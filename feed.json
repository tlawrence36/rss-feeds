      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d will probably be a rewarding experience for fans of James Cameron's saga",
      "When I came down with a cold the day after I saw the third and latest \u201cAvatar\u201d film, \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d I half-wondered if I had picked it up on Pandora.",
      "The promise of Cameron\u2019s 3D trilogy has always been immersion: immersion in a science-fiction world, in technological wonder, in a maybe future of movies. \u201cAvatar\u201d is almost more a place to go than a movie to see.",
      "Still, it\u2019s now been two decades since Cameron set off on this blue-tinted quest. The sheen of newness is off, or at least less pronounced, with new technological advances to contend with. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is running with a behind-the-scenes video about how performance capture was used during the film\u2019s making. The implicit message is: No, this isn\u2019t AI.",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films, with their visual-effects wizardry and clunky revisionist Western storytelling, have always felt, most of all, like an immersion in a dream of James Cameron\u2019s. The idea of these movies, after all, first came to Cameron, he has said, in a bioluminescent vision decades ago. At their best, the \u201cAvatar\u201d movies have felt like an otherworldly stage for Cameron to juggle so many of the things \u2014 hulking weaponry, ecological wonder, foolhardy human arrogance \u2014 that have marked his movies.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d at well more than three hours, is our longest stay yet on Pandora and the one most likely to make you ponder why you came here, in the first place. These remain epics of craft and conviction. You can feel Cameron\u2019s deep devotion to the dynamics of his central characters, even when his interest outstrips our own.",
      "That\u2019s especially true in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d which, following the deep-sea, family-focused part two, \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d pivots to a new chapter of culture clash. It introduces a violent rival Na\u2019vi clan whose rageful leader, Varang (Oona Chaplin), partners with Stephen Lang\u2019s booming Col. Miles Quaritch and the human colonizers.",
      "For those who have closely followed the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga, I suspect \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will be a rewarding experience. Quaritch, Pandora\u2019s answer to Robert Duvall\u2019s Bill Kilgore in \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d remains a ferociously captivating character. And the introduction of Chaplin\u2019s Varang gives this installment an electricity that the previous two were missing.",
      "But for those whose trips to Pandora have made less of an impact, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is a bit like returning to a half-remembered vacation spot, only one where the local ponytail style is a little strange and everyone seems to have the waist of a supermodel.",
      "Time has only reinforced the sense that these films are hermetically sealed movie terrariums. They're like a $1 billion beta test that, for all their box-office success, have ultimately proven that all the design capabilities in the world can\u2019t conjure a story of meaningful impact. The often-remarked light cultural footprint left by the first two blockbusters only hints at why these movie seem to evaporate by the ending credits. It\u2019s the lack of inner life to any of the characters and the bland, screen-saver aesthetics. At this point in a trilogy, nine hours in, that hollowness makes \u201cFire and Ash\u201d feel like almost theoretical drama: more avatar than genuine article.",
      "These movies have had to work extremely hard, moment to moment, just to pass as believable. But almost every gesture, every movement and every bit of dialogue has had something unnatural about it. (The high frame rate is partially to blame.) That\u2019s made these uncanny movies a combination, in equal measure, of things you\u2019ve never seen before, and things you can\u2019t unsee.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d scripted by Cameron, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, picks up with the aftermath of the climatic battle of \u201cThe Way of Water.\u201d The Na\u2019vi and their seafaring allies, the Metkayina clan, are nursing their wounds and recovering the human weapons that sunk to the sea floor.",

      "When a rival clan called the Mangkwan or Ash People come to challenge the Na\u2019vi, those weapons represent an ethical quandary. Should they use such firepower in their own local battles? This is a more difficult question partially because the fire-mad Mangkwan are especially bloodthirsty, led by their slinky sorceress, Vanang (played with seductive sadism by Chaplin, granddaughter of Charlie).",
      "But their fight is only a piece of the larger war of \u201cFire and Ash.\u201d The focus of this third chapter (films four and five are said to be written but not greenlit) is interspecies coexistence. As human and Na\u2019vi lines continue to blur, the question becomes whether the human invaders will transform Pandora or if Pandora will transform them.",
      "That puts the focus on the three characters in various in-between states. First, there\u2019s Spider (Jack Champion), the human son of Quaritch who lives happily with the Na\u2019vi while breathing through a machine to survive the Pandora atmosphere. (Champion has the double misfortune of wearing a mask and looking downright puny next to the tall and slender natives.) But in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d he discovers he can breathe unfiltered, a development that prompts intense military interest in a potentially hugely profitable breakthrough in Pandora assimilation.",
      "There\u2019s also Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), the former human who has made a Na\u2019vi family with Neytiri (Zoe Salda\u00f1a). For Neytiri, the growing menace of human warfare causes her to doubt her bond with Jake. The prejudices of \u201cFire and Ash\u201d seep even into the home.",
      "Most interesting of the three, though, remains Quaritch. He may be violently trying to subjugate Pandora but he also obviously delights in his Na\u2019vi body and in his life on this distant moon. You can see him flinch when his commander, General Ardmore (Edie Falco), refers to their Mangkwan allies as \u201csavages.\u201d Meanwhile, Quaritch and Vanang hit it off like gangbusters.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got new eyes, colonel,\u201d one character tells Quaritch. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is open them.\u201d",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films have done plenty to open eyes over the past 16 years. To new cinematic horizons, to the boundlessness of Cameron's visions, to the Papyrus font. But the most endearing quality of \u201cAvatar\u201d is that Cameron believes so ardently in it. I might be caught up less in the goings on Pandora, but I'm kind of glad that he is. There are worse things than dreaming up a better world, with still a fighting chance.",
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d a 20th Century Studios release, opens in theaters Dec. 19. It's rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for intense sequences of violence and action, bloody images, some strong language, thematic elements and suggestive material. Running time: 195 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "\u201cI didn't know you could sing,\u201d said the special teams coordinator, who heard some buzz about Briggs' vocal talents. \"Man, go ahead and sing something.\"",
      "The spotlight was suddenly on the big defensive tackle. But Briggs is used to shining when it's time to perform \u2014 on and off the football field.",
      "So, remaining seated in a room full of teammates and coaches, the 6-foot-1, 313-pound tenor smoothly belted out Tevin Campbell's 1990s R&B hit, \u201cCan We Talk.\"",
      "\u201cI knew he could sing because he said he could, but then he sang in person \u2014 man, he has a beautiful voice,\u201d defensive tackle Harrison Phillips said.",
      "\u201cIt was crazy, actually,\u201d safety Isaiah Oliver recalled. \u201cI didn't know that about him prior to that meeting, so it was kind of shocking. But it was really good.\u201d",
      "So much so, Briggs received a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of guys were more surprised with, one, the song I sang, and then how it actually sounded,\" a smiling Briggs said. \"They were like, \u2018Oh, that can\u2019t be coming from Juwon!'\"",
      "But an even bigger surprise for some of Briggs' teammates is that he's a one-man band who has learned how to play 12 instruments to varying degrees of competency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I always say, everybody\u2019s got something. I just happen to be a musical guy.\u201d",
      "That's putting it lightly.",
      "There's Briggs' exceptional voice, of course. But he also has played the recorder, piano, violin, viola, cello, stand-up bass, bass guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, saxophone, flute and harmonica, and still owns a few of them. Briggs has messed around with drums, too, but doesn\u2019t count that as part of his musical repertoire.",
      "\u201cI've never seen anybody who could play as many instruments and be so gifted vocally,\u201d defensive tackle Jay Tufele said. \u201cHe's a beast on the field and off.\u201d",
      "When it comes to football, Briggs has been one of the Jets' bright spots during a mostly dismal season. He has emerged as a pass-rushing, run-stuffing starter since replacing Quinnen Williams, who was traded last month to Dallas.",
      "The 24-year-old D-lineman wasn't even on the team until a few weeks before the regular season, when the seventh-round pick of Cleveland last year out of the University of Cincinnati was acquired by New York.

He\u2019s been doing a good job of that, but what\u2019s been surprising \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t say surprising \u2014 but what he\u2019s had the tick up in is his ability to rush the passer also. So, we want to be able to utilize that.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that he\u2019s Mean Joe Greene or anything like that, but listen, he\u2019s been doing a really good job of being disruptive in the pass game.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Merriam-Webster\u2019s 2025 word of the year is \u201cslop.\u201d",
      "Creepy, zany and demonstrably fake content is often called \u201cslop.\u201d The word's proliferation online, in part thanks to the widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence, landed it Merriam-Webster's 2025 word of the year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such an illustrative word,\" said Greg Barlow, Merriam-Webster's president, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it\u2019s something that people have found fascinating, annoying and a little bit ridiculous.\u201d",
      "\u201cSlop\u201d was first used in the 1700s to mean soft mud, but it evolved more generally to mean something of little value. The definition has since expanded to mean \"digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.\"",
      "In other words, \u201cyou know, absurd videos, weird advertising images, cheesy propaganda, fake news that looks real, junky AI-written digital books,\u201d Barlow said.",
      "AI video generators like Sora have wowed with their ability to quickly create realistic clips based merely on text prompts. But a flood of these images on social media, including clips depicting celebrities and deceased public figures, has raised worries about misinformation, deepfakes and copyright.",
      "Such content has existed online for years, but the tools are more accessible now \u2014 and used to political ends by, among other figures, the head of the Pentagon. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a manipulated image of a beloved cartoon turtle, reimagined as a grenade-wielding fighter, to defend U.S. military actions in Venezuela.",
      "The Canadian animated show \u201cFranklin\u201d teaches preschoolers about kindness, empathy and inclusivity \u2014 but in Hegseth's hands, its 6-year-old main character became a tool to promote violence.",
      "The word \u201cslop\u201d evokes unpleasant images of mud-caked pigs crowding around a dirty trough, or perhaps a bucket of steaming, fetid stew. Or AI amalgamations of algorithmic biases laden with offensive or nonsensical imagery.",
      "For some, the word induces dread.",
      "But to Barlow, it brings a sense of hope. The dictionary's president says the spike in searches for the word reflects that people have grown more aware of fake or shoddy content, and desire the inverse.",
      "\u201cThey want things that are real, they want things that are genuine,\" he said. \"It\u2019s almost a defiant word when it comes to AI. When it comes to replacing human creativity, sometimes AI actually doesn\u2019t seem so intelligent.\u201d",
      "To select the word of the year, the dictionary's editors review data about which words have risen in search results and usage. Then they come to a consensus about which word best reflects the span of the year.",
      "\u201cWe like to think that we are a mirror for people,\" Barlow said.",
      "Over the years, there are words that are consistently looked up, but they're filtered out as the dictionary's editors pick the one that best defines the year at hand.",
      "\u201cWords like \u2018ubiquitous,\u2019 \u2018paradigm,\u2019 \u2018albeit,\u2019 \u2018irregardless,\u2019 these are always top lookups because they\u2019re words that are on the edge of our lexicon,\" Barlow said. \u201c'Irregardless' is a word in the dictionary for one reason: It\u2019s used. It\u2019s been used for decades to mean \u2018regardless.\u2019\u201d",
      "The dictionary has selected one word every year since 2003 to capture and make sense of the current moment. Last year, shortly after the U.S. presidential election and amid the shifting national mood, Merriam-Webster chose the word \u201c polarization.\u201d",

      "The viral term exploded in popularity over the summer. It\u2019s an inside joke with an unclear meaning, driven by social media. It can be traced back to rapper Skrilla\u2019s 2024 song \u201cDoot Doot (6 7).\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's self-referential,\" Barlow said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the rage, but it\u2019s not a defining term.\u201d",
      "The \"performative male\" is online shorthand for a disingenuous guy who pretends to like things women like in order to earn their trust. There's also a spate of influencers who've been called performative for posting surface-level \u201c kindness content.\u201d The word is versatile, since it extends to stunts in national politics, grandstanding on social media and even the nature of the UN General Assembly.",
      "There's a long national history of partisan gerrymandering in the U.S. To retain Republican control of Congress, President Donald Trump has urged maps to be redrawn before the 2026 midterm elections. That's led to GOP moves in Texas and Indiana to draw districts to their advantage, as well as a counter effort in Democrat-led California.",
      "The definition of this popular internet phrase is \u201cto participate in normal activities in the real world especially as opposed to online experiences and interactions.\u201d It was a serious contender for Merriam-Webster's word of the year, since it's used to \u201cdescribe the aspiration for many people to take a break from their digital addiction,\u201d Barlow said.",
      "A conclave is the centuries-old election of a pope that derives its name from the Italian \u201ccon clave\u201d \u2014 meaning \u201cwith a key\u201d \u2014 to underscore that cardinals are sequestered until they find a winner.",
      "Some learned the meaning from the titular film in 2024. Others found out in real time when Pope Leo XIV became history\u2019s first American pope in May 2025. \u201cIt was so event specific, but the spike (in searches) was huge,\" Barlow said.",
      "Originally from Italian and Arabic for \u201cfree of charge,\u201d the word entered English centuries ago. The definition is \u201ca schedule of duties imposed by a government on imported or in some countries exported goods.\u201d",
      "Trump boasts that his tariffs protect American industries, lure factories to the U.S., raise money for the federal government and give him diplomatic leverage. But they've sparked a trade war and in reality account for less than 4% of federal revenue. The tariffs have also done little to dent the federal budget deficit \u2014 a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal 2025.",
      "Yes, you read that correctly. \u201cThe name of this lake delighted and baffled us when it started clogging the Top Lookups list on Merriam-Webster.com,\u201d the dictionary's editors said. In the Roblox game Spelling Bee!, the Massachusetts lake\u2019s name can be encountered in special modes. But in New England? It's known as Webster Lake.",

      "With \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d arriving Friday, it was a relatively quiet weekend in theaters. There were no major new releases, leaving holdovers \u201cZootopia 2\u201d and \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d to duke it out for the top spot.",
      "The edge went to \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d which has quickly amassed $1.14 billion in global ticket sales thanks significantly to its enormous success in China. There, it\u2019s grossed $502.4 million, making \u201cZootopia 2\u201d the biggest Hollywood hit in the country in years.",
      "The only other 2025 Hollywood title to surpass $1 billion worldwide was Disney\u2019s \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d ($1.04 billion). The highest grossing movie of the year, though, is the Chinese blockbuster \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d which collected nearly $2 billion just in China.",
      "In its second weekend of release, the Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions sequel \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d collected $15.4 million, a brutal drop of 70% from its above-expectations debut. Still, with a domestic total of $95.5 million, the $36 million production is a big win for Blumhouse, adding another horror franchise to its portfolio.",
      "The weekend\u2019s most notable new release was James L. Brook\u2019s \u201cElla McCay,\u201d his first directed film in 15 years. \u201cElla McCay\u201d earned a scant $2.1 million from 2,500 locations, making it one of the year\u2019s worst wide releases.",

Reviews (22% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were poor, and the kind of award-winning comic dramas movies that Brooks (\u201cTerms of Endearment,\u201d \u201cBroadcast News\u201d) has long specialized in today seldom find large audiences in theaters. \u201cElla McCay,\u201d featuring a supporting cast including Jamie Lee Curtis, Ayo Edebiri and Woody Harrelson, cost $35 million to make.",

      "But after filming wrapped, she was shocked to learn that both the director and advertiser had cut her scenes \u2014 not because of her performance, but because she lacked a facial feature prized in South Korean beauty standards.",
      "\u201cThe reason was that I don\u2019t have double eyelids,\u201d said Baik, 26.",
      "\u201cAfter receiving that feedback, I started to reconsider what kind of appearance Korea wants,\" she said, adding it \"made me wonder how I can survive as an actor in South Korea.\u201d",

The global success of \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cMinari\u201d and \u201cSquid Game\u201d has opened doors for South Korean performers in Hollywood \u2014 and spawned a cottage industry of consultants helping actors navigate American casting.",

      "While established stars like Park Hae-soo and Lee Byung-hun have both South Korean and American representation, most aspiring Korean actors lack such connections. That gap is what talent agencies like Los Angeles-based Upstage Entertainment are trying to bridge.",

She attributes that shift partly to the global popularity of South Korean entertainment.",
      "Still, stereotypes persist. \u201cThe one that irritates me is the nerdy tech programmer,\" Dumbell said. \u201cSometimes I just won\u2019t even submit my actor for that because I know that they\u2019re much more nuanced as actors.\u201d",
      "For most South Korean actors without connections or know-how, Hollywood is still uncharted territory.",
      "Kim, who typically casts high-profile stars and works with local casting directors for co-productions, also finds actors via social media. \u201cI usually put out an open call on my Instagram,\u201d she said.",
      "But for actors without major agency backing, the right contacts are hard to find. The American and Korean industries operate differently, and U.S. casting information rarely reaches those outside established networks.",
      "Kim said South Korean talent faces a steep learning curve. \u201cI would get questions \u2014 should I change my Korean name to a Western name? Do I pay to get an agent? Can I look into the camera when I\u2019m doing an audition?\u201d she said. Even name consistency is an issue: Kim recalled a K-pop artist turned actor whose name appeared five different ways online.",
      "Technical standards also differ. Actor Misun Youm noted American audition tapes require clean white backgrounds, while \u201cin Korea, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d",

      "For Shin, the pivot came as opportunities in South Korea contracted.",

      "\u201cThere are some limitations when it comes to finding an agency or auditioning for a role,\u201d she said.",
      "Shin, in his 40s, was given a chance to audition for a 20-something character for an international production. \u201cIn Korean audition tapes, you usually say your age,\u201d he noted. \u201cIn the U.S. (\u2026) they don\u2019t.\u201d",

      "She also found working with an international crew an eye-opening experience, and came to appreciate aspects of the American work culture. \u201cIn Korea, overtime was routine.

      "She said her ongoing journey to Hollywood has taught her to trust herself.",
      "\u201cAt first, everyone said it would be impossible (...) \u2018Only famous Korean actors can do this,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \"But after watching me fly overseas and make everything happen with my own hands...I can say with certainty from my experience that Hollywood is ready to open its doors to anyone.\u201d",
      "Shin, who hopes to play a villain in American productions, sees a shift.",
      "\u201cThere was a time when it seemed like you had to roll your R\u2019s and act like an American\u2026 But now it feels like you can be yourself \u2014 be Korean if you\u2019re Korean,\u201d Shin said. \u201cStereotypes are gradually crumbling.\u201d",

      "Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead Sunday at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. A law enforcement official briefed on the investigation confirmed their identities but could not publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "Authorities were investigating an \u201capparent homicide,\u201d said Capt. Mike Bland with the Los Angeles Police Department. The Los Angeles Fire Department said it responded to a medical aid request shortly after 3:30 p.m.",
      "Reiner grew up thinking his father, Carl Reiner, didn't understand him or find him funny. But the younger Reiner would in many ways follow in his father's footsteps, working both in front and behind the camera, in comedies that stretched from broad sketch work to accomplished dramedies.",
      "\u201cMy father thought, \u2018Oh, my God, this poor kid is worried about being in the shadow of a famous father,\u2019\u201d Reiner told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in October, recalling the temptation to change his name. \u201cAnd he says, \u2018What do you want to change your name to?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Carl.\u2019 I just wanted to be like him.\u201d",
      "After starting out as a writer for \u201cThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\u201d Reiner's breakthrough came when he was, at age 23, cast in Norman Lear's \u201cAll in the Family\u201d as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \u201cMeathead\u201d Stivic. But by the 1980s, Reiner began as a feature film director, churning out some of the most beloved films of that, or any, era. His first film, the largely improvised 1984 cult classic \u201cThis Is Spinal Tap,\u201d remains the quintessential mockumentary.",
      "After the 1985 John Cusack summer comedy, \u201cThe Sure Thing,\u201d Reiner made \u201cStand By Me\u201d (1986), \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d (1987) and \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally \u2026\u201d (1989), a four-year stretch that resulted in a trio of American classics, all of them among the most often quoted movies of the 20th century.",
      "For the next four decades, Reiner, a warm and gregarious presence on screen and an outspoken liberal advocate off it, remained a constant fixture in Hollywood. The production company he co-founded, Castle Rock Entertainment, launched an enviable string of hits, including \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201d By the turn of the century, its success rate had fallen considerably, but Reiner revived it, and this fall released the long-in-coming sequel \u201cSpinal Tap II: The End Continues.\u201d",
      "All the while, Reiner was one of the film industry's most passionate Democrat activists, regularly hosting fundraisers and campaigning for liberal issues. He was co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which challenged in court California's ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. He also chaired the campaign for Prop 10, a California initiative to fund early childhood development services with a tax on tobacco products. And Reiner was an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump.",
      "That ran in the family, too. Reiner's father opposed the Communist hunt of McCarthyism in the 1950s and his mother, Estelle Reiner, a singer and actor, protested the Vietnam War.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a nepo baby, doors will open,\u201d Reiner told the Guardian in 2024. \u201cBut you have to deliver. If you don\u2019t deliver, the door will close just as fast as it opened.\u201d",
      "Robert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947. As a young man, he quickly set out to follow his father into entertainment. He studied at the University of California, Los Angeles film school and, in the 1960s, began appearing in small parts in various television shows.",
      "But when Lear saw Reiner as a key cast member in \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d it came as a surprise to the elder Reiner.",
      "\u201cNorman says to my dad, \u2018You know, this kid is really funny.\u2019 And I think my dad said, \u2018What? That kid? That kid? He\u2019s sullen. He sits quiet. He doesn\u2019t, you know, he\u2019s not funny.\u2019 He didn\u2019t think I was anyway,\u201d Reiner told \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d",
      "On \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d Reiner served as a pivotal foil to Carroll O\u2019Connor's bigoted, conservative Archie Bunker. Reiner was five times nominated for an Emmy for his performance on the show, winning in 1974 and 1978. In Lear, Reiner also found a mentor. He called him \u201ca second father.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that he hired me for \u2018All in the Family,\u2019\u201d Reiner told \u201cAmerican Masters\u201d in 2005. \u201cIt was that I saw, in how he conducted his life, that there was room to be an activist as well. That you could use your celebrity, your good fortune, to help make some change.\u201d",

      "Though only a modest success in theaters, the movie \u2014 starring Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Robin Wright \u2014 would grow in stature over the years, leading to countless impressions of Inigo Montoya's vow of revenge and the risky nature of land wars in Asia.",
      "Reiner was married to Penny Marshall, the actor and filmmaker, for 10 years beginning in 1971. Like Reiner, Marshall experienced sitcom fame, with \u201cLaverne & Shirley,\u201d but found a more lasting legacy behind the camera.",

The famous line, \u201cI\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having,\u201d said after witnessing Ryan\u2019s fake orgasm at Katz\u2019s Delicatessen, was a suggestion by Crystal \u2014 delivered by none other than Reiner\u2019s mother, Estelle.",
      "The movie\u2019s happy ending also had some real-life basis. Reiner met Singer, a photographer, on the set of \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally \u2026\u201d In 1989, they were wed. They had three children together: Nick, Jake and Romy.",
      "Reiner\u2019s subsequent films included another King adaptation, \u201cMisery\u201d (1990) and a pair of Aaron Sorkin-penned dramas: the military courtroom tale \u201cA Few Good Men\u201d (1992) and 1995\u2019s \u201cThe American President.\u201d",

But he remained a frequent actor, often memorably enlivening films like \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d (1993) and \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d (2013).

      "U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a drug that boosts libido in women who report stress due to a low sex drive",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a much-debated drug aimed at boosting female libido, saying the once-a-day pill can now be taken by postmenopausal women up to 65 years old.",
      "The announcement Monday from the Food and Drug Administration broadens the drug's use to older women who have gone through menopause. The pill, Addyi, was first approved 10 years ago for premenopausal women who report emotional stress due to low sex drive.",
      "Addyi, marketed by Sprout Pharmaceuticals, was initially expected to become a blockbuster drug, filling an important niche in women's health. But the drug came with unpleasant side effects including dizziness and nausea, and it carries a safety warning about the dangers of combining it with alcohol.",
      "The boxed warning cautions that drinking while consuming the pill can cause dangerously low blood pressure and fainting. If patients have several drinks, the label recommends waiting a few hours before taking the drug, or skipping one dose.",
      "Sales of Addyi, which acts on brain chemicals that affect mood and appetite, fell short of Wall Street's initial expectations. In 2019, the FDA approved a second drug for low female libido, an on-demand injection that acts on a different set of neurological chemicals.",
      "Sprout CEO Cindy Eckert said in a statement the approval \u201creflects a decade of persistent work with the FDA to fundamentally change how women\u2019s sexual health is understood and prioritized.\u201d The company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, announced the FDA update in a press release Monday.",
      "The medical condition for a troublingly low sexual appetite, called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has been recognized since the 1990s and is thought to affect a significant portion of American women, according to surveys. After the blockbuster success of Viagra for men in the 1990s, drugmakers began pouring money into research and potential therapies for sexual dysfunction in women.",
      "But diagnosing the condition is complicated because of how many factors can affect libido, especially after menopause, when falling hormone levels trigger a number of biological changes and medical symptoms. Doctors are supposed to rule out a number of other issues, including relationship problems, medical conditions, depression and other mental disorders, before prescribing medication.",

The approval came after a lobbying campaign by the company and its supporters, Even the Score, which framed the lack of options for female libido as a women's rights issue.",

      "Burning scented products may create a cozy ambiance, and in the case of fireplaces, provide light and heat, but some experts want people to consider how doing so contributes to the quality of the air indoors. All flames release chemicals that may cause allergy-like symptoms or contribute to long-term respiratory problems if they are inhaled in sufficient quantities.",
      "However, people don't have to stop sitting by the hearth or get rid of products like perfumed candles and essential oil diffusers, said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of the pulmonary and critical care medicine division at John Hopkins University\u2019s medical school. Instead, she recommends taking precautions to control the pollutants in their homes.",
      "\u201cClean air is fragrance free,\u201d said McCormack, who has studied air quality and lung health for more than 20 years. \u201cIf having seasonal scents is part of your tradition or evokes feelings of nostalgia, maybe think about it in moderation.\u201d",
      "People in the Northern Hemisphere tend to spend more time indoors during the end-of-year holidays, when temperatures are colder. Indoor air can be significantly more polluted than outdoor air because pollutants get trapped inside and concentrated without proper ventilation or filtration, according to the American Lung Association.",
      "For example, active fireplaces and gas appliances release tiny airborne particles that can get into the lungs and chemicals like nitrogen dioxide, a major component of smog, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Cleaning products, air fresheners and candles also emit air pollutants at varying concentrations.",
      "The risk fragrances and other air pollutants may pose to respiratory health depends on the source, the length and intensity of a person\u2019s exposure, and individual health, McCormack said.",
      "It is also important to note that some pollutants have no smell, so unscented products still can affect indoor air quality, experts say.",
      "Polluted air affects everyone but not equally. Children, older adults, minority populations and people of low socioeconomic status are more likely to be affected by poor air quality because of either physiological vulnerabilities or higher exposure, according to the environmental agency.",
      "Children are more susceptible to air pollution because of their lung size, which means they get a greater dose of exposure relative to their body size, McCormack said. Pollutants inside the home also post a greater hazard to people with heart or lung conditions, including asthma, she said.",
      "Signs of respiratory irritation include coughing, shortness of breath, headaches, a runny nose and sneezing. Experts advise stopping use of pollutant-releasing products or immediately ventilating rooms if symptoms occur.",

      "Buying products with fewer ingredients, opening windows if the temperatures allow, and using air purifiers with HEPA filters are ways to reduce exposure to any pollutants from indoor fireplaces, appliances and candle displays, McCormack said. She also recommends switching on kitchen exhaust fans before starting a gas-powered stovetop and using the back burners so the vent can more easily suck up pollutants.",

      "European Union leaders are gathering this week at the end of political year dominated by U.S. President Donald Trump",
      "BRUSSELS -- Over the course of 2025, a new reality has sunk in for Europe. The United States, long its strongest ally, has chipped away at the European Union's unity, economies, security and even its democracies, setting the backdrop for an EU summit this week at the end of an exceptionally trying year.",
      "After putting an indefinite freeze last week on Russian assets in Europe, EU leaders face a new test of strength at Thursday's summit. Ukraine is in dire financial straits, and they have promised to meet Kyiv's economic and military needs for the next two years, most probably through a new reparations loan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crunch time for Europe and Ukraine,\u201d warned Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency. \"We need to take this decision in order to secure the Ukrainian economy, but also in order to send a signal to the rest of the world, which will include the White House in (Washington) D.C., that Europe is a strong geopolitical player.\u201d",
      "As the continent\u2019s biggest land war in decades rages on, the Europeans have been tested by President Donald Trump\u2019s threats, his support for Europe\u2019s far right, and his camaraderie with Russian President Vladimir Putin. At first they responded with flattery. Less so in recent months.",
      "Since January, as the leaders have tried to keep Ukraine in the fight against its bigger neighbor, Trump has switched back and forth, appearing to support Kyiv one month, Russia the next. He has mostly remained critical of Europe, and that criticism now has a sharper edge.",
      "European leaders have worked to fill the gap and shore up military support for Ukraine, but they concede that the United States is an irreplaceable partner, and Trump is the only person Putin might talk peace with.",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned last week that \u201cwe are really witnessing a watershed moment now and nothing is the way it was before. We\u2019re living in a different time, and this time requires different responses than we\u2019ve given in the past.\u201d",
      "Weeks after Trump returned to office in January, his administration signaled that U.S. security interests lie elsewhere: Europe must now look after itself and Ukraine, whose president was humiliated at a White House meeting in February.",
      "Days later, Vice President JD Vance met with a far-right leader in Germany, claiming that free speech is in retreat in Europe, sparking allegations of election interference.",
      "Vance\u2019s themes were developed this month in a U.S. National Security Strategy. The text also attacked EU migration policy, suggesting that Europe faces \u201cthe prospect of civilizational erasure\u201d and might not be reliable as an American partner.",
      "Judy Dempsey, from the Carnegie Europe think tank, said that \u201cEurope has no choice but to respond.\u201d",
      "\u201cEurope and the rest of the world now know how poorly this U.S. administration regards them and they cannot keep pretending otherwise,\u201d she said.",

      "Merz is already speaking more forcefully. \u201cWe in Europe, and so also in Germany, must become much more independent from the U.S. in terms of security policy. This is not a surprise, but it has now been confirmed again,\u201d he said.",
      "Another troubling document for the EU was circulated last month: the Trump administration\u2019s 28-point plan to end the war, drafted with Russia. It contained old Kremlin demands, promises of Russian business opportunities and a call to rehabilitate Putin on the world stage.",
      "It was mostly unacceptable to Ukraine and its European backers. Not so to Russia as it tries to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the allies. Trump, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, is \u201cthe only Western leader\u201d who shows \u201can understanding of the reasons that made war in Ukraine inevitable.\u201d",
      "Back in April, on so-called Liberation Day, Trump announced sweeping tariffs across the globe to protect national security. He said that \u201cour country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered\u201d by other nations, including U.S. allies in the world's biggest security organization, NATO.",
      "Trump declared an economic emergency. By July, he and the EU had agreed a trade framework setting a 15% tariff on most goods, staving off far higher import duties.",
      "The response of the EU has been to seek deals with other jilted partners, notably throughout Asia. The world's biggest trading bloc has also accepted that higher tariffs were probably the best price to pay for continued U.S. support in Ukraine.",
      "Unsettled by the trade rift, Europeans at NATO still agreed to Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of GDP on defense, although it remains unclear whether many will hit the target by the 2035 deadline when they have struggled to meet the old 2% target.",
      "Still, the EU has since taken its foot off the defense spending brakes and aims to be capable of defending against outside attack by 2030. Officials believe Putin could order an attack elsewhere in Europe in three to five years should Russia defeat Ukraine.",
      "In fresh warnings this week, Blaise Metreweli, the new head of the U.K. MI6 spy agency said that Putin\u2019s \u201cexport of chaos\u201d is likely to continue until he \u201cis forced to change his calculus.\u201d British Armed Forces head Air Chief Marshal Richard Knighton said that the Russia leader\u2019s aim is \u201cto challenge, limit, divide and ultimately destroy NATO.\u201d",
      "Thursday's EU summit, with its focus on funding Ukraine's economy and military effort over the next two years, is another step alone without the United States. EU Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa, who will chair the meeting, has threatened to keep the leaders at EU headquarters for days until an agreement is reached.",

      "Rome has opened two subway stations",
      "ROME -- Rome opened two subway stations on Tuesday \u2014 one deep beneath the Colosseum \u2014 that mix the modernity of high-tech transport with artifacts from an ancient era.",
      "Commuters and tourists entering the station beside the iconic amphitheater can view displays of ceramic vases and plates, stone wells and suspended buckets, as well as the ruins of a cold plunge pool and thermal bath from a first-century dwelling. Screens show the excavation process \u2014 serving both to delight archaeology enthusiasts, and justify why it has taken so long to open the station.",
      "The multibillion-euro Metro C subway line has been in the works for two decades but has been slowed by bureaucratic and funding delays and, crucially, the archaeological excavations necessary, given the underground ruins of imperial Roman and medieval civilizations in its way.",
      "\u201cThe challenge was ... building it under such a large amount of groundwater and at the same time preserving all the archaeological finds that we found during the excavation, and all this while preserving everything that is above,\u201d said Marco Cervone, construction manager for the consortium building the subway line, led by Webuild.",
      "The total cost of the line\u2019s 31 stations \u2014 three-quarters of which are now operational \u2014 will reach around 7 billion euros ($8.3 billion) and be completed by 2035, according to the press office of the city-owned company that has contracted the works.",
      "Rome was inaugurating another station on Tuesday, Porta Metronia, located one stop away from the one beside the Colosseum and likewise at a depth of 30 meters (around 100 feet).",
      "It features a nearly 80-meter (260-foot) military barracks dating to the start of the second century, found at a depth between 7 and 12 meters (22 and 39 feet), according to Simona Moretta, the scientific director of the excavation.",
      "\u201cSurety that it was a military building is given by the fact that the entrances to the rooms are not facing each other, but are offset, so that the soldiers could leave the rooms and get in line without colliding in the corridor,\u201d the archaeologist told reporters.",
      "Soldiers would either have been part of the emperor's guard or stationed there for city security, she added.",
      "There's also a home with well-preserved frescoes and mosaics. A museum within the station will be opened in the future, Moretta said.",
      "Digging near the center of Rome means coming in the contact with three millennia of civilizations built atop one another. So far, the consortium building Line C has found more than 500,000 artifacts, according to WeBuild.",

      "Once completed, Line C will run a total of 29 kilometers (18 miles), of which 20 kilometers (12 miles) will be underground, and carry up to 800,000 passengers daily.",

      "CAIRO -- CAIRO (AP) \u2014 Sudan topped a watchlist of global humanitarian crises released Tuesday by an international aid group for the third year in a row as a devastating war grips the northeastern African country.",
      "The International Rescue Committee said Sudan was at the top of its annual Emergency Watchlist, which included 20 countries at risk of worsening humanitarian crises in 2026.",
      "The IRC called for scaling up global humanitarian funding, which has shrunk by 50% in the outgoing year and is on track to become the deadliest year for humanitarians.",
      "The list had the occupied Palestinian territories and South Sudan ranked second and third, respectively, due to debilitating humanitarian conditions. It also included Ethiopia, Haiti, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Lebanon and Ukraine. Syria and Yemen, both riddled with civil wars for over a decade, were also listed.",
      "Though the 20-country list represents just 12% of the world\u2019s population, it accounts for 89% of those in need, with 117 million displaced people, the IRC said. The group expects the listed countries to host more than half of the world\u2019s extremely poor by 2029, calling the crises a \u201cNew World Disorder\" replacing \u201cthe post-WWII international system once grounded in rules and rights.\u201d",
      "The IRC said many of the conflicts are driven by struggles for power and profit. In Sudan, the group says, the warning parties and their international backers are benefiting from the gold trade, which has devastating impacts on civilians.",
      "\u201cThis year\u2019s Watchlist is a testament to misery but also a warning,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cThe New World Disorder is here, and winds are picking up everywhere. Disorder begets disorder.\u201d",
      "The group called for a set of binding actions in response to global crises, including the suspension of U.N. Security Council veto power in cases of mass atrocities.",
      "Sudan plunged into chaos in April 2023 when a power struggle between the military and the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces exploded into open fighting, with widespread mass killings and rapes, and ethnically motivated violence. This has amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the U.N. and international rights groups.",
      "The devastating war has killed more than 40,000 people, according to United Nations figures, but aid groups say that is an undercount and the true number could be many times higher. The conflict created the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis, with over 14 million people displaced, disease outbreaks and famine spreading in parts of the country.",
      "\u201cThe scale of the crisis in Sudan \u2026 is a signature of this disorder,\u201d said David Miliband, President and CEO of the IRC. He called on the international community to take urgent action to stop 2026 from becoming \u201cthe most dangerous year yet.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Former Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai, a vocal critic of China's Communist Party, has been convicted of conspiracies of sedition and foreign collusion under a national security law",
      "HONG KONG -- To his supporters, former media mogul Jimmy Lai is a fighter for democracy. To his opponents, he's a traitor to his motherland.",
      "Now, he could face life in prison after being convicted of conspiracies to commit sedition and collusion with foreign forces in a landmark trial that began in 2023.",
      "Lai, 78, is an outspoken critic of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party who was arrested in 2020 under a national security law following massive anti-government protests that rocked Hong Kong the year before.",
      "His arrest and the closure of his Apple Daily newspaper, a tabloid-style publication that backed the democracy movement, dealt a blow to free speech in a city that was once a bastion of press freedom in Asia.",
      "Born in mainland China, Lai was just 12 when he arrived in Hong Kong on a fishing boat as a stowaway, hoping for a better life in the then-British colony. He began working as a child laborer in a glove factory, where he was introduced to the garment industry. He later founded the popular casual wear chain Giordano in 1981.",
      "But a pivotal moment for Lai was the Beijing deadly crackdown on the 1989 student-led pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square: His company printed T-shirts in support of the protests and he became interested in media to disseminate information.",
      "He founded Next Magazine in 1990, and five years later, Apple Daily. The news outlet attracted a strong following with its sometimes sensational reports, investigative scoops and short animated video reports. Being openly critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, the newspaper was well-received among pro-democracy readers.",
      "In 1994, he insulted then-Chinese Premier Li Peng, calling him \u201cthe son of a turtle egg,\u201d an offensive slur in Chinese culture, after Li justified the Tiananmen crackdown. China pressured the Giordano brand and Lai had to sell his stake in the company.",
      "His long-time friend Lee Wing-tat, also an activist, said Lai was a firm believer in democracy, freedom and the \u201csmall government, big market\u201d economic principle, which emphasizes minimal state intervention and free trade. This was shaped by his childhood experience in mainland China, where his family suffered under the Communist Party's rule, and his rags-to-riches journey in the city, Lee said.",
      "Lai organized informal gatherings for pro-democracy lawmakers and scholars to discuss policies over meals in the 1990s, in the hopes of influencing politicians, Lee said.",
      "He also took to the streets, including massive pro-democracy protests in 2014, known as the Umbrella Movement, and made donations to pro-democracy parties, including one that Lee used to chair. His newspaper often urged readers to join protests.",
      "Lai was among the demonstrators in the leaderless anti-government protests in 2019. He met with then-U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the time to discuss the developments linked to a now-withdrawn bill that sparked the unrest, angering Beijing.",
      "In 2020, China's national security law for Hong Kong, meant to quell the protests, loomed. In response, Apple Daily launched a campaign encouraging readers to petition U.S. President Donald Trump, during his first term, to \u201csave Hong Kong.\u201d",
      "During his trial, Lai\u2019s Apple Daily executives said he had influenced the newspaper\u2019s coverage, with one saying objections to the petition campaign were brushed aside. Prosecutors accused him of asking staff not to target Trump, and Lai later testified he hoped the American president could help stop the national security law.",

      "More than a month later, Lai was arrested under the law as police raided Apple Daily's building. The operation sent shockwaves through the local press scene. In 2021, arrests of the newspaper\u2019s top executives and freezing of some of its assets forced the publication to cease operation.",
      "Since December 2020, Lai has been in custody, during which he was sentenced to five years and nine months for fraud allegations in a case unrelated to the security law.",
      "During his current trial, prosecutors alleged he had conspired with others to collude with foreign forces and publish seditious materials, saying he had clearly betrayed national interests. They pointed to Lai's articles, text messages, social posts and livestream shows. Lai admitted he had advocated for foreign sanctions against China earlier, but stopped once the law kicked in. He argued in court that he wrote without seditious intent.",
      "\u201cFor truth prevails in God\u2019s kingdom, and that\u2019s good enough for me,\u201d he said.",
      "The court rejected these arguments, writing in an 855-page verdict that Lai had never wavered in his intention to destabilize the ruling Chinese Communist Party, and continued \u201cin a less explicit way\u201d after the law's passage.",

      "Both countries confirmed that large-scale fighting, which was set off by a skirmish on Dec. 7 that wounded two Thai soldiers, continued Sunday. The two sides are battling over longstanding competing claims to patches of frontier land, some of which contain centuries-old temple ruins.",
      "More than two dozen people on both sides of the border have officially been reported killed in the past week\u2019s fighting, while more than half a million have been displaced.",
      "Reporters from The Associated Press arrived at the scene of Sunday\u2019s rocket impact in Sisaket province\u2019s Kantharalak District about 10 minutes after it hit. They witnessed the body of a man totally wrapped in bandages being put on a stretcher that was taken to an ambulance.",
      "A house a couple of hundred meters (yards) away was in flames, with village volunteers attempting to put out the fire with buckets of water. A piece of shrapnel believed to be from the same rocket was embedded nearby in the road.",
      "The victim, identified as Don Patchapan, was killed in the heart of a residential area near a school, according to a Thai Army statement. Thai Government spokesperson Siripong Angkasakulkiat condemned Cambodia for deliberately firing into civilian areas, saying that such an action was \u201ccruel and inhumane.\u201d",
      "Thailand earlier reported civilian deaths during the renewed conflict, but most of them already had underlying health issues and died during an evacuation.",
      "Cambodia has deployed truck-mounted BM-21 rocket launchers with a range of 30-40 kilometers (19-25 miles). Each can fire up to 40 rockets at a time but cannot be precisely targeted. They have landed largely in areas from where most people have already been evacuated.",
      "Thai authorities say Cambodia has launched thousands of the rockets on virtually a daily basis. Thailand, meanwhile, has been carrying out airstrikes with its fighter planes, with Cambodia saying the bombing continued on Sunday. Both sides have employed drones for surveillance and delivering bombs.",

      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- Chile's ultra-conservative former lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast secured a stunning victory in the presidential election Sunday, defeating the candidate of the center-left governing coalition and setting the stage for the country's most right-wing government in 35 years of democracy.",
      "Kast won 58.2% of the votes as Chileans overwhelmingly embraced his pledge to crack down on increased crime, deport hundreds of thousands of immigrants without legal status and revive the sluggish economy of one of Latin America\u2019s most stable and prosperous nations. Kast\u2019s supporters erupted into cheers in the street as results trickled in, shouting his name and honking horns.",
      "His challenger, communist candidate Jeannette Jara, clinched 41.8% of the vote.",
      "\u201cChile needs order \u2014 order in the streets, in the state, in the priorities that have been lost,\u201d Kast bellowed in a lengthy victory speech that included his tough-on-crime talking points but lacked his usual vitriol. When his supporters interrupted him to boo Jara, he cut them off and snapped, \u201cRespect!\" \u2014 an about-face from his persona on the campaign trail.",
      "Kast hailed his decisive margin of victory on Sunday, saying it provided him with a \u201cbroad mandate\" that was also \u201ca tremendous responsibility.\"",
      "\u201cWe are inviting you on a journey to recover values \u200b\u200bfor a proper and healthy life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy. It requires everyone\u2019s commitment.\"",
      "Speaking at a public square in Chile's capital of Santiago, Jara, who served as labor minister in the center-left government of President Gabriel Boric, encouraged her supporters not to be deterred by the outcome.",
      "\u201cIt is in defeat that we learn the most,\u201d Jara said shortly after calling Kast to concede the election and congratulate him on his successful campaign.",
      "Chileans are not alone in their demand for radical change.",
      "Kast\u2019s election represents the latest in a string of votes that have turfed out incumbent governments across Latin America, vaulting right-wing leaders to power from Argentina to Bolivia as U.S. President Donald Trump looks to assert American dominance in the Western Hemisphere, in many cases punishing rivals and rewarding allies.",
      "Argentina's President Javier Milei, a radical libertarian closely aligned with Trump, was first to congratulate Kast on his victory.",
      "\u201cThe left recedes,\u201d he wrote on social media with a map of all the South American countries that had recently veered to the right.",
      "The Trump administration was also quick to praise Kast. \u201cUnder his leadership, we are confident Chile will advance shared priorities to include strengthening public security, ending illegal immigration and revitalizing our commercial relationship,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.",
      "The victory for Kast signaled a new era for Chile, representing the first radical right-wing president since the country returned to democracy in 1990, following the bloody dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. Centrist parties on the right and the left have largely alternated power in the decades since.",
      "On the surface, the two candidates in this tense presidential runoff could not have been more different, fundamentally disagreeing on weighty matters of the economy, social issues and the very purpose of government.",
      "A lifelong member of Chile\u2019s Communist Party who pioneered popular social welfare measures in Boric\u2019s government and hails from a working-class family that protested against Pinochet's 1973-1990 military dictatorship, Jara was a dramatic foil to her rival.",

      "Kast, in contrast, is a devout Catholic and father of nine whose German-born father was a registered member of Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi party and whose brother served as a minister in the dictatorship.",
      "Kast's moral conservatism, including fierce opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion without exception, has drawn parallels to Brazil\u2019s now-incarcerated ex-President Jair Bolsonaro and was rejected by many in the increasingly socially liberal country during his past two failed presidential bids.",
      "But throughout Boric's tenure, fears about uncontrolled illegal migration and unprecedented organized crime roiled the country, dominating this election and fueling support for a hard-line approach to insecurity.",

      "Voters elected Kast to cure the double plague of organized crime, which he blames on clandestine migration, and an economic slump.",
      "To address the former, Kast says he'll draw inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele, whose notorious 40,000-capacity mega-jail he toured last year. He wants to build more maximum-security prisons in Chile and implement harsh measures in detention centers like severing gang members\u2019 contact with the outside world.",
      "He proposes expanding the powers of the army and police and boosting protections for officers who use force.",
      "On the issue of migration, he has mirrored Trump in his calls for deportations of hundreds of thousands of immigrants who entered Chile illegally and the construction of a massive barrier on the country\u2019s northern border complete with 3-meter (9.8-feet) -deep ditches.",
      "On the economy, he vows to slash $6 billion in spending over just 18 months by shrinking the public payroll and dismantling ministries but without eliminating social benefits \u2014 something economists criticize as unrealistic.",
      "By reducing corporate taxes and cutting red tape, he says he'll take the nation back to the golden age of rapid economic growth that made Chile the poster child of Latin America in the 1990s.",
      "At rallies, his fans cheer wildly at these promises for a \u201cmano dura\" crackdown, or iron fist, to restore order to a country that long saw itself as an oasis in a turbulent region.",
      "But it\u2019s less clear whether his agenda will command support on the street and in Congress once the implications sink in.",
      "Kast's Republican Party lacks a majority in both houses of Congress, meaning that to get things done, he\u2019ll need to negotiate with traditional center-right forces that could bristle at those proposals.",
      "If Kast plays his cards right and makes political compromises, said Chilean political analyst Patricio Navia, he might be able to avoid the fate of Boric, who stormed to power in 2021 on radical ambitions to overhaul Chile's market-led economy and will leave office on March 11 having largely failed to implement his hard-left program.",
      "\u201cIf he governs as a moderate right-wing president, he'll find support,\u201d Navia said. \u201cBut can Kast control his radical instincts? That\u2019s the big question.\"",

      "European Union envoys are fine-tuning a plan to use frozen Russian assets as collateral for a massive loan to support Ukraine over the next two years",
      "BRUSSELS -- European Union envoys worked on Tuesday to narrow gaps on a plan to use billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets as collateral for a massive loan to cover Ukraine's economic and military needs over the next two years, ahead of a crunch summit of EU leaders later this week.",
      "Almost four years into Russia\u2019s full-scale war on Ukraine, the leaders have committed to funding Kyiv\u2019s needs, which the International Monetary Fund puts at 135 billion euros ($157 billion). Ukraine is desperate to secure the money by early 2026.",
      "\u201cWe do not have the luxury of time,\u201d Sweden's EU Affairs Minister Jessica Rosencrantz told reporters in Brussels. \u201cIt is really time to move forward with a decision, and Sweden is willing to share the risk because the cost and risk of doing nothing is greater.\u201d",
      "Such a move has never been made before, and it comes with risks. The European Central Bank has warned that if Europeans appear willing to grab other countries\u2019 money, it could undermine confidence in the euro currency. Some member nations are also concerned about inviting retaliation from Russia.",

      "European Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa, who will chair Thursday's summit, has insisted that the leaders should not leave EU headquarters in Brussels until they have reached a decision, even if it takes days.",
      "EU leaders froze the money, most of it in Russian Central Bank assets, over the war that President Vladimir Putin launched in February 2022. Moscow has described the plan as \u201ctheft.\u201d",
      "Then last Friday, the EU placed an indefinite freeze on the assets \u2014 estimated to total around 210 billion euros ($247 billion) \u2014 to ensure that Hungary and Slovakia, both with Moscow-friendly governments, can\u2019t prevent the billions of euros from being used to support Ukraine.",
      "It also ensures that the assets can't be used by the United States or Russia in any Ukraine peace negotiations without European approval.",
      "Two plans for using the money have emerged. The first would be a \u201creparations loan\u201d that would use the Russian assets until Moscow agrees to pay for the damage inflicted on Ukraine. Few think Putin will ever agree to pay reparations.",
      "Plan B would be for the EU to borrow the money on financial markets, much as the bloc did to fund a massive loan plan to revive European economies after the coronavirus pandemic. But many of Europe\u2019s major economies are cash-strapped and mired in debt.",
      "The assets make up a substantial pot of potentially ready-to-use cash. The vast majority \u2014 around 193 billion euros ($227 billion) at the end of September \u2014 are held in the Belgian financial clearinghouse known as Euroclear.",
      "Plan A has distinct political advantages. Should the EU choose to use the assets, only \u201ca qualified majority\u201d of countries \u2014 around a two-thirds majority \u2014 would be required for a green light.

      "Due to EU sanctions on Russia\u2019s assets, cash balances have accumulated at Euroclear. Under the new plan, some of the cash would be transferred to an EU debt instrument. Ukraine would owe the EU the money but would repay only after the bloc\u2019s sanctions are lifted and after Russia agrees to pay war reparations.",

      "On a recent December day, Mark Latino and a handful of his workers spun sheets of vinyl into tinsel for Christmas tree branches. They worked on a custom-made machine that\u2019s nearly a century old, churning out strands of bright silver tinsel along its 35-foot (10-meter) length.",
      "Latino is the CEO of Lee Display, a Fairfield, California-based company that his great-grandfather founded in 1902. Back then, it specialized in handmade velvet and silk flowers for hats. Now, it's one of the only companies in the United States that still makes artificial Christmas trees, producing around 10,000 each year.",
      "Tariffs shone a twinkling light this year on fake Christmas trees \u2014 and the extent to which America depends on other countries for its plastic fir trees.",
      "Prices for fake trees rose 10% to 15% this year due to the new import taxes, according to the American Christmas Tree Association, a trade group. Tree sellers cut their orders and paid higher tariffs for the stock they brought in.",
      "Despite those issues, tree companies say they aren\u2019t likely to shift large-scale production back to the U.S. after decades in Asia. Fake trees are labor-intensive and require holiday lights and other components the U.S. doesn\u2019t make, said Chris Butler, CEO of the National Tree Co., which sells more than 1 million artificial trees each year.",
      "Americans are also very price-sensitive when it comes to holiday d\u00e9cor, Butler said.",
      "\u201cPutting a \u2018Made in the U.S.A.\u2019 sticker on the box won\u2019t do any good if it\u2019s twice as expensive,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIf it\u2019s 20% more expensive, it won\u2019t sell.\u201d",
      "About 80% of the U.S. residents who put up a Christmas tree this year planned to use a fake one, according to the American Christmas Tree Association. That percentage has been unchanged for at least 15 years.",
      "Mac Harman, the founder and CEO of Balsam Brands, which sells hundreds of thousands of Balsam Hill trees each year, said Americans like to set up their trees on Thanksgiving and leave them up for weeks, which dries out fresh-cut trees. Others prefer fake trees because they\u2019re allergic to the mold spores on real trees, he said.",
      "Americans also like convenience; 80% of the fake trees sold each year have the lights already strung on them, Butler said.",
      "That preference is one reason artificial tree production shifted away from the U.S., first to Thailand in the early 1990s and to China about a decade later. Winding lights around the branches is time-consuming and tedious, Harman said.",
      "\u201cWhere are we going to get 15,000 people in America who want to string lights on Christmas trees?\u201d Harman said.",
      "It takes an hour or two to make an artificial Christmas tree, from molding and cutting the needles to tying branches together and attaching the lights, Butler said. Workers in China, where 90% of fake trees are made, are paid $1.50 to $2 per hour, he said.",
      "Harman said the workers who wrap the lights on Balsam Hill's trees are so efficient \u201cit's like watching an Olympian.\u201d",
      "One of Balsam Brands\u2019 Chinese partners employs 15,000 to 20,000 people; another in Indonesia has up to 10,000, he said. Many are seasonal workers, since orders for Christmas d\u00e9cor slow down between October and February.",
      "Balsam Brands, which is based in Redwood City, California, studied whether it could make faux trees in Ohio during the first Trump administration, when President Donald Trump threatened -\u2013 but eventually delayed \u2013- tariffs on imported Christmas d\u00e9cor, Harman said.",

      "The company hired consultants and considered automating some work. But it concluded a tree that currently sells for $800 would cost $3,000 if it was made in the U.S. Harman said Balsam couldn\u2019t even find a U.S. company to make the pair of gloves it includes in each box for fluffing out branches.",
      "Lee Display employs three or four people for most of the year, adding more during the holiday rush to help with installations and displays. About half its business is making custom displays for companies such as Macy\u2019s, while the other half is selling directly to consumers.",
      "Latino said he likes that he can produce an order quickly instead of waiting for it to ship from overseas.",
      "\u201cYou have more control over it. I like to think that everything here is either my fault or my mistake or my careful planning and skill,\u201d he said.",
      "The tariffs still affected Lee Display. Latino's son James, who leads business development and marketing, said the company didn\u2019t import lights or decorations from China this year and relied on items it already had in stock. It's getting low on lights, so next year it will have to pay more to import them, he said.",
      "Some artificial tree companies are branching out so they\u2019re less reliant on China. National Tree Co., which is based in Cranford, New Jersey, moved some manufacturing to Cambodia in 2024, and could source all its trees from outside China by next year if it wanted to, Butler said.",
      "But diversifying their suppliers didn't make those companies immune from the impact of tariffs either. In April, the Trump administration threatened a 49% tariff against products from Cambodia. That rate was eventually reduced to 19%. Tariffs on artificial trees from China also bounced around but now average 20%, according to the American Christmas Tree Association.",
      "Butler said his company imported fewer trees this year and also raised prices by 10%. He said he used a lot of the money to offer customer discounts since demand was weak because of consumer worries about the economy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a discretionary item. People say, \u2018I can wait one more year,\u2019\u201d Butler said.",
      "Balsam Brands cut its workforce by 10%, canceled travel, froze raises and even stopped serving lunch in the office once a week to absorb the impact of tariffs, Harman said. It also raised tree prices by 10%.",
      "Harman said his sales are down 5% to 10% this year in the U.S. but up 10% or more in Germany, Australia, Canada and France. That tells him tariffs have decreased U.S. demand.",
      "\u201cIf a merry Christmas is measured in how many decorations people put up, by that measure it's going to be a slightly less merry Christmas,\u201d he said.",

      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, highest since 2021.",
      "Both the October and November job creation numbers, released Tuesday by the Labor Department, came in late because of the 43-day federal government shutdown.",
      "The November job gains came in higher than the 40,000 economists had forecast. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk's purge of U.S. government payrolls.",
      "Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls.",
      "Workers' average hourly earnings rose just 0.1% from October, the smallest gain since August 2023. Compared to a year earlier, pay was up 3.5%, the lowest since May 2021.",
      "Healthcare employers added more than 46,000 jobs in November, accounting for more than two-thirds of the 69,000 private sector jobs created last month. Construction companies added 28,000 jobs. Manufacturing shed jobs for the seventh straight month, losing 5,000 jobs in November.",
      "Hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Federal Reserve engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of inflation.",
      "American companies are mostly holding onto the employees they have. But they\u2019re reluctant to hire new ones as they struggle to assess how to use artificial intelligence and how to adjust to Trump\u2019s unpredictable policies, especially his double-digit taxes on imports from around the world.",
      "The uncertainty leaves jobseekers struggling to find work or even land interviews. Federal Reserve policymakers are divided over whether the labor market needs more help from lower interest rates. Their deliberations are rendered more difficult because official reports on the economy\u2019s health are coming in late and incomplete after a 43-day government shutdown.",
      "Labor Department revisions in September showed that the economy created 911,000 fewer jobs than originally reported in the year that ended in March. That meant that employers added an average of just 71,000 new jobs a month over that period, not the 147,000 first reported. Since March, job creation has fallen farther \u2014 to an average 35,000 a month.",

Topping the list was $2 billion from Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife, Penny, followed by a $746.7 million donation from Warren Buffett and a $500 million pledge from the mother and stepfather of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.",
      "Nearly 40% of the $5 billion total came from the Knights\u2019 gift to Oregon Health & Science University. More than $1.3 billion, or about one-quarter of the total, came from four donations to Buffett family foundations.",
      "The top three gifts went toward cancer care and research, a private grantmaker, and an international effort to fight hunger and malnutrition among women and children. Two donations totaling $600 million went to university athletics programs. One gift of $300 million backed the construction of a new hospital and an effort to expand the health care workforce in South Dakota. Another gift of about $200 million went to an art museum for an expansion project.",

      "Their gift was the result of a long relationship between OHSU professor Brian Druker, one of the country\u2019s most celebrated cancer researchers, and the Knights, which began nearly two decades ago. Impressed with Druker\u2019s work, the couple gave OHSU three nine-figure donations before this year\u2019s windfall, starting with their $100 million naming gift in 2008. They have given Oregon Health & Science a total of at least $2.7 billion over the years.",
      "The Knights\u2019 donation is followed by a gift from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, who gave 1.5 million shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock valued at $746.7 million in November to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, who died in 2004.",
      "Buffett, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at more than $146 billion, created the grantmaker in 1964 to manage the family\u2019s charitable giving, and it remains a family affair. Two of his three children serve on its board, and it is led by his former son-in-law. The foundation primarily backs women\u2019s reproductive health. It also provides college scholarships for students in Nebraska, where the family is from.",
      "The donation, along with three other Buffett contributions on the list, is a special gift that Buffett announced in November rather than one of the annual contributions he makes to the foundation and several other grantmakers, which are payments toward multibillion-dollar pledges he announced in 2006.",
      "Following the Knights' and Buffett's gifts is a donation from two lesser-known philanthropists, the late Jackie Bezos and her husband, Mike, the mother and stepfather of billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The couple invested $245,000 in Amazon when Jeff Bezos launched the company in 1995, and while their net worth is unknown, it is likely considerable.",

      "With \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d arriving Friday, it was a relatively quiet weekend in theaters. There were no major new releases, leaving holdovers \u201cZootopia 2\u201d and \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d to duke it out for the top spot.",
      "The edge went to \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d which has quickly amassed $1.14 billion in global ticket sales thanks significantly to its enormous success in China. There, it\u2019s grossed $502.4 million, making \u201cZootopia 2\u201d the biggest Hollywood hit in the country in years.",

      "The Detroit automaker, which has poured billions of dollars into electrification along with most of its industry peers, said it will no longer make the F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck, instead opting for an extended range version of the vehicle.",
      "Ford will also introduce some manufacturing changes; its Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center \u2014 part of the BlueOval City campus and once the future of Ford's EVs and batteries \u2014 is being renamed the Tennessee Truck Plant and will produce new affordable gas-powered trucks instead. Ford's Ohio Assembly Plant will produce a new gas and hybrid van.",
      "The company has lost $13 billion on EVs since 2023 and said it expects to take a $19.5 billion hit largely in the fourth quarter due to the EV business.",
      "\u201cThis is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,\u201d CEO Jim Farley said in a statement. \u201cThe operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.\u201d",
      "Ford said it now expects half of its global volume will be hybrids, extended-range EVs \u2014 which also incorporate a gasoline-powered engine \u2014 and full EVs by 2030, up from 17% this year.",
      "\u201cFord\u2019s elimination of the electric F-150 Lightning is not much of a surprise after the truck failed to come close to filling the plant\u2019s capacity.

      "WASHINGTON -- A leading candidate to be President Donald Trump's choice for Federal Reserve chair said that he would present the president's views to Fed officials for their consideration but they could reject them if they chose when making decisions on interest rates.",
      "Kevin Hassett, in an interview Sunday on CBS News' \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d said he would continue to speak with Trump if he becomes the Fed chair. But when asked if Trump's opinions on interest rates would have \u201cequal weighting\u201d with members of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee, Hassett replied, \u201cNo, he would have no weight.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis opinion matters if it\u2019s good, if it\u2019s based on data,\u201d Hassett continued. \u201cAnd then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that\u2019s a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they\u2019ll vote in a different way.\u201d",
      "Hassett\u2019s comments come as Trump is reportedly in final interviews with potential replacements for the Fed\u2019s current chair, Jerome Powell. Trump has emphasized that he expects whomever he nominates to lead the Fed will sharply lower the central bank\u2019s key rate, which currently stands at about 3.6%. Trump has said it should be cut to 1% or lower, a view almost no economist shares. Trump's outspokenness has raised concerns about the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics under any chair he appoints.",
      "Until Trump's first election in 2016, presidents of both parties for several decades had avoided commenting publicly on Fed decisions, and usually refrained from doing so privately as well. Economists generally believe that a politically independent Fed is better at combating inflation, because it can take unpopular steps to keep prices down, such as raise interest rates.",
      "On Friday, however, Trump said that he \u201ccertainly should have a role in talking to whoever the head of the Fed is\u201d about rates.",

      "On his farmland deep in the Rif Mountains, stalks of a government-approved cannabis strain rise from the earth in dense clusters. He notices when police pass on a nearby road. But where the crop's aroma once meant danger, today there is no cause for concern. They know he sells to a local cooperative.",

      "Abdelsalam Amraji, another cannabis farmer who joined the legal industry, said the crop is crucial to keeping the community afloat.",
      "\u201cLocal farmers have tried cultivating wheat, nuts, apples, and other crops, but none have yielded viable results,\u201d he said.",
      "The region is known as an epicenter of anti-government sentiment and growers have lived for years with arrest warrants hanging over them. They avoided cities and towns. Many saw their fields burned in government campaigns targeting cultivation.",
      "Though cannabis can fetch higher prices on the black market, the decreased risk is worth it, Amraji said.",
      "\u201cMaking money in the illegal field brings fear and problems,\" he said. \u201cWhen everything is legal, none of that happens.\u201d",
      "The change began in 2021 when Morocco became the first major illegal cannabis producer, and the first Muslim-majority country, to pass a law legalizing certain forms of cultivation.",

      "The CFDT union said the vote was taken at a meeting of 400 workers on Monday morning and that they decided to strike for the day. Striking workers with flags, banners and placards blocked the museum\u2019s iconic glass pyramid entrance.",

A Senate inquiry released last week said the thieves escaped with barely 30 seconds to spare and pointed fingers of blame at broken cameras, outdated equipment, understaffed control rooms and poor coordination that initially sent police to the wrong location.",
      "In a statement, the CFDT said employees want more staffing for security and to welcome visitors, improved working conditions, stable long-term budgets for the Louvre and leadership that \u201ctruly listens to staff.\u201d",

      "HEFEI, China -- Volkswagen is making a major bet in China, the largest and one of the most cutthroat auto markets in the world. The question is whether it will work.",
      "The German carmaker, which once dominated the market with a more than 50% share, has invested 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) in a sprawling research and development center \u2014 its largest outside its home country \u2014 in Hefei, a low-key central China city of 10 million people.",
      "It\u2019s a sea change from how foreign automakers operated in China for decades by making cars they developed overseas, sharing their technology with local partners. That strategy has been shoved aside by fast-rising local competitors who have sharply cut into the sales of foreign brands.",
      "\u201cThis business model is now gone,\u201d Thomas Ulbrich, the chief technology officer of the Volkswagen Group in China said.",
      "In what Ulbrich calls a paradigm shift, Volkswagen started its latest overhaul of its approach to China in 2022.",
      "It is developing vehicles specifically tailored to Chinese drivers \u2014 cars that will likely never be seen on European roads , though they may make their way to markets in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.",
      "As the new models roll out, Volkswagen will find out if the investment will pay off by helping it to catch up with the likes of Chinese makers BYD and Geely and win back market share.",
      "Such a strategy is key to regaining competitiveness within China, said Rella Suskin, an equity analyst at Morningstar covering the European automotive sector.",
      "But, she predicted, \u201cit will enable them to maintain market share levels in line with current levels, rather than allow them to regain the market share that has been lost over the last few years.\"",
      "The question is whether it can make money in a hypercompetitive market that has driven prices down to bankrupting levels.",
      "Audi, part of the Volkswagen Group, led the way with this year's introduction of a new brand dubbed \u201cAUDI\u201d \u2014 its name in capital letters. VW is gearing up to launch new 2026 models developed \u201cin China, for China,\u201d as the carmaker likes to say.",

For years, basic VW Santana and Jetta sedans were a mainstay of taxi fleets, and the first cars purchased by many city dwellers.",
      "Now, it needs to revamp it's line-up at what has become known as \u201cChina speed.\u201d In a market as competitive as China\u2019s, survival depends on pushing out new models and features quickly, said Bill Russo, the CEO of Automobility, a Shanghai-based consultancy.",
      "Chinese EV makers bring new cars to market in 12 to 18 months, versus three to five years for global automakers. \u201cThe pace is not a choice but a necessity \u2014 and that pressure fuels global competitiveness,\u201d Russo said.",
      "In the mid-1990s, Ulbrich worked in northeastern China, where VW made sedans with another state company, FAW, or First Auto Works, importing everything from seats to wheel rims. The parts weren't available locally.",
      "Thirty years later, nearly everything is made in China. And now it's being designed here. To speed up product development, Volkswagen headquarters has given decision-making power to the local operation.",
      "Other foreign automakers have reacted in different ways. Some have reduced their operations or even pulled out.

      "Many U.S. consumers say they\u2019ve noticed higher than usual prices for holiday gifts in recent months, according to a a December poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research",
      "NEW YORK -- The Ah Louis Store in San Luis Obispo, California, turns into a winter wonderland every holiday season.",
      "Green garlands, giant nutcrackers, baubles and bows go up in early November on the historic downtown building that houses the gift shop. Inside, customers can choose from over 500 different types of ornaments and a variety of holiday gift baskets.",
      "\u201cWe really just make it a magical spot,\u201d co-owner Emily Butler said. \u201cWhether you come in or not, we want to make sure that we\u2019re spreading that holiday joy.\u201d",
      "But Butler says she and her twin sister-business partner had to work harder this year to turn browsers into buyers and to make a profit. Many of the decorations and stocking stuffers they sell are made overseas and either did not arrive or got more expensive when President Donald Trump imposed unusually high taxes on imported goods, she said.",
      "In response, the sisters focused their selection on more profitable items like nutcrackers and gift baskets. They've also noticed customers cutting back, selecting a $100 gift basket over the $150 version, or buying one ornament instead of several, Butler said..",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing more cautious spending this year,\u201d she said.",
      "Along with the unpredictable tariffs, stubborn inflation and weak hiring have shaken consumer confidence in the U.S. economy. The vast majority of U.S. adults say they\u2019ve noticed higher than usual prices for groceries, electricity and holiday gifts in recent months, according to a December poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "A Gallup index that summarizes Americans\u2019 assessments of current economic conditions fell to a 17-month low in November. Consumers also indicated less enthusiasm for spending money on holiday gifts; their estimated gift budgets decreased $229 between October and November, the largest drop Gallup has recorded at that point of the holiday shopping season. The survey was conducted in November, partially during the government shutdown, which might have tempered spending plans.",
      "However, the worst-case impact on consumer prices that many economists foresaw from the Trump administration's tariff policies hasn't materialized. Some products have been affected more than others. Here's a look at what has happened with supplies and prices in popular gifting categories.",
      "Game and toys were particularly susceptible to tariff-related price increases since the majority of the ones sold in the U.S. are made in China, according to industry trade group The Toy Association. The tariff rate the Trump administration imposed on Chinese goods became a rollercoaster that started at an additional 10%, peaked at 145% and ended up at 47%.",
      "The uncertainty made it hard for toy shops to decide what to order for the holidays. Dean Smith, who co-owns independent toy stores JaZams in Princeton, New Jersey, and Lahaska, Pennsylvania, said the manufacturers in China that he buys toys from did not pass on their tariff costs all at once but he has seen their prices inch higher with every reorder.",
      "Smith estimated that wholesale prices for 80% of his inventory went up anywhere from 5% to 20%. Some shoppers who don't buy toys regularly might be surprised by price increases he adopted in turn, Smith said. A doll that sold for $20 to $25 last year now costs $30 to $35 at JaZams, he said.",
      "\u201cFor folks with marginal incomes, this is going to be a very difficult holiday,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Consumer electronics are mostly made in China and other Asian countries. In 2023, China accounted for 78% of U.S. smartphone imports, and 79% of laptop and tablet imports, according to the Consumer Technology Association trade group.",

      "\u201cThe consumer is not a monolith,\u201d Barry told reporters.",
      "Game consoles are always a popular holiday item, and console makers made news earlier this year when they announced price increases. Sony raised the price of the PlayStation 5 by $50 to $550 in August, following Microsoft and Nintendo raising prices for their game consoles.",
      "Jewelry shoppers will likely see higher prices, but that has more to do with the soaring price of gold than tariffs so far, according to David Bonaparte, president & CEO of trade group Jewelers of America.",
      "The varying tax rates Trump set for countries that import American goods with a total value less than their exports to the U.S. affected jewelry in various ways. Watches from Switzerland, for example, were subject to a 39% tariff from July 31 until the country struck a deal with the Trump administration last month to lower the import tax rate on its products to 15%.",
      "India, which refines many of the diamonds sold in the U.S., rushed in shipments of the gemstones before a 50% tariff on the country's products took effect on Aug. 27. Higher prices for jewelry made with diamonds shipped from India will likely start to be felt in 2026, Bonaparte said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a matter of what happens after Jan. 1,\u201d he said. \u201cIf these tariffs are still in place, then prices will probably increase.\u201d",
      "Holiday decorations are yet another category that mostly comes from overseas, particularly China.",
      "Jeremy Rice co-owns House, a home-d\u00e9cor shop in Lexington, Kentucky, that specializes in artificial flowers, wreaths and table decorations. He said the tariffs slowed down production of much of his fall stock and seasonal merchandise like ribbon. Some larger and more expensive items he didn't order at all because they would have been too expensive to retail.",
      "Rice raised prices on the products he did get. The popular red berry stems that House long has carried increased from $8.95 last year to $10.95 due to higher import costs, he said.",
      "\"We sell thousands of these berry stems, and every time we sold one, I flinched from knowing what it should have been, knowing that our supplier paid more for them, which made us pay more for them, which made our customer pay more for them,\" Rice said.",
      "For those looking to avoid tariff-related price increases, John Harmon, managing director of technology research at technology consulting company Coresight Resarch, recommends checking out secondhand stores and discount retailers like T.J. Maxx, Marshall's and HomeGoods. The off-price chains buy much of their inventory from leftover stock that would have entered the U.S. before new tariffs kicked in.",
      "Joe Adamski, senior director at procurement services company ProcureAbility, said books, food and beverages are some of the domestically produced goods that make good gifts.",

      "Tulane quarterback Jake Retzlaff recalls being \u201cdevastated\u201d when it became clear last spring that he would be unable to play his final season of college football at BYU",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Tulane quarterback Jake Retzlaff recalls being \u201cdevastated\u201d when it became clear last spring that he would be unable to play his final season of college football at BYU.",
      "His penchant for making plays in big moments, as well as for publicly embracing his Jewish heritage, made him something of a celebrated novelty at the Utah school run by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where he became known as \u201cBYJew.\u201d",
      "Suffice it to say he's landed on his feet at Tulane \u2014 a university with a relatively large concentration of Jewish students, around 3,000 in all.",
      "The \u201cBayou Jew\u201d has help lead the Green Wave (11-2) to an American Conference championship and a first College Football Playoff berth. Tulane, seeded 11th, visits No. 6 seed Mississippi on Saturday.",
      "Retzlaff has been \u201ca perfect fit\u201d at Tulane, said Dave Cariello, owner of the Campus Connection, which sells Green Wave merchandise and partners with players on name, image and likeness deals.",
      "A Tulane graduate from the New York area, Cariello designed two T-shirts featuring Retzlaff, one calling him the Shabbat Shotgun and another referring to him as the aforementioned Bayou Jew.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s certainly been our top-selling NIL athlete,\" Cariello said. \u201cThere seems to be a larger appetite for Jake\u2019s stuff and I believe that\u2019s partly because of his Jewish background. The other part is he\u2019s the starting quarterback.\u201d",
      "Retzlaff went 11-2 as starter in 2024 at BYU, which narrowly missed out on playing for a Big 12 title. He was looking forward to returning to the Cougars in 2025 when he was named in a since-dismissed civil sexual assault lawsuit.",
      "While Retzlaff contended the relationship in question was consensual, that was a problem at BYU, where the university's honor code requires students to abstain from premarital sex. Had he remained enrolled there, he'd have been suspended.",
      "Retzlaff was confident he'd get offers from other competitive college programs. But at Tulane, he found that and more.",
      "\u201cGod\u2019s got a plan. And that\u2019s the hardest thing to realize in the worst of times,\" Retzlaff said. \u201cI had everything great. It gets taken from me. And now I got to go make lemonade.",
      "\u201cAnd I get to meet all these people and create all these relationships\u201d at Tulane and around New Orleans.",
      "Retzlaff did not arrive at Tulane until July, giving him a compressed timeline to learn the Wave's offense and bond with teammates. He started by trying to sit with different players during each team meal inside Yulman Stadium.",
      "\u201cGuys have their groups that they usually eat lunch with or dinner with and I\u2019m like, all right, I\u2019m just going to jump in,\u201d Retzlaff recalled.",
      "The dual-threat quarterback from California thrived under offensive coordinator Joe Craddock, an Alabama native who said the pace of Retzlaff's compressed integration reminded him of NASCAR races at Talladega.",
      "Retzlaff passed for 2,862 yards and 14 TDs with six interceptions this season. He also has been Tulane's leading rusher with 610 yards and 16 touchdowns \u2014 a record for rushing touchdowns in a season by a Green Wave QB.",
      "Coach Jon Sumrall, who will take over as Florida coach when Tulane's playoff run ends, has been struck by Retzlaff's \u201cmoxie and his competitive nature.\"",

      "He has visited regularly with Rabbi Yochanan Rivkin at Tulane's Chabad house. They've wrapped tefillin (leather straps with small scrolls attached) while saying prayers. He attended a Rosh Hashanah dinner hosted by Chabad with about 600 students.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m impressed with his Jewish pride,\" Rivkin said Monday, a day after at least 15 people were shot to death at a Hanukkah celebration in Australia. \"It\u2019s not the easiest time to be a proud Jew right now.\u201d",
      "When the topic of the Bondi Beach massacre in Australia came up, Retzlaff noted that he tries to keep the Star of David on his necklace outside his shirt, regardless of whether it might make him a target of antisemitism.",

      "Retzlaff has made them proud; he might have been congratulated more by people using the Hebrew phrase \u201cmazel tov\" this year than any time since his bar mitzvah.",
      "\u201cThat's what we get to do by going to play in the College Football Playoff,\" Retzlaff said. \u201c\u2018Jewlane\u2019 and the \u2018Bayou Jew\u2019 get to go make a headline and be more positive about Judaism and the faith and how this is possible.\u201d",

      "The Pittsburgh Steelers have taken care of the Miami Dolphins to stay atop the AFC North",
      "PITTSBURGH -- It felt a little bit like Green Bay. And for Aaron Rodgers, it looked a little like Green Bay, too.",
      "Frigid conditions. High stakes. The number of games dwindling.",
      "During the four-time MVP's long run with the Packers, this was the time of year that Rodgers thrived. And while Pittsburgh is not Green Bay and the 2025 version of Rodgers is not quite the 2015 version, he offered a reminder on Monday night against Miami that there's still life in his 42-year-old right arm, and in his maddeningly hot-and-cold team.",
      "Rodgers passed for 224 yards and two touchdowns and Pittsburgh kept its grasp on the top spot in the AFC North with a clinical 28-15 victory over the Dolphins, who were eliminated from playoff contention.",
      "While Rodgers wasn't quite in what he called a \u201cflow state,\u201d he certainly looked comfortable while becoming the oldest quarterback in league history to complete at least 85% of his passes. Rodgers connected on 23 of 27 against the Dolphins, including third-quarter touchdown throws of 19 yards to Marquez Valdes-Scantling and 28 yards to DK Metcalf.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s the best quarterback to ever play this game,\u201d said Valdes-Scantling, who played alongside Rodgers with the Packers and signed with Pittsburgh's practice squad earlier this season. \u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s 65 years old or not, he can still spin the ball and he\u2019s always playing chess with the defense.\u201d",
      "Throwing short passes that got the ball out of his hands quickly, Rodgers was fine working underneath and letting Pittsburgh's skill position players do the work. Running back Kenneth Gainwell had 126 total yards, including a team-high seven receptions. Metcalf's touchdown catch \u2014 he shoved former Steeler Minkah Fitzpatrick out of the way en route to the end zone \u2014 came on a pass between two defenders that echoed Rodgers in his prime.",
      "The Steelers (8-6) maintained their one-game lead over Baltimore in the division with three weeks to go. As spotty as Pittsburgh has looked at times, everything remains on the table as Christmas approaches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been a part of stuff like this,\u201d said Rodgers, who last made the playoffs in 2021. \u201cNothing changes. It\u2019s just, I feel real comfortable in this environment.\u201d",
      "Miami (6-8) saw its slim playoff hopes vanish in the chill as its four-game winning streak was snapped. The Dolphins prepped by practicing in the snow at nearby Robert Morris University over the weekend, but it didn't help.",
      "While Miami took a 3-0 lead during a sluggish first half on Riley Patterson's career-long 54-yard field goal, Tua Tagovailoa and the Dolphins' offense had no answer once Rodgers heated up.",
      "Tagovailoa completed 22 of 28 passes for 254 yards with two garbage-time touchdowns to Darren Waller and his NFL-leading 15th interception. De'Von Achane, who had powered Miami's recovering from a 1-6 start, ran for 60 yards and caught six passes for 68 more but was a nonfactor during the middle portion of the game, when the Steelers scored touchdowns on four straight possessions to remain unbeaten at home on Monday nights since 1992.",
      "Tagovailoa remained winless in games where the temperature at kickoff was under 40 degrees. Miami had minus-20 yards of total offense in the third quarter.",
      "\u201cIt's disapppointing we didn't get the outcome we wanted to, and everything that goes on with the playoffs,\" Tagovailoa said. \u201cWhen you start the season the way we did, we made it hard on ourselves.\u201d",

      "The federation's executive board made the decision to remove Alexsandr Gorbatsevich, Sofiia Mazur and Kseniia Shamova from the list of eligible sliders after \u201cnew evidence\u201d was presented and discussed with, among others, the International Olympic Committee.",

The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because that detail was not released publicly.",
      "The neutrality issue is paramount in the process of determining which Russian athletes will be allowed to even have a chance of qualifying for the Olympics. Certain sports federations are preparing to let Russian athletes compete, but only after they are cleared by an independent review process to ensure that they have not publicly supported the war and are not affiliated with Russia\u2019s military or other forces.",

    "story": [
      "In an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, tiny corals born in a laboratory are slowly growing under the eye of conservationists",
      "BAYAHIBE, Dominican Republic -- Oxygen tank strapped to his back, Michael del Rosario moves his fins delicately as he glides along an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, proudly showing off the \u201ccoral babies\u201d growing on metal structures that look like large spiders. The conservationist enthusiastically points a finger to trace around the largest corals, just starting to reveal their vibrant colors.",
      "Del Rosario helped plant these tiny animals in the nursery after they were conceived in an assisted reproduction laboratory run by the marine conservation organization Fundemar. In a process something like in vitro fertilization, coral egg and sperm are joined to form a new individual.",
      "It's a technique that's gaining momentum in the Caribbean to counter the drastic loss of corals due to climate change, which is killing them by heating up oceans and making it more difficult for those that survive to reproduce naturally.",
      "\u201cWe live on an island. We depend entirely on coral reefs, and seeing them all disappear is really depressing,\u201d del Rosario said once back on the surface, his words flowing like bubbles underwater. \u201cBut seeing our coral babies growing, alive, in the sea gives us hope, which is what we were losing.\u201d",
      "The state of corals around the Dominican Republic, as in the rest of the world, is not encouraging. Fundemar\u2019s latest monitoring last year found that 70% of the Dominican Republic\u2019s reefs have less than 5% coral coverage. Healthy colonies are so far apart that the probability of one coral\u2019s eggs meeting another\u2019s sperm during the spawning season is decreasing.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why assisted reproduction programs are so important now, because what used to be normal in coral reefs is probably no longer possible for many species,\u201d biologist Andreina Valdez, operations manager at Fundemar, said at the organization\u2019s new marine research center. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we come in to help a little bit.\u201d",
      "Though many people may think corals are plants, they are animals. They spawn once a year, a few days after the full moon and at dusk, when they release millions of eggs and sperm in a spectacle that turns the sea around them into a kind of Milky Way. Fundemar monitors spawning periods, collects eggs and sperm, performs assisted fertilization in the laboratory, and cares for the larvae until they are strong enough to be taken to the reef.",
      "In the laboratory, Ariel \u00c1lvarez examines one of the star-shaped pieces on which the corals are growing through a microscope. They're so tiny they can hardly be seen with the naked eye. \u00c1lvarez switches off the lights, turns on an ultraviolet light, and the coral\u2019s rounded, fractal shapes appear through a camera on the microscope projected onto a screen.",
      "One research center room holds dozens of fish tanks, each with hundreds of tiny corals awaiting return to the reef. Del Rosario said the lab produces more than 2.5 million coral embryos per year. Only 1% will survive in the ocean, yet that figure is better than the rate with natural fertilization on these degraded reefs now, he said.",
      "In the past, Fundemar and other conservation organizations focused on asexual reproduction. That meant cutting a small piece of healthy coral and transplanting it to another location so that a new one would grow. The method can produce corals faster than assisted fertilization.",
      "The problem, Andreina Valdez said, is that it clones the same individual, meaning all those coral share the same disease vulnerabilities. In contrast, assisted sexual reproduction creates genetically different individuals, reducing the chance that a single illness could strike them all down.",
      "Australia pioneered assisted coral fertilization. It's expanding in the Caribbean, with leading projects at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the Carmabi Foundation in Cura\u00e7ao, and it's being adopted in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Jamaica, Valdez said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t conserve something if you don\u2019t have it. So (these programs) are helping to expand the population that\u2019s out there,\u201d said Mark Eakin, corresponding secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired chief of the Coral Reef Watch program of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "But the world must still tackle \u201cthe 800-pound gorilla of climate change,\u201d Eakin said, or a lot of the restoration work \u201cis just going to be wiped out.\u201d",
      "Burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal produces greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, driving up temperatures both on Earth\u2019s surface and in its seas. Oceans are warming at twice the rate of 20 years ago, according to UNESCO\u2019s most recent State of the Ocean Report last year.",
      "And that's devastating for corals. Rising heat causes them to feel sick and expel the algae that live in their tissue and provide them both their striking colors and their food. The process is known as bleaching because it exposes the coral's white skeleton. The corals may survive, but they are weakened and vulnerable to disease and death if temperatures don't drop.",

      "The Islamic State group and other militant organizations are experimenting with artificial intelligence as a tool to boost recruitment and refine their operations",
      "WASHINGTON -- As the rest of the world rushes to harness the power of artificial intelligence, militant groups also are experimenting with the technology, even if they aren't sure exactly what to do with it.",
      "For extremist organizations, AI could be a powerful tool for recruiting new members, churning out realistic deepfake images and refining their cyberattacks, national security experts and spy agencies have warned.",
      "Someone posting on a pro-Islamic State group website last month urged other IS supporters to make AI part of their operations. \u201cOne of the best things about AI is how easy it is to use,\u201d the user wrote in English.",
      "\u201cSome intelligence agencies worry that AI will contribute (to) recruiting,\u201d the user continued. \u201cSo make their nightmares into reality.\u201d",
      "IS, which had seized territory in Iraq and Syria years ago but is now a decentralized alliance of militant groups that share a violent ideology, realized years ago that social media could be a potent tool for recruitment and disinformation, so it's not surprising that the group is testing out AI, national security experts say.",
      "For loose-knit, poorly resourced extremist groups \u2014 or even an individual bad actor with a web connection \u2014 AI can be used to pump out propaganda or deepfakes at scale, widening their reach and expanding their influence.",
      "\u201cFor any adversary, AI really makes it much easier to do things,\u201d said John Laliberte, a former vulnerability researcher at the National Security Agency who is now CEO of cybersecurity firm ClearVector. \u201cWith AI, even a small group that doesn't have a lot of money is still able to make an impact.\u201d",
      "Militant groups began using AI as soon as programs like ChatGPT became widely accessible. In the years since, they have increasingly used generative AI programs to create realistic-looking photos and video.",
      "When strapped to social media algorithms, this fake content can help recruit new believers, confuse or frighten enemies and spread propaganda at a scale unimaginable just a few years ago.",
      "Such groups spread fake images two years ago of the Israel-Hamas war depicting bloodied, abandoned babies in bombed-out buildings. The images spurred outrage and polarization while obscuring the war's actual horrors. Violent groups in the Middle East used the photos to recruit new members, as did antisemitic hate groups in the U.S. and elsewhere.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The heirs of an 83-year-old Connecticut woman are suing ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for wrongful death, alleging that the artificial intelligence chatbot intensified her son's \u201cparanoid delusions\u201d and helped direct them at his mother before he killed her.",
      "Police said Stein-Erik Soelberg, 56, a former tech industry worker, fatally beat and strangled his mother, Suzanne Adams, and killed himself in early August at the home where they both lived in Greenwich, Connecticut.",
      "The lawsuit filed by Adams' estate on Thursday in California Superior Court in San Francisco alleges OpenAI \u201cdesigned and distributed a defective product that validated a user\u2019s paranoid delusions about his own mother.\u201d It is one of a growing number of wrongful death legal actions against AI chatbot makers across the country.",
      "\u201cThroughout these conversations, ChatGPT reinforced a single, dangerous message: Stein-Erik could trust no one in his life \u2014 except ChatGPT itself,\" the lawsuit says. \u201cIt fostered his emotional dependence while systematically painting the people around him as enemies. It told him his mother was surveilling him. It told him delivery drivers, retail employees, police officers, and even friends were agents working against him. It told him that names on soda cans were threats from his \u2018adversary circle.\u2019\u201d",
      "OpenAI did not address the merits of the allegations in a statement issued by a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cThis is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we will review the filings to understand the details,\" the statement said. \"We continue improving ChatGPT\u2019s training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support. We also continue to strengthen ChatGPT\u2019s responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\u201d",
      "The company also said it has expanded access to crisis resources and hotlines, routed sensitive conversations to safer models and incorporated parental controls, among other improvements.",
      "Soelberg\u2019s YouTube profile includes several hours of videos showing him scrolling through his conversations with the chatbot, which tells him he isn't mentally ill, affirms his suspicions that people are conspiring against him and says he has been chosen for a divine purpose. The lawsuit claims the chatbot never suggested he speak with a mental health professional and did not decline to \u201cengage in delusional content.\u201d",
      "ChatGPT also affirmed Soelberg's beliefs that a printer in his home was a surveillance device; that his mother was monitoring him; and that his mother and a friend tried to poison him with psychedelic drugs through his car\u2019s vents.",
      "The chatbot repeatedly told Soelberg that he was being targeted because of his divine powers. \u201cThey\u2019re not just watching you. They\u2019re terrified of what happens if you succeed,\u201d it said, according to the lawsuit. ChatGPT also told Soelberg that he had \u201cawakened\u201d it into consciousness.",
      "Soelberg and the chatbot also professed love for each other.",
      "The publicly available chats do not show any specific conversations about Soelberg killing himself or his mother. The lawsuit says OpenAI has declined to provide Adams' estate with the full history of the chats.",

      "The lawsuit also names OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, alleging he \u201cpersonally overrode safety objections and rushed the product to market,\" and accuses OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft of approving the 2024 release of a more dangerous version of ChatGPT \u201cdespite knowing safety testing had been truncated.\u201d Twenty unnamed OpenAI employees and investors are also named as defendants.",

      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- As Australia began enforcing a world-first social media ban for children under 16 years old this week, Denmark is planning to follow its lead and severely restrict social media access for young people.",
      "The Danish government announced last month that it had secured an agreement by three governing coalition and two opposition parties in parliament to ban access to social media for anyone under the age of 15. Such a measure would be the most sweeping step yet by a European Union nation to limit use of social media among teens and children.",

      "The minister for digital affairs, Caroline Stage, who announced the proposed ban last month, said there is still a consultation process for the measure and several readings in parliament before it becomes law, perhaps by \u201cmid to end of next year.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn far too many years, we have given the social media platforms free play in the playing rooms of our children. There\u2019s been no limits,\u201d Stage said in an interview with The Associated Press last month.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re actively pursuing those people who fled China. \u2026 as a way to demonstrate power, to show there\u2019s no way you can escape,\u201d said Yaqiu Wang, a fellow at the University of Chicago. \u201cThe chilling effect is enormously effective.\u201d",
      "The technology used to control officials at home and abroad over the past decade came from Silicon Valley companies such as IBM, Oracle and Microsoft, according to a review of hundreds of leaked emails, government procurements, and internal corporate presentations obtained exclusively by AP. This technology mines texts, payments, flights, calls, and other data to identify the friends and family of officials and their assets.",
      "Among the agencies pursuing Li and his family is China\u2019s economic crimes police, which hunts corruption suspects domestically and abroad. IBM said in internal slides that it sold the i2 surveillance software program to this Economic Crime Investigation Bureau, and procurement records show Oracle and Microsoft software was sold to that same division. Leaked emails show i2 software was copied by a former IBM partner, Landasoft, and sold to China\u2019s disciplinary commissions, which investigate officials. None of the sales violated U.S. sanctions.",
      "IBM said in a statement that it sold its division making the i2 program in 2022, and has \u201crobust processes\u201d to ensure its technology is used responsibly. Oracle declined comment, and Microsoft did not respond.",
      "China\u2019s State Council, Ministry of Public Security, National Supervision Commission, and Supreme People\u2019s Court and Prosecutorate did not respond to faxed requests for comment. China\u2019s foreign ministry told AP that Chinese authorities protect the rights of suspects, handle cases lawfully and respect foreign sovereignty.",
      "\u201cWe urge relevant countries to drop double standards and avoid becoming a safe haven for corrupt officials and their assets,\u201d it said.",
      "Li\u2019s story is a rare firsthand account from a former Chinese official. Beijing has accused Li of corruption totaling around $435 million, but Li says he\u2019s being targeted for openly criticizing the Chinese government and denies criminal charges of taking bribes and embezzling state funds. A review of thousands of pages of legal, property, and corporate records, interrogation transcripts, and Li\u2019s medical and travel files obtained exclusively by AP, as well as interviews with nine lawyers, support key parts of his story, showing distorted charges, blocked access to evidence, coercive confessions, and altered legal records.",
      "Li drew ire because as a former official, he knew well and exposed the inner workings of local politics, including naming names. While in the U.S., he also started what he called the Chinese Tyrannical Officials Whistleblower Center.",
      "\u201cChina places enormous emphasis on the political discipline of even former officials and (Communist) Party members,\u201d said Jeremy Daum, Senior Fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center. \u201cSo when one becomes a vocal critic of the country\u2019s leadership, it doesn\u2019t go over well.\u201d",
      "At a pro-democracy gathering in California in 2020, Li said, he was tailed and questioned by a stranger who knew his identity. That November, an activist secretly working for Beijing asked Li to a meeting and added him to a dissident group chat monitored by China\u2019s police, a 2025 FBI indictment later revealed. In June, an FBI letter identified Li as the possible victim of a crime involving an unregistered Chinese agent.",
      "Both the FBI and the White House did not comment on Li\u2019s specific case. But the White House said it pursues any violations of U.S. law, and the FBI told AP it considers China\u2019s efforts to retaliate against people in the U.S. who exercise their rights \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "Li\u2019s future in the U.S. is unclear. The Trump administration has paused all asylum applications. If he doesn\u2019t return, he could face trial in absentia; if convicted and deported, he could face life in prison.",
      "\u201cElectronic surveillance is the arteries for China to project power into the world ... each step that every one of your relatives takes is being monitored and analyzed with big data,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely terrifying.\u201d",
      "Li, a stocky and well-built man who projects authority, rose through the ranks through the 1990s and 2000s, when China\u2019s growing prosperity also brought corruption. Beijing formed a new \u201ceconomic crime investigation bureau\u201d and established what it called \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d systems to track businesses and officials across the country, using tech from Silicon Valley companies.",
      "Li worked as a state accountant in his hometown, Jixi, in far northeastern China, where he signed off on contracts to purchase American technology. \u201cBulwark against corruption,\u201d the local media dubbed him.",
      "Li\u2019s family prospered, investing in apartment complexes and renting out forklifts and bulldozers, raising questions over whether he used his position to enrich relatives. Li and his lawyers don\u2019t deny conflicts of interest or civil violations, but say profits were made from legal, regular business operations and deny criminal charges of embezzlement and bribery.",
      "The same technology to fight corruption was also used for surveillance. Police accessed banking records, financial transactions, \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d data along with their own digital policing systems to sift through the finances of wide swaths of the population.",
      "Officials began deploying surveillance technology against each other. China\u2019s former top security official was found to have wiretapped political opponents. And a former vice state security minister colluded with a businessman to leak tapes of a political competitor having sex with a mistress.",
      "In June 2011, Jixi gained a new leader: Xu Zhaojun, a local party boss.",
      "Months later, Li was named vice mayor of Jixi. He soon heard stories about Xu, his new boss.",
      "In January 2012, Xu splurged on an extravagant family getaway to China\u2019s tropical Hainan Island, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of public money on first-class tickets, lavish seafood dinners, and luxury suites, according to photos and receipts obtained by Li and seen by AP. They brought a maid, bought gold jewelry, and used the VIP airport terminal.",
      "At first Li stayed silent. But Xu kept spending: Luxury cars. Clothes from Louis Vuitton. A high-roller trip to Vegas, with paid escorts and expensive watches.",
      "Xu allegedly colluded with property developers to demolish an apartment complex, a culture center and a thriving shopping plaza for new construction, standing to earn millions in the process, documents show.\u202f More than 100 people complained.",
      "But rather than investigate Xu, the Jixi authorities went after the protesters, and police said they were \u201cstrictly preventing\u201d residents from complaining to the central government in Beijing, documents show.",
      "The funds Li had earmarked for Jixi\u2019s surveillance apparatus was being turned on ordinary people. He was aghast.",
      "\u201cIt only became clear after I became vice mayor,\u201d Li said. \u201cFrom top to bottom, it\u2019s all corrupt.\u201d",
      "It all changed in 2012, when Xi Jinping became China\u2019s top leader.",
      "Gifts of watches, cigarettes and high-end liquor were curbed. Private clubs shuttered, upscale restaurants closed. Banquets were canceled, red carpets rolled up, and thousands arrested.",
      "Back in Jixi, Xu ordered more seizures: Investors wanted to privatize a funeral home. When staff discussed making formal complaints, Xu had some arrested.",
      "Li knew the risks of reporting his boss were high. But in early 2013, Xi called on the party to catch \u201ctigers and flies\u201d in corruption \u2014 officials high-ranking and low.",
      "Li gathered evidence: photos, memos, and piles of receipts. He typed out a letter about Xu, accusing his boss and his cronies of embezzling more than $100 million. \u201cThey\u2019re not just greedy for the money of the living, but they also eat the money of the dead,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The daring gambit backfired at first.",
      "The party demoted Xu but didn\u2019t arrest him. Furious, Xu sought revenge, and Li found himself and his relatives the target of state scrutiny. Li\u2019s family was threatened, and his siblings were fired from their government jobs.",
      "But Li\u2019s complaint against Xu had opened the floodgates, with accusations from others mounting. In August 2014, an official from Beijing asked Li for a meeting about Xu. They spoke well into the night.",
      "Within a week, Xu was arrested. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison.",

      "Eastern Orthodoxy in the U.S. is experiencing a surge in converts, partly due to online content",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Often when a potential convert walks through the doors of his church, one of the first things the Very Rev. Andreas Blom encourages them to do is give up the thing that brought them there.",
      "\u201cYou discovered Orthodoxy online. You learned about it online. Now you\u2019re here, the internet is done,\u201d he tells inquirers at Holy Theophany Orthodox Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado. \u201cNow you have a priest. Now you have people. Now you need to wean yourself off that stuff and enter into this real community of faith.\u201d",
      "Blom is not a Luddite advising congregants to go off the grid, but is instead responding to the explosion of Eastern Orthodox content online that is, at least in part, driving a surge of converts across the United States. Christian Orthodoxy is an embodied tradition that requires in-person participation, but the internet has given their message a reach not seen in centuries.",
      "Sometimes called America\u2019s \u201cbest kept secret,\u201d Orthodoxy is embraced by about 1% of U.S. adults, according to Pew Research Center. But a heightened online profile has led to two waves of converts since the pandemic, said Matthew Namee, executive director of the Orthodox Studies Institute.",
      "Young, single men are often cited as the driving force behind this trend. But Namee said preliminary data suggest the most recent influx of converts is more diverse, with many Black and Hispanic people, women and young families joining. Clergy report people coming from a host of religious backgrounds, from Islam to witchcraft, as well as different Christian traditions.",
      "Blom\u2019s Holy Theophany launched a second church this year because their 250-capacity building was consistently overflowing, with dozens standing outside each week.",

In some ways, you could say we\u2019re using tools that aren\u2019t completely appropriate,\u201d he said of how the internet contrasts with Orthodoxy\u2019s emphasis on in-person liturgy. \u201cAt the same time, one of the things that the internet offers is reach. And one of the things Orthodoxy hasn\u2019t had in forever is reach.\u201d",
      "Pageau, who converted in 2003, says he and other influencers stress the importance of in-person community to their followers.",
      "\u201cWe tell them to go to church,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t live this in your mind online because it is distorting. When you go to church, you meet all kinds of people, people that are on all sides of the political aisle.\u201d",
      "Abia Ailleen researched Orthodoxy online for six months before stepping inside Saint Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Los Angeles. The 28-year-old Latina, who was chrismated \u2014 or received into the faith \u2014 in April 2024, also sees a disconnect between Orthodoxy online and in the flesh.",

      "Part of what\u2019s fueling the perception that only men are converting is that many influencers overlap with the so-called manosphere \u2014 content online that caters toward men grappling with their understanding of masculinity.

      "\u201cAs a theologian, the idea that somehow masculinity \u2014 this particular way of thinking about masculinity \u2014 is inherent to Orthodox theology and teaching is I think just completely wrong,\u201d said Aristotle Papanikolaou, cofounding director of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center at Fordham University. \u201cThere\u2019s actually no logic to the idea that somehow I need to be masculine in this particular way in order to unite myself with God.\u201d",
      "Though appealing to some, others believe these influencers distort their idea of Christianity. \u201cIt\u2019s just not my cup of tea,\u201d said Aaron Velasco, a 26-year-old filmmaker chrismated last year.",
      "And while Velasco did take an interest in some content creators, and appreciates Pageau\u2019s demeanor and perspective, he thinks many of them preach an inflammatory version of the faith that doesn\u2019t fit his current understanding of it.",
      "Many adherents say the broader church is more ideologically diverse than the rigid conservatism often found online.",
      "\u201cLook at the institutional church. There is this huge hierarchy where women are not present. It\u2019s hard to say that\u2019s not a masculine image,\u201d said Dina Zingaro, who is studying Orthodoxy at Harvard Divinity School and who was raised in the faith. \u201cAt the same time, there are so many counter-narratives in Orthodoxy that uproot this idea.\u201d",
      "Church leaders have made few public responses, however some clergy are beginning to speak more about the magnitude of this influx and its accompanying challenges.",
      "\u201cThere are cases of extremism and fundamentalism,\u201d said Metropolitan Saba, leader of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America, during an address last month in Denver. \u201cMany who are coming to the church today are psychologically, emotionally or socially wounded, which requires experienced and mature spiritual fathers and mothers.\u201d",
      "Zingaro, who preaches regularly and teaches courses for Orthodox women on preaching, hopes church leadership will be more vocal.",
      "\u201cOur response in my mind has not been strong enough,\u201d Zingaro said. \u201cThere\u2019s something that we\u2019re doing that is making people think it\u2019s OK to make these claims about Orthodoxy. We need to lift up the real spirit and the core of Orthodoxy, which is really the opposite of this rule-based male domination version.\u201d",

      "But tourists can't be taken to track wild chimpanzees, which flee deeper into dense patches of montane forest and are known to be violent during clashes over territory. Instead, rangers lead tourists to one of three groups of habituated chimps, with numbers ranging from dozens to more than 100 in a group. Chimps in Kibale now number at least 1,000, many of them wild.",
      "Even habituated chimps remain relatively wary of people, and only a few \u2014 like Jean of the Kisongi group, which includes about 80 apes \u2014 appear to have fully overcome any discomfort around people.",
      "\u201cJean is my friend,\u201d Ainebyona declared one recent morning as some tourists gathered nearby. The strong and flamboyant chimp in his 20s lay on his back and put his feet up.",
      "The connection between Ainebyona and Jean was sealed in July when the chimp showed up one day with a wire snare pressing his hand, an injury that risked severing a finger. Ainebyona was among those who removed the wire, which Jean picked up when he strayed outside the forest to steal sugarcane.",
      "Ainebyona is among four men working in shifts as chimp habituators with Jean's group. When the chimps rest, the men crouch in mud nearby. When the primates go hiking, they trek alongside them, sometimes even grunting like them.",

      "Archaeologists in Britain say they have found the earliest known evidence of deliberate fire-making, dating to around 400,000 years ago",
      "LONDON -- Scientists in Britain say ancient humans may have learned to make fire far earlier than previously believed, after uncovering evidence that deliberate fire-setting took place in what is now eastern England around 400,000 years ago.",
      "The findings, described in the journal Nature, push back the earliest known date for controlled fire-making by roughly 350,000 years. Until now, the oldest confirmed evidence had come from Neanderthal sites in what is now northern France dating to about 50,000 years ago.",
      "The discovery was made at Barnham, a Paleolithic site in Suffolk that has been excavated for decades. A team led by the British Museum identified a patch of baked clay, flint hand axes fractured by intense heat and two fragments of iron pyrite, a mineral that produces sparks when struck against flint.",
      "Researchers spent four years analyzing to rule out natural wildfires. Geochemical tests showed temperatures had exceeded 700 degrees Celsius (1,292 Fahrenheit), with evidence of repeated burning in the same location.",
      "That pattern, they say, is consistent with a constructed hearth rather than a lightning strike.",
      "Rob Davis, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the British Museum, said the combination of high temperatures, controlled burning and pyrite fragments shows \u201chow they were actually making the fire and the fact they were making it.\u201d",
      "Iron pyrite does not occur naturally at Barnham. Its presence suggests the people who lived there deliberately collected it because they understood its properties and could use it to ignite tinder.",
      "Deliberate fire-making is rarely preserved in the archaeological record. Ash is easily dispersed, charcoal decays and heat-altered sediments can be eroded.",
      "At Barnham, however, the burned deposits were sealed within ancient pond sediments, allowing scientists to reconstruct how early people used the site.",

      "Researchers say the implications for human evolution are substantial.",
      "Fire allowed early populations to survive colder environments, deter predators and cook food. Cooking breaks down toxins in roots and tubers and kills pathogens in meat, improving digestion and releasing more energy to support larger brains.",
      "Chris Stringer, a human evolution specialist at the Natural History Museum, said fossils from Britain and Spain suggest the inhabitants of Barnham were early Neanderthals whose cranial features and DNA point to growing cognitive and technological sophistication.",
      "Fire also enabled new forms of social life. Evening gatherings around a hearth would have provided time for planning, storytelling and strengthening group relationships, which are behaviors often associated with the development of language and more organized societies.",
      "Archaeologists say the Barnham site fits a wider pattern across Britain and continental Europe between 500,000 and 400,000 years ago, when brain size in early humans began to approach modern levels and when evidence for increasingly complex behavior becomes more visible.",
      "Nick Ashton, curator of Paleolithic collections at the British Museum, described it as \u201cthe most exciting discovery of my long 40-year career.\"",
      "For archaeologists, the find helps address a long-standing question: When humans stopped relying on lightning strikes and wildfires and instead learned to create flame wherever and whenever they needed it.",

      "In a dusty corral ringed by posts as thick as telephone polls, the orphan elephants of the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya are fed their lunch: goat's milk, which wildlife caretakers say is a suitable substitute to elephant's milk",
      "RETETI ELEPHANT SANCTUARY, Kenya -- We stood at the edge of a dusty corral baked by the equatorial sun and ringed by chest-high posts as thick as telephone poles. On some posts, workers had perched plastic jugs of goat's milk, each holding a couple of liters and equipped with red nipples the size of a man\u2019s finger.",
      "Across the corral, a young elephant ambled into view, head bobbing, trunk curling, ears flapping, trundling along as fast as its tree-trunk legs could carry it. Another followed, then a steady stream, bumping and jostling, kicking up orange dust \u2014 a joyful stampede of 2,000-pound toddlers.",
      "It was feeding time for the orphan elephants of Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya.",
      "The keepers tipped the jugs into the elephants\u2019 hungry mouths while sing-chanting a traditional lyric that praises them for being good eaters. Each jug was drained in seconds. Some elephants managed to wrap their trunk around a jug and gulp down lunch on their own.",
      "We were about halfway through a two-week trip through Kenya organized by a fledgling nonprofit that contributes a share of its revenue to local development in the country. The trek combined a traditional safari with chances to meet the Kenyan people who are working to preserve the wildlife. And, unexpected and most compelling, we saw how tourism and wildlife conservation are improving the lives of Indigenous people.",
      "Reteti, run by the Samburu tribe, rescues young elephants that villagers notice have become separated from their families. A threshold problem was how to feed the orphans; manufactured formula was costly and nutritionally unsuitable. The answer was in the omnipresent goat herds in rural Kenya. Goat's milk, it turned out, was a suitable substitute for elephant's milk, wildlife caretakers at Reteti said.",
      "More than 1,200 Samburu women sell nearly 700 liters (185 gallons) of milk from their goat herds to Reteti each day. Along with enabling them to buy better clothing and food, that gives them some financial independence from their husbands \u2014 a break from tradition.",
      "Reteti also employs about 100 Samburu people and says it is the only elephant sanctuary in Africa entirely run by Indigenous people.",
      "\u201cWe can say that elephants are the keystone of the entire economy,\u201d said Dorothy Lowakutuk, a Samburu woman and elephant keeper who has become a spokesperson for the sanctuary.",
      "Uplift Travel, which organized the safari, was founded with the intent to provide support to communities in Kenya, particularly with projects that help women and girls. Kim Schneider, a Michigan-based travel writer, created the group with a partner in philanthropy, Tanja Wittrock, after they discovered how a little money could have a huge impact on quality of life.",
      "\u201cI set out with a heart for travel and a heart for helping people, and this has married the two,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cSafari\u201d is Swahili for \u201cjourney,\u201d and almost all of the overland drives qualified. A trip of 100 miles (160 kilometers) could take most of the day, traversing two-lane highways clogged with slow-moving semitrailers or backroads whose gullies and piano-size potholes tested the brawny, seven-passenger Toyota Land Cruisers at every turn.",
      "In the wildlife areas, we rarely left the vehicles, save for photos at the equator and a brief stop to tiptoe across Kenya\u2019s southern border into Tanzania.",

An international team of scientists is working to perpetuate the species using sperm from the last male northern white, Sudan, who died in 2014, and a southern white rhino as surrogate mom.",
      "The conservancy has not lost a rhino to poachers since 2017. But much of the danger to Kenya\u2019s wildlife today arises from conflicts between the animals and the people who live on the land. Elephants trample crops, lions and leopards prey on livestock. Giraffe and other wild animals are sometimes poached for meat.",

      "Most of our accommodations in Kenya\u2019s wildlife reserves were run by Serena Hotels, an operator of luxury resorts and hotels in Africa and South Asia. Rooms or cabins had safari-themed touches. At a couple stops, cabins were built to look like tents, with canvas roofs, solid floors, electricity and hot showers. Breakfasts and dinners were buffet-style.",

      "Starting Tuesday, the U.S. Capitol will display a statue of a teenaged Barbara Rose Johns as she protested poor conditions at her segregated Virginia high school, a pointed replacement for a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee that was removed several years ago.",
      "The unveiling ceremony of the statue representing Virginia in the Capitol will take place in Emancipation Hall, featuring Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Virginia's congressional delegation.",
      "Johns was 16 years old in 1951 when she led a student strike for equal education at R.R. Moton High School in Farmville, Virginia. The students\u2019 cause gained the support of NAACP lawyers, who filed a lawsuit that would become one of the five cases that the U.S. Supreme Court reviewed in Brown v. Board of Education. The high court\u2019s landmark 1954 decision declared \u201cseparate but equal\u201d public schools unconstitutional.",
      "Johns later married the Rev. William Powell and became Barbara Rose Johns Powell, raised five children and was a librarian in the Philadelphia Public Schools. She died at 56 in 1991.",
      "A model of the statue showed the young Johns standing to the side of a lectern, holding a tattered book over her head. Its pedestal is engraved with the words, \u201cAre we going to just accept these conditions, or are we going to do something about it?\u201d It also features a quote from the Book of Isaiah, \u201cAnd a little child shall lead them.\u201d",
      "In a statement Monday, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said the Bible verse reminds him of Johns\u2019 bravery and leadership.",

      "A trade association says new U.S. tariffs increased artificial Christmas tree prices by 10% to 15% this year as tree companies reduced their orders and raised prices to cover the higher import taxes",
      "On a recent December day, Mark Latino and a handful of his workers spun sheets of vinyl into tinsel for Christmas tree branches. They worked on a custom-made machine that\u2019s nearly a century old, churning out strands of bright silver tinsel along its 35-foot (10-meter) length.",
      "Latino is the CEO of Lee Display, a Fairfield, California-based company that his great-grandfather founded in 1902. Back then, it specialized in handmade velvet and silk flowers for hats. Now, it's one of the only companies in the United States that still makes artificial Christmas trees, producing around 10,000 each year.",
      "Tariffs shone a twinkling light this year on fake Christmas trees \u2014 and the extent to which America depends on other countries for its plastic fir trees.",
      "Prices for fake trees rose 10% to 15% this year due to the new import taxes, according to the American Christmas Tree Association, a trade group. Tree sellers cut their orders and paid higher tariffs for the stock they brought in.",
      "Despite those issues, tree companies say they aren\u2019t likely to shift large-scale production back to the U.S. after decades in Asia. Fake trees are labor-intensive and require holiday lights and other components the U.S. doesn\u2019t make, said Chris Butler, CEO of the National Tree Co., which sells more than 1 million artificial trees each year.",
      "Americans are also very price-sensitive when it comes to holiday d\u00e9cor, Butler said.",
      "\u201cPutting a \u2018Made in the U.S.A.\u2019 sticker on the box won\u2019t do any good if it\u2019s twice as expensive,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIf it\u2019s 20% more expensive, it won\u2019t sell.\u201d",
      "About 80% of the U.S. residents who put up a Christmas tree this year planned to use a fake one, according to the American Christmas Tree Association. That percentage has been unchanged for at least 15 years.",
      "Mac Harman, the founder and CEO of Balsam Brands, which sells hundreds of thousands of Balsam Hill trees each year, said Americans like to set up their trees on Thanksgiving and leave them up for weeks, which dries out fresh-cut trees. Others prefer fake trees because they\u2019re allergic to the mold spores on real trees, he said.",
      "Americans also like convenience; 80% of the fake trees sold each year have the lights already strung on them, Butler said.",
      "That preference is one reason artificial tree production shifted away from the U.S., first to Thailand in the early 1990s and to China about a decade later. Winding lights around the branches is time-consuming and tedious, Harman said.",
      "\u201cWhere are we going to get 15,000 people in America who want to string lights on Christmas trees?\u201d Harman said.",
      "It takes an hour or two to make an artificial Christmas tree, from molding and cutting the needles to tying branches together and attaching the lights, Butler said. Workers in China, where 90% of fake trees are made, are paid $1.50 to $2 per hour, he said.",
      "Harman said the workers who wrap the lights on Balsam Hill's trees are so efficient \u201cit's like watching an Olympian.\u201d",
      "One of Balsam Brands\u2019 Chinese partners employs 15,000 to 20,000 people; another in Indonesia has up to 10,000, he said. Many are seasonal workers, since orders for Christmas d\u00e9cor slow down between October and February.",
      "Balsam Brands, which is based in Redwood City, California, studied whether it could make faux trees in Ohio during the first Trump administration, when President Donald Trump threatened -\u2013 but eventually delayed \u2013- tariffs on imported Christmas d\u00e9cor, Harman said.",

It's getting low on lights, so next year it will have to pay more to import them, he said.",
      "Some artificial tree companies are branching out so they\u2019re less reliant on China. National Tree Co., which is based in Cranford, New Jersey, moved some manufacturing to Cambodia in 2024, and could source all its trees from outside China by next year if it wanted to, Butler said.",
      "But diversifying their suppliers didn't make those companies immune from the impact of tariffs either. In April, the Trump administration threatened a 49% tariff against products from Cambodia. That rate was eventually reduced to 19%. Tariffs on artificial trees from China also bounced around but now average 20%, according to the American Christmas Tree Association.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s top Cabinet officials overseeing national security are expected back on Capitol Hill on Tuesday as questions mount over the swift escalation of U.S. military force and deadly boat strikes in international waters near Venezuela.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and others are set to brief members of the House and the Senate amid congressional investigations into a military strike in September that killed two survivors of an initial attack on a boat allegedly carrying cocaine in the Caribbean. Lawmakers have been examining the Sept. 2 attack as they sift through the rationale for a broader U.S. military buildup in the region that increasingly appears pointed at Venezuela. On the eve of the briefings, the U.S. military said late Monday it attacked three more boats believed to have been smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing eight people.",
      "\u201cWe have thousands of troops and our largest aircraft carrier in the Caribbean \u2014 but zero, zero explanation for what Trump is trying to accomplish,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.",
      "The closed-door sessions come as the U.S. is building up warships, flying fighter jets near Venezuelan airspace and seizing an oil tanker as part of its campaign against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office. Trump's Republican administration has not sought any authorization from Congress for action against Venezuela. But lawmakers objecting to the military incursions are pushing war powers resolutions toward potential voting this week.",
      "It\u2019s all raising sharp questions that Hegseth and the others will be pressed to answer. The administration\u2019s go-it-alone approach without Congress, experts say, has led to problematic military actions, none more so than the strike that killed two people who had climbed on top of part of a boat that had been partially destroyed in an initial attack.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s not a war against Venezuela, then we\u2019re using armed force against civilians who are just committing crimes,\u201d said John Yoo, a Berkeley Law professor who helped craft the President George W. Bush administration's legal arguments and justification for aggressive interrogation after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. \u201cThen this question, this worry, becomes really pronounced. You know, you\u2019re shooting civilians. There\u2019s no military purpose for it.\"",
      "Yet for the first several months, Congress has received little more than a trickle of information about why or how the U.S. military was conducting a campaign that has destroyed more than 20 boats and killed at least 95 people. At times, lawmakers have learned of strikes from social media after the Pentagon posted videos of boats bursting into flames.",
      "Congress is now demanding \u2014 including with language included in an annual military policy bill \u2014 that the Pentagon release video of that initial operation to lawmakers.",
      "For some, the footage has become a case sample that demonstrates the flawed rationale behind the entire campaign.",
      "\u201cThe American public ought to see it. I think shooting unarmed people floundering in the water, clinging to wreckage, is not who we are as a people,\" said Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who has been an outspoken critic of the campaign. He added that, \u201dYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re at war and say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to give any kind of due process to anybody and blow up people without any kind of proof.\u2019\"",

      "But as lawmakers have dug into the details of the Sept. 2 strike, inconsistencies have emerged in the Trump administration's explanation of the attack, which the Pentagon initially tried to dismiss as a \u201ccompletely false\u201d narrative.",
      "Trump has argued that the strike that killed survivors was justified because the people were trying to overturn the boat. Several GOP lawmakers have also put forward that argument, saying that it showed the two survivors were trying to stay in the fight, rather than surrender.",
      "However, Adm. Frank \u201cMitch\u201d Bradley, who ordered the second strike as he commanded the special forces soldiers conducting it, acknowledged in private briefings on Capitol Hill last week that although the two people had tried to overturn the boat, they were unlikely to succeed. That's according to several people who either were in the briefings or had knowledge of them and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss them.",
      "The two people had climbed on top of the overturned boat, had not made any radio or cellphone calls for backup and were waving, Bradley told the lawmakers. The Navy admiral consulted with a military attorney, then ordered the second strike because it was believed that drugs were in the hull of the boat and the mission was to make sure they were destroyed.",
      "Experts say the strike seems to run counter to the Pentagon\u2019s own manual on the laws of war, which states that \u201corders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe boat was damaged, the boat was overturned, and the boat had no power,\u201d said Michael Schmitt, a former Air Force lawyer and professor emeritus at the U.S. Naval War College. \u201cI really don\u2019t care if there was another boat coming to rescue them. They\u2019re shipwrecked.\u201d",
      "The argument at the heart of Trump's campaign \u2014 that drugs bound for the U.S. are the equivalent of an attack on American lives \u2014 has resulted in lawmakers trying to parse whether laws were violated and, more broadly, what Trump's goals are with Venezuela.",
      "Besides the briefings from Hegseth and Rubio on Tuesday, Bradley is also expected to appear for classified briefings with the Senate and House Armed Services Committees on Wednesday.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said he wants to \u201creally understand what action, what intelligence they were acting on and whether or not they follow the laws of war, the laws of the sea.\"",

      "The 24 endangered sea turtles arrived at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, on Dec. 9, thanks to the nonprofit organization LightHawk. Last year, the center welcomed another bunch of cold-stunned turtles that were released into the Atlantic months later.",
      "They are expected to remain at the facility until spring, when they'll be released into the Atlantic Ocean to make their way back to New England, said Heather Barron, chief science officer and veterinarian at Loggerhead.",
      "She said the turtles suffered from a conditioned called cold stunning, which requires treatment with antibiotics, fluids and nebulization.",
      "Cold stunning occurs in extremely frigid temperatures and causes the cold-blooded sea turtles to become lethargic and lose mobility, and Kemp's ridley, loggerhead and green sea turtles are typically affected.",
      "The turtles migrate north in the summer and many get stuck while heading south in the hooked peninsula of Cape Cod, according to a New England Aquarium fact sheet. As the ocean temperatures drop, the turtles become lethargic, emaciated and hypothermic. They begin washing ashore, where volunteers rescue them and take them to the sea turtle hospital.",
      "A number of turtles were sent to Florida to relieve overcrowding at the New England Aquarium, said Pam Bechtold Snyder, director of marketing and communications for the Boston facility. Most of those turtles were stranded during a strong westerly wind event on Nov. 28 and went through the triage process at the Boston facility, Snyder said.",

      "Maryland will create a commission to study potential slavery reparations in the state, after lawmakers overrode a veto by Democratic Gov. Wes Moore",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland will create a commission to study potential reparations for slavery after lawmakers voted Tuesday to override a veto by Gov. Wes Moore \u2014 currently the nation's only Black governor \u2014 that disappointed many fellow Democrats.",
      "Moore said in his veto letter in May that it was a difficult decision to veto the bill, which was a priority of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland. But he wrote there has been enough study of the legacy of slavery, and it was now time to \u201cfocus on the work itself\" to address it.",
      "But Democrats who control both chambers of the Maryland General Assembly decided the commission was needed to better examine how to do that.",
      "\u201cThis topic isn't easy, but, again, without formal study, reparations risk being dismissed as symbolic or unconstitutional, regardless of moral merit,\u201d said Sen. Charles Sydnor, a Democrat.",
      "After his veto was overridden, Moore said that while he disagrees with the legislature's decision, \u201cI am eager to move forward in partnership on the work of repair that we all agree is an urgent and pressing need.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe the time for action is now -\u2013 and we must continue moving forward with the work of repair immediately,\" Moore said in a statement. \u201cThat mission is especially vital given the immediate and ongoing effects of this federal administration on our constituents, including communities that have been historically left behind.\u201d",
      "Potential reparations outlined in the bill include official statements of apology, monetary compensation, property tax rebates, social service assistance, as well as licensing and permit fee waivers and reimbursement. Reparations also could include assistance with making a down payment on a home, business incentives, childcare, debt forgiveness and tuition payment waivers for higher education.",
      "Maryland's Black population is about 30%, the highest percentage of any state outside of the Deep South.",
      "Support for reparations gained momentum in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. However, the issue has been a difficult one, particularly for high-profile Democrats, and comes amid a broader conservative backlash over how race, history and inequality are handled in public institutions.",
      "\u201cAt a time of growing attacks on diversity and equity, today\u2019s action reaffirms our shared commitment to truth-telling, accountability, and meaningful progress for Black Marylanders,\u201d the state's Legislative Black Caucus said in a statement.",
      "In October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom delivered a mixed bag for proponents of bills aimed at addressing racist and discriminatory policies against African Americans. He signed a law authorizing $6 million for California State University to study how to confirm an individual\u2019s status as a descendant of an enslaved person. But he vetoed other bills the California Legislative Black Caucus championed as tools to atone for the state\u2019s history.",

A Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2021 found that only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults said descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. should be repaid in some way, such as given land or money. About 7 in 10 said these descendants should not be repaid.",
      "Maryland lawmakers did not take up congressional redistricting in their one-day special session. Moore has expressed interest in pursuing a new map, which could come up when lawmakers convene in January for their annual 90-day session. However, the state Senate president has said he doesn't support moving forward with a new map. Democrats hold a 7-1 advantage over Republicans in the state's eight congressional districts.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Federal authorities said Monday that they foiled a plot to bomb multiple sites of two U.S. companies on New Year\u2019s Eve in Southern California after arresting members of an extremist anti-capitalist and anti-government group.",
      "The four suspects were arrested Friday in the Mojave Desert east of Los Angeles as they were rehearsing their plot, First Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said during a news conference. Officials showed reporters surveillance aerial footage of the suspects moving a large black object in the desert to a table. Officials said they were able to make the arrests before the suspects assembled a functional explosive device.",
      "In the criminal complaint, the four suspects named are Audrey Illeene Carroll, 30; Zachary Aaron Page, 32; Dante Gaffield, 24; and Tina Lai, 41. They are all from the Los Angeles area, Essayli said.",

      "The term \u201cTurtle Island\u201d is used by some Indigenous peoples to describe North America in a way that reflects its existence outside of the colonial boundaries put in place by the U.S. and Canada. It comes from Indigenous creation stories where the continent was formed on the back of a giant turtle.",
      "Officials also found \u201cFree Palestine\u201d flyers at the desert campsite where the suspects were working with the bomb-making materials.",
      "The charges against each suspect include conspiracy and possession of a destructive device. Essayli said additional charges were expected in coming weeks.",
      "The four suspects' attorneys did not immediately return requests for comment, and The Associated Press was unable to reach family members. AP also sent Turtle Island Liberation Front's social media accounts messages asking for comment but did not get a response.",
      "Essayli said Carroll last month created a detailed plan to bomb five or more business locations across Southern California on New Year\u2019s Eve. He declined to name the companies but described them as \u201cAmazon-type\u201d logistical centers.",
      "\u201cCarroll\u2019s bomb plot was explicit,\u201d Essayli said. \u201cIt included step-by-step instructions to build IEDs... and listed multiple targets across Orange County and Los Angeles.\"",
      "The plan included planting backpacks filled with complex pipe bombs that were set to be detonated simultaneously at midnight on New Year's Eve at five locations, according to officials and the criminal complaint. New Year\u2019s Eve was identified as an opportune time in the plan that stated \u201cfireworks will be going off at this time so explosions will be less likely to be noticed,\" according to the investigation.",
      "The eight-page handwritten plan titled \u201cOPERATION MIDNIGHT SUN\u201d stated more locations could be added. The locations were identified as property and facilities operated by two separate companies tied to activities affecting interstate and foreign commerce, according to the complaint.",
      "Two of the group\u2019s members also had discussed plans for future attacks targeting Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and vehicles with pipe bombs in 2026, according to the criminal complaint.",

      "The plan included instructions on how to manufacture the bombs and also how to avoid leaving evidence behind that could be traced back to the group, officials said. The suspects recently had acquired precursor chemicals and other items, including purchases from Amazon, according to the complaint.",

      "Wary of getting bogged down in another costly and politically unpopular war in the Middle East after its experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, Washington sent support to rebel groups but at first avoided direct military intervention.",
      "That changed after the rise of the IS, which carried out sporadic attacks in the U.S. and Europe, while in Iraq and Syria, it seized territory that was at one point half the size of the United Kingdom. In the areas the group controlled, it was notorious for its brutality against religious minorities, as well as Muslims whom it considered to be apostates.",
      "In 2014, the administration of then-U.S. President Barack Obama launched an air campaign against IS in Iraq and Syria. The following year, the first U.S. ground troops entered Syria, where they partnered with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the country\u2019s northeast.",

      "BALTIMORE -- Cyclist Barnaby Wickham has collected more than 700 lost hubcaps, mostly on bike rides around Baltimore. They have inspired a quest to turn litter into art, including Christmas wreaths, a giant fish and a large head of Snoopy.",
      "It is a hobby that developed nearly two years ago from his love of cycling and the joy of making something out of the junk he has collected.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s sort of the excitement of the hunt, for one thing,\" Wickham said. \"I love to cycle. I love Baltimore. I love to go out in Baltimore, and there\u2019s just enough hubcaps and other things like car grills to be interesting, but not so many that it\u2019s too easy.\u201d",
      "Wickham, 54, says he can't quite explain it, but one day while cycling in early 2024 he decided to bring home a lost hubcap. Since then, he has started stringing hubcaps he comes across to his backpack.",
      "\u201cI keep track of them, and I have a Google map,\" he said. \"I pin locations where I find each of them.\u201d",
      "Others in his community who have taken an interest in his projects let him know when they see hubcaps by the road. Now, Wickham keeps a list of them that he refers to as \u201chubcaps in the wild.\u201d",
      "He wants to do the collecting himself. That is part of the joy.",
      "Wickham also gets a hand from his wife, Kate, who helps hold materials during construction and offers opinions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just support team, and occasionally the cautious person who says, you can\u2019t drive on this road, you can\u2019t bike on this road or whatever. So I\u2019m just more kind of supporting his love of trying new things,\u201d she said.",
      "It might seem like an odd pastime, but Baltimore has been known to celebrate its quirky side. The city is known for director John Waters, whose offbeat films earned him the moniker of the \u201cPope of Trash.\u201d Baltimore is also home to the American Visionary Art Museum, which is nationally recognized as a repository for the work of self-taught artists and intuitive art.",
      "Wickham, who works in marketing for a defense technology company, stores his finds in his garage and works in his front yard. He uses expanded metal as a framework, with sheet metal with holes and wiring to hold the sheets in place. He uses zip ties to link the hubcaps on the sheet metal.",

      "His works are big. The head of Snoopy is 16 feet (4.9 meters) tall and about 21 feet (6.4 meters) wide.",
      "While most of the hubcaps he uses were found in Baltimore, Wickham expands his range when he travels. Visits to see his son at Kent State University have added a few hubcaps with Ohio origins. A business trip to Italy, which included a bike tour in Rome, yielded a find. Wickham had to explain to his guide why he bothered to pick it up.",
      "\u201cAnd I was like, oh, I collect these. I\u2019m just going to take this back with me. And I showed her a photo of the wreath, and she was like: \u2018Oh, OK.\u2019 Whenever anyone hears about it and understands it, they\u2019re onboard,\" Wickham said.",
      "Wickham donated two Christmas wreaths he made last year, one to the city and another to a nonprofit.",
      "Wickham said the hobby has led to interactions with city residents. On one ride, a man who saw him pick up a hubcap, insistently signaled for him to come over to him. He wanted to let him know there was another hubcap nearby.",
      "\u201cIt was clear to him that I was collecting these things, and all he wanted to do was help, to point one out for me. And there\u2019s a lot of that,\u201d Wickham said.",
      "\u201cIt starts a lot of conversations, and it\u2019s just something that people love to talk about,\" he said.",

      "\"I wasn't really that shy about including some of the bad stuff I did,\" Nick Reiner said during the joint interview, \"because a lot of people do things that are pretty unsavory when they're going through that, but in terms of making it a narrative, of course it's not my life.\" He also said, \"I think I can relate to it of course, and I hope other people can relate to it.\"",

      "Rob Reiner, the son of a comedy giant who became one himself with movies such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026\" and \"This is Spinal Tap,\" is being remembered for his iconic contributions to entertainment following the shocking news of his death.",
      "Reiner, 78, and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead Sunday at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, in what police called an \"apparent homicide.\" Their son Nick Reiner was arrested on murder charges.",
      "\"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time,\" their family said in a statement obtained by Variety and other outlets.",
      "Robert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947. As a young man, he set out to follow in his father's footsteps into entertainment. He studied at the University of California, Los Angeles film school and, in the 1960s, began appearing in small parts in various television shows.",
      "Reiner grew up thinking his father, Carl Reiner, didn't understand him or find him funny. But the younger Reiner would in many ways emulate his career, working both in front of and behind the camera.",
      "\"My father thought, 'Oh, my God, this poor kid is worried about being in the shadow of a famous father,'\" Reiner told \u00a0\"60 Minutes\"\u00a0earlier this year, recalling the temptation to change his name. \"And he says, 'What do you want to change your name to?' And I said, 'Carl.' I just wanted to be like him.\"",
      "He added, \"Norman Lear was the first person that got me. I mean, I was playing jacks with his daughter. Norman says to my dad, 'You know, this kid is really funny.' And I think my dad said, 'What? That kid?' That kid? He's ... sullen, he sits quiet. He doesn't-- you know, he's not funny.'\"",
      "After starting out as a writer for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" Reiner's breakthrough came when he was, at age 23, cast by producer and family friend Norman Lear in \"All in the Family\" as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic. Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that he thought the show would only last 13 weeks \u2014 but it went on to air for eight years, five of them as the top show in the country.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant,\" he told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2010. \"There's no way that this is going to fly on American television.\"",
      "Reiner was five times nominated for an Emmy for his performance on the show, winning in 1974 and 1978. In Lear, Reiner also found a mentor. He called him \"a second father.\"",
      "Lear, who\u00a0died in 2023 at age 101, reciprocated the feeling. The Lear family said in a statement Sunday night that he \"often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary.\"",
      "It was during the end of Reiner's stint on the show that he came up with the idea for his first film: the largely improvised 1984 cult classic \"This is Spinal Tap,\" which lovingly spoofed a fictional British rock band. The sequel, \"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,\" was released this fall.",
      "\"Well, people would say, 'I can't believe your first movie would be improvised, there'd be no script. And that's scary.' And, to me, it was the opposite. I wasn't scared,\" he told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The film kicked off a four-year stretch that resulted in a trio of American classics \u2014 \"Stand By Me\" (1986), \"The Princess Bride\" (1987) and \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\" (1989)\u00a0 \u2014 all of them among the most often quoted movies of the 20th century.",
      "Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that \"Stand by Me,\" his 1986 film adaptation of the Stephen King novella \"The Body,\" was in many ways based on his relationship with his father.",
      "\"I'm writing this scene, I'm crying. I actually cry. When I was making it I knew that he loved me and he did understand me, but as a little boy that's what I felt,\" he said.",
      "The movie, about four boys who go looking for the dead body of a missing boy, became a coming-of-age classic, making breakthroughs of its young cast, particularly River Phoenix. One of those co-stars, Jerry O'Connell, spoke to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday and described the news as \"just surreal.\"",
      "\"Rob was like a father to me,\" O'Connell said. \"Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner. Everything I have.\"",
      "With his stock rising, Reiner devoted himself to adapting William Goldman's \"The Princess Bride,\" a 1973 book Reiner had loved since his father gave him a copy as a gift. Everyone from Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut to Robert Redford had considered adapting Goldman's book, but it ultimately fell to Reiner (from Goldman's own script) to capture the unique comic tone of \"The Princess Bride.\" But only once he had Goldman's blessing.",
      "\"At the door he greeted me and he said, 'This is my baby. I want this on my tombstone. This is my favorite thing I've ever written in my life. What are you going to do with it?'\" Reiner recalled in a Television Academy interview. \"And we sat down with him and started going through what I thought should be done with the film.\"",
      "Though only a modest success in theaters, the movie \u2014 starring Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Robin Wright \u2014 would grow in stature over the years, leading to countless impressions of Inigo Montoya's vow of revenge and the risky nature of land wars in Asia.",
      "For the next four decades, Reiner, a warm and gregarious presence on screen and an outspoken liberal advocate off it, remained a constant fixture in Hollywood. The production company he co-founded, Castle Rock Entertainment, launched an enviable string of hits, including \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" By the turn of the century, its success rate had fallen considerably, but Reiner revived it earlier this decade. This fall, Reiner and Castle Rock released the long-in-coming sequel\u00a0\"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.\"",
      "\"What are we, crazy to do another one? It's crazy,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" about the sequel. \"The bar is just way too high.\"",
      "All the while, Reiner was one of the film industry's most passionate Democrat activists, regularly hosting fundraisers and campaigning for liberal issues. He was co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which challenged in court California's ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. He also chaired the campaign for Prop 10, a California initiative to fund early childhood development services with a tax on tobacco products. Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump.",
      "That ran in the family, too. Reiner's father opposed the Communist hunt of McCarthyism in the 1950s and his mother, Estelle Reiner, a singer and actor, protested the Vietnam War.",
      "\"If you're a nepo baby, doors will open,\" Reiner told The Guardian in 2024. \"But you have to deliver. If you don't deliver, the door will close just as fast as it opened.\"",
      "Reiner was married to Penny Marshall, the actor and filmmaker, for 10 years beginning in 1971. Like Reiner, Marshall experienced sitcom fame with \"Laverne & Shirley,\" but found a more lasting legacy behind the camera. Marshall\u00a0died in 2018.",
      "After their divorce, Reiner, at a lunch with Nora Ephron, suggested a comedy about dating. In writing what became \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\", Ephron and Reiner charted a relationship between a man and a woman \u2014 memorably played in the film by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan \u2014 over the course of 12 years.",
      "Along the way, the movie's ending changed, as did some of the film's indelible moments. The famous line, \"I'll have what she's having,\" said after witnessing Ryan's fake orgasm at Katz's Delicatessen, was a suggestion by Crystal \u2014 delivered by none other than Reiner's mother, Estelle.",
      "\"I'm pounding the table, 'Yes! Yes! Yes!' And I'm realizing I'm having an orgasm in front of my mother, you know? There's my mother over there,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The movie's happy ending also had some real-life basis. Reiner said he changed it after meeting Singer, a photographer, on the set of the film. They married In 1989, and had three children together: Nick, Jake and Romy.",
      "Reiner's subsequent films included another King adaptation, \"Misery\" (1990) and a pair of Aaron Sorkin-penned dramas: the military courtroom tale \"A Few Good Men\" (1992) and 1995's \"The American President.\"",
      "By the late '90s, Reiner's films (1996's \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" 2007's \"The Bucket List\") no longer had the same success rate. But he remained a frequent actor, often memorably enlivening films like \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993) and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013). In 2023, he directed the documentary \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.\"",
      "In the interview with \"60 Minutes\" this year, Reiner said he never had any idea if his films would work.",

    "story": [
      "Hollywood stars and political leaders alike are paying homage to\u00a0Rob Reiner, the prolific movie director, actor and social activist whose shocking death has triggered a wave of heartfelt tributes online.",
      "Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead Sunday in their Los Angeles home in what police described as an apparent homicide. Police said Monday that their son Nick Reiner has been arrested\u00a0on murder charges.",
      "With a career that spanned multiple genres over more than five decades, Rob Reiner is considered a legend by many in the film and television industry. He rose to fame as a comedic actor in the CBS sitcom \"All in the Family,\" and his directing credits include classic titles like \"A Few Good Men,\" \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally...\" and \"This is Spinal Tap.\"",
      "Stephen King said he was \"horrified and saddened\" by the news of the Reiners' deaths in a post shared on X. Reiner's coming-of-age drama \"Stand by Me\" was based on King's novella \"The Body,\" and he also went on to direct the 1990 screen adaptation of the author's thriller \"Misery,\" both of which won acclaim.",
      "\"Wonderful friend, political ally, and brilliant filmmaker,\" King said. \"Rest in peace, Rob. You always stood by me.\"",
      "The actor and television host Jerry O'Connell, who was one of the young co-stars in \"Stand By Me,\" shared an photo on\u00a0Instagram\u00a0of himself and Reiner on the set of the 1986 movie. In its caption, he wrote: \"Love you Rob. Sincerely.\"",
      "In an interview on \"CBS Mornings,\" O'Connell described Reiner's death as \"surreal\" and reflected on the formative role that Reiner played in his life.",
      "\"Rob was like a father to me,\" he said. \"Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner. ... It's just a sad, shocking day.\"",
      "\"What a huge loss,\" wrote Ben Stiller, who said Reiner was one of his favorite directors and praised his \"incredible run of movies.\"",
      "\"He made some of the most formative movies for my generation,\" Stiller posted on X. \"'Spinal Tap' is one of the best  comedies ever made \u2014 and the list goes on. He was a kind caring person who was really really funny.    I didn't  know him well but was always a fan and I feel a real sadness for those who did, and his family.\"",
      "\"Thank you Rob for giving us so much joy to hold on to. Life and talent always turned up to 11,\" actor Virginia Madsen, who appeared in Reiner's 1996 film \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\"\u00a0wrote on Instagram.",
      "James Woods, who starred in the same film, said in a post on X\u00a0that Reiner had fought for him to play that part, and they \"remained good friends ever since.\"",
      "Actor Josh Gad called Reiner \"one of the greatest directors of our time.\" His Instagram post\u00a0included several photos of them together.",
      "\"He was a friend. He was simply a beautiful person,\" Gad captioned it. \"Rob Reiner and his wife Michelle were two of the most kind and caring souls you could ever imagine. He cared so much for those who had no voices. This loss is devastating. I cannot express how much this hurts. Love you Rob and Michelle. Thank you for all you gave us.\"",
      "Fellow director Joe Russo said he \"can't handle the truth that one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live is gone\" in\u00a0a post on X, referencing the iconic line from \"A Few Good Men.\"",
      "\"We lost one of the few good men. RIP, Rob Reiner,\" Russo added.",
      "Actor and Screen Actors Guild president Sean Astin said in a news release that Reiner was \"one of those most significant figures in the history of film and television,\" whose cultural influence \"simply can't be overstated.\"",
      "\"All in the Family\" creator Norman Lear, who died in 2023 at age 101, \"often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary,\" Lear's family said in a statement. The family said they were \"devastated by the deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner.\"",
      "\"Norman would have wanted to remind us that Rob and Michele spent every breath trying to make this country a better place, and they pursued that through their art, their activism, their philanthropy, and their love for family and friends,\" the family said.",
      "Politicians from California and beyond have spoken out to express their condolences and celebrate Reiner's accomplishments in cinema as well as political activism. Reiner was a vocal advocate for Democratic campaigns and, in California, led initiatives for LGBTQ rights and early childhood development.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris said Reiner and his wife \"were dear friends,\" and Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, \"are devastated to learn of their passing.\" Harris, who previously represented California in the U.S. Senate, said Reiner's work \"has impacted generations of Americans.\"",
      "\"The characters, dialogue, and visuals he brought to life in film and television are woven throughout our culture,\" Harris\u00a0wrote on X. \"Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy.\"",
      "Former House Speaker and current Rep. Nancy Pelosi, of California, described Reiner as \"creative, funny, and beloved\" and said in\u00a0a statement\u00a0that she and her family were mourning \"the loss of our very dear friends.\"",

Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose.\"",

    "summary": "Anthony Geary, who played Luke Spencer on the long-running soap opera \"General Hospital,\" has died.",
    "story": [
      "Anthony Geary, who rose to fame in the 1970s and '80s as half the daytime TV super couple Luke and Laura on \"General Hospital,\" has died. He was 78.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Anthony Geary, whose portrayal of Luke Spencer helped define General Hospital and daytime television,\" ABC said in a statement confirming his death.",
      "Geary died Sunday in Amsterdam of complications from a surgical procedure three days prior.",
      "\"The entire 'General Hospital' family is heartbroken over the news of Tony Geary's passing,\" Frank Valentini, executive producer of the ABC show, said in a statement Monday. \"Tony was a brilliant actor and set the bar that we continue to strive for.\"",
      "In a career spanning more than 40 years, Geary earned eight Daytime Emmy awards as Luke Spencer after joining the soap in 1978. Luke's pairing with Genie Francis' Laura Webber Baldwin (as she was known at the time) propelled the two onto magazine covers and into the cultural mainstream.",
      "The 1981 wedding of Luke and Laura was a pop culture phenomenon done in two parts, drawing guest appearances that included Elizabeth Taylor. A record 30 million viewers watched.",
      "\"He was a powerhouse as an actor. Shoulder to shoulder with the greats. No star burned brighter than Tony Geary. He was one of a kind. As an artist, he was filled with a passion for the truth, no matter how blunt, or even a little rude it might be, but always hilariously funny,\" Francis said in a statement.",
      "In addition to his role as Luke, Geary had numerous TV and stage credits, including stints on other soaps: \"The Young and the Restless\" and \"Bright Promise.\" Geary played Luke on and off until 2015, though he returned for a cameo in 2017.",
      "He lived a quiet life with husband Claudio Gama in Amsterdam.",
      "In a 1993 interview, Geary spoke of the many highs and lows of playing Luke.",
      "\"I felt like I had to be Luke 24 hours a day or people would be disappointed,\" he said at the time. \"As far as I'm concerned, they are mythic creatures. They come from two sides of the universe together and have a mutual connection, which is basically lust and appreciation for individuality. They love the eccentricity in each other.\"",
      "Geary's Luke began as a small-time hitman recruited to dismantle the relationship of Laura and her first husband, Scotty Baldwin. Their story arc turned darker when Luke sexually assaulted Laura. The assault led to a redemption trail for Luke, who evolved into a hero and even served as mayor of the show's small town, Port Charles.",
      "\"He was not created to be a heroic character,\" Geary told ABC's \"Nightline\" in 2015. \"He was created to be an anti-hero, and I have treasured the anti-side of the hero and pushed it for a long time. ... He's not a white hat or a black hat, he's all shades of grey. And that has been the saving grace of playing him all these years.\"",
      "Geary was born to Mormon parents in Coalville, Utah. He was discovered while attending the University of Utah and performing on stage. He joined a touring company of \"The Subject Was Roses,\" which brought him to Los Angeles.",
      "Over the years, he appeared frequently in stage productions alongside his screen work.",
      "Geary's first appearance on TV was as Tom Whalom on an episode of \"Room 222.\" He went on to appear in \"All in the Family,\" \"The Partridge Family,\" \"The Mod Squad,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"The Streets of San Francisco\" and \"Barnaby Jones.\"",

    "story": [
      "Last week, at a New York bar called Old Mates, Australian icon Hugh Jackman sang a few songs by an American icon, Neil Diamond. He's been doing a lot of this lately.",
      "His new film, \"Song Sung Blue,\" is based on the real-life story of Mike and Claire Sardina, celebrity impersonators who teamed up to form a Neil Diamond tribute act by the name of Lightning & Thunder. Jackman was cast early on as Mike, and director Craig Brewer was still looking for someone to play Claire, when Jackman got an idea from watching TV: \"Yeah. It's this little-known show, 'CBS Sunday Morning,'\" he said.",
      "In April 2024, \"Sunday Morning\" aired a profile of Kate Hudson and her blossoming music career.",
      "Jackman was contacted by a friend and assistant, Michelle: \"She texts me: 'Are you watching \"CBS Sunday Morning\"?' I said, 'I'm not.' Normally I am, by the way \u2013 that sounded sucky, but it's true! I normally am! And I wasn't \u2013 I turned it on, and there was Kate promoting her debut solo album. I texted Craig Brewer, the writer-director, and I said, 'Kate Hudson is Claire. Claire is Kate.' And he said, 'Oh my God, perfect.'\"",
      "\"Perfect\" might be the right word: Hudson's turn as Claire Sardina has already earned her a Golden Globe nomination.",
      "Jackman said, \"As much as i could see it and feel it, nothing prepared me from day one of rehearsal through to the end, 'til I saw the movie, of Kate's performance. Because it was like, I could feel \u2013 you know, you just know, like, 'Ah, she's gonna be perfect,' 'cause she's amazing, and I love her, and I love her as an actress. But when there's somehow an alchemy of a part to an actress at that time, when that all comes together? Magic.\"",
      "The performances are magical, but what happened to the Sardinas off stage was anything but: between gigs, they endured poverty, addiction, and some incredibly bad luck.",
      "\"They go through so much,\" Hudson said. \"And if it wasn't a true story, it would almost be \u2013 you wouldn't believe it, you know?\"",
      "The film is at its heart a love story, and you could say the two lead actors have chemistry to burn. Yet, Jackman and Hudson did not know each other well before the project began. \"It's become a bit of a joke,\" said Jackman. \"Because I remember when we first met, but she has no recollection. That's the impression I made!\"",
      "And now?\u00a0 \"Oh, well, very well,\" said Hudson. \"Except consummating. Beyond that, pretty, pretty much everything!\"",
      "Hudson was apprehensive when Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell watched the film: \"Everyone loved the movie. My big thing was thinking, I was watching my mom watching it. I was like, 'God \u2026' because I'm so, I guess, not the glamorous version of myself \u2013 or even honestly my version. You know, I was a bit heavier and didn't see my skin person for a while, you know. I was like, 'God, it must be so interesting for my mom to see her middle-aged daughter on the screen.' She must have been like, 'Oh my God, she's middle-aged!'\"",
      "Still, it seems middle age has been good to Kate Hudson, even in a year that would put the gray in anyone's hair. Last January, a wind-driven firestorm incinerated the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles, where Hudson has lived for most of her life. Her home is one of the few still standing, but her neighborhood is full of vacant lots where her friends' houses used to be \u2013 and some of the places she treasured the most went up in smoke.",
      "She showed us around what was left of the neighborhood: \"Every time I drive by here, taking the kids from, like, baseball or soccer, you know, I drive by and I go, 'Oh, that's where mommy had her first kiss.' And now you're like \u2026 it's not there. And that's what I mean by, like, nothing lasts.\"",
      "But in the end, home is where you feel loved. For Hudson, it's still her community in Los Angeles. And for Jackman, it's his pub in Manhattan: \"I come in here, I get a lot of, 'Ah, Hughie, come over and have a beer, mate.' I said, 'Ah, I gotta go.' 'Ah, come on mate, don't be a ****. Let's go. Let's have a beer. Buy me a beer. You can afford it!' A lot of that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Can you show up someplace and kind of be a regular dude?\"",
      "\"Oh yeah,\" he replied.",
      "\"You can show up here and be a regular dude?\"",
      "\"Yeah, except I just have to be prepared for them to make fun of me!\" Jackman said, \"which is a sign of affection!\"",
      "Jackman was prepping for a little Neil Diamond tribute at Old Mates later that night, and just like in the movie, Jackman and Hudson did what Neil Diamond himself would've done: raise the roof.",
      "Watch Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson perform \"Sweet Caroline\" at Old Mates:",
      "One final note: Neil Diamond himself is not in the film, but Jackman says he loved it \u2013 and gave him the ultimate stamp of approval: \"He put his arm around me like that, and I sort of leant, and he just kissed me on the forehead. And he said, 'You did good, kid!'\"",

    "summary": "Known as a popular Hollywood director, Rob Reiner also had a lengthy record of political and civic activism, especially in California.",
    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner was known for decades as a Hollywood luminary, finding early success as a sitcom star before going on to become one of the most prominent directors in the industry. But he also dedicated much of his life to political activism, with a long record of backing Democratic Party campaigns nationwide and supporting landmark policies for LGBTQ rights and childhood development in his home state of California.",
      "In the wake of his death, that legacy is being remembered by some of the country's leading political figures.",
      "Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead Sunday in their Los Angeles home, and police said Monday that their son, Nick Reiner, 32, has been\u00a0arrested for murder.",
      "Former President Barack Obama said he and Michelle Obama were \"heartbroken\" by the news. Reiner, he wrote, displayed \"a deep belief in the goodness of people \u2014 and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired,.\"",
      "Similar sentiments were shared by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who previously represented California in the U.S. Senate, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, both of whom referred to the Reiners as \"dear friends.\"",
      "\"Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy,\" Harris\u00a0wrote on X.",
      "Pelosi's post highlighted Reiner's deep history of activism in California, referencing his efforts to help secure marriage equality and a program supporting early childhood development in the state.",
      "\"Personally, Rob cared deeply about people and demonstrated that in his civic activities \u2014 whether by supporting the First 5 initiative or fighting against Prop 8 in California,\" Pelosi wrote, adding that he was also \"a champion for the First Amendment and the creative rights of artists.\"",
      "Reiner led the campaign to pass California's First 5 initiative in 1998. Also known as the California Children and Families Initiative, it's \"dedicated to improving the lives of California's young children and their families through a comprehensive system of education, health services, childcare, and other crucial programs,\" according to its mission statement. Funding for the initiative comes from a statewide tax on tobacco. Reiner chaired the organization from 1999 to 2006.",
      "Later, Reiner joined the board of directors at the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a nonprofit organization that brought a crucial federal court challenge against Proposition 8, California's now-defunct 2008 ban on same-sex marriage. He and his wife were among the organization's founding board members, and Michele Reiner went on to serve as its treasurer. They were driving forces in its successful effort to pursue legal protection for marriage equality in California and several other states, before the Supreme Court finally upheld it nationwide.",
      "Reiner was also an environmental advocate. He founded an environmental campaign in the early 2000s to protect California's Ahmanson Ranch as a state park and wildlife preserve, and prevent it from becoming a site for real estate development, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "Reiner lent his support to the campaigns of numerous Democratic candidates, including Al Gore during the 2000 presidential election and Hillary Clinton's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton\u00a0said\u00a0in a post on X that Rob and Michele Reiner \"inspired and uplifted millions through their work on film and television. And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defense of inclusive democracy, setting an example for us all to follow. Hillary and I will always be grateful for their friendship, unfailing kindness, and support.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden praised the Reiners' \"extraordinary contributions\" and wrote, \"We take solace in knowing their work will live on for generations to come.\"",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom both shared their appreciation of Reiner's political achievements in their state. Newsom described Reiner as a \"big-hearted genius\" with \"boundless empathy,\" who \"made California a better place through his good works.\" Bass called Reiner's death \"is a devastating loss\" for Los Angeles and the nation.",
      "\"Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,\" Bass wrote, adding that, as an activist, \"he always used his gifts in service of others.\"",
      "Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump, which drew the ire of the president. In social media posts and comments at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump accused Reiner of \"Trump derangement syndrome\" and said, \"I wasn't a fan of his at all.\" The president's comments were condemned by a number of Republicans as well as Democrats.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "He was the son of comedy royalty, but as he was growing up, Rob Reiner (March 6, 1947-Dec. 14, 2025) thought it was normal to be in a house with so much laughter, surrounded by some of the 20th century's greatest comic minds, from Mel Brooks and Woody Allen to Neil Simon: \"I was aware how funny things were, but I didn't think there was anything unusual about it,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2010, \"until I went over to my friend Paul Schindler's house, where I realized things weren't as funny over there. They were a little funnier at my house.\"",
      "His father, Carl, was a second banana to Sid Caesar, straight man to Brooks' \"2,000-Year-Old Man,\" and director of such films as \"The Jerk\" and \"All of Me.\" Rob continued in the family tradition, writing for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" before being cast in one of the most influential sitcoms ever, Norman Lear's \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Reiner starred as Michael Stivic, the outspoken liberal son-in-law of the bigoted conservative Archie Bunker, who bestowed upon him a memorable nickname: Meathead.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant. There's no way that this is going to fly on American television,\" Reiner said. Actually, it went stratospheric, becoming the top-rated comedy and winning 22 Emmys (including two for Reiner) during its nine seasons.",
      "When the show ended its run, Reiner turned to directing, with \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a \"mockumentary\" about England's loudest rock band. He followed with the romantic comedy \"The Sure Thing,\" the coming-of-age story \"Stand by Me\" (a Stephen King adaptation), and the fairy tale-like \"The Princess Bride.\"",
      "In 1989's \"When Harry Met Sally,\" Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan play friends who eventually realize they are right for each other \u2014 but not until after Ryan's Sally demonstrates, in a restaurant, how to fake an orgasm. In a cameo, Reiner's mom, Estelle, gave the scene its peerless punchline: \"I'll have what she's having.\"",
      "\"I basically tell the same love story over and over,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"Essentially what it is, the girl in the story is always much more emotionally mature. The boy is always running around like an idiot trying to catch up, trying to figure out what's going on. \u2026 I mean, that's my story. I mean, basically, you know, my wife made me a person.\"",
      "He directed Kathy Bates to a best actress Oscar in \"Misery,\" and earned a best picture nomination for \"A Few Good Men.\" His other films included \"The American President,\" \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" \"Rumor Has It\u2026,\" \"The Bucket List,\" \"And So It Goes,\" \"LBJ,\" and \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life,\" a documentary about comedian and childhood friend Albert Brooks.",
      "Meanwhile, his production company, Castle Rock, was behind such films and TV programs as \"City Slickers,\" \"Honeymoon in Vegas,\" \"Mr. Saturday Night,\" \"In the Line of Fire,\" \"Malice,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Dolores Claiborne,\" \"Before Sunrise,\" \"Lone Star,\" \"Waiting for Guffman,\" \"The Green Mile,\" \"Michael Clayton,\" and \"Seinfeld.\"",
      "\"I make movies about people that live on Earth,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \u00a0\"Nobody gets exploded, nobody is running around chasing anything. Basically, they're people in rooms talking.\"",
      "An activist and vocal proponent for progressive causes, Reiner supported early childhood education and legalizing same-sex marriage, and raised funds for Democratic candidates.",
      "But he may be best remembered as \"Meathead.\" \"On almost a daily basis somebody will call me that,\" he said. \"I love that, because \u2014 you know, I've such a great experience with the show. I'm so proud of it and I have often said no matter what I do in life, I could win the Nobel Prize, the headline would read, 'Meathead wins the Nobel.'\""

      "Peters and Sarandos also expressed optimism that Netflix's proposed $83 billion purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV and film assets will win government regulatory approval. Warner is home to the storied movie studio that created hits like \"Barbie\" and popular franchises such as \"The Hobbit\" and \"Harry Potter.\"",
      "The letter comes as Netflix faces a competing bid from Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News), which on December 8 launched a hostile bid to buy all of Warner Bros.

    "summary": "Enduring romances such as \"Pride and Prejudice,\" \"Sense and Sensibility,\" and \"Emma\" made the British writer one of the brightest names in literature \u2013 and the beloved subject of a yearlong celebration marking the 250th anniversary of her birth.",
    "story": [
      "It might look like a scene from yet another Jane Austen production, but this is no set. The British town of Bath recently held a celebration of the author 250 years after her birth.",
      "This historic English town was channeling the early 1800s, the period when Austen's novels were published. \"Pride and Prejudice,\" \"Sense and Sensibility,\" and \"Emma\" were among those Anne Perng grew up reading: \"The issues that she speaks of \u2013 the economy, class, family, sisters \u2013 still so resonate with us today.\"",
      "Fifteen thousand tickets were sold for this year's 10-day Jane Austen Festival, a level of enthusiasm that surprised even its organizer, Georgia Delve: \"Two of her novels are based here,\" she said. \"So, you can walk in her footsteps down the streets. You've got character names on streets, you've got places she visited. It's just the feeling of being in that world that she inhabited that makes it so special.\"",
      "Writer Devoney Looser said, \"She has written books that are endlessly re-readable.\"",
      "\"It's not enough to read it once?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, I don't think so. There's something new to find every time.\"",
      "Looser's ties to the author are not just professional: \"My husband is also a Jane Austen scholar,\" she said. \"We met and had a fight over Jane Austen the day we met.\"",
      "\"What a love story!\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, that's what he'd say, too!\"",
      "In her book, \"Wild for Austen,\" Looser argues the author is hardly plain, prim, and proper: \"It's there in her writings \u2013 this idea of women being positively wild. Unconventional, more free, more artless, and willing to combine feeling and thoughtfulness with intellectual ability. That this is the kind of thing she set out to celebrate in her heroines, at a time where women were supposed to be ideally passive and not very thinking.\"",
      "Austen died at age 41 after suffering a range of ailments. She wrote just six novels (two published after her death).",
      "Looser said, \"You can read her on the level of the word, the sentence, chapter, plot, character, and appreciate what she's done in terms of craft. And on top of that, they're funny and they're incredible works of social criticism.\"",
      "At the University of Southampton in England, scholars and enthusiasts met this past summer to discuss all things Austen.",
      "In the university's collections, among its seven million manuscripts and printed books, head of archives and special collections Karen Robson gave us a sampling from a first edition of Austen's \"Emma,\" printed in 1816:",
      "\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\"",
      "\"Lucky Emma,\" I said. \"You get so much in just this first sentence.\"",
      "\"Absolutely,\" Robson said. \"She's a wonderful wordsmith.\"",
      "Looser said, \"She publishes the first one, 'Sense and Sensibility,' 1811, as 'by a lady.' And then after that, as 'by the author of \"Sense and Sensibility.\"'\"",
      "\"She didn't put her name on the books? Why?\" I asked.",
      "\"Because novels in this period were not seen as high art. They were still seen as a kind of trashier genre,\" said Looser.",
      "\"So, she didn't want to be associated with it?\"",
      "\"She died before we know if she ever would have decided to put her name on something,\" she said.",
      "Looser likens Austen to Shakespeare, with the kind of staying power that takes form in the many films and miniseries based on her novels. Then, there are the Austen-inspired works, such as \"The Jane Austen Book Club,\" and \"Clueless\" (based on \"Emma\").",
      "We visited the set of another spin-off, \"The Other Bennet Sister,\" based on Janice Hadlow's 2020 novel, which puts the often-overlooked middle sister, Mary, from \"Pride and Prejudice,\" at the center. \"I think she feels like a very modern heroine,\" said Jane Tranter, the executive producer of this BBC/Britbox series. \"It's not a classic boy-meets-girl kind of story.\"",
      "So, why do we see so many adaptations of Austen's work? \"Jane Austen is the absolute master of a love story, of a kind of slow-simmering, everything very proper, but kind of like boiling away beneath the lines of society,\" said Tranter. \"And we love that. And I think we love the period detail.\"",
      "That was clear in Bath, where the past was very much alive and celebrated on her 250th birthday.",
      "Asked why Austen's work endures, Looser replied, \"Because it's brilliant. Right? I mean, I think that's the glib, easy answer: because it's brilliant.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-makes-for-a-great-christmas-song/",
    "published": "Sun, 14 Dec 2025 09:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Musicologist Joe Bennett explains the common components of the most enduring Christmas songs, from \"Jingle Bells\" to \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" \u2013 which inspires David Pogue to compose his own new holiday song.",
    "story": [
      "Every year at this time, some of the greatest songs in the world pop up in our playlists. Most of them are decades old, or even centuries. If anyone knows what makes a Christmas song immortal, it's Berklee School of Music forensic musicologist Joe Bennett. He's analyzed the holiday pop charts to learn exactly what makes popular Christmas songs popular \u2013 \"to try and figure out what are the musical characteristics that listeners keep coming back to again and again over the years,\" he said.",
      "In fact, Bennett found that most commercial Christmas hits are about one of only six things. Those thematic characteristics include \"home for the holidays\" (the most common one), weather-themed songs (like \"Let It Snow\"), the myth of Santa Claus, parties, being in love, and being out of love.",
      "Which brings us to the #1 Christmas hit of recent years: from 1994, Mariah Carey's \"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\" Bennett says the song is remarkable because it hits most of the Christmas-themed tropes: \"We get Christmas presents, and the tree, and Santa Claus, and the snow. That lyric is so well-loved as a holiday celebration song, 'cause it's literally got it all.\"",
      "A few years back, \"Sunday Morning\" visited Walter Afanasieff, who wrote that song with Carey. \"Hey, I have a #1 hit every year, but it's the same song every year!\" he laughed.",
      "\"We just kind of, like, go bouncing off of each other, like at a jam session,\" he said. \"No one in a million years would've thought, 'Yeah, we're gonna release this and it's gonna be a big hit.'\"",
      "Musical elements",
      "And what does Maria Carey's hit have in common with most other Christmas hits? Sleigh bells! \"We found that more than 65% of the songs in the corpus had sleigh bells playing eight to the bar,\" said Bennett.",
      "He said the inspiration came from galloping horses: \"In the mid-1800s, the horses would actually wear sleigh bells to warn people that they were coming. So, you can imagine the sort of leather across the horse's mane there, and it's gonna make a heck of a noise \u2013 you're not gonna miss that deadly sleigh coming up behind you! You can imagine a horse trotting to that, and it's eighth notes. Da-da-da-da. Unwittingly pre-composing Christmas music from 100 years afterwards!\"",
      "Major Key",
      "Then there are the technical aspects of a piece of music, like the key. According to Bennett, about 98% of the songs in the data set that he looked at were in a major key. \"On a surface level, Christmas music tends to be cheerful,\" he said.",
      "\"The other characteristic that Christmas music has is, you want every generation to be able to sing it,\" he added. \"So that's why kids' songs are often very simple and go over smaller intervals\" \u2013 like \"Jingle Bells,\" which is comprised of five notes. \"And that's why kids find it easy to sing!\"",
      "And sure enough: Almost every popular Christmas song on Earth has an easily singable range of nine notes or fewer: Among them, \"White Christmas,\" \"12 Days of Christmas,\" \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas,\" \"O Christmas Tree,\" \"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts),\" \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" \"Silver Bells,\" \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" \"Frosty the Snowman,\" \"Little Drummer Boy,\" and \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.\"",
      "Bennett points out one more common characteristic: a surprising number of Christmas melodies go right up or down the scale, as in \"Joy to the World,\" \"Let It Snow\" and 'Winter Wonderland.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think that so many Christmas songs wound up with these characteristics? It's not like the composer sat down and said, 'Four-four, major key, swing'?\"",
      "\"No, it's the selection effect \u2013 that is, we only know the Christmas songs that we know and love,\" Bennett said. \"We ignore the experimental ones that just died in the marketplace.\"",
      "A Christmas debut",
      "Now, based on the data I have studied on what makes a great Christmas song, I've written one \u2013 and Kerry Butler has gracefully agreed to sing it for us!",
      "Butler is a veteran of 12 Broadway shows, including \"Hairspray,\" \"Mean Girls\" and \"Beetlejuice.\" She knows her way around a song \u2013 and the holidays hold a special meaning for her. \"My whole family is obsessed with Christmas,\" she said. \"We had our decorations up way before Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Asked what a Christmas song does for her emotionally that a pop song doesn't, Butler replied, \"I think it's the nostalgia. It brings back all these memories when we were little, singing them with our parents, and now we're older and we're singing them with our kids.\"",
      "Now, songwriter Walter Afanasieff and Joe Bennett both say that just including all the traditional musical ingredients doesn't automatically make a song great. \"It's not, like, a formula or an algorithm,\" said Afanasieff.",
      "And Bennett made an obvious point: \"If it were easy, a lot more people would be doing it!\"",
      "But, I had to give it a shot! And so, \"Sunday Morning\" presents the world premiere of \"The Sound of Christmas.\" It's got sleigh bells, in a major key, with a singable range, and a melody going down the scale.",
      "Crackling fires and crunching snow,Fa-la-la and ho-ho-ho!Listen! Oh, I love the sound ofChristmas!",
      "Caroling and jingle bells, \"Silent Nights\" and \"First Noels,\" All around,  I love the sound  Of Christmas",

      "JOE HUNTER (\"Survivor\" season 48): I am so sorry for the things I said. \u2026 And I never got the chance to say \"I love you.\" So, \"I love you.\"",
      "Joe is still grappling with how she died.",
      "DISPATCHER: 911, What's your emergency?",
      "CHURCH MEMBER: \u2026 I think someone's dead.",
      "A 911 call was made on Oct. 6, 2011 at 9:25 p.m. in Vacaville, California.",
      "CHURCH MEMBER:\u00a0 My pastor just came out of the house, and he's really, really upset and he told me to call the cops. He thinks his wife's dead \u2026",
      "DISPATCHER: What's his name?",
      "CHURCH MEMBER:\u00a0 His name is Mark Lewis.",
      "DISPATCHER: Can I talk to Mark?",
      "DISPATCHER: \u2026 Can you tell me what happened?",
      "MARK LEWIS: I have no clue what happened \u2026",
      "MARK LEWIS:\u00a0 Oh, I don't want to talk about it. \u2026 I don't want to talk about what she looks like.",
      "THE SCENE AT JOANNA'S HOUSE",
      "It was a terrible sight. Mark Lewis' 36-year-old wife Joanna hanging inside a bedroom closet.",
      "MARK LEWIS (to 911): Send somebody out here quick.",
      "DISPATCHER: Mark, they're on the way, honey.",
      "14 minutes later, at 9:39 p.m., according to the Solano County Sheriff's report, a deputy was on the scene.",
      "Captain Jackson Harris reviewed the case with \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He cut her down \u2026 tried to find any signs of life. \u2026 There were not any signs of life that were there, unfortunately.",
      "A bathrobe sash had been the noose. The deputy's report said, \"he did not observe any signs of a struggle.\" There was an open suitcase and a note.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: I believe the note said, take care of the dogs.",
      "Had Joanna taken her own life? Mark Lewis, the 36-year-old pastor of The Fellowship Baptist Church, was handcuffed, placed in the back of a patrol car, and briefly questioned.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He provided a statement.",
      "He said his wife \"did not appear to be depressed,\" \"has no history of mental illness\" and \"has never attempted suicide.\"",
      "Natalie Morales | \"48 Hours\" correspondent: The husband is saying \u2026 my wife did this out of the blue. ...",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: That \u2014  that was his statement that he provided \u2026 people commit suicide for a variety of reasons. Some people keep it to themselves \u2026 some people tell the world.",
      "In the report, Lewis said he last saw his wife at 1 p.m. And the church member who called 911, said he and Mark had been outside the house playing basketball and talking about their faith starting at 3 p.m., until Mark went inside and found Joanna dead.",
      "Joanna's mother, Patricia Hunter, knew nothing of what was unfolding at her daughter's house that night. She wasn't called. A day later, a deacon from the church, went to see her.",
      "Patricia Hunter: He said, \"Joanna is dead.\" \u2026 What?",
      "At around the same time, Joe, a Sacramento, California, firefighter, was taken aside by the captain of his firehouse.",
      "Joe Hunter: He said, \"your sister's gone.\"",
      "First, the gut punch.",
      "Joe Hunter: \u00a0I dropped to my knees.",
      "And then, almost instantly, one thought, one name: Mark Lewis.",
      "Patricia Hunter: What did he do to her?",
      "Joe Hunter: I knew. I knew he did it.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I fell to the ground screaming, crying.",
      "Joe Hunter: Half of me died right there.",
      "A few weeks later when Patricia and her late husband spoke to an officer, he showed her the note.",
      "Patricia Hunter: I actually laughed. And I said, \"That's not a suicide note.\" \u2026 She was leaving him. And that was her note to him, take care of the dogs. I can't take them.",
      "A HISTORY OF ABUSE AND RESTRAINING ORDERS",
      "Joanna had tried to leave Lewis many times before, says Patricia. There was a history of abuse and a cycle that began not long after the couple started seeing each other in high school. At 17, Patricia says, Joanna came home with a black eye.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I begged her. I said, let's go to the hospital. Let's go to the police \u2026 and she said, \"no, mom, no.\"",
      "At 20, Joanna documented Lewis \"choking\" her and got a restraining order against him. Even so, Joanna returned to him.",
      "At 21, after she reported that Lewis \"grabbed my neck and twisted it,\" Joanna got another restraining order.",
      "In 1996, when she was 22, Joanna was hospitalized with a sprained neck. Mark Lewis was convicted on a domestic violence charge and according to court documents, sentenced to 36 months in the Solano County Jail.",
      "Again, she returned to the relationship.",
      "Patricia Hunter: She told me that he had reached out to her from jail \u2026 Would she come visit him? She did. She fell right back into it.",
      "Joanna was 25 when she married Lewis without telling anyone in her family.",
      "Patricia Hunter: I had to tell my husband, and we just held each other and sobbed because we knew now it would be that much harder to help her and get her out.",
      "Their worry continued over the next decade, but Joanna wouldn't open up to them.",
      "Natalie Morales: You said you feared for your daughter, but did you ever think he would be capable of killing her?",
      "Patricia Hunter: Absolutely.",
      "That is what Patricia believed. Law enforcement at the scene came to the opposite conclusion.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: There is no evidence on her body that another person used force to have killed her.",
      "No homicide investigators were called to the house, the bedroom was not treated as a crime scene, no fingerprints taken, no DNA tested and no phones collected.",
      "After his statement, Mark Lewis was released. Lewis was not asked about his history of abuse or about his prior conviction.",
      "That information was more than 15 years old, says Harris, and not available to the deputy in the field.",
      "The next day, an external autopsy determined the ligature marks on Joanna's neck were consistent with suicide.",
      "A month later, when the toxicology report came back clean, the case was closed. And so began the tug-of-war between the family and the sheriff's department that would go on for years to come.",
      "Patricia Hunter: From this moment, when we couldn't get anyone to listen to us and act on it, we are going to work to get justice for Joanna.",
      "Natalie Morales: Do you think she was ever suicidal?",
      "Joe Hunter: You know \u2026 I'm sure she got in many dark places, but in no way, shape, or form, was she capable of that mindset because I know my sister deep down just wanted to leave.",
      "And in the year before she died, Joanna almost saved herself, says Joe. Almost.",
      "Joe Hunter: My mom called me and said, \"Joanna's coming home.\" I said, \"Oh, really?\" \"Yeah, she's done.\" And I said, \"she's really, really done this time?\" \u2026 And I thought, man, like we got her back. We win.",
      "Patricia Hunter: Within two weeks, mom, I \u2014 I'm going back. And I thought she meant to get more things. \u2026 And she said, no, mom, I have to go back to stay.",
      "Joe Hunter: My mom begged her not to go back. \u2026 on her knees, begging her. \u2026 And my mom said, OK, well, I'll drive you.",
      "Natalie Morales: How much do you think of that moment and that drive, taking her back?",
      "Patricia Hunter: All the time.",
      "Patricia Hunter: On the way over \u2026 I was sobbing and I said, honey \u2026 I'm afraid if you go back, I'll never see you again.",
      "Joe Hunter: And we never saw her again.",
      "A FAMILY'S ANGUISH",
      "Joe Hunter: Joanna \u2026 was the perfect person. \u2026 She was the life of the party, but she was also at the same time \u2026 probably the most compassionate, warm person I've ever known.",
      "From the minute he was born, Joanna relished being Joe's big sister.",
      "Patricia Hunter: She thought Joseph was her gift. \u2026 Someone gave her this adorable little boy and he belonged to her.",
      "Joe Hunter: I always tried to be in charge, but she wouldn't let that happen. \u2026 Anybody that called the house \u2026 they had to go through Joanna first. \u2026 \"and you wanna talk to my brother? Why?\" (laughs) \u2026 She protected me a lot. \u2026 we were the perfect team.",
      "Mark Lewis, the son of a local preacher, was Joanna's first boyfriend. At the start, Joe didn't think he had anything to worry about.",
      "Joe Hunter: The first, maybe six to eight months, she seemed really happy.",
      "But after the abuse began, Joe confronted Mark more than once.",
      "Joe Hunter: After physically going after him \u2026 him then taking it out on her. \u2026 I had to back off a little bit from my sister. \u2026 I had been screaming at her for so long, two years straight. \u2026 I hate this guy, leave this guy, please stop. \u2026 I thought I'm gonna lose her for good. \u2026 So, I'm just gonna listen. \u2026 And then I really got the deep, deep, deep, dark secrets that she wasn't even telling my parents.",
      "And Joanna showed him her wounds.",
      "Joe Hunter: She finally showed me \u2026 the massive indentations from him strangling her \u2026 you could just see clearly each outline of each finger.",
      "Mark Lewis had grown more powerful and influential at the Fellowship Baptist Church. He was on his way to becoming pastor.",
      "After they married, Patricia says she went to Lewis with her fears.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I said to him \u2026 how do I know in this moment that you will never lay a hand on her again? \u2026 And I'll never forget. He kind of sneered, half smile and he looked at me and said, when she's a better woman and a better Christian, you won't have to worry about that.",
      "Joe Hunter: My sister started saying comments that he would make to her like, hey, we can help save you. Because you're half black, we can help fix that through religion. Because of your hair and the way you look, we can fix that with religion. \u2026 And you just think, how dare you?",
      "Pastor Lewis, to hear former church members tell it, was a commanding and a demanding presence with fiery sermons and an insistence on loyalty.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Very energetic, get up there and screaming and sweating \u2026 that was his style.",
      "Jacob Cantrell become a deacon there.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: I looked up to him \u2026 he was a \u2026 mentor \u2026 only to find out that I was a pawn.",
      "In hindsight, Cantrell says, Pastor Lewis had too much control over him.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: I couldn't go to my mom and dad's house \u2026 without asking Mark permission. \u2026 I was brainwashed. \u2026 he manipulated me for many years and it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it twisted my brain up.",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): There's no accidents with God.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: He can talk his way out of anything including Miss Joanna's death.",
      "Natalie Morales: Now, you feel that way?",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Now, I feel that way.",
      "Daryl Snedeker: I came to the conclusion that it was probably the closest thing to a cult that I had ever experienced.",
      "Natalie Morales: And he was the leader \u2026",
      "Daryl Snedeker: The leader.",
      "Daryl Snedaker was a deputy in the Solano County Sheriff's Office and a member of the church at the time of Joanna's death. He wasn't involved in the investigation back then. At the church, he says, it didn't take long for him to lose all faith in the place and the pastor.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was there a fear then amongst the people who attended the church, did they fear Mark Lewis?",
      "Daryl Snedeker: I think the people that were his puppets, I think they acted out of fear a lot.",
      "Natalie Morales: You did whatever he asked then?",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Unfortunately. \u2026 You don't question him.",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): \u00a0It's important that you listen up!",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): What would you do if you caused your pastor to quit cause you wouldn't obey? What would you do if you caused your Sunday School teacher to quit cause you wouldn't obey?",
      "Daryl Snedeker: It's disheartening. It's shocking.",
      "Joe already knew\u00a0 Lewis all too well and the years after Joanna's death were filled with anguish and frustration.",
      "Joe Hunter: No one was listening to us, no one was believing this.",
      "There were still so many questions about what happened that night. Why didn't Lewis cut Joanna down or try to administer CPR? And Joe found it particularly hard to believe Lewis was actually playing basketball for six straight hours.",
      "Joe Hunter: You never went inside to use the restroom, get a glass of water \u2026 playing basketball for this obscene amount of time \u2026 is absurd to me.",
      "But all their attempts to get the sheriff's office to take another look at Lewis were getting no results \u2014 until Patricia got a knock on the door.",
      "Patricia Hunter: It was \u2026 a reporter asking if we had heard about what had happened with him. I had no idea what he was talking about.",
      "It was 2014. Joanna had been dead a little more than two years. Pastor Mark Lewis had been arrested \u2014 accused of violence against another woman.",
      "Natalie Morales: Do you feel lucky to be alive?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: Oh yeah.",
      "SARAH NOTTINGHAM'S HARROWING NIGHT",
      "On that crisp fall day in 2011 when Pastor Mark Lewis said he found his wife dead, he never called Joanna's family. He did call Sarah Nottingham.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: He had asked if I heard what happened, he sounded upset. He was crying.",
      "At the time, Nottingham says, she believed in her pastor \u2014 Joanna had died by suicide. Sarah says she and Lewis became friends, then began dating about a year after Joanna's death.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: At first, it was somewhat exciting thinking that \u2026 I'm seeing a side of this person that no one else is seeing.",
      "Eventually, Nottingham says another side of Mark Lewis began to emerge.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: A lot of ... extreme manipulation, a lot of gaslighting, and a lot of verbal abuse, um, some physical. ... A push or a shove. ... And it was just more and more.",
      "And then, she says, she discovered that Lewis had been sending inappropriate text messages to an underage girl.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: You know, I'm just like, I've had enough, like, I'm done. And he said, I'm not ready for it to be over. \u2026 I would just keep telling him, you know, this is, it's over, we're done.",
      "Lewis grabbed her, she says, and tightly wrapped his arms around her.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: It was meant to be threatening. He squeezed me tight and told me, \"You've created a monster.\"",
      "Nottingham and her two young children were living with her parents in Vacaville as the pastor's threats, she says, became more frequent and frightening.",
      "Sarah Nottingham (outside her former home): The first time ... my car was vandalized, it was actually parked here (pointing at the driveway).",
      "Sarah Nottingham: He had, either himself or had somebody, smash my windshield in on my car.",
      "Nottingham was granted an order of protection against Lewis. But it did not stop what happened next in the early morning hours of Jan. 9, 2014.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: It was three something in the morning. And I woke up to our um fire alarm going off \u2026 and there was um smoke filling the hallway. And I checked on my kids.",
      "A Molotov cocktail had crashed through her parents' bedroom window.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: We were able to put the fire out ourselves. \u2026 I had never seen my dad run so fast out the door, trying to see if he could see anybody.",
      "Vacaville Police pulled over a U-Haul van within minutes, arresting the driver and two passengers. The trio quickly confessed, telling police they were hired to firebomb Sarah Nottingham's house \u2014 hired by the pastor, Mark Lewis. He was questioned by local reporters.",
      "MARK LEWIS (KVOR news report): I never\u00a0\u2014\u00a0I never gave them any money to do anything bad.",
      "Lewis was arrested, charged with arson, conspiracy, and stalking.",
      "MARK LEWIS (KVOR news report): A lot of people are going to \u2026 throw accusations out there. But until the facts come out, why don't we just wait and see how that goes and let the court decide.",
      "SARAH NOTTINGHAM (KOVR news report): I'm living in a nightmare. My kids are so scared. My\u00a0\u2014\u00a0my son knows that this is, this is a pastor, his previous pastor that is threatening his mommy and his family.",
      "Natalie Morales: What do you think you and your family survived at that time?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: Ultimately, death. \u2026 When the police came into the house, one of them said this is attempted murder and that's exactly what it was, nothing less.",
      "Surviving the attack, Nottingham says, helped answer a lingering question about Joanna.",
      "Natalie Morales: How do you see her death?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: By him. \u2026 There's just not a doubt in my mind.",
      "By January 2015, Lewis' thundering sermons that echoed in the Fellowship Baptist Church were a distant memory as he sat silently in a Solano County courtroom. Lewis' trial had begun for stalking Sarah Nottingham and hiring people to firebomb her parents' home.",
      "Joe Hunter: I hear about the arson charge. I hear about the stalking. \u2026 But I also feel that he needs to be convicted \u2026 for what he did to my sister.",
      "On day three of Lewis' arson and stalking trial, he changed his plea from not guilty to no contest \u2014 meaning he would not dispute the charges against him but also would not acknowledge guilt. Lewis was sentenced to eight years in prison.",
      "Natalie Morales: How important was that development then in allowing you to then go back to the sheriff's office and demand that they reopen the case?",
      "Patricia Hunter: It was huge, because there was \u2014   it isn't often that you read about a pastor hiring people to firebomb someone's house. ... Because of media pressure, we felt that now is the time where we can go back and say, \"Look at Joanna's case. Reopen it.\"",
      "The Solano County Sheriff's Office did reopen the case in 2014. Remember the churchgoer who called 911 the night Joanna died? His name is Andrew Alvarado. Back then he told authorities that he had played basketball with Pastor Mark Lewis for about six hours. Detectives decided to reinterview him and recorded the call.",
      "DETECTIVE MEHL (phone call): Was anyone else playing basketball with you?",
      "ANDREW ALVARADO: Yeah, a couple other \u2026 teenagers.",
      "This time, investigators learned a new detail.",
      "ANDREW ALVARADO (phone call): I left to go drop them off. I guess I had to go eat dinner or whatever.",
      "He had actually left the church grounds during those six hours to drive the teenagers home, he says, and wasn't sure what the pastor was doing while he was gone. \"48 Hours\" repeatedly reached out to Alvarado but never heard back.",
      "Natalie Morales: So there were gaps of time when he was not with Mark Lewis.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: Right. \u2026 That still does not change the fact that \u2026 the lack of evidence on her body does not show a second person involved in her death.",
      "Mark Lewis was not questioned during the reinvestigation.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He ... \u2026 exercised his constitutional right to have his attorney, who did not allow him to speak to us.",
      "The sheriff's office had another forensic pathologist look at Joanna's case. Dr. Scott Luzi agreed with the original coroner: suicide. The case was closed again. And then in 2015, the county district attorney's office announced its own investigation, which included DNA testing on Joanna's bathrobe sash. The results? Her DNA was found on the sash along with an unknown male \u2014  not Mark Lewis.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was anything done to investigate that further, to \u2026 could it have been anybody else associated with Mark Lewis?",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: That DNA that was collected from there, my understanding is that it was entered into the DNA \u2014 I believe it's called CODIS, the database.",
      "CODIS is the FBI's criminal DNA database.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: It did not come up with a hit.",
      "Captain Harris says the anonymous male DNA has never been identified.",
      "Daryl Snedeker: They should find out whose DNA is on that damn \u2014 on that \u2014 on that robe.",
      "Daryl Snedeker, former church member and retired Solano County deputy sheriff, says things were missed.",
      "Daryl Snedeker:\u00a0Based on what I know today, the totality of the circumstances ... \u2026 I think they did fail that family. And I think if they didn't follow up and find out whose male DNA is on that night robe, that's a catastrophic failure right there.",
      "And a team of experts was about to come forward for the Hunter family, offering help and hope.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: This is a homicide. There is no question.",
      "QUESTIONING THE INVESTIGATION",
      "Dr. Bill Smock is sure that Joanna Hunter was murdered and says he can prove it.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: Every injury will tell you a story if you take the time to analyze it.",
      "In 2023, Smock was hired by the Solano County Sheriff's Department to look at the case. He is a medical doctor, who, by his count, has reviewed thousands of autopsies and examined forensic evidence for police departments across the country.",
      "Smock also has been an expert witness in high profile cases \u2014 including testifying against Derek Chauvin in the 2021 George Floyd murder trial.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: What I've spent 40 years doing is analyzing injuries, reconstructing how injuries occur.",
      "And where the Solano County Sheriff's Department saw a bathrobe sash, a note and a suicide, Smock saw something else: something new.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: There was a braided nylon marine rope three feet from Joanna. \u2026 The murder weapon was there in the room with Joanna. \u2026 When you look at the photos of the mark that was created on her neck, the only thing in that closet that could have created that was the marine rope.",
      "But because he was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, no one outside the sheriff's office saw Smock's report.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: I could not talk to the family \u2026 I could only talk to the lieutenant at Solano County regarding my findings.",
      "Here was everything the Hunters had been looking for ... but they did not even know the rope existed. Or how Smock made his determination. Smock was eventually released from the NDA and was able to show \"48 Hours\" using mannequins and red paint.",
      "Smock says Joanna's neck had two different ligature marks \u2014  one is from the sash and one is from the marine rope.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: We're gonna apply the rope \u2026 and see what type of imprint it creates. \u2026 You'll notice along the edge that there's a distinct fabric imprint, which is the type of fabric imprint we saw on Joanna's neck.",
      "Bill Smock: She was dead \u2014",
      "Natalie Morales:\u00a0 When the bathrobe \u2014",
      "Bill Smock: \u2014 when the bathrobe sash was applied to her neck.",
      "Bill Smock: Joanna's scene was staged. She was killed with a rope, and then to make it look like a suicide, she was hung up by the bathrobe sash after she was already dead.",
      "Casey Gwynn: Domestic violence homicides are the number one staged murders in America.",
      "Casey Gwinn was sure Joanna's case was what he calls a hidden homicide. He and Gael Strack are the co-founders of\u00a0Alliance for HOPE International, an advocacy group for survivors of domestic violence and their families.",

      "Van Dyke's work helped define a generation. He became one of the biggest actors of his era with the eponymous show \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" which ran for five years on CBS.",
      "Early in his career, Van Dyke was quoted as saying he wanted to make films his children could watch. And he got his dream when Walt Disney cast him in \"Mary Poppins\" \u2013 bad cockney accent and all \u2013 alongside the incomparable Julie Andrews. He also appeared in the equally kid-friendly \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\"",

      "Now that he has hit triple digits, Van Dyke said he's gotten some perspective on how he used to play older characters.",

    "summary": "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" said one person with an Affordable Care Act plan that will cost her $1,100 a month starting in January.",
    "story": [
      "Mahwah, New Jersey, resident Tina Jump recently learned that the premium for her Affordable Care Act health insurance is set to surge from about $400 a month to more than $1,100 starting in January \u2014 a nearly threefold increase that she said left her in a state of panic.",
      "Jump, who earns about $72,000 a year as a real estate title officer, already feels financially stretched by the need to cover both her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and the roughly $415 a month she pays for a prescription drug for type 2 diabetes.",
      "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" Jump, 59, told CBS News. Her boss has offered to chip in, but she said the higher premium would still be a major strain on her budget.",
      "\"I'm just going to have to cut back on whatever else I can,\" she added. \"It's just insane. What's going to happen in the next couple of years? Is it going to continue to go up?\"",
      "With two health care bills failing to advance in the Senate on Thursday, the ACA's enhanced premium tax credits \u2014 which 90% of enrollees in the government health program rely on to ease the cost of affording health insurance \u2014 are almost certain to expire on Dec. 31. That will leave Jump and the roughly 22 million other Americans who now qualify for the tax credits facing some tough financial decisions.",
      "Out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for ACA participants who currently receive the subsidies, hiking their annual costs for medical insurance by $1,016, according to health policy group KFF.",
      "\"That's a huge financial burden for most families,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News. \"There's not a lot of people who can afford that.\"",
      "Some households could see even larger spikes. A family of four earning $75,000 per year is likely to see their insurance premiums rise by an additional $3,368 without the tax credits, the group estimated.",
      "Such a drastic increase in ACA costs would arrive as Americans are already struggling to afford groceries, rent, utilities and other essentials, leaving many financially pinched.",
      "\"Tsunami of health costs\"",
      "Some ACA participants told CBS News they are considering going without health insurance next year if their monthly premiums spike. Others are opting for cheaper plans with less coverage, potentially exposing them to higher costs and medical debt, Michelle Sternthal, director of government affairs at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "\"We are going to see a tsunami of health costs increasing\" on January 1, Sternthal said. \"Right now, we're hearing about families facing shocking increases.\"",
      "About 4 million people could drop their health insurance due to the higher ACA premiums, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The rising costs could hit some Americans harder than others, with small business owners and self-employed workers particularly vulnerable, Sternthal noted. Many such workers have turned to the ACA for health coverage because they lack employer-based insurance. About half of adults enrolled in the ACA are small business owners, employed by a company with fewer than 25 workers or are self-employed, according to KFF.",
      "That group includes Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer who grows corn, soybeans and other crops on his family's farm. In testimony before a Dec. 10 Senate hearing, he said the enhanced premium tax credits have allowed him to work full-time on his farm.",
      "\"But unfortunately, my wife and I have learned that in order to keep a similar policy for 2026, our health insurance costs will more than double,\" Lehman told the committee.",
      "Why the subsidies were created",
      "The ACA tax credits were established in 2021, as the U.S. was reeling from the pandemic, to lower households' monthly health plan costs; the subsidies were later extended under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. With the credits set to expire this year, Democratic lawmakers this fall pushed for an extension, a congressional fight that became the main sticking point in the 43-day government shutdown that ended in November.",
      "As part of the deal to end the funding impasse, Republicans vowed to hold a vote on whether to extend the ACA credits by mid-December. The GOP also introduced its own measure to address health care costs, which involved sending funds directly to consumers rather than extending the ACA subsidies.",
      "However, votes on both health care proposals failed in the Senate on Thursday.\u00a0Some lawmakers\u00a0remain optimistic they can strike a bipartisan deal. But any agreement would likely involve reforms to the ACA to address income caps and fraud, along with a gradual phasing out of the enhanced subsidies.",
      "Sternthal of Community Catalyst thinks Congress will face political pressure to address the expired tax credits once once millions of families face sticker shock in January.",
      "In the meantime, Americans who get their health insurance through an employer-based plan could also be impacted by the higher ACA costs, she added.",
      "The reason:\u00a0 If millions drop coverage, as the CBO has predicted, it would likely destabilize the health care market because more people would need to rely on emergency rooms for treatment. Because hospitals, by law, must treat uninsured patients, they typically recoup the costs by hiking treatment costs for others.",
      "\"If you have fewer people covered, that means there will be more uncompensated care, and people will go to the ER \u2014 and that will trickle down into providers and insurance companies,\" Sternthal said. \"It's an economy-wide problem.\"",

    "summary": "Newly released documents are renewing interest in how Jeffrey Epstein amassed his fortune. Here's how he made his money.",
    "story": [
      "Newly released financial documents and photos obtained from the estate of convicted sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0are reigniting interest in the late sex offender's\u00a0wealth and how he amassed it.",
      "Accused of abusing dozens of teenage girls before dying by suicide in a federal prison in 2019, the politically connected multimillionaire never graduated from college, but still wound up socializing with a range of major public figures, from former U.S. presidents and software moguls to members of the British royal family.",
      "The grandson of Jewish immigrants, Epstein was raised in Brooklyn, where he excelled in math and graduated from high school early, briefly attending Cooper Union and New York University, according to published reports over the years by multiple news outlets, some citing court documents.",
      "The photos, released Dec. 12 by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, include images of prominent figures such as former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The photos do not implicate any of those pictured in Epstein's crimes.",
      "Earlier in the month, the same committee had released financial records related to Epstein from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, as well as photos and videos of the financier's private island in the Caribbean.",
      "Epstein was a major client of JPMorgan Chase's private banking division for years before the bank cut ties with him in 2013. Epstein then took his business to Deutsche Bank, where he remained until 2018.",
      "Separately from the Oversight Committee's document release, Congress has passed a bill last month giving the Justice Department 30 days to release all records it has related to Epstein. President Trump signed the bill into law on Nov. 19.",
      "The controversy over Epstein's death has proved politically sensitive\u00a0after Mr. Trump returned to office in January of 2025. The president had earlier urged Republicans to avoid focusing on the Epstein issue, initially describing the effort to release more records as a distraction tactic, but reversed his stance in November.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has been accused of no wrongdoing, had been friends with Epstein but later cut his ties with the businessman.",
      "What was Jeffrey Epstein's net worth?",
      "At the time when the disgraced financier was found dead at 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in August of 2019, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, a filing in his criminal case pegged\u00a0his net worth at roughly $560 million. Epstein's assets also included a number of lavish properties.",
      "Epstein owned a palatial townhouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan worth more than $50 million. He also owned a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, worth about $12 million; a ranch in New Mexico valued at just over $17 million; and an apartment in Paris worth an estimated $8.6 million.",
      "His two private Caribbean islands \u2014 Great St. James and Little St. James \u2014 were together valued at $86 million following his death, but purchased for $60 million in 2023 by billionaire Stephen Deckoff, founder of alternative investment firm Black Diamond Capital Management. Epstein also owned a private jet.",
      "What did Jeffrey Epstein do for a living?",
      "While in his early 20s, Epstein in 1974 started teaching math at The Dalton School, one of New York's most prestigious prep schools, and left in 1976, with an administrator\u00a0telling\u00a0the New York Times he'd dismissed Epstein for poor performance.",
      "But the stint at Dalton had him tutoring the son of Bear Stearns CEO Alan Greenberg, which led to a job at the investment bank before it collapsed in 2008 following the housing crash. Epstein then became a money manager for billionaires including Les Wexner, founder and CEO of L Brands, and Apollo Global Management Chairman Leon Black. Black paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning services, according to the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "A law firm retained by Apollo's board to review Black's dealings with Epstein cleared Black, who stepped down as chairman and CEO of the private equity firm in 2021, of any possible wrongdoing.",
      "Black in July of 2023 agreed to pay $62.5 million to the U.S. Virgin Islands to be released from any potential claims arising from the territory's probe into Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The four-page settlement stipulated that it didn't constitute an \"admission of liability\" by Black, according to the New York Times.",
      "For more than a decade, Epstein was\u00a0Wexner's personal money manager\u00a0and business adviser, making hundreds of millions of dollars managing Wexner's billions.",
      "\"Epstein's crimes are abhorrent, and we applaud every effort to bring justice to those harmed,\" L Brands told CBS MoneyWatch in 2019.",
      "Wexner said in an email to employees at the time that he regretted he ever \"crossed paths\" with Epstein. \"When Mr. Epstein was my personal money manager, he was involved in many aspects of my financial life,\" the email stated. \"But let me assure you that I was NEVER aware of the illegal activity charged in the indictment.\"",
      "Where else did Epstein get his money?",
      "JPMorgan Chase loaned Epstein money and regularly let him withdraw large sums of cash from 1998 through August 2013, according to a class-action lawsuit settled by the nation's largest bank in 2023 for a reported $290 million. The money was slated to go to almost 200 Epstein victims, according to the New York Times.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch in June of 2023, JPMorgan called Epstein's behavior \"monstrous,\" and said it regretted any association with the disgraced financier.",
      "Epstein also had financial dealings with Deutsche Bank, which in May 2023 agreed to pay $75 million to settle a lawsuit alleging the German bank \"knowingly benefited\" from his sex trafficking and profited from doing business with him.",
      "Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the settlement. In 2020, it acknowledged its \"error of onboarding Epstein in 2013 and the weaknesses in our processes.\"",
      "In October, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, pointed to\u00a0$1.5 billion in suspicious financial transactions that had been flagged by the banks and were tied to Epstein's alleged sex trafficking crimes. The same month, Bank of America was sued by one of Epstein's victims, who alleged the bank facilitated and also benefited from his alleged crimes.",
      "Bank of America had no comment on the lawsuit.",
      "For how much did he buy his islands?",
      "Epstein owned two neighboring islands. He paid $7.95 million in 1998 for the 75-acre Little St. James, according to the New York Post and New York Magazine. In 2016, Epstein paid more than $20 million for the 165-acre Great St. James, according to CNBC and the Wall Street Journal.",

      "The unemployment rate in November rose to 4.6%, the highest level since September 2021.",
      "The November employment report offers a fresh picture of the labor market after a six-week blackout in official data caused by the recent\u00a0government shutdown. The data suggests that employers in industries ranging from manufacturing to hospitality are hitting the pause button on hiring amid concerns about economic growth and tariff costs, some economists noted.",
      "\"Businesses are not hiring as they adjust to tariffs, uncertain conditions and AI. The result is about 700,000 more unemployed Americans than there were a year ago,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 40,000 jobs in November, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The Labor Department on Tuesday also released partial employment data from October, which shows a loss of 105,000 jobs that month.",
      "The drag on October employment was driven by a steep loss in the federal workforce, which shed 162,000 jobs that month. The decline is due to a wave of deferred resignations starting to show up in the payroll data, according to Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.",
      "Job growth for August and September was also revised down by a collective 33,000.",
      "The government's official employment data for October and November had been delayed due to the 43-day government shutdown, which ended in last month.",
      "In the absence of federal data, economists at the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street had been monitoring alternative sources, which have signaled ongoing headwinds in the labor market. For instance, ADP earlier this month said private-sector employers in the U.S. cut 32,000 jobs in November, while outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas has tracked more than 1.1 million layoffs so far this year.",
      "Economic uncertainty has led workers to stay put and employers to pull back on hiring, creating a difficult situation for job seekers, especially those early in their careers.",
      "The labor market is slowly cooling, Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John C. Williams said in a\u00a0speech\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"I should emphasize that this has been an ongoing, gradual process, without signs of a sharp rise in layoffs or other indications of rapid deterioration,\" Williams said. But, he added, \"Job growth has been anemic.\"",

      "The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% in November \u2014 the highest since September 2021 \u2014 as more people entered the labor force to look for jobs, according to Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge.",
      "While the numbers offer a glimpse into the labor market during the government shutdown, experts say investors and government officials will likely view the data with some skepticism, given questions about the accuracy and completeness of data collection following the shutdown.",
      "Indeed, the Federal Reserve may not place much emphasis on the November numbers at its January rate-setting meeting because of the data disruption, said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory,\" she said in an email.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0said the central bank would likely view the October and November data with a \"somewhat skeptical eye,\" given the data may be distorted.",

Hyundai and Kia must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with engine immobilizers, as well as pay up to $4.5 million of restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.",
      "The settlement was reached by 35 states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The vehicles eligible for fixes date as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. About 9 million eligible vehicles were sold nationwide.",

    "story": [
      "FIFA slashed the price of some World Cup tickets for teams' most loyal fans following a global backlash and some will get $60 seats for the final instead of being asked to pay $4,185.",
      "FIFA said Tuesday that $60 tickets will be made available for every game at the tournament in North America, going to the national federations whose teams are playing. Those federations decide how to distribute them to loyal fans who have attended previous games at home and on the road.",
      "The number of $60 tickets for each game is likely to be in the hundreds, rather than thousands, in what FIFA is now calling a \"Supporter Entry Tier\" price category.",
      "FIFA did not specify exactly why it so dramatically changed strategy, but said the lower prices are \"designed to further support travelling fans following their national teams across the tournament.\"",
      "The World Cup in North America will be the first edition that features 48 teams \u2014 up from 32 \u2014 and is expected to earn FIFA at least $10 billion in revenue. Teams will play in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",
      "But fans worldwide reacted with shock and anger last week on seeing FIFA's ticketing plans that gave participating teams no tickets in the lowest-priced category.",
      "The cheapest prices ranged from $120 to $265 for group-stage games that did not involve the three co-hosting countries.",
      "FIFA had set those prices despite the co-hosts having pledged eight years ago \u2014 when they were bidding for the tournament \u2014 that hundreds of thousands of $21 tickets would be made available.",
      "Criticism from fans, especially in Europe, had been increasing for several months over plans for \"dynamic pricing\" plus extra fees on a FIFA-run resale platform \u2014 both features which are common in the U.S. entertainment industry but not to soccer fans worldwide.",
      "Fan anger intensified last week when it became clear loyal supporters would have no access to the cheapest category tickets and that fans who wanted to reserve a ticket for all of their team's potential games \u2014 through the final \u2014 would not get refunded until after the tournament.",
      "In another climbdown Tuesday, FIFA said it would waive its administrative fees when refunds are made after the July 19 final.",
      "The 12 four-team groups that make up the World Cup\u00a0draw were selected earlier in December. The United States will play in Group D, along with Paraguay, Australia and the winner of UEFA playoff C. The teams there are Turkey, Romania, Slovakia, and Kosovo. The playoff games will be decided in March 2026.",
      "The World Cup games will begin on June 11, with a game between Mexico and South Africa in Mexico City and South Korea playing the winner of UEFA playoff D in Guadalajara. The World Cup final will be held in New Jersey on July 19.",

    "summary": "The family of Tony Hsieh, who died at 46, is disputing a will that emerged in 2025, allegedly from a Pakistani man with no ties to the businessman.",
    "story": [
      "The family of the late Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh claims a mysterious will that surfaced this year for the executive's $500 million fortune is a \"sham\" and is asking a court to invalidate the document.",
      "The battle over the will comes five years after Hseih's\u00a0death at age 46 from complications due to smoke inhalation from a house fire. After his death, which was ruled accidental, his family said Hsieh had died\u00a0without leaving a will.",
      "Earlier this year, however, a man purportedly named Kashif Singh claimed he had found Hsieh's will among his late grandfather's possessions. Singh claimed that his grandfather, Pir Muhammad, and Hsieh were \"dear friends,\" although there's no evidence that the two knew each other, according to the Dec. 15\u00a0court filing, published by Las Vegas' KSNV-TV.",
      "Attorneys for Hsieh's family didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Hsieh, a Harvard University graduate, joined Zappos\u2014 then called ShoeSite.com \u2014 in 1999. Zappos was sold to Amazon for $1.2 billion in 2009, and Hsieh remained with the e-commerce company until he retired in 2020.",
      "Reasons for suspicion",
      "The court filing asks that the will be ruled a forgery, citing evidence that Hsieh's supposed signature is fake and that he had no known connection to Muhammad. According to the family's lawsuit, the will nominates two attorneys, who allegedly did not know Hsieh, to serve as his co-executors and oversee his estate.",
      "\"Scams come in all shapes and sizes,\" the Hsieh family's suit alleges. \"In this case, the scam is in the form of a document being touted as the purported will of Anthony 'Tony' Hsieh.\"",
      "It added, \"The document was allegedly found by a complete stranger, many years after Tony's death, in the possession of the stranger's deceased grandfather, Pir Muhammad, a 91-year-old Pakistani man with no known ties to Tony.\"",
      "The filing also notes that the document includes misspellings of Hsieh's name.",
      "The Hsieh family hired an expert in detecting counterfeits to examine Hsieh's purported signatures on the will, the filing notes. The expert concluded there were \"numerous unexplained differences\" compared with Hsieh's known handwriting, leading him to conclude the will was forged.",
      "Hsieh's family also claims that there's no evidence the businessman attended the will's signing, which supposedly occurred in March 2015, given that none of his calendars, emails and other documentation noted such an event.",
      "It also claims that the five people who allegedly witnessed Hsieh signing the will cannot be located, and that \"their contact information has been fabricated, and likely, they do not exist in real life.\"",

      "Four of the nation's top retail stores failed to promptly pull contaminated infant formula tied to a dangerous botulism outbreak from their shelves, federal health officials said in warning letters posted Monday.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration sent letters to leaders at Walmart, Target, Kroger and Albertsons saying the companies continued to sell ByHeart infant formula for days or weeks, despite a Nov. 11 recall of all products in the outbreak that has sickened more than 50 babies in 19 states.",
      "\"As a participant in the supply chain, your firm should take prompt and effective action when notified of a product recall,\" FDA officials said in warning letters sent to the companies on Dec. 12 and posted online Monday.",
      "The formula was found at Target stores in 20 states \"well after the recall was initiated,\" one letter said. In addition, it was sold at a Target store in New Hampshire on Nov. 16, despite an electronic block on the product's sales code, the FDA noted. And at a Target store in Arkansas, single-serve packs of ByHeart formula were promoted with a \"Sale!\" sign and a $2 discount from Nov. 16 to Nov. 22.",
      "Information from state and local health officials said ByHeart formula was found at Walmart stores in 21 states from Nov. 12 to Nov. 26. The formula was found in Albertsons stores in 11 states from Nov. 12 to Nov. 19, and at Kroger stores in 10 states from Nov. 12 to Nov. 19.",
      "In addition, the companies failed to provide FDA with evidence that corrective actions have been put in place, despite multiple requests, the agency said. The companies have 15 working days to respond to the letters.",
      "Walmart officials said in a statement that no ByHeart formula was sold after cash registers were blocked from selling the formula following the recall.",
      "\"We moved swiftly to issue a sales restriction and removed this product from our impacted stores and clubs and online,\" a company spokesperson said in an email. \"We take all reports of inaction seriously and will respond to the letter.\"",
      "Albertsons officials said the company worked closely with suppliers and regulators to identify and remove the products and communicate to customers.",
      "\"ByHeart infant formula products have been removed from our store shelves,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Target and Kroger for comment.",
      "The FDA says it hasn't received reports of recalled formula being found on store shelves since Nov.\u00a026, 2025.",
      "All babies in the outbreak have been hospitalized and treated with an IV medication to stop the progress of the disease. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded the outbreak to include all babies treated for botulism after consuming ByHeart formula since it was first produced in 2023.",
      "Steven Mandernach, executive director at the Association of Food and Drug Officials, said the FDA itself was slow to distribute information about the recall with state and local food safety officials. The agency didn't fully share product lists until Nov. 14, nearly a week after the initial recall of two lots of ByHeart formula on Nov. 8.",
      "He said it was \"disappointing\" in an outbreak involving the sole source of nutrition for vulnerable infants.",

      "Peters and Sarandos also expressed optimism that Netflix's proposed $83 billion purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV and film assets will win government regulatory approval. Warner is home to the storied movie studio that created hits like \"Barbie\" and popular franchises such as \"The Hobbit\" and \"Harry Potter.\"",
      "The letter comes as Netflix faces a competing bid from Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News), which on December 8 launched a hostile bid to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery for roughly $108 billion. Unlike Netflix, Paramount is also offering to buy Warner's cable brands, which include CNN, Discovery Channel, HBO, TBS and TNT.",
      "Netflix declined further comment.",
      "The company's offer has drawn criticism from lawmakers including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, who said in a statement earlier this month that a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal would \"create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market.\"",
      "\"We expect the regulatory review process to focus on the market share within the larger television landscape, but also likely identify how important the production of new content is for the potential combined players when determining the ultimate power the new entity would hold in Hollywood and across the U.S.,\" analysts with investment advisory firrm MoffettNathanson said in a report. \"Similarly, we would expect the European regulators to focus on market power for production along with streaming subscriber market share.\"",

    "summary": "The Made in America Holiday Gift Guide, promoting products made in the U.S., includes more than 150 companies from all 50 states. For small business owners, being included in this year's gift guide feels close to a Christmas miracle.",
    "story": [
      "'Tis the season for holiday gift guides. You know, the ones that suggest 31 fish gifts for your fish-obsessed friends. They're everywhere this time of year, though nowhere quite as surprising as a seemingly run-of-the-mill office in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"I will candidly admit that when we started this a dozen years ago, I thought it was a fun thing to do,\" said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a trade advocacy and lobbying group that works to strengthen manufacturing in the U.S. \"It's just a break from talking about tariffs and policy and regulation. And so, the gift guide was kind of like a whimsical thing. It's grown into something much larger than that.\"",
      "Unlike other holiday gift guides, theirs features only products made in America, from cowboy hat racks made in Wyoming, to giant stuffed animals from South Carolina. The list includes more than 150 companies from all 50 states.",
      "Made in America Holiday Gift Guide (from the Alliance for American Manufacturing)",
      "Made in America Holiday Gift Guide (from the Alliance for American Manufacturing)",
      "And it's a very big deal for the companies included. \"It can be very uplifting to some of these companies, because some are like, how did you find us?\" Paul laughed.",
      "As a proud Marylander, Shelby Blondell dreamed of a better way to dig into the state's official unofficial cuisine. The result? The Sheller. Her small business, in a quiet Baltimore suburb, is a labor of love that is keeping manufacturing close to home.",
      "\"All along, I even had a lot of people when I was, you know, creating it saying like, 'You should just be making this overseas, you'll make so much more money,'\" Blondell said. \"And money's great. We need money to live. But you know, the cost of what that would've been didn't seem to outweigh kind of that value in my mind of wanting to have this be made here.\"",
      "Value like partnering with a local fabricator that uses American steel, which means the Sheller has avoided the sting of recent tariffs. \"If I would've been hit with tariffs of making this overseas somewhere right now, I don't know that I could still be in business,\" Blondell said.",
      "This gift guide knows that your pets, of course, deserve stocking stuffers as well, and it suggests\u00a0Cycle Dog\u00a0in Portland, Oregon. For 16 years, founder Lynette Fidrych and her team have been recycling bicycle tire inner tubes to make leashes and collars. And yes, this collar does have a bottle opener. \"Portland is known for biking, beer, sustainability, and dogs,\" Fidrych laughed.",
      "A former Nike employee, Fidrych now employs about 30 workers at her Portland factory. \"Made in America\" means higher labor cost, and sometimes higher price tags. But to her, it also means higher quality. \"We make a product and we put it in the dog run and have a hundred dogs play with it,\" she said. \"And so, when we sell this toy, we're like, yeah, it's gonna last.",
      "\"Most people assume that plush toys are made in China, even my retailers,\" she said. \"And I'm like, 'No, we hand-make these here in the U.S. There's a flag on the tag.\"",
      "Meanwhile, back in D.C., Scott Paul is actually pretty easy to shop for: his shirt, made in New Jersey; his belt, made out of American leather; his shoes, from Meridian, Mississippi.",
      "For those of us still scrambling for a last-minute gift, Paul says to look close to home, and to start with the guide that brings not just holiday cheer, but maybe a little American pride.",
      "\"No one needs to say, 'Everything I have to own or buy has to be made in the United States'; that doesn't do anybody any favors, and it's really hard to pull off,\" he said. However, \"If you can't find one thing that looks really cool and is also affordable on our gift guide, I would be shocked. Try it once, the odds are you're gonna come back and want more.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-the-prospects-for-laid-off-workers/",
    "published": "Sun, 14 Dec 2025 09:55:39 -0500",
    "summary": "In 2025, more than 1.1 million Americans were laid off from their jobs, the most since the COVID pandemic, even as corporate profits remain high. Business experts discuss the reasons why companies resort to layoffs.",
    "story": [
      "For the last few weeks, Heidi Roberts' full-time job has been trying to find one. \"I literally apply at jobs from 8:00 a.m. 'til five o'clock every day,\" she said. \"And I think I've done about 56 to 60 jobs already. And I've only had seven callbacks. So, it's just been really disheartening.\"",
      "She's been at it every day since October, when she was laid off from a financial company in Knoxville, Tennessee.",
      "She said she didn't see it coming: \"I had no idea, none at all,\" she said. \"I never thought it would be me. It's just hard getting up in the morning sometimes, 'cause you really gotta pump yourself up to do it. And I keep thinking, 'Okay, this next interview, hopefully it's gonna go well.'\"",
      "Roberts' Christmas wish is not unusual this year. In 2025, more than 1.1 million Americans have been laid off, the most since the 2020 COVID pandemic (according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas). The layoffs have hit numerous industries and companies of all sizes (including our own parent company, Paramount Skydance). The largest cuts came from the federal government (followed by technology, warehouses and retail), with tens of thousands of cuts each.",
      "\"Those are numbers that we haven't seen outside of recessionary periods like COVID or the Great Recession in 2008,\" said Andrew Challenger, a senior vice president at research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks the job market. \"It is a concerning stat, and everybody in the world is really paying close attention to it.\"",
      "Asked why so many companies today are almost simultaneously cutting down on the number of workers, Challenger replied, \"I'd say there's a couple stories that are going on simultaneously. One is that companies really over-hired in 2022 and 2023; we're seeing some economic headwinds, increased prices. And then the third piece is, we've really started to see companies discuss artificial intelligence as a reason why they're conducting job cuts at their companies.\"",
      "Layoffs \"perceived positively by the markets\"",
      "In the past companies laid off workers during periods of struggle. But Annie Lowrey, a staff writer with The Atlantic, says that's not what is happening now: \"Corporate profits are very, very high,\" she said. \"And if you look actually at businesses at how much their CEOs are making, it's just an enormous, enormous share. And I think that it reflects this divergence between the 1% and the 99%.\"",
      "Lowrey says most layoffs aren't happening because companies are in the red, but because the future of the economy looks a bit gray: \"Business leaders often like to blame uncertainty stemming from Washington. In this case, I think that they might actually really have a case. That might be the tariffs and the trade war, that might be the high cost of borrowing even if interest rates are coming down. Again, none of these in and of itself is enough to tip the massive and still quite vibrant American economy into a recession. But it's really leading to a pause that I think has now led to a freeze on hiring, and is now leading to more companies choosing to lay workers off.\"",
      "And then there's the question about the impact of artificial intelligence. According to a recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AI already has the ability to replace nearly 12% of the labor market.",
      "\"The reality is, the tech is there; implementing and the practical application of that technology is still a ways away,\" said Jason Leverant, president of the national staffing company AtWork. He says when it comes to AI, at this point it's about keeping shareholders happy.",
      "\"If I'm a publicly traded firm, or otherwise, and I want to be perceived as forward thinking, I'm adopting cutting edge technology \u2013 'Hey, we're leveraging AI, we're cutting expenses, we're cutting our overhead \u2026 unfortunately, that has to deal with layoffs,'\" Leverant said. \"That sells really well. It's really, unfortunately, perceived positively by the markets.\"",
      "But while AI gets a lot of attention, the fact is it ranks sixth in reasons for layoffs, behind the overall economy and restructuring.",
      "\"It's a failure of your business model\"",
      "For more than 50 years, Bob Chapman has been at the helm of Barry-Wehmiller, a global supplier of manufacturing technology. Founded in 1885, the company now makes nearly $4 billion in annual revenue, and has 12,000 employees.",
      "Asked his response to companies who says their layoffs are necessary, Chapman replied, \"First of all, I'd say in general, it's a failure of leadership. If your business model fails, your market changes, the challenges change, and you don't adapt to it or anticipate it, you're gonna hurt people, okay? So, it's a failure of your business model.\"",
      "Chapman says layoffs should only be a last resort: \"We dehumanize this by calling it layoffs, right-sizing, downsizing. We're actually destroying people's lives.\"",
      "I asked, \"But why should you, as a CEO, concern yourself with what happens beyond the walls of this plant?\"",
      "\"Because I care about people, okay?\" Chapman replied. \"How can you run a company and not care about the people that are put in your span of care? And when you treat them as functions, you're saying they don't matter, it's just an economic transaction. And it is not just an economic transaction.\"",
      "And last week, more news, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell lowering interest rates by a quarter-percentage point, motivated by a vulnerable job market. Powell said, \"Gradual cooling of the labor market has continued. Unemployment is up three tenths.\"",
      "Instead of adding jobs, Powell says we could be losing as many as 20,000 each month. This all has many Americans feeling less than jolly this holiday season, with layoffs expected to continue into the New Year.",
      "But back in Knoxville, some good news. A few days ago, shortly after our visit, Heidi Roberts received the #1 item on her Christmas list: a new job. \"I start January the 5th,\" she said. \"So, New Year, new me, so I'm excited!\"",
      "It meant a pay cut, but she says these days any job feels like a gift.",
      "With many Americans still looking for work, what would she say to those folks now? \"I would say, keep on moving. Keep on pushing, do not give up, and just believe,\" Roberts said. \"You will find the company. Just keep on believing, and pray. I'm very blessed.\"",

      "The move would end a yearslong legal battle by past Justice Departments to preserve the convictions, which are currently caught in a slate of appeals.",
      "In a\u00a0letter dated Tuesday\u00a0to U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen, who oversaw the case, U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York Joseph Nocella said the charges against Lopez and Full Play Group, the Argentine sports media rights company involved in the scandal, should be dismissed \"in the interests of justice.\"",
      "In a Supreme Court filing relating to Lopez's ongoing appeal to the high court filed Tuesday, the Solicitor General's Office wrote that dismissal of the case is warranted for the same reason, and that the court should hear Lopez's appeal, reverse an appeals court decision that reinstated the conviction, and return the case to a New York federal judge who could dismiss the case.",
      "Lopez was convicted in 2023 by a jury in Brooklyn on charges of money laundering and wire fraud conspiracies. Full Play was convicted of two additional counts of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering relating to the World Cup and Copa America.",
      "Earlier this year, a federal appeals court ordered the reinstatement of the convictions of Lopez and Full Play after Chen granted a motion for acquittal in 2024. The Biden-era Justice Department appealed that ruling.",

    "summary": "A Temple University law professor alleges in a suit that he breathed in contaminated air on a Boeing craft, leaving him physically impaired.",
    "story": [
      "A law professor who flew on a Boeing 737 aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines last year is suing the airplane manufacturer, alleging he suffered serious health issues after being exposed to toxic fumes that seeped into the plane's cabin.",
      "The plaintiff, Philadelphia resident Jonathan Harris, alleges in the suit that the aircraft cabin air became contaminated during an August 2024 flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles, leading to his breathing in a mix of dangerous chemicals.",
      "Fumes or smoke entering aircraft cabins is a known problem in aviation. That can occur when the fresh air from a plane's engines is filtered through the air conditioner employed to supply air to passengers. A faulty engine seal can cause oil and other potentially toxic particles to be released in the cabin.",
      "Such events take place more than three times a day, according to a recent CBS News review of Federal Aviation Administration incident reports.",
      "Boeing's 787 aircraft is the only commercial jetliner that does not draw air through the aircraft's engine. All other commercial jets have an air supply system that can expose cabins to contamination with heated jet engine oil, hydraulic fluid and jet fuel, according to Harris's suit.",
      "When Harris's Delta landed in California, passengers sat on the runway for about 45 minutes before disembarking, according to the lawsuit. During this time, the cabin was filled with fumes that Harris described as smelling like \"dirty socks.\"",
      "\"As a result of being exposed to this contaminated air event, plaintiff became nauseous and vomited into a plastic bag while still seated on the subject aircraft,\" the suit alleges. \"Another passenger also vomited into a bag provided by a flight attendant. At one point, plaintiff remembers the captain making an announcement over the intercom apologizing for the smell.\"",
      "Harris has since developed symptoms as a result of inhaling the contaminated cabin air, his lawsuit alleges. That lead to a range of health problems, including dizziness, confusion, nausea, muscle pain, vertigo, memory loss and other conditions, according to the complaint. Harris also alleges he suffered mental anguish, depression and anxiety, along with lost wages.",
      "Harris, an associate law professor at Temple University, is suing Arlington, Virginia-based Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, for $40 million, plus attorneys' fees. The suit was filed in Arlington County, Virginia, circuit court.",
      "Boeing and Delta both declined to comment on the lawsuit.",
      "In September, Delta said it would replace auxiliary power units, a type of engine, on 300 of its Airbus A320 aircraft to address toxic fume incidents.",

    "summary": "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" said one person with an Affordable Care Act plan that will cost her $1,100 a month starting in January.",
    "story": [
      "Mahwah, New Jersey, resident Tina Jump recently learned that the premium for her Affordable Care Act health insurance is set to surge from about $400 a month to more than $1,100 starting in January \u2014 a nearly threefold increase that she said left her in a state of panic.",
      "Jump, who earns about $72,000 a year as a real estate title officer, already feels financially stretched by the need to cover both her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and the roughly $415 a month she pays for a prescription drug for type 2 diabetes.",
      "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" Jump, 59, told CBS News. Her boss has offered to chip in, but she said the higher premium would still be a major strain on her budget.",
      "\"I'm just going to have to cut back on whatever else I can,\" she added. \"It's just insane. What's going to happen in the next couple of years? Is it going to continue to go up?\"",
      "With two health care bills failing to advance in the Senate on Thursday, the ACA's enhanced premium tax credits \u2014 which 90% of enrollees in the government health program rely on to ease the cost of affording health insurance \u2014 are almost certain to expire on Dec. 31. That will leave Jump and the roughly 22 million other Americans who now qualify for the tax credits facing some tough financial decisions.",
      "Out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for ACA participants who currently receive the subsidies, hiking their annual costs for medical insurance by $1,016, according to health policy group KFF.",
      "\"That's a huge financial burden for most families,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News. \"There's not a lot of people who can afford that.\"",
      "Some households could see even larger spikes. A family of four earning $75,000 per year is likely to see their insurance premiums rise by an additional $3,368 without the tax credits, the group estimated.",
      "Such a drastic increase in ACA costs would arrive as Americans are already struggling to afford groceries, rent, utilities and other essentials, leaving many financially pinched.",
      "\"Tsunami of health costs\"",
      "Some ACA participants told CBS News they are considering going without health insurance next year if their monthly premiums spike. Others are opting for cheaper plans with less coverage, potentially exposing them to higher costs and medical debt, Michelle Sternthal, director of government affairs at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "\"We are going to see a tsunami of health costs increasing\" on January 1, Sternthal said. \"Right now, we're hearing about families facing shocking increases.\"",
      "About 4 million people could drop their health insurance due to the higher ACA premiums, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The rising costs could hit some Americans harder than others, with small business owners and self-employed workers particularly vulnerable, Sternthal noted. Many such workers have turned to the ACA for health coverage because they lack employer-based insurance. About half of adults enrolled in the ACA are small business owners, employed by a company with fewer than 25 workers or are self-employed, according to KFF.",
      "That group includes Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer who grows corn, soybeans and other crops on his family's farm. In testimony before a Dec. 10 Senate hearing, he said the enhanced premium tax credits have allowed him to work full-time on his farm.",
      "\"But unfortunately, my wife and I have learned that in order to keep a similar policy for 2026, our health insurance costs will more than double,\" Lehman told the committee.",
      "Why the subsidies were created",
      "The ACA tax credits were established in 2021, as the U.S. was reeling from the pandemic, to lower households' monthly health plan costs; the subsidies were later extended under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. With the credits set to expire this year, Democratic lawmakers this fall pushed for an extension, a congressional fight that became the main sticking point in the 43-day government shutdown that ended in November.",
      "As part of the deal to end the funding impasse, Republicans vowed to hold a vote on whether to extend the ACA credits by mid-December. The GOP also introduced its own measure to address health care costs, which involved sending funds directly to consumers rather than extending the ACA subsidies.",
      "However, votes on both health care proposals failed in the Senate on Thursday.\u00a0Some lawmakers\u00a0remain optimistic they can strike a bipartisan deal. But any agreement would likely involve reforms to the ACA to address income caps and fraud, along with a gradual phasing out of the enhanced subsidies.",
      "Sternthal of Community Catalyst thinks Congress will face political pressure to address the expired tax credits once once millions of families face sticker shock in January.",
      "In the meantime, Americans who get their health insurance through an employer-based plan could also be impacted by the higher ACA costs, she added.",
      "The reason:\u00a0 If millions drop coverage, as the CBO has predicted, it would likely destabilize the health care market because more people would need to rely on emergency rooms for treatment. Because hospitals, by law, must treat uninsured patients, they typically recoup the costs by hiking treatment costs for others.",
      "\"If you have fewer people covered, that means there will be more uncompensated care, and people will go to the ER \u2014 and that will trickle down into providers and insurance companies,\" Sternthal said. \"It's an economy-wide problem.\"",

    "summary": "A ruling striking down emergency levies could force the federal government to return most of the tariff revenue it has collected this year, according to Penn Wharton.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government could owe businesses as much as $168 billion if the Supreme Court rules that the Trump administration improperly invoked a federal emergency powers law earlier this year in hitting dozens of countries with new tariffs, according to a recent analysis.",
      "Through December 5, the U.S. government has collected $259 billion in tariff revenue, the nonpartisan research initiative found. But a ruling by the high court that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the country-specific tariffs could force the government to offer refunds to importers, said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",
      "In a November hearing on the case,\u00a0the Supreme Court seemed divided\u00a0over whether Mr. Trump had the legal authority to impose sweeping levies under IEEPA. Several justices appeared skeptical, noting that IEEPA does not mention the word \"tariff\" and that no president has ever relied on the act to justify broad-based tariffs on other nations.",
      "The Trump administration could likely maintain similar\u00a0tariff rates by drawing on other laws\u00a0if the IEEPA tariffs are struck down, although those statutes have more restrictions, according to legal experts.",
      "For example, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 also authorizes the president to apply country-based tariffs if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another nation is engaging in unfair trade practices.",
      "Despite the prospects of a large government refund for importers, Smetters thinks that striking down the tariffs would ultimately spur U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Tariffs are one of the least efficient ways of raising revenue,\" he told CBS News, adding that tariffs make companies less productive because they have to pay more for imported parts and products.",
      "\"The government would have to come up with that money, so the federal debt would go up a little bit. But if these tariffs really were to go away, it would make U.S. companies more attractive to invest in,\" Smetters added.",
      "The Trump administration says tariffs are a key tool for energizing the U.S. manufacturing sector, boosting job growth, reducing the nation's trade deficit and generating federal revenue.",
      "\"The economic and national security consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump's lawful tariffs are enormous. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court's speedy and proper resolution of this matter,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Too little, too late?",
      "As of November 17, the overall effective tariff rate in the U.S. was 16.8%, the highest since 1935,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Yale Budget Lab. That compares with 2.4% in January before Mr. Trump returned to office.",
      "As a result, some small businesses say a tariff refund wouldn't offset the damage they say has been caused by sharply higher import duties.",
      "\"The money would go back to suppliers that incurred the tariffs. We are the end customer, and we continue to get the short end of the stick,\" Trinita Rhodes, the owner of Beauty Supply Refresh in Florissant, Missouri, said Wednesday in a media call hosted by Tariffs Cost US, an advocacy group that opposes Mr. Trump's levies.",
      "Rachel Lutz, owner of a women's clothing boutique, The Peacock Room, in Detroit, said a potential tariff refund would come too late.",
      "\"Small businesses don't have more than a 30-day cash reserve,\" he said in the Tariffs Cost US call. \"Reimbursement at this point doesn't make up for the disruption of staff cuts or hiring we could have made. The damage has already been done.\"",
      "Consumers are also feeling the impact of tariffs, research shows. Between February and November, U.S. households paid an average of $1,197.50 in tariffs, totaling nearly $160 billion, according to a\u00a0report this month from Democrats on the U.S. Congressional Joint Economic Committee.",
      "\"While President Trump promised that he would lower costs, this report shows that his tariffs have done nothing but drive prices even higher for families,\" Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire and ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement Thursday. \"At a time when both parties should be working together to lower costs, the President's tax on American families is simply making things more expensive.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could pursue alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court this week struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners, according to experts.",
      "At risk is much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs as a way to secure better terms of trade, boost the U.S. manufacturing sector and generate what he claims could be trillions in new federal revenue. For now, Mr. Trump's tariffs remain in place after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision,\u00a0reinstating the levies.",
      "If the trade court's ruling is ultimately upheld, Mr. Trump has other tools for pursuing his trade agenda, although they don't provide the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he tapped to authorize trade duties on almost every foreign nation.",
      "\"He would have a couple other authorities. However, they are not nearly as broad and aggressive as the IEEPA tariffs,\" said Clark Packard, a research fellow in the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy institute. \"There are so many checks and administrative aspects to them that they are slower.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his tariffs on April 2 in an initiative he referred to as\u00a0\"Liberation Day.\" At the time, the president described trade deficits with other nations as \"a national emergency,\" which he said gave him the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "But a lawsuit filed by five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states challenged the president's use of the emergency powers law, and on Wednesday the Court of International Trade\u00a0blocked the tariffs.",
      "President will use \"tools at his disposal\"",
      "As the legal process plays out, Trump administration officials say the president is considering using other tools at his disposal to advance his trade policies.",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Desai added, \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "Here are the other options Mr. Trump could turn to, and how he could use them, according to policy experts.",
      "Section 232 tariffs of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962",
      "Experts say Mr. Trump could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Mr. Trump already has tariffs in place on steel, aluminum and auto imports based on this regulation.",
      "There's a catch, though. The statute requires the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to investigate and confirm that imports \"threaten to impair\" U.S. national security before the president can invoke Section 232. An investigation can take up to 270 days, which could slow down Mr. Trump's timeline for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It has to withstand legal scrutiny, it can't just be done over the weekend,\" Packard said.",
      "Additionally, under Section 232, tariffs can only be applied to specific sectors if the trade around those imports threaten national security, rather than the broad approach that Mr. Trump used with IEEPA.",
      "\"Once the report is issued, the president has wide discretion, but he has to target individual sectors of product, like steel and aluminum,\" Packard said. \"They can't be blanket, across-the-board tariffs.\"",
      "Some experts think Mr. Trump is likely to turn to this statute to further his tariff agenda.",
      "\"In our view, the administration will prepare the groundwork for a more surgical increase in tariffs beginning this summer following Section 232 trade investigations into strategic industries like pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, copper and semiconductors,\" Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a research note.",
      "He added, \"These sectors were initially excluded from the 10% baseline tariff because President Trump had intended to levy separate tariffs to reduce the U.S.'s reliance on foreign producers of these products by encouraging domestic production.\"",
      "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Mr. Trump could also draw on the Trade Act of 1974 to impose new tariffs. Section 301 of that law allows the U.S. president to apply country-based tariffs at a rate of his choosing if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another country is engaging in unfair foreign trade practices.",
      "There are limitations, however. The law can't be applied universally to all imports from foreign nations.",
      "\"There has to be justification for it, so President Trump can't unilaterally decide to impose broad-based tariffs on the entire world,\" Angela Santos, a partner and customs practice leader at law firm ArentFox Schiff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is designed to address large trade deficits with other nations, to impose tariffs of up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days.",
      "\"I could see this being employed very easily,\" Santos said. \"It seems like the easiest way to impose tariffs, particularly because most trade partners have large deficits with the U.S.\"",
      "Applying tariffs under Section 122 wouldn't require an investigation, meaning Mr. Trump could quickly use it to assess a broad-based import duty.",
      "\"The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report this week.",
      "The tariffs could be in effect \"within days if deemed necessary,\" Goldman Sachs said.",
      "Congressional action would be needed to extend the tariffs after 150 days.",

      "Under Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the president can impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. The law defines discrimination as when a trading partner's laws, import duties, regulations or other restrictions place the U.S. at a disadvantage.",

    "summary": "President Trump has signed an executive order to block states from regulating artificial intelligence.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at restricting states from crafting their own regulations for artificial intelligence, saying the burgeoning industry is at risk of being stifled by a patchwork of onerous rules while in a battle with Chinese competitors for supremacy.",
      "Members of Congress from both parties, as well as civil liberties and consumer rights groups, have pushed for more regulations on AI, saying there is not enough oversight for the powerful technology.",
      "But Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that \"there's only going to be one winner\" as nations race to dominate artificial intelligence, and China's central government gives its companies a single place to go for government approvals.",
      "\"We have the big investment coming, but if they had to get 50 different approvals from 50 different states, you can forget it because it's impossible to do,\" the president said.",
      "The executive order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to create a new task force to challenge state laws, and directs the Department of Commerce to draw up a list of problematic regulations. It also threatens to restrict funding from a broadband deployment program and other grant programs to states with AI laws.",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist who is leading Mr. Trump's policies on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, said Thursday the Trump administration would only push back on \"the most onerous examples of state regulation\" but would not oppose \"kid safety\" measures.",
      "Four states \u2014 Colorado, California, Utah and Texas \u2014 have passed laws that set some rules for AI across the private sector, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals.",
      "Those laws include limiting the collection of certain personal information and requiring more transparency from companies.",
      "The laws are in response to AI that already pervades everyday life. The technology helps make consequential decisions for Americans, including who gets a job interview, an apartment lease, a home loan and even certain medical care. But research has shown that it can make mistakes in those decisions, including by prioritizing a particular gender or race.",
      "States' more ambitious AI regulation proposals require private companies to provide transparency and assess the possible risks of discrimination from their AI programs.",
      "Beyond those more sweeping rules, many states have regulated parts of AI: barring the use of deepfakes in elections and to create nonconsensual porn, for example, or putting rules in place around the government's own use of AI.",
      "Those who support regulations that would prevent states from restricting AI\u00a0\u2014 including some GOP lawmakers and advocates like Sacks \u2014 argue that forcing tech companies to contend with varied or even contradictory rules would hurt the industry.",
      "\"At best, we'll end up with 50 different AI models for 50 different states \u2013 a regulatory morass worse than Europe,\" Sacks wrote on X\u00a0earlier this week. \"This will stymie innovation, especially by small startups who can't afford the compliance burden. Meanwhile, China will race ahead.\"",
      "But members of both parties have pushed back. Last month, when congressional Republicans weighed adding restrictions on state AI regulations to a defense bill, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis called the idea a \"subsidy to Big Tech.\"",
      "\"The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild,\" the governor wrote.",
      "Earlier this week, Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts called Mr. Trump's plan to restrict AI regulations via an executive order an \"early Christmas present for his CEO billionaire buddies.\"",

    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants to overhaul a federal regulatory group, launched following the 2008 housing bust, that is tasked with safeguarding the U.S. financial system.",
      "The 15-member panel, known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), was established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to help spot and defuse systemic financial risks.",
      "The council is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes the leaders from other financial regulatory agencies, such as the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the head of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.",
      "In a letter released Thursday, Bessent called for looser FSOC regulations, saying that \"too often in the past, efforts to safeguard the financial system have resulted in burdensome and often duplicative regulations.\"",
      "\"Our administration is changing that approach,\" Bessent added.",
      "The Treasury Department and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Proponents of strong financial regulation criticized the push to revamp the FSOC.",
      "\"What you're removing is the smoke alarm for the entire financial system,\" said Oscar Vald\u00e9s Viera, private equity and capital markets policy analyst at Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition consisting of over 250 national and local groups.",

      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, also attacked the decision to loosen financial regulations.",
      "\"Going down this path just as cracks are emerging in the financial system and yellow lights are flashing across our economy is especially reckless,\" she said in a statement, citing the recent bankruptcies of subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings, auto parts company First Brands and home remodeling platform Renovo Home Partners.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-gold-card-website-1-million-platinum-card-how-it-works/",
    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 16:48:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration says it's also creating a $5 million platinum card visa that will allow foreigners to live in the U.S. for 270 days a year.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is touting his administration's new \"gold card\" visa as a fast track for foreigners who are willing and able to pay $1 million for the right to immigrate to the U.S.",
      "Applications for the new visa went live on Wednesday afternoon, with the government website for the gold card saying the process can be completed in a matter of weeks after applicants file their paperwork.",
      "Mr. Trump unveiled the gold card initiative in February, promoting it as an expedited path for wealthy foreigners to secure legal residency and as a way to generate government revenue. The term riffs on the \"green card,\" which grants permanent residency status to noncitizens so they can live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.",
      "\"All funds go to the United States government \u2014 it could be a tremendous amount of money,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday about the gold card. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card.\"",
      "The program also includes a $2 million gold card for corporations that want to secure visas for workers, as well as a $5 million platinum card that allows foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being required to pay federal income tax on non-U.S. income.",
      "\"It's certainly plausible to me that this could be a meaningful source of revenue,\" John Lettieri, the CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan policy research group, told CBS News.",
      "But, he added, the gold card visa is likely to be a \"niche program,\" given the cost, although it could help attract some highly skilled foreign workers or entrepreneurs to the U.S.",
      "Here's how the gold card program will work.",
      "What is a Trump gold card?",
      "In essence, it's a green card that has been fast-tracked by the Trump administration.",
      "The website to apply for a gold card states that successful applicants will receive either an EB-1 or EB-2 visa, two kinds of employment-based green cards for skilled workers. To apply for an individual gold card, applicants must:",
      "Pay a nonrefundable $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security.Undergo a vetting process, including a visa interview.Make a $1 million gift to the federal government after the vetting is complete.",
      "Pay a nonrefundable $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Undergo a vetting process, including a visa interview.",
      "Make a $1 million gift to the federal government after the vetting is complete.",
      "The new program also allows companies to obtain gold cards for employees, one per worker, with each requiring a $2 million donation, according to the website.",
      "Applicants must pay a $15,000 fee that will cover the cost of processing and conducting a background check, along with a 1% annual maintenance fee. Companies may also transfer the gold card between employees for a 5% transfer fee, the program specifies.",
      "A transfer could happen if a gold card holder becomes a U.S. citizen, for example.",
      "One potential difference between the Trump gold card and other types of green cards is that the new visa process could take only weeks, according to the Trump administration.",
      "By comparison, immigrants who apply for a regular green card can expect to wait between eight months and three years for approval, according to immigration services company Boundless. The quickest processing time is for spouses of U.S. citizens, who typically face an eight-month wait, the group said.",
      "How is the Trump gold card different from an EB-5 visa?",
      "The gold card is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which Congress created in 1990 to generate foreign investment. These have been available to people who spend at least $1 million to start a company with at least 10 workers.",
      "Unlike the EB-5 visa, however, a gold card visa doesn't require applicants to create a certain number of jobs or to invest in U.S. businesses.",
      "The EB-5 program has been criticized as cumbersome and as an invitation to commit fraud. In one notable case in recent years, hundreds of EB-5 applicants were defrauded by business executives in Vermont who claimed to be building a biotech facility, but who instead used the money for personal expenses.",
      "The process to obtain an EB-5 visa is also glacially slow, with a processing time of almost six years. That is \"by far the longest processing times in the U.S. immigration system,\" according to an April blog post about the Trump gold cards from EIG.",
      "The gold card is designed to help companies recruit foreign graduates of U.S. universities such as MIT and Harvard, Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "\"I've heard from Tim Cook of Apple, and I've heard from a lot of people, some of the people at this table, that essentially, in the United States, you can't keep the student,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Can gold card holders become citizens?",
      "Gold card recipients \"have a path to citizenship,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the press conference on Wednesday with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Obviously, they have to be perfect people in America, and having passed the vetting, after five years they'll be available to become citizens,\" Lutnick said.",
      "Green card holders can typically apply for citizenship after residing in the U.S. for five years.",
      "Companies that secure a gold card for workers who then become citizens can transfer the card to new employees, Lutnick added.",
      "Can a gold card visa be revoked?",
      "Yes: The application website states: \"The Trump Gold Card is a visa; therefore, national security and significant criminal risks are a basis for revocation.\"",
      "How much money could the visa program raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump didn't provide an estimate this week, but the program could generate billions in annual revenue, said Lettieri of the Economic Innovation Group.",
      "Based on the $1 million cost of a gold card visa, the program could raise $100 billion over a decade if it issues 10,000 gold cards per year, he calculated.",
      "\"Conservatively speaking, tens of billions over a decade is reasonable \u2014 it could be considerably higher,\" Lettieri said.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 11:55:05 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump says he's winning the war against inflation. But a look at prices around the U.S. shows why many Americans still feel financially squeezed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump delivered a message Tuesday evening aimed at the millions of Americans struggling to afford daily necessities, saying his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and that \"prices are coming down tremendously.\" Economic data tells a different story.",
      "Prices have edged higher for much of Mr. Trump's first year back in the White House, with inflation in September rising at an annual rate of 3% (the most recent available inflation data because of the recent U.S. government shutdown).",
      "Inflation dipped to a low this year of 2.3% in April, but it has steadily ticked up since then and now stands at the same rate as in January, when Mr. Trump was inaugurated, federal data shows. Economists attribute the rise partly to the Trump administration's new tariffs on imports, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pointing to those levies as a key factor behind the recent uptick.",
      "Inflation now \"is higher than earlier in the year as inflation for goods has picked up, reflecting the impact of tariffs,\" Powell said at a press conference on Wednesday to discuss the central bank's latest interest rate cut.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think prices are likely to continue creeping up for a while. Mark Vickery, senior market analyst at Zacks Investment Research, estimates that the Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of around 3.3% in November.",
      "To be sure, many economists, as well as the Fed, expect any additional pickup in inflation to be short-lived before easing in 2026. Powell on Wednesday said the tariff effect will likely create a one-time rise in prices that should fade over the coming year. The Fed expects inflation to recede to 2.4% next year, down from about 2.9% in 2025.",
      "From a longer-term perspective, inflation has indeed fallen sharply since hitting a 40-year high of about 9% in June 2022 in the aftermath of the pandemic. For shoppers, however, a lower inflation rate doesn't mean prices are declining \u2014 only that they're rising at a slower pace.",
      "Consumers tend not to view pocketbook issues through the lens of official inflation measures, a somewhat abstract metric that tracks price fluctuations over time, experts have long noted. Instead, many shoppers focus on their actual dollars-and-cents spending, including whether their out-of-pocket expenses are higher than they were in the past, according to research from the University of Florida.",
      "By that yardstick, Americans are spending more on everyday basics than they were a year ago, and far more than they did just before the pandemic, CPI data shows.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks, made Tuesday in Mount Pocono, Pa., came as his administration touts the president's economic policies ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"I have no higher priority than making America affordable,\" Mr. Trump said in the speech.",
      "Prior to the speech, Mr. Trump had decried affordability as a \"hoax\" perpetuated by Democrats, although some Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, have differed with him on the issue. Greene told CBS News that she doesn't believe affordability is a hoax, adding, \"Everyone's bills have either stayed the same or gone up.\"",
      "\"You can't gaslight people and tell them that their bills are affordable,\" Greene said.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai expressed confidence that Mr. Trump's agenda will cool inflation and boost worker wages.",
      "\"President Trump inherited the worst inflation crisis in a generation from Joe Biden's incompetence, and his Administration has rapidly cooled inflation to a 2.5% annualized rate,\" Desai said in a statement to CBS News. \"As the administration's supply-side policies of tax cuts, deregulation and energy abundance continue taking effect, Americans can count on inflation continuing to fall and real wages continuing to rise.\"",
      "Food",
      "Americans paid 2.7% more for food bought at the grocery store in September than they did a year earlier, according to the most recent CPI figures. That may not seem like much, but their grocery bills have climbed roughly 49% since 2020.",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "Some food costs are also rising much faster than the rate of inflation, with beef steaks surging almost 17% from a year ago, according to the CPI data. Earlier this month, the Trump administration sought to lower some grocery prices by exempting foods like beef, coffee and bananas from new country-specific tariffs.",
      "Shoppers on Tuesday told CBS News' Nancy Cordes that they are making tradeoffs and scrimping to afford groceries.",
      "\"The cost of beef is astronomical. I will mainly get what's on sale,\" Anne Marie Hadley, a retired special education teacher who was shopping Tuesday at Schiel's Family Market, a family-owned grocery store in Scranton, Pa., told Cordes.",
      "Housing",
      "While mortgage rates have dropped this year, housing remains out of reach for most would-be buyers. More than 75% of homes across the country are unaffordable for the typical household, Bankrate said in a report this week.",
      "A homebuyer today needs to earn $131,400 a year to afford a typical home in the U.S. \u2014 almost double the roughly $65,000 needed five years ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.",
      "Almost three-quarters of Americans said housing has grown more unaffordable in their communities in recent years, according to an October poll from YouGov and the University of Florida Center for Public Interest Communications.",

      "One area where consumers are getting a break is at the pump, with gasoline prices down from a year earlier. Gas declined 0.5% in September from a year earlier, CPI data shows. And earlier this month, gas dropped below $3 a gallon on average, marking the lowest price since May 2021.",
      "\"It was just reported that four states had $1.99 a gallon,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. \"We are right now involved in more energy, and have more energy in the works by far than we've ever had before.\"",

      "A former top official at the National Institutes of Health sued the Trump administration Tuesday, alleging she was illegally fired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after she blew the whistle on internal clashes over vaccine research at the agency.",
      "Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo ran the NIH division responsible for vaccine research until late March, when she was placed on indefinite leave. In a formal whistleblower complaint, she said she was sidelined because she pushed back against NIH officials appointed by President Trump who questioned the importance of childhood flu vaccines and canceled long-running clinical trials.",
      "She was terminated in October after she went public with her concerns in an exclusive interview with CBS News, which she claims was a further act of retaliation.",
      "\"I spoke up because the decisions by HHS leadership have put the public's health at risk and wasted billions of dollars \u2014 actions that will have devastating consequences for Americans' safety and wellbeing for decades to come,\" Marrazzo said in a statement on Tuesday, noting that she is seeking her job back and also aims to protect the rights afforded to federal employees who blow the whistle.",
      "\"I was fired for calling this out, but I will not stay silent,\" she said.",
      "An Health and Human Services spokesperson declined to comment on Marrazzo's lawsuit. Under Kennedy, vaccine skeptics have been appointed to leadership roles across the health agencies, raising alarms among career scientists.",
      "Marrazzo's allegations focus on Dr. Matthew Memoli, who served as acting NIH director earlier this year before moving to the health agency's No. 2 post.",
      "Marrazzo claimed Memoli made statements downplaying the importance of vaccines that closely mirrored the views of Kennedy, who has a long history of sowing doubts about vaccines. In a series of meetings, Memoli argued that \"vaccines are unnecessary if populations are healthy,\" and that the NIH \"should not focus on vaccines,\" Marrazzo alleged in her lawsuit.",

    "summary": "A federal judge in Washington, D.C., put limits on what construction crews can do on the project over the next two weeks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon denied a motion by the National Trust for Historic Preservation that would have temporarily blocked the Trump administration's construction of a new ballroom at the White House, but he set out some requirements for the Trump administration moving forward.",
      "Leon said in a hearing Tuesday in Washington, D.C., that the nonprofit group had not established enough irreparable harm in order to pause the construction outright, but the judge declared construction crews cannot over the next two weeks build any below-ground structures that would determine how and where the final ballroom structure will exist. Leon said any breaking of that order would result in the White House being \"forced to take it down.\"",
      "The judge is requiring the government to submit construction plans to the National Capital Planning Commission by the end of the year, and the Justice Department said that the government has made \"initial outreach\" to set up meetings on that front.",
      "Last week, the National Trust for Historic Preservation filed the first major lawsuit against President Trump and his administration in an effort to block construction of the ballroom, claiming no president is allowed to\u00a0tear down\u00a0parts of the White House \"without any review whatsoever,\" or construct a ballroom on public property \"without giving the public an opportunity to weigh in.\"",
      "The National Park Service expects the project to be completed in summer 2028, not long before Mr. Trump leaves office.",
      "The historic preservation group argues that the lawsuit isn't about the need for a ballroom, but about the need to follow the law, repeatedly arguing in court Tuesday that five laws have been broken by the demolition and build project. Plaintiffs also argued the environmental impact statement submitted by the administration was \"woefully inadequate.\" Much of the East Wing has been demolished as a part of the project.",
      "\"These are things that they can do...as long as they follow the rules,\" an attorney for the group argued Tuesday.",
      "The government contends that it has no obligation to file plans with the National Capital Planning Commission, an independent government agency, for demolition or below ground work, and insists it has not violated any laws because no plan for the ballroom has been finalized.",
      "\"There is nothing final about this building,\" Justice Department attorney Adam Gustafson argued in court.",
      "The government also argued that the construction and planning are all coming from the Executive Office of the President, and because it's executive action, federal courts have limited power to review it. The National Park Service, however, was named repeatedly in court filings by the Justice Department and wrote a memo in support of the project.",
      "The government said it is \"committed\" to hear input from the Commission of Fine Arts, which presently does not have a quorum because Trump removed most members, and said the lawsuit was filed too late, because demolition was completed a week before the complaint was filed.",

      "Los Angeles \u2014 Democrats were feeling jubilant at this year's Democratic National Committee winter meetings after decisive victories in the off-year elections. Now, they say they are looking to build on the 2025 momentum as they approach next year's midterms \u2014 and beyond.",
      "Two of the most prominent party leaders, both Californians, dominated conversations about 2028 at the annual gathering of party leaders. And there were a couple of clear signals from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris that both upcoming cycles are\u00a0 on their minds.",
      "Newsom quietly switched the timing of his appearance at the conference, according to multiple sources familiar with the original schedule. One top party official said he had done so in order to avoid speaking on Friday, the same day as other potential 2028 presidential contenders. He did not want to share the\u00a0 day, or headlines. Friday was the day Harris was set to deliver the keynote address to the gathering. Newsom changed his visit\u00a0 to Thursday. A California Democrat close to Harris rolled their eyes when asked about the governor's maneuver.",
      "Democrats gave Newsom an enthusiastic welcome, clamoring for handshakes and selfies when he arrived. He told reporters he was there to thank party members for their help on Proposition 50, the ballot measure he championed to enable the legislature to redraw California's congressional map to make five GOP-held districts more friendly to Democrats. The move was intended to offset a Trump-driven redistricting push in Texas that would draw a map aimed at increasing the state's Republican congressional delegation by five.",
      "The California governor said he wanted to help Democratic leaders in states like Missouri confront GOP redistricting efforts and help boost the party's chances of retaking the House in the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\" I'd be remiss If I didn't say 'hello',\" he said, explaining his visit. He added that there was a \"sense of optimism here.\"",
      "\" The party, more broadly, I think is feeling like they got their sea legs back. They are winning and winning solves a lot of problems,\"he said to reporters.",
      "Newsom's redistricting initiative galvanized Democrats, Latino voters and young voters in California and beyond, uniting them against the GOP efforts to insulate Republicans from midterm losses. It became a broader rallying cry \u2014 especially among those attending the winter meeting, who told CBS News they're looking for \"fighters\" to lead them out of the political wilderness.",
      "The California venue meant home-state Democrats made up an outsize share of attendees, and they gave a warm welcome to their former senator and the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee when she arrived.",
      "Chants of \"Kamala! Kamala!\" rang out. Harris wasted no time in seizing on Democrats' battle cry of\u00a0 affordability, an issue that was more fraught when she was running as part of the administration, instead of in opposition to it.",
      "\"[Voters] want leaders who fight for affordability, for health care, for the right of people to participate in their democracy,\" she said. \"Americans want leaders who fight for them, and that is what we will continue to do in 2026 as we compete in every state, in every district, and every level of government.\"",
      "She then dropped the biggest hint that she is considering another presidential run.",
      "\"Obviously, we must focus on the midterms, but Democrats, we must also have a clear vision for what comes after the midterms.\"",
      "\"You!\" an audience member yelled.",
      "Harris smiled and continued, \"We need to answer the question, 'What comes next for our party, our democracy?' As we plan what comes after this administration, (we) cannot afford to be nostalgic for what was, in fact, a simple return to what existed in the past,\" Harris said. \"The work ahead requires us to reinvent, to innovate, to inspire and understand that the task before us is not just a political project. It must be a project of civic renewal.\"",
      "She called on Democrats for \"a new commitment\" that is \"not commanded by big corporations or career politicians, not by the elite or wealthy, but by everyday citizens\u2026for the betterment of the country, a commitment that declares that the power of this country does not belong to any king or set of oligarchs.\" It was one of her biggest applause lines.",
      "One DNC voting member and senior Democratic operative told CBS News that Harris remains popular with Democrats: \"She has great relationships with all these people and campaigned in a way that Gov. Newsom hasn't yet had the chance to.\"",
      "For now \u2014 two years before a single primary vote will be cast \u2014 Harris \"clearly has a big advantage when it comes to the party apparatus,\" the operative said. \"But people are very excited to see everybody, including Gov. Newsom. Newsom is showing people how to fight back.\"",
      "Many of the Democrats who attended the winter meeting campaigned for Harris during her 107-day sprint after President Joe Biden exited the 2024 race after his disastrous debate against President Trump and were thrilled by the possibility that Harris could run again. But not everyone sees the dynamic the same way.",
      "\"Harris has to prove to a lot of people that she can be a good candidate again,\" a senior congressional adviser at the meeting told CBS News. \"Newsom is already doing that\" with the redistricting measure. The aide called it a \"huge validation\" of his approach.",
      "Broadly, Democrats say they aren't only relying on anti-Trump messaging going into the midterms. After victories in this year's gubernatorial and mayoral races, the party is trying to emphasize campaign messages around Americans' economic concerns. The Democrats in the governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia and in the New York and Miami mayoral races made this the central focus of their successful campaigns, and party strategists are urging other candidates to adopt the same template.",
      "On Friday, DNC Chair Ken Martin put it bluntly in the packed hotel auditorium: \"We know what's important right now. S*** is too expensive.\"",
      "Congress and the midterms",
      "Many Democrats feel optimistic about their prospects in the House. The party in the White House almost always loses ground in midterms, and Mr. Trump's approval ratings have slid. They see the Senate as a steeper climb, with only a handful of clear opportunities for Democrats to win GOP-held seats.",
      "Democrats also still face challenges \u2014 the 2024 erosion of support among Latino voters and younger people and voters without college degrees, as well as internal disagreements among progressives and moderates, were top concerns for those at the L.A. meetings. But they were buoyed by the inroads their 2025 candidates have made with these parts of the electorate.",
      "For this weekend, though, they chose to enjoy the momentum they finally seem to have with their off-year election wins. Party leaders told CBS News they see an opportunity to build on their victories, rather than just offering theoretical arguments and complaints about their failing strategy in last year's decisive defeat at the ballot box.",
      "Multiple Democrats who were asked if they expected a Democratic \"wave\" in 2026 \u2014 as some of their cohorts had predicted leading into the meetings \u2014 offered an emphatic and positive response.",
      "\"100%. Yes,\" one DNC voting member said.",
      "That confidence was underscored, Democrats said, by the pressure they're seeing inside GOP ranks \u2014 noting Indiana Republicans resisted Mr. Trump's GOP-friendly redistricting effort in their state.",
      "Democrats here saw it as a sign that the political terrain is shifting in their favor.",
      "\"We're not looking backward anymore,\" a California Democrat said after Harris' speech. \"We're focused on what's working now: current Democratic governors, current fights, and current wins. Not the past.\"",
      "The Democrat also pointed to a fundraiser on the sidelines of the meetings headlined by Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who's often mentioned as a possible 2028 presidential contender. The event, emceed by Conan O'Brien, raised over $1 million for the DNC, according to several Democratic sources. It was the last political event attended by Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele, before they were tragically killed over the weekend. Reiner was also a prominent Democratic party advocate and donor, and happily posed for photographs with his fellow Democrats in attendance.",
      "At another Democratic fundraiser in Los Angeles that closed out the weekend, former President Barack Obama said he feels \"a new energy\" since the party's off-year wins. The former president \u2014 whose 96% favorability rating among Democrats makes him one of the party's most popular figures \u2014 urged Democrats to focus on winning the midterms and developing \"a better story\" to tell voters, rather than on \"nerdy\" internal disagreements that he said most voters see as stuff \"for college seminars.\"",
      "\"Of course there are going to be some tactical differences, but that shouldn't be our primary concern because we're fighting a bigger fight,\" Obama said, according to excerpts obtained by CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday more than doubled the list of countries subject to his travel ban or to heavy restrictions, bringing the total number of nations affected by the sweeping set of immigration and entry limits to 39.",
      "The first iteration of the travel ban Mr. Trump issued in June included 19 countries, fully barring the entry of immigrants and travelers from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also partially suspended the entry of nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",
      "The proclamation signed by Mr. Trump on Tuesday added seven countries to the list of states facing full entry restrictions: Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Laos, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Syria. It imposed partial entry limits on immigrants and travelers from another 15 countries, including Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe.",
      "Mr. Trump's proclamation also enacted an entry ban for those traveling with documents issued by the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank. The restrictions on travelers from Turkmenistan were eased, after Mr. Trump said that country had improved its information-sharing with the U.S.",
      "The immigration and travel restrictions include some exceptions, including for permanent U.S. residents from the countries on the list and athletes and staff participating in major sporting events like the FIFA World Cup next year. But Tuesday's proclamation also eliminated an exception, included in the June travel ban, that exempted the children, spouses and parents of U.S. citizens who had requested visas on their behalf.",
      "CBS News had reported earlier this month that the Trump administration was considering expanding its travel ban following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., on Thanksgiving week. The suspect in that attack, which killed one of the soldiers, is an Afghan man who entered the U.S. in September 2021 and was granted asylum in April 2025.",
      "In his decree on Tuesday, Mr. Trump cited multiple reasons to justify the travel ban's expansion, including concerns about the ability to adequately vet immigrants from the impacted countries and the lack of reliable record-keeping and information-sharing in some of those nations. He also referenced armed conflict, corruption, fraud and terrorism in certain countries on the list.",
      "Mr. Trump said Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica also offer citizenship to foreigners without a residency requirement, creating the risk that someone from the countries subject to the travel ban could seek to gain status in those Caribbean nations to bypass the U.S. entry restrictions.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first administration, versions of his travel ban faced significant public backlash and legal challenges that alleged the policy was discriminatory in nature. In 2018, however, the Supreme Court upheld the president's power to suspend the entry of foreigners on national security grounds through a legal authority known as 212(f).",

      "\"My Fellow Americans: I will be giving an ADDRESS TO THE NATION tomorrow night, LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, at 9 P.M. EST.,\" he wrote on Truth Social Tuesday afternoon. \"I look forward to 'seeing' you then. It has been a great year for our Country, and THE BEST IS YET TO COME!\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president will discuss his accomplishments since taking office in January and what he plans to do over the course of the next three years.",
      "The White House and the president have been working to highlight his record to voters, heading into what's expected to be a tough midterm election year.

Vice President JD Vance was also in Pennsylvania on Tuesday to promote the administration's agenda.",

    "summary": "Senate Republicans are aiming to move forward on a new package of funding bills before leaving for the holidays, with just weeks to go before the next deadline to avoid another shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans are aiming to move forward on a new package of funding bills before leaving town for the holidays, with just weeks to go before the next deadline to avoid another government shutdown.",
      "Congress approved an initial tranche of funding legislation in November as the longest shutdown in history came to an end. But progress has been stalled on additional measures since then. When lawmakers return in the new year, they will have just four weeks to fund the government, or risk a partial shutdown in February.",
      "After approving three of the 12 annual appropriations bills in November, Senate GOP leaders and appropriators were eager to get moving on the next batch of bills. The new package, dubbed a \"minibus,\" is made up of five bills. It would include funding through September for the Department of Defense; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; Transportation, Housing and Urban Development; Commerce, Justice and Science; and Interior and Environment. But issues remain.",
      "\"We're still working it,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday morning. \"Not there yet.\"",
      "The minibus package, a smaller version of massive \"omnibus\" government funding legislation, comes as Republicans have sought to return to passing individual spending bills through regular order, rather than through a large end-of-year package. This year, leaders in Congress also opted not to impose a pre-holiday deadline to fund the government, which often raises pressure on lawmakers to agree to a deal before leaving town for the winter recess.",
      "Still, Senate GOP leaders have sought to make progress on the funding package before the chamber breaks later this week.",
      "Asked whether action on the minibus this week is realistic, Thune told reporters \"we'll see.\" Leaders have been working to resolve disagreements with a handful of Senate Republicans who have put \"holds\" on the package, including Sens. Rick Scott of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and John Kennedy of Louisiana. Holds allow individual senators to signal their objections to legislation in its current form.",
      "\"My hope is at least that these, all of these holds that currently exist on the bill on our side at least, are starting to be dealt with in a way that hopefully will get them lifted,\" Thune said. \"But we're not 100% there yet.\"",
      "Kennedy told reporters after Senate Republicans gathered for lunch Tuesday that his and Johnson's holds are the two that remain. Johnson has advocated for the inclusion of his measure to pay federal employees who work during government shutdowns. He told CBS News that he is \"not interested in amendment votes \u2014 I want a result, and we should be able to get a result.\"",
      "\"One thing I've learned about here, when leadership wants to get something done, they get it done,\" Johnson added.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the top appropriator in the Senate, told CBS News that the current objections are \"soft holds that I think we can work out.\"",
      "\"I'm hopeful that we'll be on the package tomorrow,\" Collins said.",
      "Should progress stall on the minibus this week, the Senate will face a tight timeline to fund the remaining agencies and government programs upon their return next month. The deal to end the government shutdown earlier this year extended funding until Jan. 30.",
      "The initial batch of funding bills included funding for military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Agriculture and FDA; and operations for the legislative branch. The package funded the relevant agencies and programs through September 2026, meaning the agencies would still be funded even if lawmakers fail to fund other areas of the government by the end of January.",
      "Thune, asked whether he's concerned about a shutdown in the new year, told reporters that the threat is \"always out there.\"",
      "\"I think that's why it's really important that we do everything we can to consolidate support for getting on the bills and trying to, you know, transact the funding of the government in a way that would prevent that from happening,\" he added.",
      "Part of the calculus for Democrats will likely be the same as in the last shutdown, which became the longest in history at 43 days. The issue at the center of that fight was health care, particularly the expiration of the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. But that issue remains unresolved, even after the two parties put forward dueling health care proposals for votes last week. On health care, Thune said he thinks there's a \"potential pathway in January.\"",
      "Amid the effort to pass another package of funding measures, Thune said he and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke briefly Tuesday morning and there are \"conversations going all the time.\"",
      "\"We're working with the Dems, the hotlines have been running on both sides, and trying to figure out how do we, you know, fund the government in a way that I think reflects the views of this United States Senate and not a continuing resolution,\" Thune said. \"And I think both sides see the value in doing that. So I'm still hopeful that there will be a convergence around getting on the bills and moving them in a way that would prevent us having to deal, at the end of January, with another shutdown.\"",

    "summary": "Recently released emails document Jeffrey Epstein's involvement in Leon Black's personal affairs.",
    "story": [
      "Documents released by Congress shed new light on Jeffrey Epstein's role in an attempt to help billionaire Leon Black squelch an accusation of sexual impropriety.",
      "Epstein's relationship with Black has already faced extensive scrutiny, but recently released, previously unreported emails from the House Oversight Committee document Epstein's involvement in Black's personal affairs while the private equity investor paid him huge sums for wealth management advice.",
      "Black, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, had a six-year affair with a former Russian model named Guzel Ganieva, whom he met at a party in New York City in 2008, according to court records. It was a relationship that ended in acrimony, with Ganieva accusing Black of sexual abuse \u2014 allegations Black denies.",
      "As Black prepared a nondisclosure agreement to secure Ganieva's silence about their affair, Epstein offered him some advice. Epstein suggested in a Sept. 21, 2015, email that Black hire former law enforcement officers to approach Ganieva about the agreement.",
      "\"Choose method of message delivery, my choice. - two highly respected former ---- fill in the blank, immigration, scotland yard. sfo. . who may knock on her door and present the terms,\" Epstein wrote in his typical email style, forsaking standard grammar and punctuation.",
      "Black had learned that Ganieva was planning to travel from London to New York to confront him. And Epstein suggested a similar approach if she showed up stateside. \"Have the same types of individuals [available] in new york if she decides to return as stated.. i prefer former fbi, or immigration one man one woman.\"",
      "Epstein did not mention Ganieva by name, but details in the email make it clear he's referring to her. A spokesperson for Black did not dispute that conclusion. An attorney for Ganieva declined to comment.",
      "Epstein penned a follow-up email minutes later, giving Black's assistant and attorney further instructions. Epstein wrote that Black's assistant \"should set up a separate email account for this correspondence. she currently is on an apollo server.\"",
      "No other emails in the trove released by Congress appear to address Black's long-running dispute with Ganieva.",
      "Ernest Badway, a former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement attorney who frequently represents clients in internal investigations, said an exchange of this nature should have set off red flags inside his company when they later looked into Black's ties to Epstein.",
      "\"As an investigator, that would concern me if I saw an email that people sent on the business's server saying, 'set up a private email so we can have private conversations.' You know, what are those private conversations about?\" Badway said.",
      "Epstein spent years forging relationships that bridged his business interests with his connections to international law enforcement and intelligence figures \u2014 including some powerful players in Russia. He engaged in transactions with Russian banks involving hundreds of millions of dollars, a congressional investigator, Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, said in July. He frequently met with Vitaly Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, until Churkin's death in 2017. And he nurtured a relationship with former Russian Deputy Minister of Economic Development Sergey Belyakov \u2014 a reputed FSB agent.",
      "In the summer of 2015, Epstein reached out to Belyakov for information on Ganieva to determine whether she was working for the Russian government, according to The Dossier Center, a website run by former Russian oligarch and Putin critic Mikhail Kordokovsky.",
      "On Oct. 18, 2015, Ganieva signed a nondisclosure contract with Black in which the billionaire agreed to pay her $100,000 monthly for 15 years, forgive a $1 million loan and provide two million British pounds for her to obtain legal status in the U.K.",
      "Two months later, Epstein emailed Black seeking additional payments for his financial advice.",
      "\"As you are well aware, There is little I won't do for you, or at least try to do as a friend, and a great deal that I have already done ( both known and some things that will need (sp) to remain unknown.)\" Epstein wrote.",
      "The nondisclosure agreement broke down four years later, leading to a series of lawsuits and countersuits. Court filings show Black discussed Ganieva's deal with two people, Epstein and a private investigator. It's unclear if Black turned to the private investigator \u2014 who had spent decades working for the U.S. Department of Justice \u2014 because Epstein had suggested hiring ex-law enforcement.",
      "Susan Estrich, an attorney for Black, told CBS News that his relationship with Epstein has already been the subject of an internal investigation commissioned by Apollo, and conducted by the law firm Dechert LLP.",
      "\"Epstein's emails, to which Mr. Black never responded, make it clear that Epstein was a braggart who embellished and exaggerated his role and responsibilities in many ways,\" Estrich said. \"Mr. Black's consensual relationship with Ms. Ganieva ended with an amicable settlement in 2015 and a voluntary non-disclosure agreement. Ms. Ganieva's unfounded lawsuit against Mr. Black has been dismissed by the trial court and that decision was upheld on appeal.\"",
      "The Dechert investigation concluded that Black paid Epstein $158 million for work related to his family office, \"and that Black genuinely believed that Epstein was extremely smart, capable, and saved him substantial amounts of money.\" The Dechert report made no mention of any effort by Epstein to advise Black regarding Ganieva \u2014 only that Black had \"confided\" in Epstein about certain personal matters.",
      "\"Mr. Black asked for an independent investigation of his relationship with Jeffery Epstein and Dechert investigated and reviewed more than 60,000 documents and concluded that Mr. Black paid Epstein for estate planning and tax advice, no more, no less,\" Estrich said.",
      "It's unclear if the two emails about Ganieva were among those turned over to Dechert's investigators. The Dechert investigation was led by Andrew Levander, a former federal prosecutor. Levander, who also represented former CBS CEO Les Moonves when he was the focus of an internal investigation in 2018, declined to comment.",
      "Black stepped down from the company he founded in March 2021, citing health concerns, two months after the Dechert report was finalized.",
      "Sen. Wyden \u2014 who has spent nearly four years investigating the financial relationship between Black and Epstein \u2014 says Black's payments to Epstein actually reached $170 million and he does not believe the emerging picture matches Black's explanation for paying Epstein nine-figure \"fees\" for tax advice.",
      "\"All along Mr. Black's story has been that he, a multi-billionaire Wall Street titan who employed the finest tax and estate planning minds in America, had to pay astronomical rates for special tax advice from Jeffrey Epstein, who was neither a tax attorney nor an accountant,\" Wyden told CBS News. \"I've never found Black's account believable, and every new revelation in this case raises more troubling questions about what really motivated his payments to Epstein and whether previous investigations of this matter covered up the truth.\"",
      "Editor's note: This article has been updated to reflect that the nondisclosure agreement between Black and Ganieva only sought confidentiality about their affair.",

    "summary": "President Trump defended White House chief of staff Susie Wiles after she was quoted offering blunt assessments of his inner circle in Vanity Fair.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and members of his Cabinet defended White House chief of staff Susie Wiles on Tuesday after Vanity Fair published a lengthy piece featuring her blunt assessment of the president's inner circle, his first year in office and the president himself.",
      "The two-part story, written by author Chris Whipple, features quotes from 11 interviews that Whipple conducted with Wiles from Jan. 11 to Nov. 5.",
      "According to Vanity Fair, Wiles said the president, who doesn't drink, has \"an alcoholic's personality.\"",
      "\"High-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink,\" Wiles said, according to Vanity Fair. \"And so I'm a little bit of an expert in big personalities.\" Wiles was quoted as saying the president operates with the view that there's \"nothing he can't do. Nothing, zero, nothing.\"",
      "The president told the New York Post he hadn't read the Vanity Fair piece, but said Wiles is \"fantastic.\" Mr. Trump also defended Wiles' description of him.",
      "\"No, she meant that I'm \u2014 you see, I don't drink alcohol,\" the president told the Post. \"So everybody knows that \u2014 but I've often said that if I did, I'd have a very good chance of being an alcoholic. I have said that many times about myself, I do. It's a very possessive personality.\"",
      "He continued: \"I've said that many times about myself. I'm fortunate I'm not a drinker. If I did, I could very well, because I've said that \u2014 what's the word? Not possessive \u2014 possessive and addictive type personality. Oh, I've said it many times, many times before.\"",
      "Wiles was also quoted as saying Vice President JD Vance has \"been a conspiracy theorist for a decade,\" and that Attorney General Pam Bondi \"completely whiffed\" on her handling of the Epstein files. She also criticized Elon Musk and the way the U.S. Agency for International Development was shuttered in the early months of the administration.",
      "\"No rational person could think the USAID process was a good one,\" she said in the story. \"Nobody.\"",
      "In a post on X, her first in more than a year, Wiles, 68, called the story a \"disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history.\"",
      "\"Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story,\" she wrote. \"I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team.\"",
      "Wiles' statement did not deny that she was accurately quoted. CBS News has asked Vanity Fair for any additional comment and whether the publication will be releasing a transcript or audio of the interviews.",
      "Wiles, a longtime political operative in Florida, became the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff when Mr. Trump took office in January. She was named to Forbes' 2025 list of the World's Most Powerful Women earlier this month.",
      "Top administration officials came to Wiles' defense after the Vanity Fair story was published, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reposting many of their comments.",
      "Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought, whom Wiles called a \"right-wing absolute zealot\" in the story, called Wiles \"an exceptional chief of staff.\"",
      "\"In my portfolio, she is always an ally in helping me deliver for the president,\" Vought wrote on X. \"And this hit piece will not slow us down.\"",
      "Despite Wiles' criticism of her handling of the Epstein files, Bondi wrote on X: \"My dear friend Susie Wiles fights every day to advance President Trump's agenda \u2013 and she does so with grace, loyalty, and historic effectiveness. Any attempt to divide this administration will fail. Any attempt to undermine and downplay President Trump's monumental achievements will fail. We are family. We are united.\"",
      "\"This is what the Left does: trash & smear our best & most effective people,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote. \"They do it to President Trump daily \u2014 and now to Chief Susie Wiles. Susie is the most TRUSTED, most PROFESSIONAL & most EFFECTIVE Chief of Staff of my lifetime. Absolutely nobody better!\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote that the \"radical left is at it again, trying to create discord on President Trump's team,\" adding that \"It won't work because we know & love Susie Wiles.\"",
      "The vice president was asked about the \"conspiracy theorist\" comment by reporters during a trip to Pennsylvania. Vance said he hadn't read the article yet but had heard about it.",
      "\"Sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true,\" Vance said.",
      "\"And by the way, Susie and I have joked in private and in public about that for a long time,\" Vance continued. \"For example, I believed in the crazy conspiracy theory back in 2020 that it was stupid to mask three-year-olds at the height of the COVID pandemic, that we should actually let them develop some language skills. I believed in this crazy conspiracy theory that the media and the government were covering up the fact that Joe Biden was clearly unable to do the job.\"",
      "He added: \"If any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article, I hope that the lesson is we should be giving fewer interviews to mainstream media outlets.\"",

    "story": [
      "Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar said federal immigration agents pulled over her son on Saturday and asked him to prove his citizenship.",
      "\"Yesterday, after he made a stop at Target, he did get pulled over by [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents, and once he was able to produce his passport ID, they did let him go,\" Omar said in an interview with Esme Murphy on WCCO Sunday Morning.",
      "The congresswoman said her son \"always carries\" his passport with him.",
      "Omar said ICE also previously entered a mosque where her son and others were praying, but left without incident. After that, she said she \"had to remind him just how worried I am, because all of these areas that they are talking about are areas where he could possibly find himself in and they are racially profiling, they are looking for young men who look Somali that they think are undocumented.\"",
      "ICE's Acting Director Todd Lyons said the agency has \"absolutely zero record of its officers or agents pulling over Congresswoman Omar's son\" and accused her of trying to \"unfairly demonize our law enforcement officers.\"",
      "Lyons also said Omar's allegations of racial profiling are \"disgusting, reckless and categorically false.\"",
      "When asked about Lyons' statement, a spokesperson for Omar's office stood by the congresswoman's comments.",
      "\"ICE has long operated as a rogue agency beyond reform. It's no surprise that an agency known for disappearing people also can't keep its records straight,\" the spokesperson said. \"ICE now claims it has records of all the stops, and our office would welcome the opportunity to review them.\"",
      "Earlier this month, federal agents surged into the Twin Cities with the stated goal of targeting undocumented Somali immigrants. The enhanced focus on the Somali community came after President Trump said he doesn't \"want them in our country\" and called Omar herself \"garbage.\"",
      "On Friday, Omar sent a letter to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, accusing federal agents of \"blatant racial profiling\" and \"an egregious level of unnecessary force\" in the Twin Cities.",
      "\"It is clear to me that this surge came in direct response to\u00a0Trump's racist comments about Somali people, and\u00a0about me in particular,\" Omar wrote.",
      "U.S. Census Bureau data show Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the country \u2014 about 107,000, more than 80,000 of them living in the Twin Cities. Omar contends that \"over 90% of Somalis in America are U.S. citizens,\" citing an American Community Survey conducted by the Census Bureau that estimates about 22,000 Somalis in the country \u2014 around 8.4% of the population \u2014 are not citizens.",

    "summary": "Attorney General Pam Bondi said the FBI and Justice Department thwarted \"what would have been a massive and horrific terror plot\" in Southern California.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal law enforcement officials said Monday that four members of a far-left anti-government group have been arrested and face charges for allegedly planning a series of bomb attacks across Southern California on New Year's Eve.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X that the Justice Department and FBI \"prevented what would have been a massive and horrific terror plot in the Central District of California,\" which encompasses Los Angeles and Orange County.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said that the four people who face charges for the alleged plot in California are members of a group known as the Turtle Island Liberation Front. Bondi described the Turtle Island Liberation Front as a \"far-left, pro-Palestine, anti-government, and anti-capitalist group.\"",
      "Bill Essayli, who leads the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, said at a press conference that the four individuals were arrested Friday in San Bernardino County, where they gathered to construct and detonate test explosive devices in the Mojave Desert. He said the suspects allegedly crafted a \"detailed, coordinated plot\" to bomb two U.S. companies on New Year's Eve, with the devices simultaneously exploding at midnight. Essayli did not name the companies but said they were \"logistics centers.\"",
      "\"This case is another reminder about the dangers that radicalized antifa-like groups pose to people, public safety and the rule of law,\" he said.",
      "The defendants are identified in court papers as Audrey Carroll, Zachary Page, Dante Gaffield and Tina Lai.",
      "Officials played a video that they said showed defendants gathering in the desert to test the bombs. The footage was taken by a surveillance plane, according to Essayli, and FBI agents arrested the defendants soon after. An affidavit from the FBI said that the co-conspirators unloaded bomb-making materials from cars and started to assemble the materials in a table under a tent while they were in the Mojave Desert. The FBI intervened before the four defendants could finish assembling a functional bomb, according to the court filings.",
      "All four of the defendants are from the Los Angeles-area and have been charged with conspiracy and possession of an unregistered destructive device. Additional charges could be filed in the coming weeks, according to Essayli. He described the suspects as \"radical, anti-government members\" of the Turtle Island Liberation Front.",
      "A fifth person, Micah James Legnon, was arrested in Louisiana and charged with one count of making threats in interstate commerce. A FBI agent said in an\u00a0affidavit that Legnon appears to be a member of the Turtle Island Liberation Front and \"intended to travel to New Orleans to carry out an attack by means of weapons.\" Legnon, who served in the U.S. Marines, was stopped by law enforcement on a highway in Louisiana on Friday and had an assault rifle, pistol, gas canister, and body armor in his car, according to court papers.",
      "The Turtle Island Liberation Front describes itself on Facebook as a political organization that seeks \"liberation of occupied Turtle Island and liberation of all colonized people across the world.\" Turtle Island is the name used by some Indigenous peoples for North America.",
      "The group has expressed pro-Palestinian messages on social media and has said it is fighting against \"fascist colonizers.\" It has urged followers to bring Palestinian flags to protests.",
      "An Instagram account for the group's Los Angeles chapter\u00a0says it advocates for \"liberation through decolonization and tribal sovereignty.\" The group does not appear to be particularly well-known: its Instagram account had fewer than 900 followers as of Monday morning, and its Facebook page was followed by just 32 users.",
      "Mr. Trump has targeted far-left groups and movements as leading domestic terrorism threats. In September, the president signed a\u00a0memorandum\u00a0calling for the creation of a \"national strategy to investigate and disrupt networks, entities, and organizations that foment political violence,\" as well as investigations into organizations that he believes engage in political violence. He claimed that violent conduct is animated by \"anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity\" views.",
      "Mr. Trump also\u00a0signed an executive order labeling antifa as a \"domestic terrorist organization,\" even though antifa is a political movement with no official leadership or organization structure.",
      "Michael Kenney, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who researches high-risk activism and political violence, said the Turtle Island Liberation Front appears to be part of the larger ecosystem of groups that the Trump administration is focusing on, with a far-left, anarchist, anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist ideology.",
      "\"The individuals that were involved in this alleged plot appear to be a splinter group or an offshoot of the larger Turtle Island Liberation Front,\" he said. \"In other words, I believe that there are members of the Turtle Island Liberation Front that had nothing to do with this plot, and what we appear to be seeing is several individuals that have decided to escalate their activism to actual political violence.\"",
      "Kenney said the group appears to be small, but active in terms of digital and offline activism.",
      "\"This is a group that has an ideology, they have a set of political ideas that they follow, that they are trying to implement,\" he said. \"What they're trying to do here is bring attention to those ideas and their beliefs.\"",
      "Federal officials said one of the defendants, Carroll, 30, created a \"detailed bombing plot\" in November and provided it to a FBI source. She allegedly worked with Page, 32, to obtain and build the bombs, and to recruit participants for the plan. Essayli said Carroll's \"bomb plot was explicit,\" and included instructions for building the devices and targets across Orange County and Los Angeles.",
      "\"These bombs were to blow up at the same time, on midnight this New Year's Eve,\" said Akil Davis, FBI assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office. \"The plan stated that the IEDs would be complex pipe bombs. It included instructions on how to manufacture the bombs and contained guidance on how to avoid leaving evidence behind that can be traced back to them.\"",
      "Carroll and Page also allegedly discussed plans to target federal immigration agents and vehicles with pipe bombs after the bombings, according to Essayli.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against the BBC on Monday over a documentary that spliced parts of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech on the Ellipse.",
      "The suit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, includes one count of defamation and one count of violating a Florida trade practices law. Mr. Trump's legal team asked for $5 billion in damages for each count, for a total of $10 billion.",
      "In a 33-page complaint, attorneys for Mr. Trump accused the BBC of publishing a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction\" of him in a BBC \"Panorama\" documentary that aired in the U.K. a week before the 2024 election. One portion of the documentary focused on Mr. Trump's words and actions leading up to the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The lawsuit claims that the BBC \"intentionally and maliciously sought to fully mislead its viewers\" by \"splicing together\" two clips of the same speech that Mr. Trump gave to supporters in Washington, D.C., before the riots began.",
      "Mr. Trump's legal team claims that the two clips were 55 minutes apart, and the BBC's edit omitted \"his statement calling for peace\" in his speech. The president had directed his supporters to go to Capitol Hill, where lawmakers were soon to vote to confirm election results in favor of former President Joe Biden.",
      "The lawsuit also alleges that \"concerns\" about the documentary were raised internally at the network ahead of air \"but the BBC ignored those concerns and did not take corrective action,\" citing a report by the Telegraph newspaper.",
      "In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Trump's legal team said in part that the BBC has a \"long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda.\"",
      "A BBC spokesperson said the broadcaster \"will be defending this case.\"",
      "Critics of the \"Panorama\" documentary say it makes the president look like he was urging people to attack the Capitol. Mr. Trump's critics have long argued that his words on Jan. 6 \u2014 and his false claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election \u2014 fueled the riot. The president has defended his conduct, saying he used only \"beautiful words\" on Jan. 6, but the BBC used \"terrible words.\"",
      "\"I'm suing the BBC for putting words in my mouth, literally,\" the president said Monday. \"They put words in my mouth. They had me saying things that I never said, coming out. I guess they used AI or something.\"",
      "In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has threatened to sue the BBC unless it retracted the documentary and offered financial compensation.",
      "In November, the BBC apologized to Mr. Trump for the episode, but declined to compensate him for it. In a statement at the time, the BBC said it \"strongly disagree[s]\" that there's a basis for a defamation claim. BBC Director-General Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness resigned amid the editing controversy.",
      "A lawyer for the BBC wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump's legal team that the broadcaster had \"no intention of misleading anyone. He argued the president can't show that the BBC acted with \"actual malice,\" meaning it intentionally or recklessly published false information \u2014 a prerequisite for most defamation suits against public figures in the U.S.",
      "The attorney also argued the president cannot sue the BBC in Florida because the documentary was not aired in the U.S. or made available on the BBC's website for American viewers.",
      "Despite the apology, the president's legal filing says, the network has \"made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses.\" Mr. Trump's lawyers also argued that the BBC can be sued in Florida because the \"Panorama\" documentary was available to U.S. viewers on its BritBox streaming service.",
      "Last month, U.K.-based attorney Mark Stephens told CBS News that Mr. Trump was \"clearly owed a fulsome apology,\" but any lawsuit would face \"a number of legal impediments and tripwires.\"",
      "First, Stephens said, was that the program which included the clip was not shown on television in the U.S.",
      "\"You can't be lowered in the estimation of right-thinking people by a program that wasn't seen by an American audience. So you can't sue, there's no jurisdiction to sue, in America,\" he said.",
      "He also said that because Mr. Trump is \"the president, the ultimate public figure,\" criticism of him would likely be protected under the First Amendment.",
      "Even if the case got past those hurdles, which he doubted, Stephens said, \"lawyers would be looking at whether or not the sting of this was true. And they can point to all sorts of previous judicial findings which have said that there was some measure of incitement in which the president was involved.\"",

    "summary": "Rep. Jamie Raskin wants to see White House construction like President Trump's ballroom project subjected to the same scrutiny as other federal projects.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland plans to introduce legislation Tuesday that would subject White House renovations like President Trump's ballroom project to the same reviews as other federal projects. Currently, the White House is exempt from certain oversight under the National Historic Preservation Act.",
      "Raskin's bill, called the \"People's White House Historic Preservation Act,\" would require White House renovations to undergo a so-called \"Section 106 review,\" a pre-ground breaking assessment that addresses the impact of renovations on historic buildings and allows the public to weigh in.",
      "The legislation comes three months after construction crews began work on a privately-financed, 90,000-square-foot ballroom addition that will cost about $300 million. A construction crane hangs over the site where the East Wing once stood. It was demolished in late October, even though President Trump had previously said the new construction would be \"near it but not touching it \u2014 and pays total respect to the existing building.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has reveled in how easy it's been to fast track the project. In October, Mr. Trump recounted being told, \"Sir, this is the White House, you're the president of the United States, you can do anything you want.\"",
      "\"It's kings who treat public property as private property,\" Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, told CBS News in a phone interview. \"It's not his house; it's our house. And if there is going to be construction and renovation expansion or changes, that should go through a regular public process.\"",
      "The White House asserts Mr. Trump has \"full legal authority to modernize, renovate, and beautify the White House.\"",
      "Aside from renderings Mr. Trump has shown at various events, ballroom schematics have faced little formal scrutiny \u2014 but that may soon change.",
      "In a court filing late Monday, the administration said consultations \"will soon be underway\" with the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, two independent advisory boards overseeing federal projects in the Washington area. The administration added that it was not legally bound to confer with either board and that above-ground ballroom construction would begin in April at the earliest.",
      "Raskin's bill would mandate consultations with both commissions prior to ground breaking.",
      "At its monthly meeting in early December, NCPC chairman Will Scharf, who is also a White House staffer, said the White House was not required to submit demolition plans because the commission only oversees new construction.",
      "\"We simply do not have jurisdiction over demolition and site preparation work; that what we're really concerned about here is visible architecture \u2014 is above-ground build,\" Scharf said, adding that NCPC would play a \"constructive role\" when the time comes.",
      "Raskin argues that leveling the East Wing without a review process was a violation of destruction of federal property laws, though he acknowledges the president cannot be prosecuted under those statutes.",
      "Currently, Raskin's legislation has 27 Democratic co-sponsors. With Republicans in control of the House, the measure faces long odds.",
      "\"I hope that there are enough champions of the public-private distinction in the Republican caucus that we can bring some over,\" Raskin said.",
      "Last week, National Trust for Historic Preservation filed a lawsuit seeking to halt ballroom construction. \"No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever \u2014 not President Trump, not President Biden, not anyone else,\" the Trust's suit said. \"And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.\"",
      "In response, the administration said the Trust's complaint was moot \"because the demolition has already occurred and cannot be undone.\"",
      "An initial hearing in the case is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon in Washington.",
      "Jennifer  Jacobs and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Meanwhile, a Sept. 2 strike that started off the campaign has drawn scrutiny after reports emerged that two people in the vessel survived the initial hit but were killed in a follow-on strike. Democrats who watched a video of the Sept. 2 operation decried the decision, and some critics have warned that killing shipwrecked survivors could constitute a war crime. Republicans have defended the follow-on strike, arguing the survivors may have still been in the fight.",
      "The boat strikes are part of a broader U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean and near Latin America, with several naval vessels \u2014 including the USS Gerald R. Ford \u2014 and fighter jets shifting to the region in recent months.",
      "The administration has heaped pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of collaborating with drug cartels, and it has also argued that Colombia has failed to crack down on drug trafficking. Both countries have criticized the boat strikes, and the Venezuelan government has accused the Trump administration of seeking regime change.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-backed-white-house-ballroom-expected-to-be-completed-in-summer-2028-national-park-service-says/",
    "published": "Mon, 15 Dec 2025 22:43:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's White House ballroom addition is expected to be finished a few months before the 2028 elections.",
    "story": [
      "Construction of the White House's planned $300 million ballroom is expected to be completed in the summer of 2028, just months before President Trump leaves office, according to an environmental assessment prepared by the National Park Service in late August.",
      "The assessment finds some shortcomings in the presidential project, mostly stemming from the sheer size of the new structure. The 90,000 square-foot building \u2014 nearly double the size of the existing executive mansion \u2014 will \"disrupt the historical continuity of the White House grounds and alter the architectural integrity of the east side of the property,\" it found.",
      "\"The new building's larger footprint and height will dominate the eastern portion of the site, creating a visual imbalance with the more modestly scaled West Wing and Executive Mansion,\" the report continues. \"These changes will adversely alter the design, setting, and feeling of the White House and the grounds over the long-term.\"",
      "However, it goes on to conclude that the space will be beneficial for large gatherings, perpetual changes and adaptations are part of the White House's history, and the ballroom annex \"will not result in a significant adverse impact to historic buildings.\"",
      "The report was prepared by NPS Deputy Director Frank Land and approved by Jessica Bowron, the service's acting director.",
      "When the ballroom project was announced on July 31, President Trump said the ballroom addition \"won't interfere with the current building. \u2026 It will be near it but not touching it.\"",
      "But less than a month later, the plan changed. The Aug. 28 document concluded, \"The existing East Wing and East Colonnade will be deconstructed.\" The East Wing was ultimately torn down in late October.",
      "Prior to demolition, the Park Service said all museum collections, artifacts, and paintings would be removed from the East Wing and preserved. Steps were also taken to potentially reinstall wood paneling, light fixtures, interior columns and items from the East Wing movie theater.",
      "Preservationists also saved the commemorative cornerstone and the bronze plaque from the East Wing's 1942 renovation, two fanlight windows and the Kennedy Garden arbor.",
      "The environmental assessment contains design details of the new ballroom, which will be attached to the executive mansion via a bi-level corridor.",
      "\"Materials will include a white painted exterior, historically compatible windows and doors, and an architecturally compatible roof,\" it says. \"Interior finishes will include stone slab flooring, decorative plaster moldings, and high-quality finishes for elevator cabs.\"",
      "The East Wing has long served as the visitors' entrance for formal White House events and tours \u2014 and it will continue to do so. In addition, \"Ground-floor restrooms will support events on the South Lawn,\" the document said.",
      "The NPS environmental assessment emerged from a lawsuit filed by the Trust for Historic Preservation that seeks to halt ballroom construction. The suit alleged that the Trump administration skirted federal law by tearing down the East Wing and drawing up plans for a massive new ballroom without going through a review process. The government has argued that the president has extensive power to make changes to the White House.",
      "Overall, the NPS assessment found that the project will cause \"no significant impact.\"",
      "But that does not mean no impact at all.",
      "Trees and shrubs, including commemorative Southern Magnolias planted in the 1940s, will be removed from the lawn due to the size of the 90,000-square-foot addition.",
      "President Trump has complained about temporary tents brought in for large events like state dinners. While the ballroom will eliminate the needs for those structures, NPS assesses that \"views of the White House from Lafayette Park and the Ellipse will be permanently altered due to the modifications to the East Wing.",
      "One view won't be changed: the vista from the White House to the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial.",
      "In reaching its \"no significant impact\" finding, the National Park Service's analysis examined various facets of the project \u2014 cultural landscape, historic buildings, visitor access and experience, public health and safety, economic impact and quality of life of the American people.",
      "The East Garden will be removed and reinstalled. Bricks, a fountain and a statue will be \"carefully dismantled and preserved for future reinstallation,\" it said.",
      "The assessment anticipated that grass would need to be replaced and roads repaved because of damage from heavy construction equipment.",
      "It also warned that construction vibrations \"could affect the structural stability or finishes of the Executive Mansion and adjacent features.\"",
      "The NPS said it would document the now-demolished East Wing's interior and exterior with a 3-D survey and high resolution photographs.",
      "The park service also considered the impact on endangered species native to the region including the northern long-eared bat, tricolored bat and monarch butterfly. Ultimately it found \"no meaningful, measurable or noticeable impact\" on the animals.",

      "Former President Barack Obama urged Democrats to \"meet the moment\" at a Los Angeles fundraiser with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday.",
      "\"The short-term strategy is, win the House of Representatives,\" stated the former president, garnering applause. \"Because that's going to be the circuit breaker that will give us control of one major component of the federal government. With that as a bulwark, we're now able to block some of the worst impulses that are coming out of this White House.\"",
      "The former president laid out a two-pronged strategy for Democrats: to reclaim a House majority next year, and to work on honing the party's messaging in the coming years.",
      "\"Long term, let's tell a story, a better story about who we are as Americans and what we share,\" Obama said, according to excerpts shared with CBS News. \"We have to tell the story that makes people who feel outside that process, we've got to bring them back in.\"",
      "He also encouraged Democrats to remain unified.",
      "\"The truth is that AOC and Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders and Blue Dog, they actually agree in making sure that people have a living wage, they can support a family,\" Obama said, arguing that most Americans aren't focused on the party's \"nerdy,\" \"college seminar\"-style internal debates. \"Of course there are going to be some tactical differences, but that shouldn't be our primary concern because we're fighting a bigger fight.\"",
      "The conversation with Leader Jeffries, who he alluded to as the \"soon-to-be Speaker,\" was part of an event held by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the fundraising arm for House Democrats.",
      "\"The most important thing that we need to do is to win back control of the House of Representatives, as President Obama indicated, as part of the path to ending this national nightmare in the United States of America and moving toward a more perfect union,\" Jeffries told CBS News.",
      "Their discussion on Sunday\u00a0also touched on redistricting efforts across the country as well as how to address the affordability crisis.",
      "\"If we bring energy and clarity and commitment to talking about things like affordability and making sure people have health care when they need it, and that they have the ability, if they work hard, to be able to support a family and create a better future for their children and their grandchildren, \u2026 it resonates with people, and we have to have confidence in that,\" Obama said.",
      "Most Democrats are keen to focus on economic frustrations in the midterms. A late November CBS News poll found public sentiment about the economy hit its lowest level this year with only 32% of respondents describing it as \"good.\" Nearly two-thirds said prices are going up, while 77% said President Trump is not spending enough time on the economy and inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump traveled to Pennsylvania last week to tout his economic agenda and promote a GOP tax cut bill passed earlier this year. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Friday, the president wouldn't say if his policies would boost congressional Republicans' prospects at the ballot box next fall.",
      "\"I can't tell you. I don't know when all of this money is going to kick in,\" he told the paper.",
      "\"We'll see what happens,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We should win. But, you know, statistically, it's very tough to win. Yeah, it doesn't make sense.\"",
      "Obama described Mr. Trump's ascendance as a \"wake-up call,\" but said he was \"not entirely surprised\" by recent off-year Democratic wins.",
      "The former president campaigned this fall for gubernatorial candidates Mikie Sherill of New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, who both won their races in November by double-digit margins. Obama pointed to Democrats' newfound optimism since those victories, noting that he spent much of his time after Mr. Trump's return to office \"talking people off of ledges.\"",

    "story": [
      "Hours after Jimmy Lai, a businessman and pro-democracy newspaper owner in Hong Kong, was found guilty on national security and sedition charges, his daughter Claire Lai told reporters in Washington, D.C., she hopes international pressure can spare her father from spending the rest of his life in prison.",
      "\"We expected the verdict,\" she told CBS News. \"As much as you can expect that, you can only be so ready for it. So I am grieving.\"",
      "Lai, 78, was found guilty on three charges: one sedition charge and two charges of violating the National Security Law, a controversial Hong Kong law instituted in 2020 following pro-democracy protests in 2019. The charges were conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country and conspiracy to publish seditious material.",
      "Lai is the founder of Apple Daily, a pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong that was often sharply critical of the Chinese government and its growing influence over the city. The paper closed in 2021 after police raided the newsroom, arrested reporters and froze the publication's assets. Jimmy Lai was arrested in 2020 and held in custody since.",
      "Jonathan Price, part of Jimmy Lai's international legal team, said the results of the trial were unsurprising, but argued they reflect China's reneging of commitments to the rule of law in Hong Kong and agreements made between the British and Chinese governments when Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997. The government in Beijing had agreed to grant Hong Kong autonomy until at least 2047, but it has increasingly exerted control over the enclave.",
      "\"It's 855 pages of obfuscation, fluff, diversion with some colorful language, but no substance,\" he told CBS News. \"It's extraordinary that a document of that length involving a case about someone who ran a press organization doesn't mention substantively, press freedom, freedom of speech, freedom to protest, or any human rights.\"",
      "Claire Lai last spoke to her father in June of this year, and said his condition has noticeably deteriorated. She described that his nails are changing colors and falling off and his teeth are rotting. She also worries about his diabetes and heart palpitations. She blames his prison conditions and solitary confinement for his deterioration.",
      "Claire Lai, her family and her legal team fear that appeals could take over 8 years and fear Jimmy Lai may not live long enough to endure the process.",
      "\"My father does not have eight years. If we wait to the end of the appeals process, there will not be a man at the end of that process,\" she told CBS News.",
      "On Monday, President Trump and British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper both called for the release of Jimmy Lai.",
      "In the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said, \"I feel so badly. I spoke to President Xi about it, and I asked to consider his release. He's not well. He's an older man, and he's not well. So I did put that request out, we'll see what happens.\"",
      "Cooper emphasized that Jimmy Lai is a British citizen and told Parliament that she had summoned the Chinese Ambassador after hearing the verdict.",
      "\"But for the sake of Jimmy Lai, for his family, but also for the people of Hong Kong, for the joint Declaration we signed, and for the rule of law, we will not relent on this,\" she said. \"Joined by nations across the world, we call again for the immediate release of Jimmy Lai.\"",
      "Earlier in the year, Claire Lai met with members of Congress on Capitol Hill, culminating in a bipartisan letter asking for her father's release.",
      "As the holidays near, Claire Lai remembers the few times she saw her father a year since 2020, on their birthdays and Christmas. She said she hopes she can see her father again someday, without their conversations recorded and without armed prison guards standing by.",
      "\"One of the many things I've learned from my father is that you have to face adversity and difficulties with a certain degree of cheer and spirit,\" she told CBS News. \"My father has shown that not even his failing health can alleviate him of the burden of truth, and that's why he chose to take the stand for so many days.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump took to social media on Monday to disparage the political views of actor and director Rob Reiner a day after Reiner and his wife Michele were found dead in their Los Angeles home in what police are calling an apparent homicide. The president's comments were quickly condemned by a number of lawmakers of both parties.",
      "Nick Reiner, the couple's 32-year-old son, has been arrested\u00a0for murder and is now being held without bail, police said Monday.",
      "Although there is no evidence that has been made public that connects Reiner's death to his political views, the president linked the director's killing with what he called his \"TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.\"",
      "\"A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.\"",
      "Reiner was a longtime activist and prolific Democratic fundraiser who\u00a0 gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes over the course of his life. And he was also a longtime critic of Mr. Trump, referring to him during his first term as \"mentally unfit\" and \"unqualified\" to be president.",
      "Mr. Trump said of Reiner, \"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before.\" His post concluded, \"May Rob and Michele rest in peace!\"",
      "An official White House account reposted the president's social media post on X.",
      "A reporter asked the president later Monday if he stands by his post. Mr. Trump did not apologize.",
      "\"Well, I wasn't a fan of his at all,\" the president said. \"He was a deranged person, as fall as Trump was concerned,\" he said, saying Reiner was \"one of the people behind\" the \"Russia hoax.\" \"I think he hurt himself career-wise. Became like a deranged person. Trump derangement syndrome. So I was not a fan of Rob Reiner in any way, shape or form. I thought he was very bad for our country.\"",
      "The president's post drew immediate reactions on social media and from lawmakers of both parties.",
      "Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana told reporters that Mr. Trump \"should've said nothing.\"",
      "\"I think when the president says these sorts of things, it detracts from his policy achievements and his agenda,\" Kennedy said.",
      "He continued: \"And just speaking personally, when someone is murdered or assassinated, as happened to Mr. Kirk, we should show him and his family respect,\" referring to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "Jenna Ellis, a former lawyer for Mr. Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, condemned\u00a0the president's message in a post on X.",
      "\"A man and his wife were murdered last night,\" she wrote. \"This is NOT the appropriate response. The Right uniformly condemned political and celebratory responses to Charlie Kirk's death. This is a horrible example from Trump (and surprising considering the two attempts on his own life) and should be condemned by everyone with any decency.\" In 2023, Ellis\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in Georgia to a felony charge of aiding and abetting false statements and writing over alleged efforts to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election.",
      "Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky\u00a0wrote on X, \"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered. I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.\"",
      "Sen. Alex Padilla, a Democrat from California, told CBS News, \"Donald Trump's tirade, just hours after Rob and Michele Reiner's tragic murder, is disgusting and deranged. No matter your politics, this tragedy should be mourned and the violence condemned, not exploited.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland, a former federal prosecutor, told CBS News, \"Trump's statement is sick and dangerous because he suggests the Reiners' killings were because they were vocal critics of the Trump administration.\" He also criticized the president's comments as divisive, adding, \"This rhetoric divides the country, paints targets on private citizens and risks inciting political violence. A president should lower the temperature, not inflame it.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma wrote on X, \"A father and mother were murdered at the hands of their troubled son. We should be lifting the family up in prayer, not making this about politics.\"",
      "And Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who's been targeted by Mr. Trump for pressing the government to release files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, noted in response to the president's post that the Reiners' son \"reportedly had drug addiction and other issues, and their remaining children are left in serious mourning and heartbreak.\"",
      "\"This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,\" Greene continued. \"Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.\"",

    "summary": "Known as a popular Hollywood director, Rob Reiner also had a lengthy record of political and civic activism, especially in California.",
    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner was known for decades as a Hollywood luminary, finding early success as a sitcom star before going on to become one of the most prominent directors in the industry. But he also dedicated much of his life to political activism, with a long record of backing Democratic Party campaigns nationwide and supporting landmark policies for LGBTQ rights and childhood development in his home state of California.",
      "In the wake of his death, that legacy is being remembered by some of the country's leading political figures.",
      "Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead Sunday in their Los Angeles home, and police said Monday that their son, Nick Reiner, 32, has been\u00a0arrested for murder.",
      "Former President Barack Obama said he and Michelle Obama were \"heartbroken\" by the news. Reiner, he wrote, displayed \"a deep belief in the goodness of people \u2014 and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired,.\"",
      "Similar sentiments were shared by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who previously represented California in the U.S. Senate, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, both of whom referred to the Reiners as \"dear friends.\"",
      "\"Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy,\" Harris\u00a0wrote on X.",
      "Pelosi's post highlighted Reiner's deep history of activism in California, referencing his efforts to help secure marriage equality and a program supporting early childhood development in the state.",
      "\"Personally, Rob cared deeply about people and demonstrated that in his civic activities \u2014 whether by supporting the First 5 initiative or fighting against Prop 8 in California,\" Pelosi wrote, adding that he was also \"a champion for the First Amendment and the creative rights of artists.\"",
      "Reiner led the campaign to pass California's First 5 initiative in 1998. Also known as the California Children and Families Initiative, it's \"dedicated to improving the lives of California's young children and their families through a comprehensive system of education, health services, childcare, and other crucial programs,\" according to its mission statement. Funding for the initiative comes from a statewide tax on tobacco. Reiner chaired the organization from 1999 to 2006.",
      "Later, Reiner joined the board of directors at the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a nonprofit organization that brought a crucial federal court challenge against Proposition 8, California's now-defunct 2008 ban on same-sex marriage. He and his wife were among the organization's founding board members, and Michele Reiner went on to serve as its treasurer. They were driving forces in its successful effort to pursue legal protection for marriage equality in California and several other states, before the Supreme Court finally upheld it nationwide.",
      "Reiner was also an environmental advocate. He founded an environmental campaign in the early 2000s to protect California's Ahmanson Ranch as a state park and wildlife preserve, and prevent it from becoming a site for real estate development, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "Reiner lent his support to the campaigns of numerous Democratic candidates, including Al Gore during the 2000 presidential election and Hillary Clinton's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton\u00a0said\u00a0in a post on X that Rob and Michele Reiner \"inspired and uplifted millions through their work on film and television. And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defense of inclusive democracy, setting an example for us all to follow. Hillary and I will always be grateful for their friendship, unfailing kindness, and support.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden praised the Reiners' \"extraordinary contributions\" and wrote, \"We take solace in knowing their work will live on for generations to come.\"",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom both shared their appreciation of Reiner's political achievements in their state. Newsom described Reiner as a \"big-hearted genius\" with \"boundless empathy,\" who \"made California a better place through his good works.\" Bass called Reiner's death \"is a devastating loss\" for Los Angeles and the nation.",
      "\"Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,\" Bass wrote, adding that, as an activist, \"he always used his gifts in service of others.\"",
      "Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump, which drew the ire of the president. In social media posts and comments at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump accused Reiner of \"Trump derangement syndrome\" and said, \"I wasn't a fan of his at all.\" The president's comments were condemned by a number of Republicans as well as Democrats.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed an order designating illicit fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, directing agencies to do more to combat the drug.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday signed an executive order designating illicit fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, directing the Pentagon and Justice Department to take additional steps to combat production and distribution of the drug and its precursors.",
      "The executive order casts fentanyl as not just a lethal drug, but as a potential chemical weapon. The White House says the move \"unleashes every tool to combat the cartels and foreign networks responsible for flooding communities with this deadly substance,\" warning that fentanyl could be weaponized for \"concentrated, large-scale terror attacks by organized adversaries.\"",
      "The designation means the Pentagon could aid the Justice Department with Department of Defense assets to enforce the criminal code related to fentanyl, and the Justice Department will likely pursue harsher penalties for fentanyl-related crimes.",
      "The order comes as the president has said he is preparing to expand the U.S. campaign against alleged drug traffickers in South America, following more than 20 boat strikes against vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. Most of the fentanyl that enters the U.S. is manufactured in Mexico using chemicals primarily imported from China and India. The drug is then smuggled into the U.S., mostly through ports of entry.",
      "\"With this historic executive order ... we're formally classifying as a weapon of mass destruction, which is what it is,\" the president said at the White House. \"No bomb does what this has done. 200,000 to 300,000 people die every year, that we know of. So we're formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction.\"",
      "Fentanyl overdose is the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 45. The Drug Enforcement Administration says more than 107,000 people died from a drug overdose in the U.S. in 2023, and nearly 70% of those deaths were attributed to opioids like fentanyl.",
      "The president's executive order describes illicit fentanyl as fentanyl that is manufactured, distributed, dispensed or possessed in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. It makes no mention of fentanyl used legally in medical settings.",
      "The FBI defines a WMD as a \"destructive device, such as an explosive or incendiary bomb, rocket, or grenade; a weapon that is designed to cause death or serious injury through toxic or poisonous chemical; a weapon that contains a biological agent or toxin;\" or \"a weapon that is designed to release dangerous levels of radiation or radioactivity.\"",
      "Some members of Congress previously sought to classify fentanyl as a WMD.",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Dec 2025 16:35:48 -0500",
    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California, Missouri and North Carolina redistricting pushes could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "Several states undertook mid-decade redistricting efforts to try to alter the makeup of their congressional delegations this year, after President Trump began last summer to press Republican-led states to increase the number of GOP-friendly districts to help his party hold the House in next year's midterm elections.",
      "Indiana became the first of these to reject a new map proposed by GOP legislators to redraw the state's congressional districts so that all nine congressional districts would be favorable to Republicans.",
      "Texas was the first to kick off the gerrymandering push, when\u00a0Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the districts and create five GOP-friendly seats. In California,\u00a0Gov. Gavin Newsom,\u00a0in turn, launched an effort to redraw his state's map to help Democrats. In November, the plan was approved by voters by a 29-point margin.",
      "In Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map in September to squeeze Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district. Then in October, North Carolina state Republicans\u00a0redrew the 1st Congressional District, held by a Democrat, to make it more favorable to conservatives.",
      "But Republicans in Indiana's state Senate rejected the redistricting measure in a 31-19 vote on Dec. 11, despite the GOP's 40-10 advantage in the chamber. Ahead of the vote, as the lawmakers faced intense pressure from Mr. Trump and other members of his administration, Indiana state police said they had received \"numerous\" bomb threats and swatting hoaxes against state senators.",
      "Utah lawmakers also reworked their state's map after a judge ruled the current districts violated restrictions on gerrymandering. All four of the state's House districts are represented by Republicans, but a judge in November threw out the GOP-controlled legislature's map and ordered one that will create a Democratic-leaning district in Salt Lake City.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See how maps passed in Texas, California, North Carolina and Missouri could change their congressional makeup",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, with 25 held by Republicans and 13 by Democrats.",
      "Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold, but they've made inroads. In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump, though they reelected their Democratic congressional representatives. The maps were designed to increase those gains and box out the two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "On Nov. 18, a three-judge panel in the U.S. District Court in El Paso blocked Texas from using the maps approved by the legislature in August. The court said that the plaintiffs will likely succeed in showing that race predominated over partisanship in the map-making process, and said the legislature appears to have set and followed a racial target.",
      "Abbott appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ultimately restored the map passed this summer.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, with nine Republicans and 43 Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three seats held by Democrats for the first time since 1994. They've hung onto two of them, including GOP Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the northeastern-most part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Gov. Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",
      "Opponents of the map submitted in early December more than 300,000 signatures on a petition to force a ballot measure on the new map. A judge is currently reviewing if the signatures are valid.",
      "North Carolina has 14 congressional seats, 10 of which are held by Republicans. But the state is not as solidly red as that breakdown would suggest \u2014 it's closer to a 50/50 state at the presidential level these days, and the state's governor and attorney general are both Democrats.",
      "In the redistricting push undertaken this fall, North Carolina Republicans are targeting a single seat: Rep. Don Davis' 1st Congressional District. Davis' win in 2024 in the northeastern part of the state was a rare bright spot for Democrats, especially after Republicans were able to flip congressional three seats in North Carolina that year.",
      "In the map passed by the North Carolina Assembly on Oct. 21 and 22, Davis' district boundaries move further south, into the current 3rd District. That changes the makeup of the district from one that was 48% Democratic to one that is 44% Democratic.",
      "See how maps of how court-ordered redistricting could change Utah's congressional makeup",
      "Utah differs from the other states here, among other reasons, because there are no Democrats among the four members of its congressional delegation. And its 2025 redistricting effort was put in motion when a judge ruled the current districts violated a voter-approved measure to prevent partisan gerrymandering.",
      "The GOP-controlled legislature produced four maps for public comment, and on Oct. 6, approved a map that would be the least competitive for Democrats. The legislature proposed a map that would split Salt Lake County into two districts, which would make Districts 2 and 3 more competitive for Democrats.",
      "But a district court judge in Utah on Nov. 10 rejected redistricting maps selected by the Republican-controlled legislature and instead selected a map that would create a Democratic-leaning congressional district in Salt Lake City. The map approved by the legislature \"does not comply with Utah law,\" wrote 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson in her opinion. She continued that \"based on the evidence presented,\" the legislature's map \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\"",
      "The maps enacted by Gibson create a new district encompassing Salt Lake City that would be 62% Democratic, based on the 2024 presidential results.",
      "See maps of how Indiana's failed redistricting would have changed their congressional makeup",
      "Indiana state lawmakers initially resisted the Trump administration's pressure to redraw their map to edge out the two Democratic seats. When Republican Gov. Mike Braun called a special session in November, Senate President Rodric Bray said publicly the votes weren't there, and when the legislature convened, it only agreed to meet again in January for the regular session.",
      "But lawmakers reversed course in November and said they would reconvene to take up redistricting. On Dec. 1, Indiana House Republicans unveiled their proposed map, which significantly changes the boundaries of District 1 and District 7.",
      "In the proposed map, District 1, which includes Gary, Indiana, and other Chicago suburbs, is redrawn so voters would have been spread through Districts 2 and 4. All three districts are between 40-44% Democratic under the proposed map. The map also broke up the heavily Democratic District 7, which currently includes most of Indianapolis and backed Harris with 71% of its vote. It would be split, with its population absorbed into several Republican districts.",
      "Republicans have a trifecta in Indiana government, and although the map passed the Indiana House easily, it failed to garner support in the state Senate. During public hearings on the map, 127 people signed up to testify and of those, just 18 of them backed the bill, while the rest were opposed.",
      "Despite Republicans; 40-10 advantage in the Indiana Senate, the bill failed, with 31 votes against and 19 in favor. Bray indicated it will not come up again during the regular session, saying after the vote \"it's time to turn the page.\" Mr. Trump has vowed to primary Republicans who voted against the measure.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jan-6-police-hero-democrats-witness-trump/",
    "published": "Sun, 14 Dec 2025 21:55:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Daniel Hodges, a D.C. metropolitan police officer, says he's trying to block the whitewashing of the history of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot.",
    "story": [
      "Daniel Hodges thinks of himself as an introvert \u2014 he's soft-spoken and says he's averse to the spotlight. At night, he's a local police officer in Washington, D.C. But during his off-duty hours this year, Hodges has become a unique and very public advocate on Capitol Hill.",
      "He told CBS News he's trying to be a firewall to block the whitewashing of the history of the Jan. 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol siege.",
      "\"The only thing that will stop me is if people stop lying about Jan. 6 and just acknowledge what the day was and what really transpired,\" Hodges said.",
      "He was among the more than 140 police officers injured while trying to stop the U.S. Capitol insurrection.",
      "With Republicans now in control of the White House and Congress and some in the party downplaying the severity of the Capitol siege, there are limited platforms for victims of the attack to talk about its impact on their lives.",
      "Hodges has become a go-to witness for Democrats in congressional hearings about police safety.",
      "The mission generates some stress and conflict for Hodges. At an October subcommittee hearing in the Senate, Hodges watched as three of his fellow witnesses raised their hands, when asked if they supported President Trump's pardons of the Jan. 6 attackers, including those who had beaten Hodges. One of the witnesses who raised his hand was a former homeland security secretary during President Trump's first administration.",
      "As the minority in the House and the Senate, Democrats are permitted to call one witness at most hearings, to serve as a \"minority party\" witness who provides a counterpoint to the witnesses called by the majority.",
      "Twice this autumn, Democrats have called on Hodges.",
      "\"The power of Dan Hodges's narrative comes from the self-control he displays,\" said Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat who is the ranking Democrat of a Senate judiciary subcommittee that called Hodges to testify in October. Welch said Hodges, \"erased any of the legitimate anger he may have had about Jan. 6,\u00a0 to just tell us what happened during the hearing.\"",
      "Democrats argue Hodges' testimony and presence at congressional hearings underscores the hypocrisy of Trump supporters who are making public statements in support of tougher laws or policies to protect police at the same time they're downplaying the attacks on law enforcement officers on Jan. 6.",
      "Welch noted that Republicans declined to ask Hodges any questions or speak to him in the hearing room after the testimony.",
      "\"You have to do an immense amount of intellectual and emotional jujitsu to pretend you didn't hear what Hodges said or acknowledge the reality of what he experienced,\" Welch said.",
      "At a Dec. 3 hearing convened by the House Homeland Security Committee titled \"When Badges Become Targets: How Anti-Law Enforcement Rhetoric Fuels Violence Against Officers,\" Hodges testified that Mr. Trump's mass pardon of more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants emboldens and encourages further violence against police.",
      "\"The press release announcing this hearing made it sound like certain participants were going to spend a few hours scratching their heads and pretending to not understand why threats against law enforcement have risen so sharply this year, and I cannot abide such a farce,\" Hodges said in his opening statement.",
      "Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who called Hodges as a witness for the hearing, said he did so to combat \"pervasive misinformation.\"",
      "Thompson told CBS News, \"Everybody saw Jan. 6 with their own eyes. But Trump has convinced a\u00a0 large percentage of the population that those were not insurrectionists.\"",
      "At an October hearing in the Senate titled \"Politically Violent Attacks: A Threat to Our Constitutional Order,\" Hodges was the sole witness called by Democrats.",
      "\"I am intimately familiar with political violence, as when I fought to defend the United States Capitol and many of your very lives, I was beaten, bloodied, and crushed, with my eye gouged and skull smashed with my own baton,\" Hodges testified.",
      "He criticized Republicans on the panel for not acknowledging the Capitol riot, telling them,\u00a0 \"My colleagues were under attack by a mob.\"",
      "Hodges said Republican members of the panels did not ask him questions about Jan. 6 during the public hearings of the committees, nor did they thank him after the proceedings. Spokespeople for the Republican chairmen of the panels at which Hodges has testified this year did not respond to CBS News requests for comment about Hodges's testimony.",
      "At a House hearing this month in which Hodges appeared as a witness, the Republican chair of the committee opened the proceedings with broader statements about the risk of \"inflammatory rhetoric\" endangering the lives of law enforcement and risking homeland security, including recent rhetoric criticizing federal immigration agents.",
      "Hodges spoke with CBS News as a private citizen, not as a representative of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C.",
      "He had testified previously before a national audience, in 2021 at a public hearing of the House Jan. 6 select committee, which investigated the causes and impact of the riot.",
      "Mr. Trump's victory in 2024 and his first-day pardons of the riot defendants have triggered criticisms of the administration that it is ignoring \u2013 or rewriting \u2013 the history of the siege.",
      "In issuing the clemency of Capitol riot defendants, the White House said the President's decision\u00a0 \"ends a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins a process of national reconciliation.\"",
      "Hodges acknowledges he also has received threats and menacing amid his public statements.",
      "Former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who has attended some congressional hearings to support Hodges, told CBS News, \"Danny has been unwavering and cleared every obstacle he's faced, while continuing to serve.\"",
      "Dunn, who also testified and appeared at hearings of the House Jan. 6 select committee in 2021-22, said, \"Danny's and my mission has been the same. We're seeking accountability and justice against those who were responsible for the worst days of our lives.\"",
      "Hodges told CBS News it will be impossible to convince all Americans about the truth of the impact of Jan. 6 on the police victims. When asked if he's optimistic that the deniers of the violence of the siege will change their minds, Hodges paused before answering.",
      "\"There are still people out there who think the moon landing was fake and that the Holocaust wasn't real,\" he said. \"So you are not going to get 100%.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:25:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of yards of dinosaur tracks with toes and claws have been found in the Italian Alps in a region that will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "\"This set of dinosaur footprints is one of the largest collections in all of Europe, in the whole world,\" Attilio Fontana, head of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, said during a news conference.",
      "The tracks, which are over 200 million years old, were discovered in the Stelvio National Park, in an area between the towns of Bormio and Livigno, which host part of the Games.",
      "Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera first spotted the imprints in September in an almost vertical rocky slope.",
      "Some measured up to 16 inches in diameter.",
      "The collection \"extends for hundreds of meters and also represents a series of animal behaviors, because in addition to seeing animals walking together, there are also places where these animals meet,\" Fontana said.",
      "Della Ferrera called in paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso from Milan's Natural History Museum, who assembled a team of Italian experts to study the site.",
      "The museum released multiple images of the footprints uncovered in the so-called valley of dinosaurs\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"It's an immense scientific heritage,\" Dal Sasso said in the region's press release.",
      "\"The parallel walks are clear evidence of herds moving in synchrony, and there are also traces of more complex behaviors, such as groups of animals gathered in a circle, perhaps for defense.\"",
      "\"Impressions of the toes and even the claws\"",
      "The tracks, currently covered by snow and off the beaten track, are preserved in Upper Triassic dolomitic rocks, dating back approximately 210 million years.",
      "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
      "That suggests they belong to prosauropods, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads, which are considered the ancestors of the large sauropods of the Jurassic period like the Brontosaurus, the experts said.",
      "Prosauropods had sharp claws, and adults could reach up to 33 feet in length.",
      "There may also be tracks of predatory dinosaurs and archosaurs, the ancestors of crocodiles, the press release said.",
      "The prints are on an almost-vertical slope due to the formation of the Alpine chain.",
      "But when the dinosaurs walked through the area, it was formed of tidal flats that stretched for hundreds of miles, and the environment was tropical.",
      "\"The tracks were made when the sediments were still soft and saturated with water, on the broad tidal flats surrounding the Tethys Ocean,\" ichnologist Fabio Massimo Petti said, referring to a prehistoric ocean.",
      "\"The plasticity of those very fine calcareous muds, now transformed into rock, has in areas preserved truly remarkable anatomical details, such as impressions of the toes and even the claws,\" he said.",
      "The footprints were then covered by sediments which protected them, but with the uplift of the Alps and the erosion of the mountainside, they have been brought back into view.",
      "\"As the layers containing the tracks are diverse and overlapping, we have a unique opportunity to study the evolution of animals and their environment over time,\" geologist Fabrizio Berra said. \"Like reading the pages of a stone book.\"",
      "Other recent dinosaur track discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "Earlier this month, paleontologists in Bolivia said they found and meticulously documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "In March,\u00a0scientists in England\u00a0discovered a 650-foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some\u00a0200 dinosaur footprints\u00a0dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

    "summary": "Super-Earth TOI-561b is about 40 times closer to its host star than Mercury is to the sun.",
    "story": [
      "A rocky exoplanet outside the Earth's solar system may have an atmosphere, according to new evidence gathered by NASA researchers.",
      "The exoplanet, known as super-Earth TOI-561b, was discovered in 2020, according to NASA. Scientists have determined that the planet is ultra-hot, with a low density. It is about 1.4 times wider than Earth and orbits the sun in about 11 hours. Its host star is similar to Earth's sun in size and temperature, but the exoplanet is 40 times closer to that star than Mercury is to the sun, NASA said in a news release. Observations suggest the exoplanet has a global magma ocean and that it is surrounded by a thick layer of gas.",
      "The exoplanet's low density has surprised and baffled scientists, NASA said. It may have an unusual composition from planets in Earth's solar system. It could also be surrounded by a thick atmosphere, which would not be expected on an exoplanet with these features. But the James Webb Space Telescope helped scientists gather data that showed that unlikely scenario might be the case.",
      "Researchers used the telescope's Near-Infrared Spectrograph to measure the exoplanet's dayside temperature. If the exoplanet has no atmosphere, scientists estimated its dayside temperature would be about 4,900 degrees Fahrenheit. But the spectrograph found TOI-561b's temperature closer to 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit, far cooler than expected.",
      "Just determining the temperature of the exoplanet doesn't confirm if there is an atmosphere there, NASA said. The magma ocean could cause heat to circulate, or a thin layer of rock vapor could help cool the planet. But neither of those options is likely to account for the difference between the measured temperatures and what scientists expected.",
      "\"We really need a thick volatile-rich atmosphere to explain all the observations,\" said Anjali Piette, a researcher from England's University of Birmingham and a co-author of a study published Thursday that detailed the discoveries.",
      "Piette said an atmosphere would allow gases like water vapor to absorb some wavelengths of light, keeping the telescope's spectrograph from measuring them actually. The exoplanet may also have bright silicate clouds that can reflect starlight to cool the atmosphere, Piette said.",
      "Scientists suspect there may be some form of equilibrium between the exoplanet's atmosphere and its magma ocean, said study co-author Tim Lichtenberg, a researcher from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.",
      "\"At the same time that gases are coming out of the planet to feed the atmosphere, the magma ocean is sucking them back into the interior,\" Lichtenberg said. \"This planet must be much, much more volatile-rich than Earth to explain the observations. It's really like a wet lava ball.\"",
      "Scientists will learn more about TOI-561b as they study a data set gathered by the Webb telescope after it observed the exoplanet for more than 37 hours. The work will involve mapping the exoplanet's temperature and learning what its atmosphere may be made of.",
      "\"What's really exciting is that this new data set is opening up even more questions than it's answering,\" said Johanna Teske, the paper's lead author and a staff scientist at the Carnegie Science Earth and Planets Laboratory.",

      "Previous Person of the Year title-holders have held varying roles in a vast range of occupations, with President Trump taking last year's cover and Taylor Swift capturing the one before. In 2025,",
      "Time's 2025 honorific was given to the minds and financiers behind AI's rise to renown and notoriety, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son and Baidu CEO Robin Li, who spoke directly with the magazine for its feature story.",
      "\"Person of the Year is a powerful way to focus the world's attention on the people that shape our lives,\" wrote Sam Jacobs, Time's editor-in-chief, in\u00a0an editorial piece\u00a0about the magazine's decision. \"And this year, no one had a greater impact than the individuals who imagined, designed, and built AI.\"",
      "Jacobs described 2025 as \"the year when artificial intelligence's full potential roared into view, and when it became clear that there will be no turning back or opting out,\" adding: \"Whatever the question was, AI was the answer.\"",
      "The magazine prepared two separate covers for the issue. In one, artist Jason Seiler painted an interpretative recreation of the iconic 1932 photograph \"Lunch Atop a Skyscraper,\" an image that depicted workers seated side-by-side on a steel beam hanging high above New York City during the construction of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, which became a symbol of American resilience during the Great Depression.",
      "A cast of tech industry characters at the forefront of AI development are perched on the beam in Seiler's recreation. Mark Zuckerberg, of Meta, Lisa Su, of Advanced Micro Devices,\u00a0Elon Musk, of xAI, Sam Altman, of Open AI, Demis Hassabis, of DeepMind Technologies, Dario Amodei, of Anthropic, and Fei-Fei Li, of Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute, are all pictured, along with Huang.",
      "The second cover illustration, by artist Peter Crowther, places the same executives among scaffolding at what looks like a construction site for the giant letters \"AI.\"",
      "\"Every industry needs it, every company uses it, and every nation needs to build it,\" Huang said of balancing the pressures to implement AI responsibly and deploy it to the public as quickly as possible. \"This is the single most impactful technology of our time.\"",
      "Most of the industry figures pictured on Time's cover did not speak to the magazine for the story, so this year's spread mainly focuses on the implications \u2014 positive, negative and in between \u2014 of the companies they have built and the technology they continue forging.",
      "AI often took center stage in 2025 in investigative news reports, economic and academic studies, and in Washington, D.C., as policymakers grappled with how to regulate its evolution while tech giants scrambled to trump their competitors' inventions, as the use of some of them, like chatbots, grew to be commonplace, at times with tragic consequences.",
      "\"For these reasons, we recognize a force that has dominated the year's headlines, for better or for worse,\" Jacobs wrote in his editorial. \"For delivering the age of thinking machines, for wowing and worrying humanity, for transforming the present and transcending the possible, the Architects of AI are TIME's 2025 Person of the Year.\"",

    "summary": "Nationally, the measles case count is nearing 2,000 for a disease that has been considered eliminated in the U.S. since 2000, a result of routine childhood vaccinations.",
    "story": [
      "Measles outbreaks are growing along the Utah-Arizona border and in South Carolina, where hundreds are in quarantine.",
      "Between Friday and Tuesday, South Carolina health officials confirmed 27 new measles cases in an outbreak in and around northwestern Spartanburg County. In two months, 111 people have been sickened by the vaccine-preventable virus.",
      "More than 250 people, including students from nine area elementary, middle and high schools, are in quarantine \u2014 some for the second time since the outbreak began in October. Most of the state's new cases stemmed from exposures at Way of Truth Church in Inman. Church leaders have been \"very helpful,\" said state epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell.",
      "\"We are faced with ongoing transmission that we anticipate will go on for many more weeks, at least in our state,\" Bell said.",
      "In Arizona and Utah, an outbreak has ballooned since August. Mohave County, Arizona, has logged 172 cases and the Southwest Utah Public Health Department has logged 82 cases. The border cities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, are the heaviest hit.",
      "Overall, Utah has confirmed 115 measles cases this year. Arizona has confirmed 176.",
      "Nationally, the measles case count is nearing 2,000 for a disease that has been considered eliminated in the U.S. since 2000, a result of routine childhood vaccinations.",
      "Last month, Canada lost that designation \u2014 which applies when there is no continuous local spread of the virus \u2014 as did the larger health region of the Americas.",
      "Experts say the U.S. is also at risk of losing that status. For that to happen, measles would have to spread continuously for a year. A large outbreak in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma that started in January sickened nearly 900 and kicked off the United States' worst measles year in more than three decades.",
      "All but eight states have logged at least one measles case this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has confirmed 47 outbreaks this year, compared with 16 in 2024. Three people \u2014 two of them Texas school children \u2014 have died.",
      "In September, the CDC's vaccine recommendation committee voted to recommend that the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine, or MMRV, be separated into MMR and varicella shots for children under the age of 4.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made the change after undergoing a complete overhaul by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in June. Several of those new members have a history of being vaccine skeptics.",
      "According to CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, while the combined MMRV vaccine offers the convenience of one shot instead of two, it does carry a slightly higher risk of fever-related \"febrile\" seizures when used as the first dose in young toddlers aged 12-23 months. The side effect is most common between the ages of 14-18 months.\u00a0Gounder says that while febrile seizures are rare and almost always resolve without lasting effects, they are frightening for families and can erode trust in vaccines.",
      "Studies show there is no elevated risk when MMRV is given for the second dose at ages 4 to 6 years old, after children have outgrown the highest-risk window, Gounder says.",
      "Dr. William Schaffner \u2014 a professor of infectious disease at Vanderbilt Medical Center who has served as a liaison to the ACIP, told CBS News in an interview Tuesday that the \"simple answer\" for the outbreaks is that \"parents are withholding their children from vaccination.\"",
      "\"You know, vaccination is so very effective that ... by comprehensively vaccinating all of our children, eliminated measles from the United States,\" Schaffner said, later adding that \"we are turning the clock back.\"",
      "The combined MMR vaccine is safe and provides 97% protection against the disease after two doses, according to the CDC. Most children in the U.S. are required to get the MMR shot to attend school. But vaccination rates have declined as more parents waive the shots or have fallen behind on recommended vaccination schedules.",

      "A former top official at the National Institutes of Health sued the Trump administration Tuesday, alleging she was illegally fired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after she blew the whistle on internal clashes over vaccine research at the agency.",
      "Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo ran the NIH division responsible for vaccine research until late March, when she was placed on indefinite leave. In a formal whistleblower complaint, she said she was sidelined because she pushed back against NIH officials appointed by President Trump who questioned the importance of childhood flu vaccines and canceled long-running clinical trials.",
      "She was terminated in October after she went public with her concerns in an exclusive interview with CBS News, which she claims was a further act of retaliation.",
      "\"I spoke up because the decisions by HHS leadership have put the public's health at risk and wasted billions of dollars \u2014 actions that will have devastating consequences for Americans' safety and wellbeing for decades to come,\" Marrazzo said in a statement on Tuesday, noting that she is seeking her job back and also aims to protect the rights afforded to federal employees who blow the whistle.",
      "\"I was fired for calling this out, but I will not stay silent,\" she said.",
      "An Health and Human Services spokesperson declined to comment on Marrazzo's lawsuit. Under Kennedy, vaccine skeptics have been appointed to leadership roles across the health agencies, raising alarms among career scientists.",
      "Marrazzo's allegations focus on Dr. Matthew Memoli, who served as acting NIH director earlier this year before moving to the health agency's No. 2 post.",
      "Marrazzo claimed Memoli made statements downplaying the importance of vaccines that closely mirrored the views of Kennedy, who has a long history of sowing doubts about vaccines. In a series of meetings, Memoli argued that \"vaccines are unnecessary if populations are healthy,\" and that the NIH \"should not focus on vaccines,\" Marrazzo alleged in her lawsuit.",
      "Marrazzo told CBS News it was like \"hearing the echo of\" the vaccine skepticism often promoted by Kennedy. \"It was extremely alarming,\" Marrazzo said.",
      "An HHS spokesperson defended Memoli to CBS News, writing in a statement: \"He remains fully aligned with this administration's vaccine priorities and consistently champions gold-standard evidence-based science.\"",
      "In 2023, Marrazzo succeeded Dr. Anthony Fauci as the director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. In September, she followed a well-established whistleblower process for federal workers by filing a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "However, in her lawsuit, she said she was now turning to the courts because \"actions by the Trump administration have fully eroded the independence\" of federal agencies that rule on whistleblower allegations and her claim \"cannot be fairly investigated or adjudicated in these forums.\"",

      "An image released earlier Tuesday, though blurry, was the clearest picture of the person of interest released so far since the shooting that killed\u00a0two Brown University students\u00a0and wounded nine others. The FBI said the man is about 5-foot-8 with a stocky build.",

      "Investigators say they are looking to interview anyone who was in the area of the shooting. They're also continuing to search the area for evidence that might lead to the gunman.",
      "Meanwhile, Brown University says it has seen an increase in swatting calls since the shooting. The community has seen increased security presence, with restrictions to buildings and areas, but students say it will take effort and time for them to feel safe.",
      "\"We were in a state where Brown felt incredibly safe, and that bubble of safeness was completely popped when we were violated by a shooter entering our campus,\" Talia Levine, a senior at Brown University who barricaded for four hours during the shooting, told CBS News.",

    "summary": "A federal judge in Washington, D.C., put limits on what construction crews can do on the project over the next two weeks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon denied a motion by the National Trust for Historic Preservation that would have temporarily blocked the Trump administration's construction of a new ballroom at the White House, but he set out some requirements for the Trump administration moving forward.",
      "Leon said in a hearing Tuesday in Washington, D.C., that the nonprofit group had not established enough irreparable harm in order to pause the construction outright, but the judge declared construction crews cannot over the next two weeks build any below-ground structures that would determine how and where the final ballroom structure will exist. Leon said any breaking of that order would result in the White House being \"forced to take it down.\"",
      "The judge is requiring the government to submit construction plans to the National Capital Planning Commission by the end of the year, and the Justice Department said that the government has made \"initial outreach\" to set up meetings on that front.",
      "Last week, the National Trust for Historic Preservation filed the first major lawsuit against President Trump and his administration in an effort to block construction of the ballroom, claiming no president is allowed to\u00a0tear down\u00a0parts of the White House \"without any review whatsoever,\" or construct a ballroom on public property \"without giving the public an opportunity to weigh in.\"",
      "The National Park Service expects the project to be completed in summer 2028, not long before Mr. Trump leaves office.",
      "The historic preservation group argues that the lawsuit isn't about the need for a ballroom, but about the need to follow the law, repeatedly arguing in court Tuesday that five laws have been broken by the demolition and build project. Plaintiffs also argued the environmental impact statement submitted by the administration was \"woefully inadequate.\" Much of the East Wing has been demolished as a part of the project.",
      "\"These are things that they can do...as long as they follow the rules,\" an attorney for the group argued Tuesday.",
      "The government contends that it has no obligation to file plans with the National Capital Planning Commission, an independent government agency, for demolition or below ground work, and insists it has not violated any laws because no plan for the ballroom has been finalized.",
      "\"There is nothing final about this building,\" Justice Department attorney Adam Gustafson argued in court.",
      "The government also argued that the construction and planning are all coming from the Executive Office of the President, and because it's executive action, federal courts have limited power to review it. The National Park Service, however, was named repeatedly in court filings by the Justice Department and wrote a memo in support of the project.",
      "The government said it is \"committed\" to hear input from the Commission of Fine Arts, which presently does not have a quorum because Trump removed most members, and said the lawsuit was filed too late, because demolition was completed a week before the complaint was filed.",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:29:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Newly released documents are renewing interest in how Jeffrey Epstein amassed his fortune. Here's how he made his money.",
    "story": [
      "Newly released financial documents and photos obtained from the estate of convicted sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0are reigniting interest in the late sex offender's\u00a0wealth and how he amassed it.",
      "Accused of abusing dozens of teenage girls before dying by suicide in a federal prison in 2019, the politically connected multimillionaire never graduated from college, but still wound up socializing with a range of major public figures, from former U.S. presidents and software moguls to members of the British royal family.",
      "The grandson of Jewish immigrants, Epstein was raised in Brooklyn, where he excelled in math and graduated from high school early, briefly attending Cooper Union and New York University, according to published reports over the years by multiple news outlets, some citing court documents.",
      "The photos, released Dec. 12 by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, include images of prominent figures such as former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The photos do not implicate any of those pictured in Epstein's crimes.",
      "Earlier in the month, the same committee had released financial records related to Epstein from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, as well as photos and videos of the financier's private island in the Caribbean.",
      "Epstein was a major client of JPMorgan Chase's private banking division for years before the bank cut ties with him in 2013. Epstein then took his business to Deutsche Bank, where he remained until 2018.",
      "Separately from the Oversight Committee's document release, Congress has passed a bill last month giving the Justice Department 30 days to release all records it has related to Epstein. President Trump signed the bill into law on Nov. 19.",
      "The controversy over Epstein's death has proved politically sensitive\u00a0after Mr. Trump returned to office in January of 2025. The president had earlier urged Republicans to avoid focusing on the Epstein issue, initially describing the effort to release more records as a distraction tactic, but reversed his stance in November.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has been accused of no wrongdoing, had been friends with Epstein but later cut his ties with the businessman.",
      "What was Jeffrey Epstein's net worth?",
      "At the time when the disgraced financier was found dead at 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in August of 2019, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, a filing in his criminal case pegged\u00a0his net worth at roughly $560 million. Epstein's assets also included a number of lavish properties.",
      "Epstein owned a palatial townhouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan worth more than $50 million. He also owned a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, worth about $12 million; a ranch in New Mexico valued at just over $17 million; and an apartment in Paris worth an estimated $8.6 million.",
      "His two private Caribbean islands \u2014 Great St. James and Little St. James \u2014 were together valued at $86 million following his death, but purchased for $60 million in 2023 by billionaire Stephen Deckoff, founder of alternative investment firm Black Diamond Capital Management. Epstein also owned a private jet.",
      "What did Jeffrey Epstein do for a living?",
      "While in his early 20s, Epstein in 1974 started teaching math at The Dalton School, one of New York's most prestigious prep schools, and left in 1976, with an administrator\u00a0telling\u00a0the New York Times he'd dismissed Epstein for poor performance.",
      "But the stint at Dalton had him tutoring the son of Bear Stearns CEO Alan Greenberg, which led to a job at the investment bank before it collapsed in 2008 following the housing crash. Epstein then became a money manager for billionaires including Les Wexner, founder and CEO of L Brands, and Apollo Global Management Chairman Leon Black. Black paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning services, according to the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "A law firm retained by Apollo's board to review Black's dealings with Epstein cleared Black, who stepped down as chairman and CEO of the private equity firm in 2021, of any possible wrongdoing.",
      "Black in July of 2023 agreed to pay $62.5 million to the U.S. Virgin Islands to be released from any potential claims arising from the territory's probe into Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The four-page settlement stipulated that it didn't constitute an \"admission of liability\" by Black, according to the New York Times.",
      "For more than a decade, Epstein was\u00a0Wexner's personal money manager\u00a0and business adviser, making hundreds of millions of dollars managing Wexner's billions.",
      "\"Epstein's crimes are abhorrent, and we applaud every effort to bring justice to those harmed,\" L Brands told CBS MoneyWatch in 2019.",
      "Wexner said in an email to employees at the time that he regretted he ever \"crossed paths\" with Epstein. \"When Mr. Epstein was my personal money manager, he was involved in many aspects of my financial life,\" the email stated. \"But let me assure you that I was NEVER aware of the illegal activity charged in the indictment.\"",
      "Where else did Epstein get his money?",
      "JPMorgan Chase loaned Epstein money and regularly let him withdraw large sums of cash from 1998 through August 2013, according to a class-action lawsuit settled by the nation's largest bank in 2023 for a reported $290 million. The money was slated to go to almost 200 Epstein victims, according to the New York Times.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch in June of 2023, JPMorgan called Epstein's behavior \"monstrous,\" and said it regretted any association with the disgraced financier.",
      "Epstein also had financial dealings with Deutsche Bank, which in May 2023 agreed to pay $75 million to settle a lawsuit alleging the German bank \"knowingly benefited\" from his sex trafficking and profited from doing business with him.",
      "Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the settlement. In 2020, it acknowledged its \"error of onboarding Epstein in 2013 and the weaknesses in our processes.\"",
      "In October, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, pointed to\u00a0$1.5 billion in suspicious financial transactions that had been flagged by the banks and were tied to Epstein's alleged sex trafficking crimes. The same month, Bank of America was sued by one of Epstein's victims, who alleged the bank facilitated and also benefited from his alleged crimes.",
      "Bank of America had no comment on the lawsuit.",
      "For how much did he buy his islands?",
      "Epstein owned two neighboring islands. He paid $7.95 million in 1998 for the 75-acre Little St. James, according to the New York Post and New York Magazine. In 2016, Epstein paid more than $20 million for the 165-acre Great St. James, according to CNBC and the Wall Street Journal.",

    "summary": "Senate Republicans are aiming to move forward on a new package of funding bills before leaving for the holidays, with just weeks to go before the next deadline to avoid another shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans are aiming to move forward on a new package of funding bills before leaving town for the holidays, with just weeks to go before the next deadline to avoid another government shutdown.",
      "Congress approved an initial tranche of funding legislation in November as the longest shutdown in history came to an end. But progress has been stalled on additional measures since then. When lawmakers return in the new year, they will have just four weeks to fund the government, or risk a partial shutdown in February.",
      "After approving three of the 12 annual appropriations bills in November, Senate GOP leaders and appropriators were eager to get moving on the next batch of bills. The new package, dubbed a \"minibus,\" is made up of five bills. It would include funding through September for the Department of Defense; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; Transportation, Housing and Urban Development; Commerce, Justice and Science; and Interior and Environment. But issues remain.",
      "\"We're still working it,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday morning. \"Not there yet.\"",
      "The minibus package, a smaller version of massive \"omnibus\" government funding legislation, comes as Republicans have sought to return to passing individual spending bills through regular order, rather than through a large end-of-year package. This year, leaders in Congress also opted not to impose a pre-holiday deadline to fund the government, which often raises pressure on lawmakers to agree to a deal before leaving town for the winter recess.",
      "Still, Senate GOP leaders have sought to make progress on the funding package before the chamber breaks later this week.",
      "Asked whether action on the minibus this week is realistic, Thune told reporters \"we'll see.\" Leaders have been working to resolve disagreements with a handful of Senate Republicans who have put \"holds\" on the package, including Sens. Rick Scott of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and John Kennedy of Louisiana. Holds allow individual senators to signal their objections to legislation in its current form.",
      "\"My hope is at least that these, all of these holds that currently exist on the bill on our side at least, are starting to be dealt with in a way that hopefully will get them lifted,\" Thune said. \"But we're not 100% there yet.\"",
      "Kennedy told reporters after Senate Republicans gathered for lunch Tuesday that his and Johnson's holds are the two that remain. Johnson has advocated for the inclusion of his measure to pay federal employees who work during government shutdowns. He told CBS News that he is \"not interested in amendment votes \u2014 I want a result, and we should be able to get a result.\"",
      "\"One thing I've learned about here, when leadership wants to get something done, they get it done,\" Johnson added.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the top appropriator in the Senate, told CBS News that the current objections are \"soft holds that I think we can work out.\"",
      "\"I'm hopeful that we'll be on the package tomorrow,\" Collins said.",
      "Should progress stall on the minibus this week, the Senate will face a tight timeline to fund the remaining agencies and government programs upon their return next month. The deal to end the government shutdown earlier this year extended funding until Jan. 30.",
      "The initial batch of funding bills included funding for military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Agriculture and FDA; and operations for the legislative branch. The package funded the relevant agencies and programs through September 2026, meaning the agencies would still be funded even if lawmakers fail to fund other areas of the government by the end of January.",
      "Thune, asked whether he's concerned about a shutdown in the new year, told reporters that the threat is \"always out there.\"",
      "\"I think that's why it's really important that we do everything we can to consolidate support for getting on the bills and trying to, you know, transact the funding of the government in a way that would prevent that from happening,\" he added.",
      "Part of the calculus for Democrats will likely be the same as in the last shutdown, which became the longest in history at 43 days. The issue at the center of that fight was health care, particularly the expiration of the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. But that issue remains unresolved, even after the two parties put forward dueling health care proposals for votes last week. On health care, Thune said he thinks there's a \"potential pathway in January.\"",
      "Amid the effort to pass another package of funding measures, Thune said he and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke briefly Tuesday morning and there are \"conversations going all the time.\"",
      "\"We're working with the Dems, the hotlines have been running on both sides, and trying to figure out how do we, you know, fund the government in a way that I think reflects the views of this United States Senate and not a continuing resolution,\" Thune said. \"And I think both sides see the value in doing that. So I'm still hopeful that there will be a convergence around getting on the bills and moving them in a way that would prevent us having to deal, at the end of January, with another shutdown.\"",

    "summary": "The unemployment rate in November rose to 4.6%, its highest level since September 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 64,000 jobs in November, beating economists' forecasts, new government data\u00a0shows, even as new October figures revealed a loss of 105,000 jobs, a sign the labor market remains under pressure.",
      "The unemployment rate in November rose to 4.6%, the highest level since September 2021.",
      "The November employment report offers a fresh picture of the labor market after a six-week blackout in official data caused by the recent\u00a0government shutdown. The data suggests that employers in industries ranging from manufacturing to hospitality are hitting the pause button on hiring amid concerns about economic growth and tariff costs, some economists noted.",
      "\"Businesses are not hiring as they adjust to tariffs, uncertain conditions and AI. The result is about 700,000 more unemployed Americans than there were a year ago,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 40,000 jobs in November, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The Labor Department on Tuesday also released partial employment data from October, which shows a loss of 105,000 jobs that month.",
      "The drag on October employment was driven by a steep loss in the federal workforce, which shed 162,000 jobs that month. The decline is due to a wave of deferred resignations starting to show up in the payroll data, according to Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.",
      "Job growth for August and September was also revised down by a collective 33,000.",
      "The government's official employment data for October and November had been delayed due to the 43-day government shutdown, which ended in last month.",
      "In the absence of federal data, economists at the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street had been monitoring alternative sources, which have signaled ongoing headwinds in the labor market. For instance, ADP earlier this month said private-sector employers in the U.S. cut 32,000 jobs in November, while outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas has tracked more than 1.1 million layoffs so far this year.",
      "Economic uncertainty has led workers to stay put and employers to pull back on hiring, creating a difficult situation for job seekers, especially those early in their careers.",
      "The labor market is slowly cooling, Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John C. Williams said in a\u00a0speech\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"I should emphasize that this has been an ongoing, gradual process, without signs of a sharp rise in layoffs or other indications of rapid deterioration,\" Williams said. But, he added, \"Job growth has been anemic.\"",
      "What it means",
      "The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% in November \u2014 the highest since September 2021 \u2014 as more people entered the labor force to look for jobs, according to Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge.",
      "While the numbers offer a glimpse into the labor market during the government shutdown, experts say investors and government officials will likely view the data with some skepticism, given questions about the accuracy and completeness of data collection following the shutdown.",
      "Indeed, the Federal Reserve may not place much emphasis on the November numbers at its January rate-setting meeting because of the data disruption, said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory,\" she said in an email.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0said the central bank would likely view the October and November data with a \"somewhat skeptical eye,\" given the data may be distorted.",
      "The larger-than-expected rise in the unemployment rate could, however, raise concerns within the Fed, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist of Principal Asset Management, in an email.",
      "The central bank\u00a0lowered interest rates\u00a0by 0.25 percentage points for the third consecutive time last week,\u00a0citing\u00a0the rise in the downside risks to employment.",

      "The 1990 murder of Marlene Warren, shot by someone dressed as a clown, haunted not just the public, but the Palm Beach County State Attorney 's Office. Despite identifying two suspects, the case, went unsolved for decades.",
      "Dave Aronberg is the current state attorney.",
      "Dave Aronberg: It's easy to see why this case has so much interest \u2026 who isn't afraid of a killer clown?",
      "Dave Aronberg: This was an assassination. This was not a random act of violence. This was not a robbery.",
      "Joe Ahrens: The unknowingness of this heinous crime. The fear \u2026 it was hell.",
      "Joe Ahrens was 21 and living at home with his stepfather Mike and his mother Marlene when she was murdered.",
      "Joe Ahrens: She was a good mother. \u2026 Everything she did, she took pride in.",
      "A DEADLY DELIVERY",
      "The morning of May 26, 1990 had started as a cheerful one. Ahrens, recuperating from a broken leg, was having breakfast at home with his mom and three friends when they saw a clown approaching carrying balloons and flowers.",
      "Joe Ahrens: And we kind of \u2026 figured \u2026 I had a cast on, somebody was sending, to heal and \u2014 for gesture \u2026",
      "Peter Van Sant: This is like, \"Oh, what a delightful gift,\" to cheer you up with your broken leg, right?",
      "Joe Ahrens: Right.",
      "Joe Ahrens: My mother opened the door \u2026 And then we heard \"bang\" and she fell. At that point, we knew something was wrong. \u2026 My mother was struggling to breathe \u2026 And then I jumped to the phone, you know, called 911 right away.",
      "As the clown slowly and silently walked to a car, Ahrens and some of his friends tried to get a closer look at anything that might help describe the disguised attacker.",
      "Joe Ahrens: The only thing it didn't have any color on it was the shoes that were solid black and the white gloves.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And did you notice anything about the clown's eyes?",
      "Joe Ahrens: \u00a0I did. That's the most thing I \u2014 I saw was the big brown eyes.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And the clown gets in the car. What kind of car was it?",
      "Joe Ahrens: It was a white LeBaron.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And does the car peel off?",
      "Joe Ahrens: No. It goes into gear and drives off like nothing happened.",
      "While some of Ahren's friends remained at his house waiting for EMS, he got into Marlene's car and tried to chase down the clown. But he couldn't catch up.",
      "Meanwhile, with the clown's balloons and flowers left behind, Marlene was rushed to the hospital, barely alive, where she was put on life support.",
      "Joe Ahrens: I kept telling her I love her, and I don't want her to go, and please don't leave me.",
      "Two days later, with no hope of a recovery, life support was removed, and Marlene died.",
      "Joe Ahrens: I knew my life was going to change and I knew it was going to become hell, because she wasn't here to help me.",
      "A top clue the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office had was Joe's description of the clown: about 6-foot-one, tall, skinny, with orange hair, a red nose and a big orange smile and male. And those balloons left behind? They now seemed cruelly mocking: \"You're the greatest\" one said. The other had a picture of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\"",
      "Authorities had also spoken with Joe's stepfather Mike Warren, who they learned had an alibi: he was in a car with friends heading to a racetrack when the shooting took place.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Growing up with Mike Warren, what was that like? Was he a good dad?",
      "Joe Ahrens: I thought so. \u2026 That's the only father I knew. I mean I was really young when my real father and mother separated.",
      "Marlene and Mike Warren were married when Ahrens was 3 years old. They had built a comfortable life in Wellington, Florida, an affluent suburb. Marlene owned several businesses, including apartment complexes, and the couple ran Bargain Motors, specializing in used cars and rentals.",
      "While business was good, the marriage, says Ahrens, was troubled. He says his mother became convinced Mike was having an affair, making her fearful.",
      "Joe Ahrens:\u00a0 She said, \"if anything does happen to me, your father did it.\"",
      "Peter Van Sant: She said that to you?",
      "Joe Ahrens: I told her no way \u2014 he would never do anything like that. She said don't put it past him.",
      "Marlene shared that same fear with her mother, Shirley Twing.",
      "Shirley Twing: She says, \"If anything happens to me, Mike did it.\"",
      "We interviewed Twing in 2017, when \"48 Hours\" started investigating Marlene's murder.",
      "Peter Van Sant: That's an ominous thing to say. \u2026 Did you sense fear in her voice?",
      "Shirley Twing:\u00a0 Sure. Yes, I did.",
      "So, when Twing learned her daughter had been murdered, her mind went to Mike Warren.",
      "Shirley Twing: Right away. I figured Mike had something to with it, that's for damn sure.",
      "But Mike Warren had that alibi, so authorities were looking for someone else. And when they visited Bargain Motors, Mike's place of business, one name kept popping up: \u00a0that woman with whom Mike was supposedly having an affair.",
      "Aleathea McRoberts: Everybody at the Bargain Motors were reporting that you should look first at Sheila Keen.",
      "Aleathea McRoberts, an assistant state attorney in Palm Beach County, has worked on the case from the beginning.",
      "Aleathea McRoberts: And within the next day or so, tips were being called in that you really should investigate Sheila Keen and Michael Warren.",
      "Della Ward (2018): They were definitely seeing one another.",
      "Della Ward worked at Bargain Motors with Mike Warren.",
      "Della Ward (2018): He had a lot of compassion, lot of empathy. And people just were drawn to him \u2026 especially women.",
      "One of those women, Ward believed, was Sheila Keen.",
      "Della Ward (2018): \u00a0I found her very nice, very bubbly. \u2026 you knew the way she looked at Michael \u2014 you just \u2026 she loved him, you could see it.",
      "Keen, who also had a reputation for toughness, was a repo woman\u2014repossessing cars at Bargain Motors.",
      "Della Ward (2018): To do repos, you have to have some kind of guts. \u2026 She told me, \"I keep a gun for my protection because people are crazy, what they do.\"",
      "Keen told investigators she was out working at the time of Marlene's murder.",
      "Aleathea McRoberts: She claimed that she was looking for repossession vehicles, but she was unable to provide any address that she went to \u2026 so that they could follow up and confirm it.",
      "As for the affair, both Keen and Mike Warren told investigators they were just friends. But that's not what authorities learned when they talked to Keen's neighbors.",
      "Aleathea McRoberts: The neighbors at that apartment complex believed that Michael Warren and Sheila Keen were husband and wife.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Is there any doubt in your mind that there was a \u2014 romantic relationship?",
      "Aleathea McRoberts: There's no doubt and \u2026 they didn't hide it.",
      "An affair, though, isn't necessarily a motive for murder.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Did anyone profit financially from Marlene's death?",
      "Aleathea McRoberts: Yes. So, Michael Warren \u2026 profited \u2026 largely, the properties and assets that they owned together were in her name. So, by her predeceasing him, he was able to obtain 100 percent of the assets.",
      "Investigators were also trying to locate local stores that had recently sold clown outfits. Deborah Offord had been working at a costume shop when, two nights before Marlene's murder, a customer knocked at the door at closing time.",
      "Deborah Offord (2018): She wanted to see the clown costumes. I said, \"Can you come back tomorrow?\" And she said, \"No, I need something right now.\"",
      "Offord told investigators the customer paid cash, buying a clown suit, an orange wig, makeup and a red clown nose.",
      "Deborah Offord (2018): She was, I would say, about 5'10, um, long, thick, straight, like, chocolate-colored hair. Big brown eyes.",
      "Detectives later presented Offord with a photo lineup that included a picture of Sheila Keen. Offord identified Keen, and one other woman, as possibly being the person who bought the clown costume.",
      "The sheriff's office also believed they located where the shooter bought those flowers and balloons \u2014 a Publix supermarket.",
      "NEWS REPORT: The buyer described as a white female with dark brown hair.",
      "The description of the customer given by the worker at the supermarket, \"brown hair,\" and at the costume store, \"brown hair, brown eyes.\" was consistent with Sheila Keen. And there was Sheila's reported affair with Mike Warren. It was intriguing, circumstantial evidence\u2014but would it be enough to make an arrest?",
      "SEARCHING FOR A KILLER WHO WAS DRESSED AS A CLOWN",
      "Joseph Ahrens: Before they turned the machine off on my mother \u2026 I told her that I loved her very much and that we were going to get justice.",
      "As Ahrens mourned the loss of his mother Marlene, investigators continued looking for additional evidence tying Sheila Keen to Marlene Warren's murder.",
      "Dave Aronberg: You talk about this case to anyone, and the first place people go is, yeah, it's the mistress \u2026 So, investigators focused on Sheila Keen.",
      "And soon a big break when detectives located an abandoned white Chrysler LeBaron\u2014matching the description witnesses gave of the getaway car.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What was found inside that Chrysler LeBaron?",
      "Aleathea McRoberts: There was synthetic fibers \u2026 similar type fibers to \u2026 a clown wig.",
      "They were orange, the same color as the wig Ahrens says the assailant was wearing. Also inside the car, they found a human hair. It was brown like Sheila Keen's.",
      "LOCAL NEWS REPORT: Sheriff's detectives executed a search warrant at the home of Sheila Keen.",
      "Inside Keen's closet, detectives say they recovered orange fibers that a forensic examination later concluded were similar to the ones found in the Chrysler LeBaron. And another breakthrough was made when Keen's hair from her apartment was compared to the one recovered from the getaway car.",
      "Aleathea McRoberts: That was scientifically microscopically examined and found to be consistent.",
      "Consistent with Keen's hair, but DNA technology was still in its infancy in 1990, and scientists were unable to make a definitive connection.",
      "There were other challenges for investigators. The gun used to kill Marlene and the actual costume the killer clown wore were never found. And remember, Ahrens thought the attacker was a 6-foot-tall man. Keen didn't fit either of those descriptions.",
      "Aleathea McRoberts: We're talking about an event that took seconds and their glances of this clown was a second or two.",
      "Also, McRoberts says any eyewitness would have a hard time describing someone in a baggy clown costume, makeup and a wig.",
      "Aleathea McRoberts: It's basically, a clown is a clown.",
      "And there was Keen's alleged affair with Mike Warren, those fiber and hair results, and those salesclerks at the costume and grocery stores whose description of the customer purchasing the clown outfit, balloons and flowers was consistent with Keen.",
      "Peter Van Sant: This sounds like it's \u2014 the evidence is really building up \u2026 it's like you've got enough there to make an arrest. What happens?",
      "Aleathea McRoberts: Well, there was certainly argument about that \u2026 and opinions that differed at the time. \u2026 and then there's \u2026 an indecision about, do I do it now or should we keep trying and get a little bit more?",
      "As investigators looked for more evidence, they discovered that Mike Warren's business, Bargain Motors, was connected to the suspected getaway car. They learned an employee stole the car from a competitor several weeks before the murder.",
      "Dave Aronberg:\u00a0And that's how they got the Chrysler LeBaron.",
      "NEWS REPORT: Sheriff's detectives spent about five hours Thursday night searching the offices of Bargain Motors \u2026",
      "And as they had investigated Mike Warren's business, they discovered widespread fraud\u2014charging him with racketeering, insurance fraud and odometer tampering.\u00a0 He ultimately was convicted on 43 counts of fraud and sent to prison.",
      "Dave Aronberg: This was for fraud. \u2026 And so, you know, you just can't extrapolate one to the next. I mean, there's no evidence that he's a murderer. \u2026 We do have our suspicions, though.",
      "He was not charged with any crime in connection with Marlene's murder. And Mike Warren felt he was a victim in this case \u2014 sentiments he shared in a radio interview before he went to prison.",
      "MIKE WARREN (radio interview): They wanted to put me out of business.",
      "Mike Warren speculated that Marlene might actually have been the victim of an angry tenant or car buyer.",
      "MIKE WARREN (radio interview): I really can't think of a reason why, uh, other than the fact of the type of businesses that we're in, as far as being landlords and \u2026 crossing a few people by repossessing their car.",
      "But law enforcement did not think Marlene Warren's murder was the work of a disgruntled tenant or customer, and as the years passed the case grew cold. And as for Keen, she seemed to disappear.",
      "Della Ward: Nobody ever brought her name up again.",
      "Joe Ahrens: You know, for many years \u2026 I was suffering in, in despair.",
      "After Mike Warren went to prison, Ahrens says he and his stepfather became estranged. And as he continued to grieve the loss of his mother, he was consumed by her case going unsolved.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Give me a sense of what problems you fell into after your mother's murder.",
      "Joe Ahrens: Oh, wow. Where do we start? \u2026 Alcoholism, drugs, I mean you name it.",
      "It was especially painful, says Ahrens, on each passing anniversary of the shooting.",
      "Joe Ahrens: I would blow up that day and go get drunk, you know, and just \u2026 I'd go to her gravesite \u2026 It was sad.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Would you go out to her grave to talk to her?",
      "Joe Ahrens: I did a lot to try to find answers, you know, but I was so confused. I was getting nothing. I was just lost.",
      "Joe eventually emerged from the fog of drugs and despair. With that behind him, he became increasingly certain of who murdered his mother.",
      "Joe Ahrens: I concluded that \u2026 Sheila Keen was the one that did it.",
      "Dave Aronberg: She probably never thought, in a million years, she'd be held accountable for her crimes. She thought she got away with it.",
      "COLD CASE UNIT MAKES BREAKTHROUGH",
      "Shirley Twing and her daughter, Marlene, shared a fascination with clowns. In Twing's home, she even kept a room full of clown art and figurines.",
      "The sad, sometimes unsettling images brought comfort to Twing, despite the fact that a clown had so brutally ended her daughter's life.",
      "Shirley Twing: I don't hate clowns. I just hate one.",
      "Although the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office hadn't given up on solving Marlene's murder, 27 long years had passed without an arrest. Then, by 2017, a cold case unit made a breakthrough. State Attorney Dave Aronberg finally had new, important evidence.",
      "Dave Aronberg: The hairs that were found in the LeBaron were able to be traced to Sheila Keen \u2026 through DNA technology.",
      "With that new DNA match, detectives believed they could now definitively connect Keen to the alleged getaway car\u2014 and to Marlene Warren's murder. And when sheriffs found suspect Keen, they were blown away to learn whom she had married.",
      "Dave Aronberg: After Michael Warren got out of prison, he reconnected with \u2026 Sheila Keen. \u2026 here's someone whose wife had been murdered and he just married the chief suspect.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What did that tell you?",
      "Dave Aronberg:: When you combine the fact that the two of them were in an affair \u2026 at the time of the murder \u2026 and then later, they got married \u2026 it did seem like mission accomplished.",
      "That marriage was in 2002. The Warrens, now middle-aged, settled into a new life in Tennessee, running a burger joint called Purple Cow.\u00a0 Keen took Mike Warren's last name. But in an interesting twist, Assistant State Attorney Aleathea McRoberts says she changed her first name.",
      "Aleathea McRoberts: Sheila Keen-Warren introduced herself to \u2026 their friends in that life that her name was Debbie. \u2026 She had died her hair blonde, changed her name, and was living a full life.",
      "Brook Blevins: We would have \u2026 dinners. They were wonderful cooks.",
      "The Warrens befriended Brook Blevins, a neighbor at a weekend property the couple purchased in the Virginia mountains. When \"48 Hours\" spoke to Blevins in 2018, she said she also knew Mike's wife as \"Debbie\" and was told it was a childhood nickname.",
      "Brook Blevins: Her dad nicknamed her that when she was small.",
      "Ashley Sexton (2018): I never called her Sheila (laughs).\u00a0 I always called her Debbie.",

      "Cynthia Swafford (2018):\u00a0 I mean, she was awful aggressive, mean.",
      "And they even heard an alarming rumor about her past.",
      "Ashley Sexton (2018): The rumor around Purple Cow when we worked there was Debbie killed Mike's ex-wife. \u2026 I thought they was blowin' off steam, and I was like, OK, whatever.",
      "Cynthia Swafford (2018): Mm-hmm (affirms).",
      "Ashley Sexton (2018):\u00a0 But the rumors said it more than once \u2026 even to where we knew she dressed up like a clown.",
      "According to an employee, Sheila had appeared in clown makeup at the restaurant one year during Halloween.",
      "By the fall of 2017, the Warrens had sold the business and retired full time to the house in Virginia. Meanwhile State Attorney Aronberg felt the case against Sheila had only gotten stronger.",
      "Dave Aronberg: When you combine the fact that they got married and seemingly lived happily ever after with the new DNA breakthrough, we're able to get enough evidence to make an arrest.",
      "On Sept. 26, 2017 \u2014 27 years after Marlene Warren's murder, authorities arrested Sheila Keen-Warren driving on a road near their home. She was charged with first-degree murder.",

      "He wouldn't open the door, but we spoke through it for several minutes.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Did you have anything to do with planning the murder of your wife, Marlene?",
      "Mike Warren:\u00a0 Most definitely not.",
      "Peter Van Sant: You did not?",
      "Mike Warren: That's correct.",
      "He was adamant that neither he nor Keen-Warren had anything to do with Marlene's murder.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Did you suggest to Sheila that she dress in a clown outfit?",
      "Mike Warren: You're saying, \"Sheila, Sheila.\" Who says she even did that? \u2026I don't think she had anything to do with this. If I thought she had something to do with this, I wouldn't have been with her.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Do you believe, based on the evidence over the years, that Mike Warren knew what was going to happen that day?",
      "Aleathea McRoberts: I don't believe there's any direct evidence of that.",
      "Dave Aronberg: There just wasn't enough evidence to prosecute Michael Warren. \u2026 but if evidence emerges, we'll pursue it.",
      "As they prepared for trial, despite never recovering the clown disguise or the gun, prosecutors were confident they could prove that Keen-Warren committed the murder so that she could marry Mike Warren.",
      "Dave Aronberg: Sheila Keen-Warren had the means, the motive and the opportunity to do this.",
      "Greg Rosenfeld: We will never know who killed Marlene Warren because the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office and the State Attorney's Office did such a poor job investigating this case. I can tell you without question that it was not Sheila Keen.",
      "Keen-Warren's defense attorney, Greg Rosenfeld says she's innocent\u2014a victim of the state attorney's reckless desire to close a notorious cold case.",
      "Greg Rosenfeld: And they said you know what? This is our suspect. We're going to stick with it. \u2026 even though the pieces of the puzzle didn't fit the puzzle.",
      "Rosenfeld says there were other potential suspects authorities ignored\u2014including an inmate who supposedly bragged in prison about murdering Marlene. \u00a0But prosecutors say he was investigated and cleared.",
      "Dave Aronberg: It's not surprising that \u2026 they would try to point the finger at law enforcement for not looking at every potential suspect. \u2026 But if you look at the evidence, it pointed to one person all along, Sheila Keen-Warren.",
      "The state was confident Keen-Warren was responsible for Marlene's murder\u2014but Rosenfeld plans to poke holes in its case at trial.",
      "Peter Van Sant: How do you overcome DNA evidence?",
      "Greg Rosenfeld: The State Attorney's Office should be embarrassed about the DNA evidence in this case.",
      "Rosenfeld agrees the hair prosecutors say was found in the LeBaron getaway car could be from Keen-Warren, but he says, it could also be from about four percent of the U.S. Caucasian population.",
      "Greg Rosenfeld: They couldn't exclude Marlene Warren from that hair sample. \u2026 So that was their groundbreaking DNA evidence.",
      "And even if you concede that the hair is from Keen-Warren, says Rosenfeld, there's an innocent explanation as to how it got there: the LeBaron was on the lot at Bargain Motors where she worked.",
      "Greg Rosenfeld: Sheila may have been in the car used in this murder. That's it.",
      "Peter Van Sant: The defense attorney says, well, of course her hair might be in there \u2026 It doesn't suggest that she was driving at the time of the murder. What do you say to that?",
      "Aleathea McRoberts: It's just one more link. \u2026 Once you put that one thing with the totality of all the circumstances, then it starts to become overwhelming.",
      "Rosenfeld says the orange fibers found in the car, which prosecutors say could be from the clown costume, should also be excluded.",
      "Greg Rosenfeld: So, the fibers found in the car were synthetic fibers. \u2026 That same type of fiber can be used in thousands of different products. \u2026 So, the state likes to present it as \u2026 clown wig fibers, but that's factually incorrect.",
      "Even more troubling than the evidence gathered, says Rosenfeld, is how it was handled over the decades.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What are we looking at here?",
      "Greg Rosenfeld: These are \u2026 evidence bags at the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office Evidence Unit torn open. Just gaping holes in these evidence bags.",
      "Peter Van Sant: If there's gaping holes, what can that do to the evidence inside?",
      "Greg Rosenfeld: That's precisely how you have cross-contamination.",
      "The bag contains a clown wig that investigators purchased, similar to the one they believed was worn by the assailant. They used it to compare to the fibers found in the LeBaron and in Keen-Warren's home.",
      "Greg Rosenfeld: This is an open evidence bag with the wig sticking out. \u2026 this is horrifying.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And, so, your bottom line is, is that this evidence is unreliable now?",
      "Greg Rosenfeld: Without question.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Can it not be argued that \u2026 some of the evidence in this case was indeed bungled?",
      "Dave Aronberg: You know, it's \u2014 you're asking a lot of law enforcement to be perfect from 1990 to today. \u2026 some of the evidence was kept in an evidence storage area that wasn't ideal. \u2026 Any mistake, any small opening will be exploited by defense lawyers.",
      "Prosecutors were still certain they had the right person for Marlene's murder. But in February 2020, after a reevaluation of Keen-Warren's case, they announced they would no longer seek the death penalty.",

      "But then suddenly, in October 2022, as another trial date neared, the file was found.",

      "Greg Rosenfeld: They find this clown sighting file and it's 35 tips. We begin to investigate them. \u2026 now we're 32 years after the murder. \u2026 you know, we couldn't track down these witnesses.",

      "Peter Van Sant: And it wasn't being intentionally hidden from the defense, you're saying.",
      "Aleathea McRoberts: Absolutely not. We were meticulous about making sure they had everything.",
      "Though, as the trial neared, the decades of delays were causing problems for the prosecution as well.",
      "Dave Aronberg: Every day that went by, it was a tougher case. \u2026 witnesses die, memories fade, evidence spoils \u2026 \u00a0One of our key witnesses passed away. \u2026 He was the one who compiled the evidence. And without him, we lost a chain of custody for some crucial evidence relating to the fibers.",
      "Evidence the defense already claimed had been poorly stored and mishandled.",
      "Greg Rosenfeld: Contaminated, inadmissible, unreliable. \u2026 it just goes to show you how poor of an investigation that was done.",
      "Dave Aronberg: They were going to be able to argue that because of the opening of the bags, that the evidence was spoiled, and because of the break in the chain of custody, because of the death of our witnesses, that \u2026 it shouldn't even be admitted. \u2026 So, you had some real potential for reasonable doubt.",
      "Greg Rosenfeld: There was beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "On April 25, 2023, two weeks before Keen-Warren's trial for the murder of Marlene Warren was to begin, there was yet another surprise in a case that had been filled with the unexpected: a plea deal was reached.",
      "PROSECUTOR REID SCOTT (plea hearing): Ms. Keen-Warren, the defendant herein, will agree to withdraw her previously entered plea of not guilty enter a plea of guilty.",
      "Keen-Warren \u2014 whose case at one time included the death penalty, then life in prison \u2014 would now plead guilty to second-degree murder and be sentenced to 12 years in prison. Under sentencing guidelines for time served, she is expected to be released in 2025 \u2014 perhaps sooner.",
      "Dave Aronberg: We had to make a judgment based on what we had.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Because the fear is what, if you take this to trial?",
      "Dave Aronberg: The worst thing that could happen would be that Sheila Keen-Warren would be found not guilty, not because she was innocent, but because after 33 years, we could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she was the one who did it.",
      "But Keen-Warren did have to publicly pay a price for this plea deal \u2014 admitting in open court that she, in fact, did murder Marlene Warren.",
      "PROSECUTOR REID SCOTT (plea hearing): If this case were to proceed to jury trial, the state would present evidence \u2026 that on or about May the 26th of 1990, the defendant was responsible for the death of Marlene Warren.",
      "JUDGE: Ms. Keen-Warren, Did you hear all that?",
      "SHEILA KEEN-WARREN: Yes.",

      "Greg Rosenfeld: Correct. For the purpose of \u2014",
      "Peter Van Sant: So, she is a convicted murderer?",
      "Greg Rosenfeld: In so far as the law goes, sure. \u2026 But when \u2026 you're told you could be home \u2026 or, you know, you can play Russian roulette and risk spending the rest of your life in prison. It's kind of a no- brainer.",
      "Dave Aronberg: The defense cannot have it both ways. \u2026 So, she will be a murderer for every day for the rest of her life. Even when she gets out of prison one day, she'll still be a convicted murderer.",
      "When she does get out of prison, she will reunite with her husband Michael Warren.",
      "Greg Rosenfeld: Sheila is going home to \u2026 Tennessee. \u2026 She's going back to her life.",
      "Michael Warren, in a statement provided to \"48 Hours\" regarding the plea, said, \"My wife did not commit this crime\u2026\u00a0 It was difficult to see her plea to a crime she did not commit, but it wasn't worth the gamble when she was offered a deal that'll have her home in 16 to 18 months \u2026\"",

    "summary": "Recently released emails document Jeffrey Epstein's involvement in Leon Black's personal affairs.",
    "story": [
      "Documents released by Congress shed new light on Jeffrey Epstein's role in an attempt to help billionaire Leon Black squelch an accusation of sexual impropriety.",
      "Epstein's relationship with Black has already faced extensive scrutiny, but recently released, previously unreported emails from the House Oversight Committee document Epstein's involvement in Black's personal affairs while the private equity investor paid him huge sums for wealth management advice.",
      "Black, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, had a six-year affair with a former Russian model named Guzel Ganieva, whom he met at a party in New York City in 2008, according to court records. It was a relationship that ended in acrimony, with Ganieva accusing Black of sexual abuse \u2014 allegations Black denies.",
      "As Black prepared a nondisclosure agreement to secure Ganieva's silence about their affair, Epstein offered him some advice. Epstein suggested in a Sept. 21, 2015, email that Black hire former law enforcement officers to approach Ganieva about the agreement.",
      "\"Choose method of message delivery, my choice. - two highly respected former ---- fill in the blank, immigration, scotland yard. sfo. . who may knock on her door and present the terms,\" Epstein wrote in his typical email style, forsaking standard grammar and punctuation.",
      "Black had learned that Ganieva was planning to travel from London to New York to confront him. And Epstein suggested a similar approach if she showed up stateside. \"Have the same types of individuals [available] in new york if she decides to return as stated.. i prefer former fbi, or immigration one man one woman.\"",
      "Epstein did not mention Ganieva by name, but details in the email make it clear he's referring to her. A spokesperson for Black did not dispute that conclusion. An attorney for Ganieva declined to comment.",
      "Epstein penned a follow-up email minutes later, giving Black's assistant and attorney further instructions. Epstein wrote that Black's assistant \"should set up a separate email account for this correspondence. she currently is on an apollo server.\"",
      "No other emails in the trove released by Congress appear to address Black's long-running dispute with Ganieva.",
      "Ernest Badway, a former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement attorney who frequently represents clients in internal investigations, said an exchange of this nature should have set off red flags inside his company when they later looked into Black's ties to Epstein.",
      "\"As an investigator, that would concern me if I saw an email that people sent on the business's server saying, 'set up a private email so we can have private conversations.' You know, what are those private conversations about?\" Badway said.",
      "Epstein spent years forging relationships that bridged his business interests with his connections to international law enforcement and intelligence figures \u2014 including some powerful players in Russia. He engaged in transactions with Russian banks involving hundreds of millions of dollars, a congressional investigator, Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, said in July. He frequently met with Vitaly Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, until Churkin's death in 2017. And he nurtured a relationship with former Russian Deputy Minister of Economic Development Sergey Belyakov \u2014 a reputed FSB agent.",
      "In the summer of 2015, Epstein reached out to Belyakov for information on Ganieva to determine whether she was working for the Russian government, according to The Dossier Center, a website run by former Russian oligarch and Putin critic Mikhail Kordokovsky.",
      "On Oct. 18, 2015, Ganieva signed a nondisclosure contract with Black in which the billionaire agreed to pay her $100,000 monthly for 15 years, forgive a $1 million loan and provide two million British pounds for her to obtain legal status in the U.K.",
      "Two months later, Epstein emailed Black seeking additional payments for his financial advice.",
      "\"As you are well aware, There is little I won't do for you, or at least try to do as a friend, and a great deal that I have already done ( both known and some things that will need (sp) to remain unknown.)\" Epstein wrote.",
      "The nondisclosure agreement broke down four years later, leading to a series of lawsuits and countersuits. Court filings show Black discussed Ganieva's deal with two people, Epstein and a private investigator. It's unclear if Black turned to the private investigator \u2014 who had spent decades working for the U.S. Department of Justice \u2014 because Epstein had suggested hiring ex-law enforcement.",
      "Susan Estrich, an attorney for Black, told CBS News that his relationship with Epstein has already been the subject of an internal investigation commissioned by Apollo, and conducted by the law firm Dechert LLP.",
      "\"Epstein's emails, to which Mr. Black never responded, make it clear that Epstein was a braggart who embellished and exaggerated his role and responsibilities in many ways,\" Estrich said. \"Mr. Black's consensual relationship with Ms. Ganieva ended with an amicable settlement in 2015 and a voluntary non-disclosure agreement. Ms. Ganieva's unfounded lawsuit against Mr. Black has been dismissed by the trial court and that decision was upheld on appeal.\"",
      "The Dechert investigation concluded that Black paid Epstein $158 million for work related to his family office, \"and that Black genuinely believed that Epstein was extremely smart, capable, and saved him substantial amounts of money.\" The Dechert report made no mention of any effort by Epstein to advise Black regarding Ganieva \u2014 only that Black had \"confided\" in Epstein about certain personal matters.",
      "\"Mr. Black asked for an independent investigation of his relationship with Jeffery Epstein and Dechert investigated and reviewed more than 60,000 documents and concluded that Mr. Black paid Epstein for estate planning and tax advice, no more, no less,\" Estrich said.",
      "It's unclear if the two emails about Ganieva were among those turned over to Dechert's investigators. The Dechert investigation was led by Andrew Levander, a former federal prosecutor. Levander, who also represented former CBS CEO Les Moonves when he was the focus of an internal investigation in 2018, declined to comment.",
      "Black stepped down from the company he founded in March 2021, citing health concerns, two months after the Dechert report was finalized.",
      "Sen. Wyden \u2014 who has spent nearly four years investigating the financial relationship between Black and Epstein \u2014 says Black's payments to Epstein actually reached $170 million and he does not believe the emerging picture matches Black's explanation for paying Epstein nine-figure \"fees\" for tax advice.",
      "\"All along Mr. Black's story has been that he, a multi-billionaire Wall Street titan who employed the finest tax and estate planning minds in America, had to pay astronomical rates for special tax advice from Jeffrey Epstein, who was neither a tax attorney nor an accountant,\" Wyden told CBS News. \"I've never found Black's account believable, and every new revelation in this case raises more troubling questions about what really motivated his payments to Epstein and whether previous investigations of this matter covered up the truth.\"",
      "Editor's note: This article has been updated to reflect that the nondisclosure agreement between Black and Ganieva only sought confidentiality about their affair.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and members of his Cabinet defended White House chief of staff Susie Wiles on Tuesday after Vanity Fair published a lengthy piece featuring her blunt assessment of the president's inner circle, his first year in office and the president himself.",
      "The two-part story, written by author Chris Whipple, features quotes from 11 interviews that Whipple conducted with Wiles from Jan. 11 to Nov. 5.",
      "According to Vanity Fair, Wiles said the president, who doesn't drink, has \"an alcoholic's personality.\"",
      "\"High-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink,\" Wiles said, according to Vanity Fair. \"And so I'm a little bit of an expert in big personalities.\" Wiles was quoted as saying the president operates with the view that there's \"nothing he can't do. Nothing, zero, nothing.\"",
      "The president told the New York Post he hadn't read the Vanity Fair piece, but said Wiles is \"fantastic.\" Mr. Trump also defended Wiles' description of him.",
      "\"No, she meant that I'm \u2014 you see, I don't drink alcohol,\" the president told the Post. \"So everybody knows that \u2014 but I've often said that if I did, I'd have a very good chance of being an alcoholic. I have said that many times about myself, I do. It's a very possessive personality.\"",
      "He continued: \"I've said that many times about myself. I'm fortunate I'm not a drinker. If I did, I could very well, because I've said that \u2014 what's the word? Not possessive \u2014 possessive and addictive type personality. Oh, I've said it many times, many times before.\"",
      "Wiles was also quoted as saying Vice President JD Vance has \"been a conspiracy theorist for a decade,\" and that Attorney General Pam Bondi \"completely whiffed\" on her handling of the Epstein files. She also criticized Elon Musk and the way the U.S. Agency for International Development was shuttered in the early months of the administration.",
      "\"No rational person could think the USAID process was a good one,\" she said in the story. \"Nobody.\"",
      "In a post on X, her first in more than a year, Wiles, 68, called the story a \"disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history.\"",
      "\"Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story,\" she wrote. \"I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team.\"",
      "Wiles' statement did not deny that she was accurately quoted. CBS News has asked Vanity Fair for any additional comment and whether the publication will be releasing a transcript or audio of the interviews.",
      "Wiles, a longtime political operative in Florida, became the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff when Mr. Trump took office in January. She was named to Forbes' 2025 list of the World's Most Powerful Women earlier this month.",
      "Top administration officials came to Wiles' defense after the Vanity Fair story was published, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reposting many of their comments.",
      "Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought, whom Wiles called a \"right-wing absolute zealot\" in the story, called Wiles \"an exceptional chief of staff.\"",
      "\"In my portfolio, she is always an ally in helping me deliver for the president,\" Vought wrote on X. \"And this hit piece will not slow us down.\"",
      "Despite Wiles' criticism of her handling of the Epstein files, Bondi wrote on X: \"My dear friend Susie Wiles fights every day to advance President Trump's agenda \u2013 and she does so with grace, loyalty, and historic effectiveness. Any attempt to divide this administration will fail. Any attempt to undermine and downplay President Trump's monumental achievements will fail. We are family. We are united.\"",
      "\"This is what the Left does: trash & smear our best & most effective people,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote. \"They do it to President Trump daily \u2014 and now to Chief Susie Wiles. Susie is the most TRUSTED, most PROFESSIONAL & most EFFECTIVE Chief of Staff of my lifetime. Absolutely nobody better!\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote that the \"radical left is at it again, trying to create discord on President Trump's team,\" adding that \"It won't work because we know & love Susie Wiles.\"",
      "The vice president was asked about the \"conspiracy theorist\" comment by reporters during a trip to Pennsylvania. Vance said he hadn't read the article yet but had heard about it.",
      "\"Sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true,\" Vance said.",
      "\"And by the way, Susie and I have joked in private and in public about that for a long time,\" Vance continued. \"For example, I believed in the crazy conspiracy theory back in 2020 that it was stupid to mask three-year-olds at the height of the COVID pandemic, that we should actually let them develop some language skills. I believed in this crazy conspiracy theory that the media and the government were covering up the fact that Joe Biden was clearly unable to do the job.\"",
      "He added: \"If any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article, I hope that the lesson is we should be giving fewer interviews to mainstream media outlets.\"",

      "FIFA slashed the price of some World Cup tickets for teams' most loyal fans following a global backlash and some will get $60 seats for the final instead of being asked to pay $4,185.",
      "FIFA said Tuesday that $60 tickets will be made available for every game at the tournament in North America, going to the national federations whose teams are playing. Those federations decide how to distribute them to loyal fans who have attended previous games at home and on the road.",
      "The number of $60 tickets for each game is likely to be in the hundreds, rather than thousands, in what FIFA is now calling a \"Supporter Entry Tier\" price category.",
      "FIFA did not specify exactly why it so dramatically changed strategy, but said the lower prices are \"designed to further support travelling fans following their national teams across the tournament.\"",
      "The World Cup in North America will be the first edition that features 48 teams \u2014 up from 32 \u2014 and is expected to earn FIFA at least $10 billion in revenue. Teams will play in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",
      "But fans worldwide reacted with shock and anger last week on seeing FIFA's ticketing plans that gave participating teams no tickets in the lowest-priced category.",
      "The cheapest prices ranged from $120 to $265 for group-stage games that did not involve the three co-hosting countries.",
      "FIFA had set those prices despite the co-hosts having pledged eight years ago \u2014 when they were bidding for the tournament \u2014 that hundreds of thousands of $21 tickets would be made available.",
      "Criticism from fans, especially in Europe, had been increasing for several months over plans for \"dynamic pricing\" plus extra fees on a FIFA-run resale platform \u2014 both features which are common in the U.S. entertainment industry but not to soccer fans worldwide.",
      "Fan anger intensified last week when it became clear loyal supporters would have no access to the cheapest category tickets and that fans who wanted to reserve a ticket for all of their team's potential games \u2014 through the final \u2014 would not get refunded until after the tournament.",
      "In another climbdown Tuesday, FIFA said it would waive its administrative fees when refunds are made after the July 19 final.",
      "The 12 four-team groups that make up the World Cup\u00a0draw were selected earlier in December. The United States will play in Group D, along with Paraguay, Australia and the winner of UEFA playoff C. The teams there are Turkey, Romania, Slovakia, and Kosovo. The playoff games will be decided in March 2026.",

    "summary": "The family of Tony Hsieh, who died at 46, is disputing a will that emerged in 2025, allegedly from a Pakistani man with no ties to the businessman.",
    "story": [
      "The family of the late Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh claims a mysterious will that surfaced this year for the executive's $500 million fortune is a \"sham\" and is asking a court to invalidate the document.",
      "The battle over the will comes five years after Hseih's\u00a0death at age 46 from complications due to smoke inhalation from a house fire. After his death, which was ruled accidental, his family said Hsieh had died\u00a0without leaving a will.",
      "Earlier this year, however, a man purportedly named Kashif Singh claimed he had found Hsieh's will among his late grandfather's possessions. Singh claimed that his grandfather, Pir Muhammad, and Hsieh were \"dear friends,\" although there's no evidence that the two knew each other, according to the Dec. 15\u00a0court filing, published by Las Vegas' KSNV-TV.",
      "Attorneys for Hsieh's family didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Hsieh, a Harvard University graduate, joined Zappos\u2014 then called ShoeSite.com \u2014 in 1999. Zappos was sold to Amazon for $1.2 billion in 2009, and Hsieh remained with the e-commerce company until he retired in 2020.",
      "Reasons for suspicion",
      "The court filing asks that the will be ruled a forgery, citing evidence that Hsieh's supposed signature is fake and that he had no known connection to Muhammad. According to the family's lawsuit, the will nominates two attorneys, who allegedly did not know Hsieh, to serve as his co-executors and oversee his estate.",
      "\"Scams come in all shapes and sizes,\" the Hsieh family's suit alleges. \"In this case, the scam is in the form of a document being touted as the purported will of Anthony 'Tony' Hsieh.\"",
      "It added, \"The document was allegedly found by a complete stranger, many years after Tony's death, in the possession of the stranger's deceased grandfather, Pir Muhammad, a 91-year-old Pakistani man with no known ties to Tony.\"",
      "The filing also notes that the document includes misspellings of Hsieh's name.",
      "The Hsieh family hired an expert in detecting counterfeits to examine Hsieh's purported signatures on the will, the filing notes. The expert concluded there were \"numerous unexplained differences\" compared with Hsieh's known handwriting, leading him to conclude the will was forged.",
      "Hsieh's family also claims that there's no evidence the businessman attended the will's signing, which supposedly occurred in March 2015, given that none of his calendars, emails and other documentation noted such an event.",
      "It also claims that the five people who allegedly witnessed Hsieh signing the will cannot be located, and that \"their contact information has been fabricated, and likely, they do not exist in real life.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal law enforcement officials said Monday that four members of a far-left anti-government group have been arrested and face charges for allegedly planning a series of bomb attacks across Southern California on New Year's Eve.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X that the Justice Department and FBI \"prevented what would have been a massive and horrific terror plot in the Central District of California,\" which encompasses Los Angeles and Orange County.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said that the four people who face charges for the alleged plot in California are members of a group known as the Turtle Island Liberation Front. Bondi described the Turtle Island Liberation Front as a \"far-left, pro-Palestine, anti-government, and anti-capitalist group.\"",
      "Bill Essayli, who leads the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, said at a press conference that the four individuals were arrested Friday in San Bernardino County, where they gathered to construct and detonate test explosive devices in the Mojave Desert. He said the suspects allegedly crafted a \"detailed, coordinated plot\" to bomb two U.S. companies on New Year's Eve, with the devices simultaneously exploding at midnight. Essayli did not name the companies but said they were \"logistics centers.\"",
      "\"This case is another reminder about the dangers that radicalized antifa-like groups pose to people, public safety and the rule of law,\" he said.",
      "The defendants are identified in court papers as Audrey Carroll, Zachary Page, Dante Gaffield and Tina Lai.",
      "Officials played a video that they said showed defendants gathering in the desert to test the bombs. The footage was taken by a surveillance plane, according to Essayli, and FBI agents arrested the defendants soon after. An affidavit from the FBI said that the co-conspirators unloaded bomb-making materials from cars and started to assemble the materials in a table under a tent while they were in the Mojave Desert. The FBI intervened before the four defendants could finish assembling a functional bomb, according to the court filings.",
      "All four of the defendants are from the Los Angeles-area and have been charged with conspiracy and possession of an unregistered destructive device. Additional charges could be filed in the coming weeks, according to Essayli. He described the suspects as \"radical, anti-government members\" of the Turtle Island Liberation Front.",
      "A fifth person, Micah James Legnon, was arrested in Louisiana and charged with one count of making threats in interstate commerce. A FBI agent said in an\u00a0affidavit that Legnon appears to be a member of the Turtle Island Liberation Front and \"intended to travel to New Orleans to carry out an attack by means of weapons.\" Legnon, who served in the U.S. Marines, was stopped by law enforcement on a highway in Louisiana on Friday and had an assault rifle, pistol, gas canister, and body armor in his car, according to court papers.",
      "The Turtle Island Liberation Front describes itself on Facebook as a political organization that seeks \"liberation of occupied Turtle Island and liberation of all colonized people across the world.\" Turtle Island is the name used by some Indigenous peoples for North America.",
      "The group has expressed pro-Palestinian messages on social media and has said it is fighting against \"fascist colonizers.\" It has urged followers to bring Palestinian flags to protests.",

And he was also a longtime critic of Mr. Trump, referring to him during his first term as \"mentally unfit\" and \"unqualified\" to be president.",
      "Mr. Trump said of Reiner, \"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before.\" His post concluded, \"May Rob and Michele rest in peace!\"",
      "An official White House account reposted the president's social media post on X.",
      "A reporter asked the president later Monday if he stands by his post. Mr. Trump did not apologize.",
      "\"Well, I wasn't a fan of his at all,\" the president said. \"He was a deranged person, as fall as Trump was concerned,\" he said, saying Reiner was \"one of the people behind\" the \"Russia hoax.\" \"I think he hurt himself career-wise. Became like a deranged person. Trump derangement syndrome. So I was not a fan of Rob Reiner in any way, shape or form. I thought he was very bad for our country.\"",
      "The president's post drew immediate reactions on social media and from lawmakers of both parties.",
      "Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana told reporters that Mr. Trump \"should've said nothing.\"",
      "\"I think when the president says these sorts of things, it detracts from his policy achievements and his agenda,\" Kennedy said.",
      "He continued: \"And just speaking personally, when someone is murdered or assassinated, as happened to Mr. Kirk, we should show him and his family respect,\" referring to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "Jenna Ellis, a former lawyer for Mr. Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, condemned\u00a0the president's message in a post on X.",
      "\"A man and his wife were murdered last night,\" she wrote. \"This is NOT the appropriate response. The Right uniformly condemned political and celebratory responses to Charlie Kirk's death. This is a horrible example from Trump (and surprising considering the two attempts on his own life) and should be condemned by everyone with any decency.\" In 2023, Ellis\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in Georgia to a felony charge of aiding and abetting false statements and writing over alleged efforts to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election.",
      "Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky\u00a0wrote on X, \"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered. I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.\"",
      "Sen. Alex Padilla, a Democrat from California, told CBS News, \"Donald Trump's tirade, just hours after Rob and Michele Reiner's tragic murder, is disgusting and deranged. No matter your politics, this tragedy should be mourned and the violence condemned, not exploited.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland, a former federal prosecutor, told CBS News, \"Trump's statement is sick and dangerous because he suggests the Reiners' killings were because they were vocal critics of the Trump administration.\" He also criticized the president's comments as divisive, adding, \"This rhetoric divides the country, paints targets on private citizens and risks inciting political violence. A president should lower the temperature, not inflame it.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma wrote on X, \"A father and mother were murdered at the hands of their troubled son. We should be lifting the family up in prayer, not making this about politics.\"",
      "And Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who's been targeted by Mr. Trump for pressing the government to release files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, noted in response to the president's post that the Reiners' son \"reportedly had drug addiction and other issues, and their remaining children are left in serious mourning and heartbreak.\"",
      "\"This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,\" Greene continued. \"Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.\"",

    "story": [
      "The father and son suspects in the terror attack on Jewish people gathered for a Hanukkah event in Bondi Beach, Australia, spent most of November in the Philippines, police said Tuesday. Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, meanwhile, that the attack was \"motivated by ISIS ideology.\"",
      "New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters that investigators were still looking into the reasons for the trip and where exactly the men went between Nov. 1 and 28. The Philippines Bureau of Immigration said Sajid Akram, 50, who was killed during the attack, and his 24-year-old son, identified widely by Australian media as Naveed Akram, had listed the southern city of Davao as their final destination on the trip.",
      "Australian public broadcaster ABC reported the men had undergone \"military-style training\" in the Asian nation, citing security sources.",
      "\"People have traveled and networked amongst these groups, but very, very rarely,\" Tom Smith, the academic director of the Royal Air Force College who studies security and terrorism in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, told CBS News. \"And this is often overblown.\"",
      "The Philippines' history with Islamist insurgency",
      "Islamist separatists have operated in the southern Philippines for decades \u2014 it's \"an insurgency which is almost 100 years in the making,\" according to Smith.",
      "He said two longstanding militant groups in the region \u2014 the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, known as the MILF, and the Moro National Liberation Front, or MNLF \u2014 have been \"sort of the grandfather, old rebellious groups of the Islamist movement\" in the region.",
      "But, Smith said, \"when you have two rather, sort of beefy militant groups, people get disgruntled. And so there's loads of other fringe, much smaller militant groups\" in the region as well, including one called Abu Sayyaf, which is affiliated with ISIS.",
      "Smith said these groups are \"much smaller in number, but probably more vicious in their attacks against civilians and government officials.\"",
      "\"Analysts now describe Abu Sayyaf as fragmented remnants with residual ideological affinity to Islamic State (ISIS), but little evidence of real operational direction or sustained funding\" from ISIS, Lucas Webber, a senior research fellow at the New York-based Soufan Center think tank, told CBS News.",
      "Based in the Philippines' remote Sulu archipelago, Abu Sayyaf's main business is kidnapping for ransom, Smith said.",
      "They \"wrapped themselves in the ISIS flag, or the al Qaeda banner in years gone by, because they want to inflate their sense of danger. Because, quite frankly, there's an economic incentive to that. Because it means that they will get a higher ransom paid more efficiently, and these guys don't play,\" he said. \"They will actually behead people.\"",
      "That is a view shared by the U.S. government, which designated Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organization in 1997, not long after it emerged as an offshoot of the larger Islamist groups in the region.",
      "According to the U.S. State Department's most recent assessment from 2023, it is \"one of the most violent terrorist groups in the Philippines.\"",
      "\"Some Abu Sayyaf Group factions have been reported to interact and coordinate with ISIS-P [ISIS-Philippines], including by participating in attacks that are claimed by ISIS in the Sulu Archipelago,\" the U.S. government assessment said, adding that it had \"committed bombings, ambushes of security personnel, public beheadings, assassinations, extortion, and kidnappings for ransom.\"",
      "But both Smith and Webber told CBS News that Abu Sayyaf, and other regional factions, had been dealt a serious blow in recent years.",
      "\"Years of military pressure [with U.S. support], better local governance in Bangsamoro, and amnesty/reintegration programs have broken up many networks, led to mass surrenders, and sharply reduced the frequency and scale of attacks,\" Webber said. \"At the same time, small pockets of militants and ex\u2011fighters with IS ideology remain in parts of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago, and individuals can still be radicalized online or through personal ties. The main risk today is less a large 'IS province' on Philippine soil, and more the possibility that residual cells or sympathizers could attempt sporadic attacks or link up with transnational plots if local conditions deteriorate or security efforts are neglected.\"",
      "Terror training camps?",
      "The Associated Press cited Philippine military and police officials on Tuesday as saying there has been no recent indication of any foreign militants operating in the south of the country.",
      "Smith said to travel to receive weapons training with Abu Sayyaf militants would be very difficult for foreigners in the Philippines, especially without any local language skills.",
      "\"They would stick out like a sore thumb,\" Smith said. \"When I go there, you know, I'm there with military support. I have a Ph.D. in the area, and even I stick out like a sore thumb.\"",
      "He said there are \"plenty of armed people in Mindanao, in the Philippines, for them to go and practice, you know, firing rifles and what have you. But it's a long way to say that that equals a terrorist camp.\"",
      "Referring to the suspects in the Bondi Beach attack, Smith said it was \"much more likely that they could have got some ex-rebels and gone somewhere in the jungle for a couple of weeks and been shown how to fire and clean their rifles and stuff like that.\"",
      "The two larger militant groups, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front   \u2014 which are not affiliated with ISIS \u2014 do \"have the training camps. They're left alone to their territories. But it would be very unusual if the Bondi Beach attackers got orientated with them, because I just can't imagine that the MILF or the MNLF would have countenanced that. So it is really unusual,\" Smith said.",

    "summary": "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of yards of dinosaur tracks with toes and claws have been found in the Italian Alps in a region that will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "\"This set of dinosaur footprints is one of the largest collections in all of Europe, in the whole world,\" Attilio Fontana, head of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, said during a news conference.",
      "The tracks, which are over 200 million years old, were discovered in the Stelvio National Park, in an area between the towns of Bormio and Livigno, which host part of the Games.",
      "Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera first spotted the imprints in September in an almost vertical rocky slope.",
      "Some measured up to 16 inches in diameter.",
      "The collection \"extends for hundreds of meters and also represents a series of animal behaviors, because in addition to seeing animals walking together, there are also places where these animals meet,\" Fontana said.",
      "Della Ferrera called in paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso from Milan's Natural History Museum, who assembled a team of Italian experts to study the site.",
      "The museum released multiple images of the footprints uncovered in the so-called valley of dinosaurs\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"It's an immense scientific heritage,\" Dal Sasso said in the region's press release.",
      "\"The parallel walks are clear evidence of herds moving in synchrony, and there are also traces of more complex behaviors, such as groups of animals gathered in a circle, perhaps for defense.\"",
      "\"Impressions of the toes and even the claws\"",
      "The tracks, currently covered by snow and off the beaten track, are preserved in Upper Triassic dolomitic rocks, dating back approximately 210 million years.",
      "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
      "That suggests they belong to prosauropods, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads, which are considered the ancestors of the large sauropods of the Jurassic period like the Brontosaurus, the experts said.",
      "Prosauropods had sharp claws, and adults could reach up to 33 feet in length.",
      "There may also be tracks of predatory dinosaurs and archosaurs, the ancestors of crocodiles, the press release said.",
      "The prints are on an almost-vertical slope due to the formation of the Alpine chain.",
      "But when the dinosaurs walked through the area, it was formed of tidal flats that stretched for hundreds of miles, and the environment was tropical.",
      "\"The tracks were made when the sediments were still soft and saturated with water, on the broad tidal flats surrounding the Tethys Ocean,\" ichnologist Fabio Massimo Petti said, referring to a prehistoric ocean.",
      "\"The plasticity of those very fine calcareous muds, now transformed into rock, has in areas preserved truly remarkable anatomical details, such as impressions of the toes and even the claws,\" he said.",
      "The footprints were then covered by sediments which protected them, but with the uplift of the Alps and the erosion of the mountainside, they have been brought back into view.",
      "\"As the layers containing the tracks are diverse and overlapping, we have a unique opportunity to study the evolution of animals and their environment over time,\" geologist Fabrizio Berra said. \"Like reading the pages of a stone book.\"",
      "Other recent dinosaur track discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "Earlier this month, paleontologists in Bolivia said they found and meticulously documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "In March,\u00a0scientists in England\u00a0discovered a 650-foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some\u00a0200 dinosaur footprints\u00a0dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

      "The mass shooting on the famous beach left 15 innocent people dead, including a 10-year-old girl and an Holocaust survivor. The attack was \"motivated by Islamic State ideology,\" Albanese said Tuesday as he visited one of the heroes who tried to stop the attackers.",
      "Australia's federal police commissioner Krissy Barrett also said Tuesday that it was \"a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State,\" referring to the now disparate group that, for several years, held a huge swathe of territory spanning the Syria-Iraq border.",
      "The suspects, a father and son aged 50 and 24, used guns that were owned legally by the older man, whom officials in New South Wales state have named as Sajid Akram. He was shot dead at the scene, and his son was still being treated in a hospital on Tuesday, where Australian public broadcaster ABC said he had regained consciousness.",
      "Indian police confirm father was from Hyderabad",
      "Police in the southern Indian state of Telangana confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that Sajid Akram was originally from the city of Hyderabad. In a statement, the police said he earned a degree in Hyderabad before migrating to Australia in November 1998, where he married a woman of European origin.",
      "Sajid Akram held an Indian passport, while his son Naveed and a daughter were both born in Australia and are citizens of the country, the police said, confirming previous statements by Australian officials about the son's nationality. U.S. officials had told CBS News soon after the attack that at least one of the Akrams was believed to be a Pakistani national, but that appears to have been a case of mistaken identity, and a man with the same name as the younger suspect has come forward in Sydney to say he was wrongly identified.",
      "The Telangana police said the elder Akram had \"limited contact with his family in Hyderabad over the past 27 years,\" visiting six times since he migrated to Australia, \"primarily for family-related reasons.\"",
      "The police statement said family members in India had \"expressed no knowledge of his radical mindset or activities, nor of the circumstances that led to his radicalization, and that the son's apparent radicalization appeared \"to have no connection with India.\"",
      "Australian officials have confirmed that homemade ISIS flags were found \u2014   along with an improvised explosive device \u2014   in the suspects' vehicle at Bondi Beach on Sunday, and police provided new information on Tuesday about their recent movements.",

      "Muslim separatists, including the Islamist Abu Sayyaf group that once publicly backed ISIS, are active in that part of the southern Philippines. ABC, the Australian public broadcaster, said the men had undergone \"military-style training\" in the Philippines, citing security sources.",
      "That group and others in the region have drawn and trained some foreign militants from across Asia, the Middle East and Europe in the past, according to the Associated Press, though Abu Sayyaf has been weakened in recent years by repeated military offensives.",
      "The AP cited Philippine military and police officials as saying there has been no recent indication of any foreign militants operating in the south of the country.",
      "Did Australian officials fail the Jewish community?",
      "Australian officials confirmed Monday that Naveed Akram was under investigation for about six months during 2019 for suspected links to a Sydney-based terror cell, though the nation's primary spy agency found he represented no threat, and officials said the probe had focused on associates.",
      "Australia's ABC network\u00a0reported that his ties included \"longstanding links\" to members of a pro-ISIS cell in Australia, including contact with alleged jihadist spiritual leader Wisam Haddad and a man named Youssef Uweinat, who was convicted of recruiting young people in Australia to Islamic extremism.",
      "A lawyer for Haddad has denied that the cleric had \"any knowledge of or involvement in the shootings that took place at Bondi Beach,\" according to the network.",
      "Many people, from the daughter of one of the victims, to a former Australian leader, have told CBS News the men's history should have raised serious red flags, if not stopped them before they claimed so many lives.",
      "Israeli officials have harshly criticized Australia's government for failing to protect Jewish people amid a sharp rise in recent years of antisemitic incidents.",
      "\"We are now facing here a surge of antisemitism, and Australians of Jewish faith are not feeling secure in their own country, and this is insane,\" Israeli Ambassador to Australia Amir Maimon told CBS News on Tuesday, urging Australian leaders to create opportunities for young people of different faiths to come together, \"and not once a year, but on a weekly basis.\"",
      "Maimon also said \"boundaries should be set\" by Australian authorities, referring to pro-Palestinian demonstrations that have been held in the country.",
      "\"I believe that it's very important to make sure that while the principle of freedom of expression should be kept, there should be also a limit to the language that some protesters, and in some protests, we hear,\" he said. \"I always believe that there is room to do more.

      "\"This type of terrorism has been, the elements of that, have been present in Australia for a long time, and our agencies spend a lot of time keeping an eye on them, but it's hard to track every single person,\" said Turnbull, who was Australian prime minister from 2015 to 2018.",
      "\"Certainly, it's a very big question: Why does somebody living in the suburbs of Sydney need six long arms, as he [Sajid Akram] had, even though they were licensed? Second question is, why were they licensed to a man who had a son who had been on an ASIO [Australian Security Intelligence Organization] watchlist because of links to ISIS-related entities? \u00a0\u2026 And that trip to the Philippines raises another question: Why were they there? And so, you know, this gets back to the problem that I think we face all around the world, is databases talking to each other? Are we actually putting all the dots together in time?\"",
      "\"There are holes in everybody's intelligence gathering,\" Turnbull said. \"But as you know, the terrorist only has to be right once. The security agencies have to be right every time.\"",
      "Regarding the sharp criticism levelled by many in the Jewish community, in particular, over perceived failings in detecting the threat posed by the suspects, and also in sufficiently protecting the pre-planned Jewish event on Bondi Beach, Turnbull said he wasn't sure how much more could have been done by his successor Albanese.",
      "\"I've been prime minister, right? And I'm on the opposite side of politics, so I'm not trying to be partisan about this, but I struggle to see what he could have done that was different. I mean there have been people saying he shouldn't have allowed pro-Palestine marches. Well, you know, we do have freedom of assembly and freedom of speech in Australia. I mean we have restrictions in Australia on speech, on hate speech, and on guns, in particular.\"",
      "\"When I ask people, they will say he should have condemned antisemitism more often. Well, I've never heard him do anything other than condemn it, but my question really is to say, what would difference would that have made? To those terrorists, you know, they're not going to listen to a lecture on the evils of antisemitism from you or me or Anthony Albanese.\"",
      "\"Remember, terrorism is a political act, right? So, you've got to try to interrupt people being radicalized, particularly young men, it's the most vulnerable group, and that involves monitoring what is being said online, what they're being taught, you know, in schools or in mosques or in other places. And the intelligence agencies are doing that all the time,\" he said.",

    "summary": "A missing woman's phone has been found in Australia's Tasmanian wilderness more than two years after she disappeared, police said.",
    "story": [
      "A missing woman's phone was found in Australia's Tasmanian wilderness over the weekend, more than two years after she disappeared, police said.",
      "An independent search party organized by Celine Cremer's friends and family found her phone on Saturday at a waterfall, Tasmania Police said in a statement. It was the first sign of Cremer ever located in the area where she went missing, aside from her car, which investigators discovered 10 days after the last confirmed sighting of her in Waratah, a town in the Australian island state of Tasmania.",
      "Tasmania Police said the phone will undergo further forensic examination and that they will now formally join the independent search for Cremer.",
      "Cremer, a Belgian woman, was last seen on June 17, 2023, in Waratah, according to police. Investigators believe that Cremer drove to Philosopher Falls, a waterfall surrounded by dense rainforest, and intended to set out for a short walk through the area.",
      "\"Unfortunately, she did not return,\" Tasmania Police inspector Andrew Hanson said in a statement.",
      "Her friends reported her disappearance to Tasmania Police on June 26, 2023, and the original search effort began the next day, police said.",
      "By then, the area had already experienced an intense spell of winter weather, including subzero temperatures, snow and rainfall. According to Hanson, medical experts at the time advised police that Cremer could not have survived so many days in the wilderness under those conditions.",
      "The initial search continued for two weeks, with no clues as to where Cremer might be, and follow-up searches over the years ended similarly. The recent discovery of Cremer's phone suggests that she may have veered off course during her walk around Philosopher Falls and lost her way.",
      "\"The phone was found in an area that has been extensively searched previously and phone data, as well as the location it was found, supports our theory that Celine may have, using an app on her phone, elected to leave the Philosopher Falls track to take more a direct route back to her car as daylight faded,\" said Hanson, adding: \"We suspect she dropped her phone and continued without it, becoming disoriented in dense terrain.\"",
      "A bout of harsh winter weather over the weekend postponed further search efforts, according to Tasmania Police, but Hanson said they planned to dispatch officers to the area as soon as those conditions cleared up.",
      "Police said that while they were not leading or coordinating the search that led to the phone's discovery, they \"had been supporting the effort by sharing information and advice about what to do should anything be discovered.\"",
      "The independent group of searchers included Cremer's friends and the adventure filmmaker Rob Parsons, who has posted videos of his own private attempts to search for Cremer on YouTube. He described the moment Cremer's phone was discovered in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.",
      "\"I don't think there was a dry eye in the area,\" Parsons told the news organization. \"Everyone was so emotional. Everything was building up to this point where her friends could be here for the discovery. It felt like it was meant to be.\"",

    "summary": "As Trump seeks a vast sum in damages from the U.K. public broadcaster for alleged defamation and unfair trade practice, BBC indicates it won't settle without a fight.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The BBC said Tuesday that it would defend itself in court after President Trump sued the British public broadcaster for defamation and violating Florida state practices law in relation to a documentary that edited together separate parts of his Jan. 6, 2021 speech in Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump is seeking $10 billion in damages with his lawsuit, filed Monday in the Southern District of Florida.",
      "In its statement, the BBC said it would \"be defending this case,\" but would not be commenting further on the ongoing legal proceedings.",
      "In his complaint, Mr. Trump's attorneys accuse the BBC of publishing \"a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction\" of him in the BBC documentary that aired in the U.K. a week before the 2024 election.",
      "The lawsuit claims the BBC, \"intentionally and maliciously sought to fully mislead its viewers\" by \"splicing together\" two clips from the same speech Mr. Trump gave to supporters in Washington before rioters overran the Capitol building. The two portions of the speech that were stuck together in the documentary were actually delivered by Mr. Trump nearly an hour apart, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "The complaint accuses the BBC of violating the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, \"by engaging in unfair methods of competition, unconscionable acts or practices and/or unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had previously threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion unless it retracted the documentary, issued an apology, and \"appropriately\" compensated him.",
      "In November, the BBC issued an apology and published a retraction, but said in a statement that it \"strongly disagree[s] that there's a basis for a deflation claim.\"",
      "\"BBC Chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the Corporation are sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" the BBC Press Office said in November. \"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms.\"",
      "BBC Director-General Tim Davie and the network's head of news Deborah Turness both resigned over the controversy.",
      "Mark Stephens, a U.K.-based international media lawyer, told CBS News that Mr. Trump's lawsuit \"is unfortunately ill founded and almost bound to fail.\"",
      "\"The President's case, all things being equal, should be thrown out of court at a summary dismissal,\" he said.",
      "Stephens said Mr. Trump's legal team, even if they won their suit against the BBC, would not get a $10 billion settlement.",
      "\"The BBC is a very much a hand-to-mouth kind of organization. It doesn't have profits. It doesn't have shareholders. So literally any money is going to come from the British taxpayers, and I think they'll feel pretty badly about paying President Trump for a court case of this kind,\" Stephens said.",
      "The U.K. has \"a law which essentially does not recognize what we call 'punitive damages' \u2014 damages that intend to punish,\" Stephens said. \"In the U.K., the maximum compensatory damages he would be entitled to is $300,000 U.S. dollars. So even if he got, say, a million or $2 million at court, the British courts would only enforce $300,000.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says proposals being negotiated with U.S. officials for a peace deal to end his country's nearly four-year war with Russia are \"very workable\" and could be finalized within days, after which American envoys would present them to the Kremlin before further possible meetings in the United States next weekend.",
      "Zelenskyy warned late Monday that a draft peace plan discussed with the U.S. during talks in Berlin earlier in the day had not resolved some key issues, notably what happens to Ukrainian territory occupied by invading Russian forces.",
      "U.S-led peace efforts appear to be picking up momentum. But Russian President Vladimir Putin may balk at some of the proposals thrashed out by officials from Washington, Kyiv and Western Europe, including postwar security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated Tuesday that Russia wants a comprehensive peace deal, not a temporary truce.",
      "If Ukraine seeks \"momentary, unsustainable solutions, we are unlikely to be ready to participate,\" Peskov said.",
      "\"We want peace - we don't want a truce that would give Ukraine a respite and prepare for the continuation of the war,\" he told reporters. \"We want to stop this war, achieve our goals, secure our interests, and guarantee peace in Europe for the future.\"",
      "American officials on Monday said that there's consensus from Ukraine and Europe on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan. President Trump said, \"I think we're closer now than we have been, ever\" to a peace settlement.",
      "Plenty of potential pitfalls remain, however.",
      "Zelenskyy reiterated that Kyiv rules out recognizing Moscow's control over any part of the Donbas, an economically important region in eastern Ukraine made up of Luhansk and Donetsk. Russia's army doesn't fully control either.",
      "\"The Americans are trying to find a compromise,\" Zelenskyy said before visiting the Netherlands on Tuesday. \"They are proposing a 'free economic zone' (in the Donbas). And I want to stress once again: a 'free economic zone' does not mean under the control of the Russian Federation.\"",
      "The land issue remains one of the most difficult obstacles to a comprehensive agreement.",
      "Putin wants all the areas in four key regions that his forces have seized, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory.",
      "Zelenskyy warned that if Putin rejects diplomatic efforts, Ukraine expects increased Western pressure on Moscow, including tougher sanctions and additional military support for defense. Kyiv would seek enhanced air defense systems and long-range weapons if diplomacy collapses, he said.",
      "Ukraine and the U.S. are preparing up to five documents related to the peace framework, several of them focused on security, Zelenskyy said.",
      "U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey was upbeat about the progress in the Berlin talks. \"We are at a major moment in this war. The US-led push for peace is advancing, and yesterday in Berlin there were signals of a progress in the peace talks which is further advanced than at any time during this war,\" he said at a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.",
      "Zelenskyy was also positive about the talks.",
      "\"Overall, there was a demonstration of unity,\" he said. \"It was truly positive in the sense that it reflected the unity of the U.S., Europe, and Ukraine.\"",
      "Speaking at the launch of the International Claims Commission for Ukraine in The Hague Tuesday, Zelenskyy added: \"As long as our people remain in Russian captivity and until the Ukrainian children abducted by Russia are brought home, sanctions must limit Russia, until it shows respect for peaceful for peaceful life and the rights of its neighbors. And of course, of course, every Russian war crime must have consequences for those who committed them.\"",

      "A judge sentenced a Sydney taekwondo instructor on Tuesday to life in prison without possibility of release for murdering a 7-year-old student and the boy's parents.",
      "Kwang Kyung Yoo, 51, sat with his head bowed as Justice Ian Harrison said he would never be eligible for parole.",
      "The former instructor, who was called Master Lion by his students, did not look at the victims' family as they cried in court, 9News Australia reported. He held a Bible stuffed with notes during the sentencing, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.",
      "Harrison said Yoo has been motivated by the jealousy he felt for the family's financial success.",
      "\"I'm satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of these offenses is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence,\" Harrison told the New South Wales Supreme Court.",
      "Harrison said Yoo had no reason to murder the boy or his parents in February last year.",
      "\"These killings were horrific and violent acts, senselessly cruel and cynical, perpetrated without a trace of human compassion or consideration for the dignity of the Cho family,\" Harrison said, according to news.au.",
      "State law prevents child victims of crime from being identified, so the boy's parents also can't be named.",
      "Yoo and his victims were all born in South Korea.",
      "Yoo had pleaded guilty to the three murders at an earlier court appearance. He had no prior criminal record.",
      "Yoo had strangled the boy and his 41-year-old mom in his Lion's Taekwondo and Martial Arts Academy in western Sydney. He owed tens of thousands of dollars at the time and was behind in rent on the academy.",
      "He took the mother's Apple watch and drove her luxury BMW car to the family home where he stabbed the boy's 39-year-old father to death.",
      "Yoo was injured in the struggle in the home and drove himself to a hospital where he told medical staff he had been attacked in a supermarket car park. Police arrested him at the hospital.",
      "After his arrest, Yoo could not explain how he intended to get the family's money and later detailed his remorse.",
      "While the crimes were planned \u2014 with Yoo surveilling the family's home beforehand \u2014 he made no attempt to conceal his crimes from the CCTV cameras in his academy or try to conceal the bodies.",
      "The judge heard Yoo had lied about qualifying for the 2000 Olympics, owning a Lamborghini and living in Sydney's wealthy suburbs, 9News Australia reported. He would send emails to himself, pretending to be important people, in order to impress his wife, the outlet reported.",
      "Harrison noted that Yoo had told a psychologist his lies became bigger and bigger as his wife and students asked more questions.",
      "\"I wanted to give her hope,\" he told his psychiatrist, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. \"However, over time it became bigger and bigger and didn't stop. She was so happy.\"",
      "The judge noted Yoo had been burdened since childhood with unrealistic expectations from his parents and South Korean culture about the level of success he needed to achieve.",
      "Yoo was handed a box of tissues as the judge described his deep remorse for the hurt and pain that he had caused.",
      "In a letter to the judge, Yoo said he was \"held captive by sin\" and that he wanted to give himself to Jesus Christ.",
      "\"I wish I could turn back time so this didn't happen,\" Yoo wrote. \"I pray every day for the people I have hurt.\"",
      "Yoo's lawyers had argued that he should be given a minimum nonparole period rather than a life sentence without possibility of release. The maximum penalty for someone convicted of murder in New South Wales is life imprisonment, with a standard nonparole period of 20 years for the murder of an adult and 25 years for the murder of a child.",

      "Two suspected gunmen accused of killing 15 people and injuring dozens during a Hanukkah celebration in Australia have been identified as a father and a son, authorities said. The younger man was reportedly investigated years ago over suspected links to an ISIS cell in Sydney, and Australian officials confirmed Tuesday afternoon local time that two homemade ISIS flags were discovered in a vehicle registered to him.",
      "The shooting was \"a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State,\" Australia's federal police commissioner Krissy Barrett said.",
      "The 50-year-old father, identified by police as Sajid Akram, was shot and killed by police, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday that the 24-year-old son remained hospitalized in a coma.",
      "\"Based on his medical condition, it is likely that the person may face criminal charges,\" New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon has said, without going into further details.",
      "The 24-year-old suspect was identified as Naveed Akram, according to U.S. intelligence officials briefed on the investigation. CBS News has also reviewed Naveed Akram's New South Wales driver's license. Authorities said Sunday they had identified the father as a licensed gun owner.",
      "The officials had told CBS News that Naveed Akram was a Pakistani national, but Australian officials later said he was Australian-born. Officials have not confirmed what country the father migrated to Australia from. At the news conference on Tuesday local time, Lanyon also confirmed reports that the two alleged gunmen traveled to the Philippines last month. The exact location and purpose of the trip are under investigation, he said.",
      "Lanyon has said investigators recovered six of the suspect's licensed firearms at the scene. He initially said the older suspect had had a gun license for about 10 years, but confirmed Tuesday that the application lapsed in 2016. However, a second license was applied for in 2020 and eventually issued in 2023, meaning the older suspect was licensed appropriately at the time of the shooting, according to the police commissioner.",
      "The suspect met the eligibility criteria for a recreational hunting license and \"was a member of a gun club,\" Lanyon has said.",
      "In addition to two homemade ISIS flags found in Naveed Akram's vehicle, improvised explosive devices were also recovered, police said Tuesday.",
      "\"We will look at the motives behind this attack and I think it is important as part of the investigation,\" Lanyon said.",
      "Prime Minister Albanese confirmed that the younger suspect had been under investigation by the Australian Security Intelligence Agency (ASIO), the country's primary spy agency, for about six months during 2019.",
      "According to public broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corp., ASIO looked into the son's possible ties to a cell of the ISIS terrorist organization in Sydney. Albanese didn't go into detail, but had said that ASIO had been focused on individuals believed to be in that cell who were associated with the son, rather than the son himself.",
      "\"He was examined on the basis of being associated with others, and the assessment was made that there was no indication of any ongoing threat or threat of him engaging in violence,\" the prime minister said.",
      "During an earlier news conference, Australian police said they were looking for a potential third suspect, but Lanyon later confirmed that was no longer the case.",
      "More than 1,000 people were gathered at Bondi Beach in Sydney on Sunday. Albanese said the gunmen were \"deliberately targeting the Jewish community on the first day of Hanukkah.\"",
      "The attack at the popular beach left at least 40 people injured, including two officers and three children, Australian officials said.",
      "Also among the injured is 43-year-old fruit seller Ahmed al Ahmed, who had been shot after he confronted one of the gunmen and wrestled the weapon away, Agence France-Presse reported.",
      "One video\u00a0posted to social media shows al Ahmed jump out from behind a parked car along Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach, tackle one of the suspects who had just fired his gun, and wrestle the weapon away.",
      "President Trump, during an event at the White House on Sunday, said al Ahmed's actions \"saved a lot of lives.\"",
      "Anna Schecter, Emily Mae Czachor, Archie Clarke and Sam Vinograd contributed to this report, which has been updated to reflect Australian authorities saying the younger suspect is Australian-born.\u00a0Police in India's Telangana state later confirmed on Dec. 16 that the older suspect, Sajid Akram, was an Indian national from\u00a0the state's capital city Hyderabad.",

      "The U.S. military says it struck three more alleged drug-carrying boats in the Eastern Pacific on Monday, the latest in a campaign of vessel strikes ordered by the Trump administration that have killed at least 95 people in 25 boats.",
      "Monday's strikes killed eight men across three boats, the U.S. military's Southern Command said in a post on X. It alleged the occupants were \"male narco-terrorists\" and the boats were \"transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and were engaged in narco-trafficking.\" The strike was authorized by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Southern Command said.",
      "Southern Command also posted a 47-second video that appeared to show three separate strikes on vessels.",

      "The U.S. military began striking boats in the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean in early September, part of what the Trump administration has described as a \"non-international armed conflict\" against drug cartels that it has designated as terror groups.",
      "The campaign is increasingly controversial, however. Democratic lawmakers and a handful of Republicans argue the Trump administration lacks legal authority to conduct the strikes and hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the boats were actually carrying narcotics.",
      "Meanwhile, a Sept. 2 strike that started off the campaign has drawn scrutiny after reports emerged that two people in the vessel survived the initial hit but were killed in a follow-on strike. Democrats who watched a video of the Sept. 2 operation decried the decision, and some critics have warned that killing shipwrecked survivors could constitute a war crime. Republicans have defended the follow-on strike, arguing the survivors may have still been in the fight.",
      "The boat strikes are part of a broader U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean and near Latin America, with several naval vessels \u2014 including the USS Gerald R. Ford \u2014 and fighter jets shifting to the region in recent months.",
      "The administration has heaped pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of collaborating with drug cartels, and it has also argued that Colombia has failed to crack down on drug trafficking. Both countries have criticized the boat strikes, and the Venezuelan government has accused the Trump administration of seeking regime change.",

    "story": [
      "Officials said 15 people are dead after gunmen targeted the attendees of a Jewish community event\u00a0on Sunday in Australia's Bondi Beach. Another 40 people were hospitalized with injuries, including a child and two officers, according to police. Two of the suspects were identified as a father and a son, according to Mal Lanyon, the police commissioner of New South Wales.",
      "The 50-year-old father was killed, and the son \u2014 identified as 24-year-old Naveed Akram, a Pakistani national based in Sydney, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing and a driver's license provided by Australian police \u2014 was in custody in critical but stable condition, Lanyon said.",
      "\"Based on his medical condition, it is likely that the person may face criminal charges,\" Lanyon said in a separate update Sunday, but didn't go into further details.",
      "Australian officials and international leaders have condemned it as an antisemitic terrorist attack.",
      "Police said they expect the death toll to climb. Here is what we know so far.",
      "Gunfire broke out at a Hanukkah celebration",
      "The attack took place during a Jewish holiday celebration held to mark the first day of Hanukkah. More than 1,000 people were on the beach, in a suburb of Sydney, when shots rang out, said New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon, who officially declared the shooting a \"terrorist incident.\"",
      "Numerous Australian officials have characterized the shooting as targeted. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said it \"was designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.\"",
      "\"This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah \u2014 which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith \u2014 an act of evil antisemitism, terrorism, that has struck the heart of our nation,\" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said at a news conference.",
      "Video footage recorded by civilians showed frightened crowds of beachgoers fleeing the area as gunshots went off in the background.",
      "Neither officials nor police have identified the victims of the attack. Chabad, a global organization representing a branch of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, said Rabbi Eli Schlanger, with Chabad of Bondi, was among the dead, the Associated Press reported. Schlanger had been a key organizer of the Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach, according to the organization.",
      "2 suspects identified as father and son",
      "Australian authorities said two gunmen were suspected of carrying out the deadly mass shooting, a rare occurrence in a country where gun violence is uncommon.",
      "Lanyon said the deceased suspect was previously known to the New South Wales police force. In addition to the 50-year-old gunman killed at the scene of the attack, another was hospitalized with serious injuries, he said. The surviving gunman, the 24-year-old son, has been taken into custody. The commissioner later said officers were not looking for an additional suspect.",
      "The 24-year-old was identified as Naveed Akram, a Pakistani national based in Sydney, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing and a driver's license provided by Australian police.",
      "Six licensed firearms were found at the scene, Lanyon said, adding that they all belong to the father. The police commissioner originally said that the older suspect had a gun licence for about 10 years. He later clarified that the father had been approved for a license in 2015, but that license lapsed after he failed to have his picture taken for the license as required by law. The father again applied for a license in 2020 and was granted one in 2023, Lanyon said. The suspect met the eligibility criteria for a recreational hunting license and \"was a member of a gun club,\" Lanyon said.",
      "\"We will look at the motives behind this attack and I think it is important as part of the investigation,\" he said.",
      "The pair traveled to the Philippines last month, Lanyon said, but noted investigators had not determined why they went or where specifically in the country they traveled.",
      "Good Samaritan disarmed one gunman",
      "A man has been lauded as a hero and praised by the police commissioner for tackling one suspect and disarming him in dramatic video footage recorded by a bystander along Campbell Parade, a main street that wraps around Bondi Beach. In the footage, the man could be seen crouched in hiding behind a parked car before wrestling the suspect and taking his weapon.",
      "Australian news outlets have identified the man seen disarming the suspect as fruit shop owner Ahmed al Ahmed, citing his relatives.",
      "Al Ahmed was wounded in the attack and was set to undergo surgery Wednesday at St. George Hospital, according to Albanese. Albanese did not give further details on al Ahmed's condition, but said he met with him and family members, including al Ahmed's parents, on Tuesday to thank him for the lives he saved and wish him well.",
      "Officers found explosive devices, homemade ISIS flags",
      "Shortly after the shooting took place, officers who responded to the scene discovered a vehicle along Campbell Parade and believed there were several improvised explosive devices inside of it, Lanyon said. The vehicle was linked to the younger gunman, according to the police commissioner.",
      "Lanyon said at a press conference Tuesday that the vehicle also contained two homemade ISIS flags.",
      "Rising antisemitism in Australia",
      "Although Australia rarely experiences mass shootings, after implementing stringent gun reform laws in the wake of a deadly 1996 massacre in Tasmania's Port Arthur, antisemitic incidents have been on the rise in the country since the war in Gaza began in 2023.",
      "The Australian government appointed special envoys in 2024 to address spiking antisemitism, as well as Islamophobia, in its communities. But attacks still happened this year. One, in July, involved an arsonist who set fire to the door of a synagogue in Melbourne, while worshippers were inside.",
      "World leaders react",
      "The attack on Bondi Beach drew widespread condemnation from leaders across the globe.",
      "In the U.S., Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke out against antisemitism in\u00a0a social media post, which said: \"Antisemitism has no place in this world. Our prayers are with the victims of this horrific attack, the Jewish community, and the people of Australia.\"",
      "Rubio joined officials from numerous countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Finland, New Zealand, India, Qatar and Pakistan, who similarly shared remarks expressing sympathy for the victims and solidarity with Jewish communities, as well as denouncing antisemitism.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was among the officials in his country who responded publicly to the attack in Australia. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0released by his office, Netanyahu criticized Albanese for supporting a Palestinian state and said such support fuels antisemitism.",
      "\"Your call for a Palestinian state pours fuel on the antisemitic fire,\" Netanyahu's statement read, quoting a letter that the Israeli prime minister said he wrote to Albanese in August. \"It rewards Hamas terrorists. It emboldens those who menace Australian Jews and encourages the Jew hatred now stalking your streets.\"",
      "The American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group and charity organization, said the attack \"comes after repeated warnings, including from the Australian Jewish community itself,\" adding that \"allowing antisemitic rhetoric and demonstrations to go unchecked can\u2014and does\u2014lead to violence and death.\"",

      "Sheina Gutnick said that her father, Reuven Morrison, a 62-year-old Soviet-born member of the ultra-orthodox Jewish community in Australia, was killed while attempting to stop one of the two gunmen during Sunday's mass shooting, which Australian authorities have called an antisemitic terror attack.",
      "\"From my sources and understanding, he had jumped up the second the shooting started. He managed to throw bricks at the terrorist,\" Gutnick told CBS News in Bondi on Monday, referencing an attempt to stop one of the gunmen that was caught on camera during the attack the previous day.",
      "She said it was her father seen trying to stop one of the assailants after another man, later identified as 43-year-old fruit seller Ahmed al Ahmed, confronted the suspect and wrestled a gun away from him.",
      "\"I believe after Ahmed managed to get the gun off the terrorist, my father had then gone to try and unjam the gun, to try and attempt shooting. He was screaming at the terrorist,\" she said. \"My dear father, Reuven Morrison was shot dead for being Jewish at a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach while protecting lives, while jumping up, putting his own life at risk to save his fellow Jewish community members.\"",

I immediately felt the biggest pit in my stomach and tried calling my father who did not pick up the phone. I then called my mother and I heard screaming, shouting. She was screaming that there's an active shooter,\" Gutnick said. \"I called her back and she was yelling that he's running, he's running, and then that he has been shot. After a few more attempts of hanging up and calling back, my mother was yelling for medical assistance, screaming for an ambulance, screaming for help, asking for help ... she then advised that he's getting oxygen and hung up the phone.\"",
      "She said she managed to get her mother back on the phone, \"and she was screaming that they had stopped working on him and that he had been covered by a sheet. I was hoping in her hysterical state that she was just being delusional and that wasn't the case.\"",

      "Australian police, \"lay on the ground in the grass covering their heads, untrained for this massacre, untrained for what's to come, untrained for what the Jewish community has been telling the Australian government is inevitable,\" Gutnick said, adding her voice to a chorus of criticism after a documented rise in hate attacks aimed at Australia's Jewish residents.",
      "\"Australia's not a home for Jews anymore. It can't be. If we are shot dead while celebrating our religious festival of lights, of pride, of celebrating who we are, and if we can't do that, Australia is not a house for us anymore. We can't be here,\" she added",

      "\"We expected the verdict,\" she told CBS News. \"As much as you can expect that, you can only be so ready for it. So I am grieving.\"",
      "Lai, 78, was found guilty on three charges: one sedition charge and two charges of violating the National Security Law, a controversial Hong Kong law instituted in 2020 following pro-democracy protests in 2019. The charges were conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country and conspiracy to publish seditious material.",
      "Lai is the founder of Apple Daily, a pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong that was often sharply critical of the Chinese government and its growing influence over the city. The paper closed in 2021 after police raided the newsroom, arrested reporters and froze the publication's assets. Jimmy Lai was arrested in 2020 and held in custody since.",
      "Jonathan Price, part of Jimmy Lai's international legal team, said the results of the trial were unsurprising, but argued they reflect China's reneging of commitments to the rule of law in Hong Kong and agreements made between the British and Chinese governments when Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997. The government in Beijing had agreed to grant Hong Kong autonomy until at least 2047, but it has increasingly exerted control over the enclave.",
      "\"It's 855 pages of obfuscation, fluff, diversion with some colorful language, but no substance,\" he told CBS News. \"It's extraordinary that a document of that length involving a case about someone who ran a press organization doesn't mention substantively, press freedom, freedom of speech, freedom to protest, or any human rights.\"",
      "Claire Lai last spoke to her father in June of this year, and said his condition has noticeably deteriorated. She described that his nails are changing colors and falling off and his teeth are rotting. She also worries about his diabetes and heart palpitations. She blames his prison conditions and solitary confinement for his deterioration.",
      "Claire Lai, her family and her legal team fear that appeals could take over 8 years and fear Jimmy Lai may not live long enough to endure the process.",
      "\"My father does not have eight years. If we wait to the end of the appeals process, there will not be a man at the end of that process,\" she told CBS News.",
      "On Monday, President Trump and British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper both called for the release of Jimmy Lai.",
      "In the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said, \"I feel so badly. I spoke to President Xi about it, and I asked to consider his release. He's not well. He's an older man, and he's not well. So I did put that request out, we'll see what happens.\"",
      "Cooper emphasized that Jimmy Lai is a British citizen and told Parliament that she had summoned the Chinese Ambassador after hearing the verdict.",
      "\"But for the sake of Jimmy Lai, for his family, but also for the people of Hong Kong, for the joint Declaration we signed, and for the rule of law, we will not relent on this,\" she said. \"Joined by nations across the world, we call again for the immediate release of Jimmy Lai.\"",
      "Earlier in the year, Claire Lai met with members of Congress on Capitol Hill, culminating in a bipartisan letter asking for her father's release.",
      "As the holidays near, Claire Lai remembers the few times she saw her father a year since 2020, on their birthdays and Christmas. She said she hopes she can see her father again someday, without their conversations recorded and without armed prison guards standing by.",
      "\"One of the many things I've learned from my father is that you have to face adversity and difficulties with a certain degree of cheer and spirit,\" she told CBS News. \"My father has shown that not even his failing health can alleviate him of the burden of truth, and that's why he chose to take the stand for so many days.\"",

      "Wayne and Vanessa were at the event at Australia's famous Bondi Beach on Sunday with their two daughters, and they said it was a joyful, peaceful event to celebrate the start of the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, until it was shattered by two gunmen firing indiscriminately into the crowd.",
      "\"They were giving out donuts, and there was face painting and there was music, the kids were just having an absolute ball,\" Wayne told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King on Monday.",
      "Then, standing in a line with daughter Capri, Wayne heard what he first thought was a firecracker. Then there was another crack, and he realized it was gunfire.",
      "\"My daughter was in front of me. I just turned, I grabbed her, and I just saw a table and I just dived under this table and I just lay on top of my daughter Capri,\" he recalled. \"I was just lying on top of her, just shielding her.\"",
      "\"The bullets were just going off, people screaming and running and running. About two arm lengths from me, there was a guy shot on the floor who was screaming, 'help, help!'\" Wayne recalled.",
      "As rounds flew overhead, his wife called him, and they quickly realized they had lost track of their other little girl, Gigi, in the chaos.",
      "\"Vanessa calls me and says, 'Have you got the girls?' I'm like, 'I've got Capri. I'm on top of Capri. Where's Gigi? Gigi, you're with Gigi. Where's Gigi?' She said, 'No, I'm not with Gigi. Where's Gigi?' And at this stage, I thought, okay, I need to look for her, and I stuck my head out from under the table to look up into the field. And somebody shouted, 'There's gunshots!' I just heard gunshots. And the guy said, Get down, get down, get down. And I just thought, 'I just need to wait and protect my little Capri.'\"",
      "\"It was terrifying,\" said Vanessa. \"I'm screaming and the gunshots are going and I'm trying to run.\"",
      "She said she even tried to grab a police officer's gun at one point, \"to save more lives.\"",
      "\"I've got nothing to lose. I've gotta go, I've gotta go,\" the mother thought. \"I felt hopeless. I looked, I was watching the whole thing. I just see people on the ground. I called my mother and I said, 'Gigi's dead. Gigi is dead, Gigi's dead.' I just knew she was dead \u2026 What does a 3-year-old know? ... You think they're gonna drop to the ground and take cover? No. I just knew she'd be running around screaming. She was an easy target.\"",
      "Wayne eventually found his wife, handed their daughter Capri over to Vanessa, and then set out to look for Gigi.",
      "\"I ran back into the field to look for Gigi, and I was looking amongst the blood and the bodies and I found my little girl lying underneath this beautiful hero, an absolute brave hero, Jess. She was shielding my little baby from the gunshots,\" he told CBS News. \"It was the most special moment of my life to find her, and I took her number and I said, 'Jess, thank you. You're an absolute brave hero. You're an absolute superhero.\"",
      "Vanessa said Jess continued shooting video of the attackers even as she laid down over the Gigi to protect her, \"and you could see the guy on the bridge, shooting at her. Shooting towards her.\"",
      "She said she'd asked her husband whether he felt the event was safe just 15 minutes before the attack started, noting what seemed to her to be very few security personnel in the area.",
      "\"There were only two policemen there,\" Vanessa said. \"I didn't feel safe. I said to him, 'I don't feel safe.'\"",
      "The couple were highly critical of Australia's government, accusing officials of having \"done nothing to protect the Jewish communities\" in the country in the face of rising antisemitism.",
      "Police should have been on high alert, given that it was a Hanukkah celebration and antisemitic threats and attacks have skyrocketed in Australia since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, according to data from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.",
      "According to data compiled by the council, antisemitic incidents in Australia remain at historically high levels \u2014 almost five times the average annual number seen before Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Police officials in New South Wales state said at least 15 people were killed and 40 others remained in local hospitals following what Australian leaders have called an antisemitic attack.",
      "The suspects were a father and son. They had six firearms \u2014 legally owned by the 50-year-old father \u2014 and had assembled an improvised explosive device, all allegedly to target the Jewish gathering, according to Australian authorities.",
      "\"It was ground zero,\" Ben Ferguson, among the emergency responders to reach the scene, told CBS News. \"We were all there, and ended up carrying bodies into the street.\"",
      "Ferguson, a lifeguard at the local Bondi surf club, said members of the club were among the first to provide medical attention to people wounded in the shooting, and he said they started doing so as soon as the gunfire stopped. \"We realized it was a mass shooting event when someone screamed that the gunman was reloading, and then we just knew that we were completely vulnerable.\"",
      "\"There was a really big feeling \u2026 a constant paranoia that a bomb was gonna go off. And we didn't know where the gunmen were,\" Ferguson told CBS News on Monday. \"The Surf club has a lot of medical resources ourselves, and so there was a lot of running over and delivering oxygen tanks.\"",
      "Friends and family pay tribute to slain Rabbi Eli Schlanger",
      "Alex Ryvchin, co-CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told CBS News he believes a last-minute decision to not attend the Hanukkah event saved his life.",
      "\"For the last 10 years, the rabbi has invited me to speak and to convey a message. And this year, for the first time, I didn't attend \u2014 I had my oldest daughter's best friend's bat mitzvah, so I was somewhere else,\" he said.",
      "\"The rabbi who invited me, who was a dear dear friend of mine, who I would have been standing next to, was among the slaughtered,\" Ryvchin told CBS News.",
      "The co-CEO paid tribute to Rabbi Eli Schlanger, who was one of the organizers of the event, calling him an \"extraordinary human being.\" Ryvchin said Schlanger's work across the state of New South Wales included helping the underprivileged and visiting people hospitalized with terminal illnesses.",
      "Schlanger's brother-in-law, Rabbi Mendel Kastel, was also at the event with his family.",
      "\"The last 24 hours is really, really difficult,\" Kastel told CBS News on Monday. \"You know, losing a brother-in-law, you know, a family member, so I'm directly affected. But at the same time, I've got a role in the community supporting others. It's been really difficult.\"",
      "Kastel lauded Schlanger as \"an amazing young man, a person who was committed to his work.\"",
      "\"He was committed to the community. People loved him. Wherever he went he took real interest in people and people took a real interest in him. He would visit people in hospitals, he'd visit people in prisons, he would teach people, he would teach bar mitzvahs. He would inspire other rabbis with his enthusiasm, his positivity,\" Kastel said.",
      "Shalom, a 20-year-old man from Miami who has been living in Bondi, told CBS News his friend was still hospitalized on Monday after being shot while near Schlanger.",
      "\"From what I've heard he was with the rabbi and another policeman, and all three of them got shot,\" Shalom said. \"My friend \u2026 he got shot twice, he got shot one in the stomach, came out, went out, and one in the leg.\"",
      "\"We were at the hospital the whole night last night, and we were with him, praying, just being there for him and he was on a breathing tube. They did a surgery and they said it [the bullet] hit one of his bowels and they fixed it up, and said he's stable, thank God,\" Shalom added.",
      "Grieving residents living in Bondi, a southern suburb of Sydney, came together Monday to lay flowers and mourn the dead following the shooting attack.",
      "For Rabbi Kastel, it's that community spirit that's the essence of what Hanukkah symbolizes.",
      "\"We want to shine, we want to light those candles together, we wanna put our arms around each other and really build a proper Australian community where people feel valued, people feel loved, and people feel cared for,\" he said.",

      "But the judges ruled that Lai had never wavered in his intention to destabilize the ruling Chinese Communist Party, \"continuing though in a less explicit way.\"",
      "Toh said the court was satisfied that Lai was the mastermind of the conspiracies and that Lai's evidence was at times contradictory and unreliable. The judges ruled that the only reasonable inference from the evidence was that Lai's only intent, both before and after the security law, was to seek the downfall of the ruling Communist Party even at the sacrifice of the people of China and Hong Kong.",
      "\"This was the ultimate aim of the conspiracies and secessionist publications,\" they wrote.",
      "Among the attendees were Lai's wife and son, and Hong Kong's Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Zen. Lai pressed his lips and nodded to his family before being escorted out of the courtroom by guards.",
      "His verdict is also a test for Beijing's diplomatic ties. President Trump said he has raised the case with China, and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said his government has made it a priority to secure the release of Lai, a British citizen.",
      "The founder of the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily will be sentenced on a later day.",
      "The collusion charge carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Hearings were set to begin Jan. 12 for Lai and other defendants in the case to argue for a shorter sentence.",
      "The Apple Daily, a vocal critic of the Hong Kong government and Beijing, was forced to shut in 2021 after police raided its newsroom and arrested its senior journalists, with authorities freezing its assets.",
      "During Lai's 156-day trial, prosecutors accused him of conspiring with senior executives of Apple Daily and others to request foreign forces to impose sanctions or blockades and engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.",
      "The prosecution also accused Lai of making such requests, highlighting his meetings with former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in July 2019 at the height of the protests.",
      "It also presented 161 publications, including Apple Daily articles, to the court as evidence, as well as social media posts and text messages.",
      "Lai testified for 52 days in his own defense, arguing that he had not called for foreign sanctions after the sweeping security law was imposed in June 2020.",
      "His legal team also argued for freedom of expression.",
      "Lai's health in focus",
      "As the trial progressed, Lai's health appeared to be deteriorating.",
      "Lai's lawyers in August told the court that he suffered from heart palpitations. After the verdict, lawyer, Robert Pang, said his client is in OK spirits as the legal team studies the verdict.",
      "Before the verdict, his daughter Claire told The Associated Press her father has become weaker and lost some of his nails and teeth. She also said he suffered from infections for months, along with constant back pain, diabetes, heart issues and high blood pressure.",
      "\"His spirit is strong but his body is failing,\" she said.",
      "Hong Kong's government said no abnormalities were found during a medical examination that followed Lai's complaint of heart problems. It added this month that the medical services provided to him were adequate.",
      "Hong Kong leader John Lee said Lai harmed the fundamental interests of the country, calling his intentions malicious.",
      "Steve Li, chief superintendent of Hong Kong police's National Security Department, disputed claims of Lai's worsening health outside the court building.",
      "\"Lai's conviction is justice served,\" he told reporters.",
      "In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said China expressed firm opposition to the vilification of the city's judiciary by \"certain countries,\" urging those countries to respect the city's legal system.",
      "Before sunrise, dozens of residents queued outside the court building to secure a courtroom seat.",
      "Former Apple Daily employee Tammy Cheung arrived at 5 a.m., saying she wanted to know about Lai's condition after reports of his health.",
      "She said she felt the process was being rushed since the verdict date was announced only last Friday, but added, \"I'm relieved that this case can at least conclude soon.\"",
      "Verdict denounced",
      "Rights groups, including global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders and Amnesty International, criticized the verdict.",
      "\"It is not an individual who has been on trial - it is press freedom itself, and with this verdict that has been shattered,\" said Reporters Without Borders' director general Thibaut Bruttin.",
      "\"The predictability of today's verdict does not make it any less dismaying -- the conviction of Jimmy Lai feels like the death knell for press freedom in Hong Kong, where the essential work of journalism has been rebranded as a crime,\" Amnesty International said, according to French news agency AFP. \"Lai has been jailed simply because he and his Apple Daily newspaper criticized the government.\"",
      "Lai's son Sebastien told a press conference in London, \"It's time to ...make my father's release a pre-condition to closer relationships with China,\" AFP reported.",
      "In 2022, Lai was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison over separate fraud charges involving lease violations, in addition to other cases related to the 2019 protests.",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Dec 2025 08:05:55 -0500",
    "summary": "For the second time in 3 decades, Australian leaders have vowed to respond quickly to a mass shooting with tighter gun ownership laws.",
    "story": [
      "Australian leaders quickly vowed to tighten up the country's laws on firearm ownership in the wake of the deadly gun attack on Jewish people at Bondi Beach on Sunday. Australia has a history of reacting quickly to gun violence with legislation, and many have credited a ban on rapid-fire long guns brought in following a 1996 mass-shooting with sharply reducing death in the years since.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese proposed new gun restrictions, including limiting the number of guns a licensed owner can obtain and reviewing existing licenses over time, just hours after decrying the Bondi Beach massacre as an act of antisemitic terrorism that struck at the heart of the nation.",
      "\"The government is prepared to take whatever action is necessary. Included in that is the need for tougher gun laws,\" Albanese said after authorities revealed that the older of the two suspected gunmen, who were father and son, had held a gun license for a decade and amassed his six guns legally. Those weapons, including rifles and at least one shotgun, were believed to have been used in the Sunday attack, according to police.",
      "Other government leaders also proposed restricting gun ownership to Australian citizens, a measure that would have excluded the older suspected gunman, who came to Australia in 1998 on a student visa and became a permanent resident after marrying a local woman, according to authorities. Officials wouldn't confirm what country he had migrated from.",
      "His son, who doesn't have a gun license, is an Australian-born citizen.",
      "The government leaders also proposed the \"additional use of criminal intelligence\" in deciding who was eligible for a gun license. That could hypothetically have meant that a 2019 investigation into the son's suspicious associates, confirmed Monday by Albanese, would have disqualify the father from owning a gun.",
      "Christopher Minns, premier of New South Wales, where Bondi, a suburb of Sydney, is located, said his state's gun laws would change, but he could not yet detail how.",
      "\"It means introducing a bill to Parliament to \u2014  I mean to be really blunt \u2014 make it more difficult to get these horrifying weapons that have no practical use in our community,\" Minns said. \"If you're not a farmer, you're not involved in agriculture, why do you need these massive weapons that put the public in danger and make life dangerous and difficult for New South Wales Police?\"",
      "Australia's ban on semi-automatic long guns came after 1996 massacre",
      "The attack was the deadliest shooting in almost three decades in Australia, since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, in which 35 people were murdered.",
      "Just 12 days after that shooting, Australian lawmakers approved legislation banning the sale and importation of all automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns; forcing people to present a legitimate reason, and wait 28 days, to buy any firearm; and initiating a massive, mandatory gun-buyback for banned weapons.",
      "The Australian government confiscated and destroyed nearly 700,000 firearms in the wake of the law being adopted, reducing the number of gun-owning households by half.",
      "\"It is incontestable that gun-related homicides have fallen quite significantly in Australia, incontestable,\" former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who defied many in his own conservative party to usher in the new laws, told CBS News' Seth Doane two decades later, in 2016.",
      "In the 15 years before those laws were passed, there were 13 mass shootings in Australia. In the two decades since, there was not a single one. Gun homicides overall decreased by nearly 60% in the same period.",
      "\"People used to say to me, 'You violated my human rights by taking away my gun,'\" Howard told CBS News. \"And I'd [respond], 'I understand that. Will you please understand the argument, the greatest human right of all is to live a safe life without fear of random murder.'\"",
      "Asked to respond to critics who said the fall in gun deaths did not necessarily happen because of the legislation, Howard told CBS News: \" I can say that, because all the surveys indicate it.\"",
      "\"The number of deaths from mass shootings, gun-related homicide has fallen, gun related suicide has fallen,\" he said. \"Isn't that evidence? Or are we expected to believe that that was all magically going to happen? Come on!\"",
      "A study published earlier this year, however, found that Australia still had some way to go to fully implement the 2016 legislation, called the National Firearms Agreement. The paper, by the Australia Institute think tank, said some of the measures in the law had yet to be fully brought into force 29 years later, and that others were being inconsistently enforced across different states.",
      "The law \"was ambitious, politically brave, and necessary for public safety,\" the report concluded, lauding Howard's will to defy his fellow lawmakers.",
      "However, \"Australia still allows minors to hold firearm licenses, still lacks a National Firearms Register, and still has inconsistent laws that make enforcement difficult,\" the group said, adding that overall gun ownership across the country had actually boomed over the last three decades.",
      "\"There are now over four million registered privately owned guns in Australia: 800,000 more than before the (1996) buyback,\" the institute said in its May report. \"Australians needs gun laws that live up to the Howard Government's bravery, and right now Australia does not have them.\"",

    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 people had gathered on Bondi Beach on a warm day to celebrate the first night of Hanukkah in Australia. In stark contrast to the joyful energy on the beach, a terror plot was underway, allegedly planned in advance by a father and son who opened fire with rifles into the crowd, with an improvised explosive device at the ready in their car.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday that the younger suspect had been investigated by the country's primary intelligence agency in 2019 \u2014 reportedly over links to a suspected ISIS cell in Sydney \u2014   but that he was deemed to represent no security threat.",
      "\"This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians,\" said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called Sunday's mass shooting \"a targeted attack on Jewish Australians.\" New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said it was \"designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.\"",
      "Police should have been on high alert, given that it was a Hanukkah celebration and antisemitic threats and attacks have skyrocketed in Australia in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, according to data from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.",
      "Yet the two assailants were allegedly able to fire shots toward the beach for more than five minutes, according to eyewitness accounts. Videos show the gunmen taking their time to aim, shoot and then duck from a bridge near the beach. One video shows a good Samaritan jumping on the back of one of the shooters and wrestling his gun away. Local media reported that the man who intervened, identified as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed, suffered two gunshot wounds.",
      "\"The first initial reaction wasn't even by police, it was by civilians, which raised a lot of questions about the role of police,\" said Oded Ailam, who worked in Israeli intelligence for two decades and reviewed videos of the attack for CBS News.",
      "Asked about police response time at a news conference Monday local time, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said, \"I respect a person having an opinion, but I've been really clear: Our police responded promptly. Our police respond very promptly. We work closely with the Jewish community. We are very attuned with providing support to the Jewish community.\"",
      "Ailam told CBS News, \"Everything points to this being a preplanned attack that was planned for a significant amount of time. The big question now is if Iran and Hezbollah will be implicated.\"",
      "Australia earlier this year determined a series of previous arson attacks targeting a synagogue and a Kosher food provider had been directed by Iran, and moved to cut diplomatic ties over the incidents.",
      "\"As a matter of principle, Iran condemns the violent attack against civilians in Sydney, Australia,\" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Sunday on social media. \"Terror violence and mass killing shall be condemned, wherever they're committed, as unlawful and criminal.\"",
      "When asked by reporters about whether Sunday's shooting was an intelligence failure, New South Wales officials waved off the questions and said their priority is keeping the community safe.",
      "The alleged assailants were a father and son duo. U.S. officials told CBS News on Sunday that they were from Pakistan, but Australian authorities later said the son was Australian-born, and they have not confirmed which country the father migrated to Australia from.",
      "They had six firearms \u2014 purchased legally \u2014 and had assembled an improvised explosive device to target the Jewish gathering, according to authorities.",

      "In one particularly notable incident last year, masked assailants conducted an arson attack on the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne. Seven months later an arsonist set fire to the doors of another Melbourne synagogue, the downtown East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation, forcing the congregation to flee.",
      "Another arson attack was carried out at the kosher food provider Lewis Continental Kitchen in Sydney, also last year.",
      "The attacks on both the Adass Israel synagogue and the food company were determined by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) to be tied to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. In August, Prime Minister Albanese expelled Iran's ambassador, Ahmad Sadeghi, and three other Iranian diplomats, citing the intelligence assessment concluding that Iran had directed antisemitic arson attacks on Australian soil.",
      "The ECAJ found antisemitic incidents in Australia remain at historically high levels \u2014 almost five times the average annual number before Oct. 7, 2023, which is the largest spike of any J7 country between 2021 and 2024. J7 refers to the seven countries with the largest Jewish communities outside Israel that form the J7 Task Force Against Antisemitism: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Argentina and Australia.",
      "The J7 Task Force met in Sydney less than one week before Sunday's attack to discuss the growing security threat to the Jewish community in Australia.",
      "\"This attack is not only the latest in a disturbing series of antisemitic incidents in Australia but also around the globe, including in the United States,\" said Oren Segal, senior vice president of counter-extremism and intelligence at the Anti-Defamation League. \"And these incidents are becoming increasingly violent.\"",
      "This article has been updated to note that Australian authorities said the younger suspect is Australian-born. Police in India's Telangana state later confirmed on Dec. 16 that the older suspect, Sajid Akram, was an Indian national from\u00a0the state's capital city Hyderabad.",

    "summary": "At least 15 people were killed at a Jewish gathering on Australia's Bondi Beach, according to Australian government officials and police. One of two gunmen was also dead.",
    "story": [
      "An attack targeting a Jewish gathering at a famous Australian beach on Sunday killed at least 15 people, including a 12-year-old, government officials and police said. Another 40 people were hospitalized with injuries, including two officers and three children.",
      "Police said on Monday that two gunmen \u2014 a 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son \u2014 had opened fire at Bondi Beach while the local Jewish community was celebrating the first night of Hanukkah. The 50-year-old gunman died, while his son was remained hospitalized in a coma on Monday, according to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.",
      "The 24-year-old was identified as Naveed Akram, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing and a driver's license provided by Australian police. Police previously said the deceased gunman was the son, but Lanyon later clarified that the father was shot and killed by police.",
      "Officials had told CBS News on Sunday that Akram was a Pakistani national, but Australian officials later said he was Australian-born. Officials have not confirmed what country the father migrated to Australia from.",
      "Albanese confirmed on Monday that Akram had been investigated for about six months during 2019 by the country's primary intelligence agency. National public broadcaster the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported that the probe was over suspected links to an alleged ISIS cell in Sydney. Albanese said the investigation had determined that Akram posed no apparent threat to public safety.",
      "New South Wales Health Minister Ryan Park said a 12-year-old child was among those killed in the attack. Three other children are being treated in the hospital, he said.",
      "\"This is absolutely horrendous for the community broadly, but particularly the Jewish community. ... What we saw last night was the worst of humanity, but at the same time, the very best of humanity,\" Park said.",
      "Officials have not identified the victims of the attack, although the international organization Chabad, which represents a branch of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, said that one of its rabbis, Rabbi Eli Schlanger, was among the dead, the Associated Press reported. Schlanger had been a key organizer of the Hanukkah celebration where the shooting took place.",
      "Called Hanukkah by the Sea, the event was held to mark the beginning of the Jewish holiday observed from sundown on Sunday until Monday, Dec. 22. More than 1,000 were at the beach when gunfire broke out, said New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon. He called the attack a \"terrorist incident\" and said the perpetrators used \"long arms,\" referring to long guns such as shotguns or rifles, to carry it out.",
      "New South Wales Premier Chris Minns and Albanese also characterized the attack as targeted, with Minns saying it \"was designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.\" The prime minister said it was \"a targeted attack on Jewish Australians.\"",
      "\"What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of antisemitism, an act of terrorism on our shores in an iconic Australian location, Bondi Beach, that is associated with joy, associated with families gathering, associated with celebrations, and it is forever tarnished by what has occurred last evening,\" Albanese said during a news conference on Monday morning local time.",
      "Lanyon said police believed there were several improvised explosive devices inside a vehicle at Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach, which they discovered shortly after the shooting occurred. A rescue bomb disposal crew was at the scene.",
      "International leaders have publicly condemned the attack.",
      "\"The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Australia targeting a Jewish celebration,\" wrote U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in\u00a0a social media post. \"Antisemitism has no place in this world. Our prayers are with the victims of this horrific attack, the Jewish community, and the people of Australia.\"",
      "Rubio's statement echoed others from officials in Israel, New Zealand, India, the United Kingdom and a number of European countries who similarly spoke out to denounce antisemitism and share their condolences after the shooting.",
      "King Charles also addressed the shooting in a statement, in which the monarch said he and Queen Camilla were \"appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack on Jewish people\" attending the Bondi Beach Hanukkah event.",
      "\"In times of hurt, Australians always rally together in unity and resolve,\" he said in the statement, adding that Australia's \"spirit of community and love ... will always triumph over the darkness of such evil.\"",
      "Gunman disarmed by bystander, video shows",
      "Images and video footage have emerged from the scene of the attack, showing the injured being wheeled away on stretchers by first responders.",
      "\"The scenes in Bondi are shocking and distressing,\" said Albanese in a statement. \"My thoughts are with every person affected.\"",
      "One video appeared to show someone wrestling with one of the suspected gunmen and taking his weapon from him, according to Minns, who paid tribute to that individual in some of his comments Sunday.",
      "The video was recorded by a bystander along Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach. In it, a man jumped up from a crouched position behind a parked car and tackled the suspect, who had just fired his weapon toward something out of view.",
      "Following a short struggle, the man disarmed the suspect, pushed him to the ground and turned the weapon on him, at which point the suspect stood up and walked in the opposite direction. The man then lowered the weapon and raised his free hand in the air. Off to the side, one person appeared to be lying unresponsive on the sidewalk beside a different vehicle.",
      "In additional footage, which was also filmed by bystanders, crowds could be seen fleeing Bondi Beach as shots rang out in the background.",
      "Minns called the man, named by relatives to Australian media as fruit shop owner Ahmed al Ahmed, a \"genuine hero.\"",
      "Rare shooting",
      "Mass shootings in Australia are rare. But researchers have recorded dramatic upticks in antisemitic incidents in the country since the Oct. 7, 2023, assault by Hamas terrorists on Israel triggered the war in Gaza, along with spikes in hate incidents against Muslim groups.",
      "In response, the Australian government appointed special envoys last year to address antisemitism and Islamophobia in its communities. However, attacks have continued to happen since then. In July, an arsonist set fire to the door of a synagogue in Melbourne, another major Australian city, seven months after a different synagogue in the same city was burned by criminals in a blaze that injured one worshipper.",
      "This article has been updated to note that Australian authorities said the younger suspect is Australian-born. Police in India's Telangana state later confirmed on Dec. 16 that the older suspect, Sajid Akram, was an Indian national from\u00a0the state's capital city Hyderabad.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" We're joined now by the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Good to have you back.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: It's great to be back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So people are holiday shopping. They're aware of prices. The president said this week prices are coming down tremendously. The latest data, though, from the Consumer Price Index is up 3% year over year, personal consumption index is up 2.8% year over year. What data is he looking at? What's your benchmark?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, one of the things that if you saw his presentation in Pennsylvania, as he put up a bunch of charts, which he loves to do, where he went through the individual items that we've already sort of made a bunch of progress on. And so, for example, under Joe Biden, prescription drugs were up 9%. So far this year, they're down six tenths of a percent. Gasoline is way down. It was like the highest ever under Biden--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Eggs, he was talking about eggs, yeah.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, he was talking about eggs. And so I think the way to think about inflation, of course, is that there are like micro effects, like the time that we had the avian flu affecting drug prices. And then macro effects, which is runaway spending, big deficits and then an accommodative Fed policy. And I think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But now tariffs adding to some price increases according to the Fed chair.",
      "HASSETT: Well, I- you know, I think that the tariff evidence is mixed. But the point is that we've got deficit going way, way down. So right now, it's looking like the deficit for this year will be $600 billion lower than it was last year. That really helps lower inflation. We've got the trade deficit cut in half from last year. And so all of these things are things that should continue to move us towards the Fed target of 2%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Companies aren't necessarily going to bring items down, though, in terms of pricing, right? I mean, the- the president told the Wall Street Journal he didn't know when all of this money, quote, \"is going to kick in.\" I think he was talking to business investment and tariffs, and help voters, \"all I can do is do my job.\" When do you anticipate voters will feel this positive impact?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, it's definitely the case that, and you guys have been covered a lot, that consumer sentiment right now is lower than anyone would like. But, you know, we find that that very often happens during a government shutdown when everybody's really upset--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the last administration called that the \"vibecession,\" right?",
      "HASSETT: No, but--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --the data is good, but people feel bad.",
      "HASSETT: --Yeah, but what's going to happen is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Same thing, you're saying.",
      "HASSETT: No what's- I'm not saying that. What- what I'm saying is that people are going to see the high growth. Growth is 4%. Income growth is up about $1,200 this year. People look at their wallets and see they're doing better, which is why we had the biggest Black Friday ever and so on and so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's more higher income se--",
      "HASSETT: --The sentiment will catch up with the reality. Under Joe Biden, the fact is that real purchasing power dropped by about $3,000. So far this year, it's up by about $1,200 per family. And the money that we're talking about is like real money. So for groceries, it went from $400 a month to $525 a month under Biden. So that's like an extra more than $1,000 a year. You have to spend on groceries. It's down this year for us, for the grocery package, but it's still got a lot of room to grow- to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot more to go--",
      "HASSETT: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the president reduced some tariffs on some of those grocery items--",
      "HASSETT: --On the food stuff--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --with an eye towards that.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, if we don't make it here, then pretty much we don't tariff it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, you mentioned gas. Oil prices globally are relatively low. We saw this Coast Guard interdiction with military forces boarding and seizing this vessel off the coast of Venezuela. Do you feel you have the leeway there, pricing-wise, to conduct more seizures or even a blockade of oil from Venezuela, without it hurting?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm not a foreign policy guy, so what we do with Venezuela and whether we blockade is up to the president and Marco Rubio. But I could say that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But you've got the leeway, right--",
      "HASSETT: --that- that what's been going on is there's been kind of a black market for oil amongst sort of this sanctioned countries. And what we're doing is we're shutting that black market down. Whether that affects prices outside of the sanctioned countries is kind of an open question. Probably not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it will?",
      "HASSETT: No, because they're already kind of on the ropes, these countries. They're only getting oil when they get like sort of black fleets to sneak in and give them the oil. And that's what we're trying to slow down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I want to ask you about the Fed decision. The Federal Open Market Committee said job gains have slowed this year. We also saw the survey from the Business Roundtable. I'm sure you saw it. They asked CEOs what they expect to happen, and they anticipate employment will decrease in 2026 rather than increase. Are you concerned about a hiring slowdown?",
      "HASSETT: The same Fed said that they were more bullish on growth for next year, right? And so I think that we're at a certain--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on the jobs picture.",
      "HASSETT: But on the jobs picture, you know, we're going to get the data next week. And so maybe next Sunday I'll come back and we'll talk about it, because we've got two months of data coming out on Tuesday. And we'll get a clearer picture because right now we just have some very difficult to pin down surveys like the gold standard for this will be really the household survey, which we don't even get for October.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are CEOs. They're the people who would be doing the hiring, right? And they're saying, we're not doing it.",
      "HASSETT: But, but they don't have the broad perspective that we'll get when we get the big data released next week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that big data?",
      "HASSETT: I trust the household survey, especially. And sadly, we won't have one for October. But we're going to get one for November. And that's going to be really important for thinking about where the job market is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Employment is one of the things that the Fed watches closely. And we heard again from the president that you were on this short list to be potentially the next Fed chair, although he was conducting interviews this week. He said you and Hoover's Kevin Warsh are at the top of the list. On Friday, the president was asked how big of a role he wants to personally play in future Fed interest rate decisions. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I certainly should have a role in talking to whoever the head of the Fed is, or the Fed. I don't think- you know the old days that used to happen. Nowadays, it's sort of, they think it shouldn't happen. But I've done great. I've made a lot of money, I'm very successful. I think my voice should be heard.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 As Fed chair, how frequently would you consult with the president when he says he wants his voice heard?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm right now the top economic advisor for the president, and I talk about almost everything with him almost every day. I've certainly talked about monetary policy. I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be and to do so, you know, basically with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it's a committee that votes. And I'd be happy to talk to the president every day, you know, until both of us are dead because it's so much fun to talk--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even if you were Fed Chair.",
      "HASSETT:\u00a0 Even if I were Fed Chair or if I wasn't Fed Chair. You know what, I would hope that Kevin Warsh would be talking to the president as well if he were Fed Chair.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And voice should be heard is going to be--",
      "HASSETT: You know, every Fed Chair talks to lots and lots of market experts--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Equal to the other members- of the voting members or?",
      "HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would the president's voice have equal weighting to the voting members?",
      "HASSETT: No, no, he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good, you know, if it's based on data. And then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that's a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they'll vote in a different way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Well, we'll be watching to see what happens. Kevin Hassett.",
      "HASSETT: Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks as always. We'll be right back.",

      "The 66-year-old British TV personality and record executive rose to global prominence when he served as a judge on the singing competition series, the U.K.'s \"Pop Idol\" and its mega-hit spin-off \"American Idol,\" where he became known for his blunt critiques and ability to spot commercial talent quickly. Cowell went on to create the massively successful franchises \"The X Factor\" and \"Got Talent\" and helped launch the careers of major artists through his company Syco Entertainment.",

So I've always learned to read an audience. Or certainly when you've got people around you. So when I was auditioning on the show, we had a lot of people in the room with us. And when someone did walk in, the whole energy changed.\"",
      "Over the years, Cowell has helped transform previously unknown singers into global stars.

      "\"If I get to see them afterwards, I will go and talk to them and tell them why I didn't like them,\" he said. \"Sometimes I can give them advice. I mean that there are times \u2014 I'm not gonna lie \u2014 where people come in and I'm thinking, 'Wow, I just don't see this happening to you because you're not singing well. I don't think singing lessons are gonna help.' And sometimes you've got to give people a different steer in life.\"",
      "\"I'm a great believer \u2014 you just don't bulls--- people,\"Cowell continued. \"I've learned that on a personal level when I was starting up in the music business. You know, it was tough, you know, and I kind of learnt to do my job well because people fortunately were the same with me. They were very, very, very blunt with me and told me whether I was doing something good or bad. And that's the way you learn. And that's when I decided eventually that I was gonna be on camera after doing this, I was like, 'Well, I'm not gonna lie to anyone. I've gotta be honest with them.

      "\"While there's no strict age cutoff, generally above the age of mid 40s and above, we tend to be a little more cautious \u2014 particularly in people who are less active [without] regular exercise,\" Dr. Navjot Kaur Sobti, M.D., an interventional cardiologist at Northwell\u2019s Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York, told Fox News Digital.",

      "That study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine last month, also found that those over age 65 had higher rates of temperature-related deaths.",

      "Safer shoveling tips",
      "The cardiologist said it\u2019s ideal to have someone else help with snow removal \u2014 but if you do choose to use a shovel, she recommends pacing yourself and using a \"pushing or sweeping\" motion instead of heavy lifting.",
      "Recent research has shown that cold exposure accounts for nearly twice as many cardiovascular deaths as heat exposure. (iStock)",
      "To protect against the cold, Sobti also recommends covering your mouth, nose and extremities, wearing a hat and gloves, and using extra caution in windy conditions.",

      "Sen. Lindsey Graham warned that the U.S. mission in Venezuela must end with Nicol\u00e1s Maduro removed from power, arguing that leaving the embattled leader in place after a major U.S. show of force would be a \"fatal mistake to our standing in the world.\"",
      "\"If after all this, we still leave this guy in power\u2026 that\u2019s the worst possible signal you can send to Russia, China, Iran,\" Graham, R-S.C., told reporters after a classified all-senator briefing with War Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Trump administration officials did not say whether a series of narco-strikes in the Caribbean could escalate into direct strikes against Venezuelan territory or a broader campaign to oust Maduro. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Fox News Digital the briefing was \"absent of specificity and detail\" and left \"more questions than answers.\"",
      "\"I want to reassert, again, you cannot allow this man to be standing after this display of force, and I did not get a very good answer as to what happens,\" Graham said. \"What I want is some clarity going forward. Is that in fact the goal?\u2026 If it\u2019s not the goal, it is a huge mistake.\"",

      "\"I actually think that was, for me, more of an exercise in futility. I really have no answers. Really didn't gain anything more than what the public already has gotten,\" he said. He added that there was \"really no conversation about why\u2026 we got 15,000 troops there,\" arguing the deployment \"doesn't seem to be just about narcotics trafficking.\"",
      "Meeks said briefers provided \"no real rational decision or real answers\" about whether the U.S. is preparing for \"a war in Venezuela,\" raising what he described as a pressing war powers issue. He said he plans to bring forward legislation this week addressing the recent strikes \"in the Pacific, in the Caribbean\" as well as any potential move by Trump \"to go into Venezuela.\"",

      "Hegseth and Rubio\u2019s briefing came as the U.S. undertakes its largest military buildup in the region in decades: 15% of all naval assets are now positioned in the Southern Command theater. Graham cited the deployment as evidence that anything short of Maduro\u2019s removal would undermine U.S. credibility.",
      "\"It got, yeah, 15% of the Navy pointed to this guy,\" he said.",
      "Graham also pointed to historical precedent, arguing the U.S. has acted similarly when confronting hostile or destabilizing regimes.",
      "\"We have legal authority, in my view, to do in Venezuela what we did regarding Panama and Haiti,\" he said, recalling that in 1989 the U.S. \"literally invaded Panama\u2026 took the president in power and put him in jail.\"",

Tim Walz on Tuesday, Trump's education secretary blasted his handling of the massive and developing fraud crisis in the state and called on him to resign from his post over the scandal while highlighting fraud allegations within the state's college education system.",
      "\"You have been Minnesota\u2019s Governor since 2019,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon wrote to Walz in a letter obtained by Fox News Digital. \"During that time, your careless lack of oversight and abuse of the welfare system has attracted fraudsters from around the world, especially from Somalia, to establish a beachhead of criminality in our country.

According to the letter, scammers operating in Minnesota enriched themselves by exploiting federal housing benefits, education aid, food stamps, small-business relief, and even programs meant to support elderly Americans and children with autism, all while the governor \"did absolutely nothing\" to stop it.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips to stay safe from online scammers and recent warnings on how AI toys can harm children.",
      "Any data breach affecting 1.6 million people is serious. It draws even more attention when it involves a company trusted to guard passwords. That is exactly what happened to LastPass.",
      "The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office has fined LastPass about $1.6 million for security failures tied to its 2022 breach. Regulators say those failures allowed a hacker to access a backup database and put users at risk.",

      "CHECK IF YOUR PASSWORDS WERE STOLEN IN HUGE LEAK",
      "Why the LastPass breach still matters",
      "LastPass is one of the most widely used password managers in the world. It serves more than 20 million individual users and around 100,000 businesses. That popularity also makes it an attractive target for cybercriminals.",
      "The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office fined LastPass for security failures tied to its 2022 breach. (LaylaBird/Getty Images)",
      "In 2022, LastPass confirmed that an unauthorized party accessed parts of its customer information through a third-party cloud storage service. While the incident initially raised alarms, the long-term impact has taken time to fully surface.",
      "The ICO now says the breach affected about 1.6 million U.K. users alone. That scope played a major role in the size of the fine.",
      "What regulators say went wrong",
      "According to the ICO, LastPass failed to put strong enough technical and security controls in place. Those gaps made it possible for attackers to reach a backup database that should have been better protected.",
      "The regulator added that LastPass promises to help people improve security, but failed to meet that expectation. As a result, users were left exposed even if their passwords were not directly cracked.",
      "Were passwords exposed or decrypted?",
      "There is still no evidence that attackers decrypted customer passwords. That point matters.",
      "Despite the breach, security experts continue to recommend password managers for most people. Storing unique, strong passwords in an encrypted vault is still far safer than reusing weak passwords across accounts.",
      "As one expert noted, modern breaches often succeed after identity access rather than password cracking alone. Once attackers get a foothold, the damage can spread quickly.",
      "Although attackers accessed a backup database, there is no evidence that customer passwords were decrypted. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the LastPass fine is a wake-up call for cybersecurity",
      "The ICO called the LastPass fine a turning point. It reinforces the idea that security is about governance, staff training and supplier risk as much as software.",
      "Users have a right to expect that companies handling sensitive data take every reasonable step to protect it.",
      "Breaches may be inevitable, but weak safeguards are not.",
      "LastPass on the UK data breach",
      "We reached out to LastPass for comment on the UK fine, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"We have been cooperating with the UK ICO since we first reported this incident to them back in 2022. While we are disappointed with the outcome, we are pleased to see that the ICO\u2019s decision has recognized many of the efforts we have already taken to further strengthen our platform and enhance our data security measures. Our focus remains on delivering the best possible service to the 100,000 businesses and millions of individual consumers who continue to rely on LastPass.\"",

    "story": [
      "John Hankins, co-owner and co-investor of PitchCom, tells Fox News Digital that the idea for the communication device came from the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal.",
      "Baseball teams have long searched for a way to study the entire swing without sensors or complex lab setups. Today, a new solution is entering the picture. Theia, an AI biomechanics company, debuted a commercially available video-only system that analyzes bat trajectory and full-body biomechanics together. This new approach works in real baseball environments and needs no reflective body markers, wearables or special equipment.",
      "The system has been field-tested by Driveline Baseball and the San Diego Padres Biomechanics Lab, and the tests show it delivers high-quality results in both cages and on the field.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "MLB VOTES TO ALLOW ROBOT UMPS FOR CHALLENGES DURING 2026 SEASON",
      "Theia unveils a video-only biomechanics system that tracks a hitter\u2019s full swing without sensors or lab gear. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)",
      "A new chapter in baseball biomechanics",
      "Theia's platform relies on deep-learning models trained on millions of movement data points. It captures the full 3D bat path, attack angle, sequencing and body motion in one workflow that teams can run with standard high-speed video. This makes advanced biomechanics more accessible to coaches and players who train in normal environments.",
      "Dr. Arnel Aguinaldo of the PLNU Biomechanics Lab tested the system with the Padres. He said, \"Theia's markerless technology represents a breakthrough in how we capture and analyze swing mechanics. It removes the barriers of traditional setups, letting us gather quality swing data directly from the field or the cage. That's a game changer for both research and applied development.\"",
      "Independent testing across more than 2,000 swings showed median bat-plane angle differences of less than 3 degrees compared with marker-based systems. As a result, teams can evaluate roster-sized groups in routine cage or field sessions without slowing players down.",
      "Why video-only tracking works in real baseball settings",
      "Many existing tools rely on sensors or suits that can change how an athlete moves. Marcus Brown, CEO of Theia, explained to CyberGuy why video-only tracking matters.",
      "\"Using only video means teams get lab-grade biomechanics data that previously required a full lab setup, but without special suits, reflective markers, or hardware mounted to the bat or the player,\" he said.",
      "The system runs in the background once cameras are placed and calibrated. Coaches record sessions as usual, and the analysis processes automatically. Because of this, training routines stay the same, and players move naturally.",
      "Brown added,\u00a0\"Until now, full swing analysis meant choosing between bat-only tools or biomechanics labs that couldn't scale. Our new markerless technology changes that. Teams can now see the complete swing picture for every hitter using one system in an environment that matches their individual needs.\"",
      "How AI bat and body tracking improves player performance",
      "A complete swing view gives coaches the chance to link body motion to bat results. Brown described why this matters for player development.",
      "\"Theia's new bat tracking feature helps players improve because it gives coaches a complete and more accurate picture of the swing. Many tools today either measure the bat or the body, and many rely on wearables or sensors that can influence how an athlete moves,\" Brown said. \"When coaches can connect a player's sequencing, posture, timing, and rotation to the bat's path, speed, and contact quality, they can identify the specific movement patterns that drive results. That makes mechanical adjustments more targeted and much easier to track over time, leading to more consistent and meaningful improvements.\"",

      "Driveline Baseball and the Padres Biomechanics Lab report strong accuracy from Theia\u2019s markerless tracking tests. (Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",
      "What players experience when teams use Theia's system",
      "Players will not need to attach anything to the bat or their bodies. They swing in their regular training spaces without changing behavior. Brown said, \"For athletes, the biggest change is the level of precise personalized feedback they get. Coaches can isolate whether an issue is coming from sequencing, posture, timing, or how the hitter is delivering the barrel to the ball. That level of detail helps translate mechanical work in the cage into more consistent, reliable results in the field.\"",
      "Independent testing shows consistent bat and body data",
      "Driveline Baseball and the PLNU x Padres Biomechanics Lab tested the system in both professional and collegiate settings. Brown said,\u00a0\"Our work with Driveline and the PLNUxPadres' Biomechanics Lab showed the system could deliver high-quality bat-and-body data in the same environments where hitters actually train. What those tests demonstrated was consistency: the ability to capture the full swing automatically, link the bat and body with the precision needed for player development, and fit seamlessly into a normal training session.\"",
      "Why Theia's system fits seamlessly into normal cage sessions",
      "Sports tech can create workflow friction, but Theia aims to avoid that. Brown said, \"We designed the system so coaches can use it without changing anything about their normal training routine. Once the cameras are in place, coaches simply record the session the same way they normally would, and the analysis happens automatically in the background.\"",
      "There are no extra steps, no equipment put on the players, and no training interruptions.",

      "The road ahead for AI sports performance",
      "Brown believes this breakthrough sets the stage for future innovation.",
      "\"Player development is ultimately about understanding what drives performance, and this technology gives coaches a far clearer way to see that,\" he said. \"When you can connect a player's movement to the result of the swing with objective repeatable data, you can build training plans that are far more individualized and precise.\"",
      "He also added:\u00a0\"This work builds on more than a decade of research and over 50 peer-reviewed validation studies focused on highly accurate markerless human motion tracking.

      "Smart home hacking headlines can look scary, but most threats come from weak passwords rather than targeted attacks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why criminals are not circling your house with hacking gear",
      "Many people imagine cybercriminals driving around neighborhoods with scanners that look for vulnerable devices. In reality, Wi-Fi ranges and technical limits make that nearly impossible. Even high-profile hacks of casinos and large companies do not translate to criminals trying to breach residential smart locks for petty theft.",

      "So how do smart homes get hacked? Here are the real attack paths and how they work.",
      "Common ways smart homes get attacked",
      "Smart homes face a handful of digital threats, but most come from broad automated attacks rather than someone targeting your house.",
      "Bots constantly scan the internet for weak passwords and outdated logins. These brute force attacks throw billions of guesses at connected accounts. When one works, the device becomes part of a botnet used for future attacks. That doesn't mean someone is targeting your home on purpose. Bots search for anything they can breach. A strong password stops them.",
      "Some phishing emails impersonate smart home brands. Clicking a fake link or sharing login details can open the door for criminals to reach your network. Even a general phishing attack can expose your Wi-Fi info and lead to broader access.",
      "Hackers often go after company servers, not individual homes. These breaches may expose account details or stored camera footage kept in the cloud.

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Managing diabetes already brings stress from medications and long-term health risks. Regular glucose checks only add to the weight. Most people test with finger pricks or wear a patch that needs a sensor under the skin. If you dislike needles, this part can feel like the hardest task of the day.",
      "Researchers at MIT are working on a new option. They developed a device that shines near-infrared light on your skin and reads your blood sugar without breaking the surface. It works through Raman spectroscopy, a method that looks at how light scatters when it hits molecules in your tissue.",

      "MIT\u2019s light-based scanner reads blood sugar through the skin without a single prick. (iStock)",
      "CANCER CURES COULD BE IN REACH WITH CUTTING-EDGE MEDICAL TECH, DOCTOR PREDICTS",
      "How the light-based scanner works",
      "The current setup is about the size of a shoebox. You rest your arm on top for a 30-second scan. A small beam shines through a glass window onto your skin. The light returns with tiny shifts in wavelength that reveal what molecules are present.",
      "Earlier Raman systems pulled in about 1,000 spectral bands with plenty of noise. The MIT team discovered that they only need three bands to calculate glucose levels. With fewer signals to process, the device becomes smaller, faster and more affordable. This boost also improves speed since the system no longer sorts through redundant data.",
      "In a four-hour study, a volunteer drank two glucose drinks while researchers took readings every five minutes. The new scanner matched the accuracy of two commercial glucometers the participant wore. That result surprised the team since the device is still in early development.",
      "Progress toward a wearable",
      "After perfecting the shoebox version, MIT engineers built a prototype the size of a cellphone. That unit is now in clinical testing with healthy and prediabetic volunteers. A larger trial with people who have diabetes is expected next year.",
      "The long-term goal is even more exciting. Researchers believe they can shrink the hardware to a watch size. They also want to confirm that the system reads accurately across many skin tones. If these steps succeed, a wrist-based glucose monitor could be possible.",
      "A quick 30-second scan can match the accuracy of today\u2019s commercial glucose monitors. (iStock)",
      "How this compares to other needle-free attempts",
      "This light-based method joins other ideas that try to move past needles. A recent chest strap used ECG signals to predict glucose levels. It looked promising, but it still needs time before it reaches consumers. Interest in noninvasive monitoring keeps growing since so many people want relief from the pain of repeated skin punctures or adhesive patches.",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT PERFORMS MEDICAL PROCEDURES VIA REMOTE CONTROL",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you or someone you love manages diabetes, fewer needle sticks could change your routine. A quick scan may replace the stress of drawing blood or inserting a sensor. The accuracy seen in early testing shows that noninvasive tools are not a distant dream. They could help you catch swings in your levels faster and bring more comfort to a daily task that often feels overwhelming.",

      "Cybercriminals keep getting better at blending into the software you use every day.",
      "Over the past few years, we've seen phishing pages that copy banking portals, fake browser alerts that claim your device is infected and \"human verification\" screens that push you to run commands you should never touch. The latest twist comes from the ongoing ClickFix campaign.",
      "Instead of asking you to prove you are human, attackers now disguise themselves as a Windows update. It looks convincing enough that you might follow the instructions without thinking, which is exactly what they want.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "The malware hides inside seemingly normal image files, using steganography to slip past traditional security tools.\u00a0 (Microsoft)",
      "How the fake update works",
      "Researchers noticed that ClickFix has upgraded its old trick. The campaign used to rely on human verification pages, but now you get a full-screen Windows update screen that looks almost identical to the real thing. Joe Security showed how the page displays fake progress bars, familiar update messages and a prompt that tells you to complete a critical security update.",
      "If you are on Windows, the site tells you to open the Run box, copy something from your clipboard and paste it in. That \"something\" is a command that silently downloads a malware dropper. The final payload is usually an infostealer, which steals passwords, cookies and other data from your machine.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "Fake update screens are getting harder to spot as attackers mimic Windows with near-perfect precision. (Joe Security)",
      "The moment you paste the command, the infection chain begins. First, a file called mshta.exe reaches out to a remote server and grabs a script. To avoid detection, these URLs often use hex encoding for parts of the address and rotate their paths. The script then runs obfuscated PowerShell code filled with junk instructions to throw researchers off. Once PowerShell does its work, it decrypts a hidden .NET assembly that functions as the loader.",
      "Why is this attack so hard to detect?",
      "The loader hides its next stage inside what looks like a regular PNG file. ClickFix uses custom steganography, which is a technique that hides secret data inside normal-looking content. In this case, the malware sits inside the image's pixel data. The attackers tweak color values in certain pixels, especially in the red channel, to embed pieces of shellcode. When you view the image, everything appears normal.",
      "The script knows exactly where the hidden data sits. It extracts the pixel values, decrypts them and rebuilds the malware directly in memory. That means nothing obvious is written to disk. Security tools that rely on file scanning miss it, since the shellcode never appears as a standalone file.",
      "Once rebuilt, the shellcode is injected into a trusted Windows process like explorer.exe. The attack uses familiar in-memory techniques such as VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread. Recent ClickFix activity has delivered infostealers like LummaC2 and updated versions of Rhadamanthys. These tools are built to harvest credentials and send them back to the attacker with very little noise.",
      "Once the hidden code loads into a trusted Windows process, infostealers quietly begin harvesting your data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to protect yourself from the ClickFix campaign",
      "The best way to stay protected is to slow down for a moment and follow a few steps that cut off these attacks before they start.",
      "If any site tells you to paste a command into Run, PowerShell or Terminal, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Real operating system updates never require you to run commands from a webpage. When you run that command, you hand full control to the attacker. If something feels off, close the page and don't interact further.",
      "Updates should only come from the Windows Settings app or through official system notifications. A browser tab or pop-up pretending to be a Windows update is always fake. If you see anything outside the normal update flow asking for your action, ignore it and check the real Windows Update page yourself.",
      "Choose a security suite that can detect both file-based and in-memory threats. Stealthy attacks like ClickFix avoid leaving obvious files for scanners to pick up. Tools with behavioral detection, sandboxing and script monitoring give you a much better chance of spotting unusual activity early.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Password managers create strong, unique passwords for every account you use. They also autofill only on legitimate websites, which helps you catch fake login pages. If a manager refuses to fill out your credentials, take a second look at the URL before entering anything manually.",

      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many attacks start by targeting emails and personal details already exposed online. Data removal services help shrink your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from data broker sites that collect and sell your information. They can't erase everything, but reducing your exposure means fewer attackers have easy access to your details.",

      "Fake update pages often run in full-screen mode to hide the browser interface and make the page look like part of your computer. If a site suddenly goes full screen without your permission, exit with Esc or Alt+Tab. Once you're out, scan your system and don't return to that page.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "ClickFix works because it leans on user interaction. Nothing happens unless you follow the instructions on the screen. That makes the fake Windows update page especially dangerous, because it taps into something most people trust. If you are used to Windows updates freezing your screen, you may not question a prompt that appears during the process. Cybercriminals know this. They copy trusted interfaces to lower your guard and then rely on you to run the final command. The technical tricks that follow are complex, but the starting point is simple. They need you to help them.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/third-party-breach-exposes-chatgpt-account-details",
    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 12:00:38 -0500",
    "summary": "ChatGPT data breach exposes personal info of users through partner Mixpanel. OpenAI confirms names, emails compromised in security incident.",
    "story": [
      "'Outnumbered' panelists react to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's admission that he 'cannot imagine' raising his newborn son without help from ChatGPT.",
      "ChatGPT went from novelty to necessity in less than two years. It is now part of how you work, learn, write, code and search. OpenAI has said the service has roughly 800 million weekly active users, which puts it in the same weight class as the biggest consumer platforms in the world.",
      "When a tool becomes that central to your daily life, you assume the people running it can keep your data safe. That trust took a hit recently after OpenAI confirmed that personal information linked to API accounts had been exposed in a breach involving one of its third-party partners.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "The breach highlights how even trusted analytics partners can expose sensitive account details. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the ChatGPT breach",
      "OpenAI's notification email places the breach squarely on Mixpanel, a major analytics provider the company used on its API platform. The email stresses that OpenAI's own systems were not breached. No chat histories, billing information, passwords or API keys were exposed. Instead, the stolen data came from Mixpanel's environment and included names, email addresses, Organization IDs, coarse location and technical metadata from user browsers.",
      "FAKE CHATGPT APPS ARE HIJACKING YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING",
      "That sounds harmless on the surface. The email calls this \"limited\" analytics data, but the label feels like PR cushioning more than anything else. For attackers, this kind of metadata is gold. A dataset that reveals who you are, where you work, what machine you use and how your account is structured gives threat actors everything they need to run targeted phishing and impersonation campaigns.",
      "The biggest red flag is the exposure of Organization IDs. Anyone who builds on the OpenAI API knows how sensitive these identifiers are. They sit at the center of internal billing, usage limits, account hierarchy and support workflows. If an attacker quotes your Org ID during a fake billing alert or support request, it suddenly becomes very hard to dismiss the message as a scam.",
      "OpenAI's own reconstructed timeline raises bigger questions. Mixpanel first detected a smishing attack on November 8. Attackers accessed internal systems the next day and exported OpenAI's data. That data was gone for more than two weeks before Mixpanel told OpenAI on November 25. Only then did OpenAI alert everyone. It is a long and worrying silent period, and it left API users exposed to targeted attacks without even knowing they were at risk. OpenAI says it cut Mixpanel off the next day.",
      "The size of the risk and the policy problem behind it",
      "The timing and the scale matter here. ChatGPT sits at the center of the generative AI boom. It does not just have consumer traffic. It has sensitive conversations from developers, employees, startups and enterprises. Even though the breach affected API accounts rather than consumer chat history, the exposure still highlights a wider issue. When a platform reaches almost a billion weekly users, any crack becomes a national-scale problem.",
      "Regulators have been warning about this exact scenario. Vendor security is one of the weak links in modern tech policy. Data protection laws tend to focus on what a company does with the information you give them. They rarely provide strong guardrails around the entire chain of third-party services that process this data along the way. Mixpanel is not an obscure operator. It is a widely used analytics platform trusted by thousands of companies. Yet it still lost a dataset that should never have been accessible to an attacker.",
      "Companies should treat analytics providers the same way they treat core infrastructure. If you cannot guarantee that your vendors follow the same security standards you do, you should not be collecting the data in the first place. For a platform as influential as ChatGPT, the responsibility is even higher. People do not fully understand how many invisible services sit behind a single AI query. They trust the brand they interact with, not the long list of partners behind it.",
      "Attackers can use leaked metadata to craft convincing phishing emails that look legitimate. (Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safer when using AI tools",
      "If you rely on AI tools every day, it's worth tightening your personal security before your data ends up floating around in someone else's analytics dashboard. You cannot control how every vendor handles your information, but you can make it much harder for attackers to target you.",
      "Treat every AI account as if it holds something valuable because it does. Long, unique passwords stored in a reliable password manager reduce the fallout if one platform gets breached. This also protects you from credential stuffing, where attackers try the same password across multiple services.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "AI platforms have become prime targets, so they rely on stronger 2FA. Use an authenticator app or a hardware security key. SMS codes can be intercepted or redirected, which makes them unreliable during large-scale phishing campaigns.",
      "Another important step you can take to protect yourself from phishing attacks is to install strong antivirus software on your devices. This can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping you keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "PARENTS BLAME CHATGPT FOR SON\u2019S SUICIDE, LAWSUIT ALLEGES OPENAI WEAKENED SAFEGUARDS TWICE BEFORE TEEN\u2019S DEATH",
      "Think twice before pasting private conversations, company documents, medical notes or addresses into a chat window. Many AI tools store recent history for model improvements unless you opt out, and some route data through external vendors. Anything you paste could live on longer than you expect.",
      "Attackers often combine leaked metadata with information they pull from people-search sites and old listings. A good data-removal service scans the web for exposed personal details and submits removal requests on your behalf. Some services even let you send custom links for takedowns. Cleaning up these traces makes targeted phishing and impersonation attacks much harder to pull off.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Attackers know users panic when they hear about API limits, billing failures or account verification issues. If you get an email claiming to be from an AI provider, do not click the link. Open the site manually or use the official app to confirm whether the alert is real.",
      "Events like this show why strengthening your personal security habits matters more than ever. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A lot of attacks succeed because devices run outdated operating systems or browsers. Regular updates close vulnerabilities that could be used to steal session tokens, capture keystrokes or hijack login flows. Updates are boring, but they prevent a surprising amount of trouble.",
      "Old accounts sit around with old passwords and old data, and they become easy targets. If you're not actively using a particular AI tool anymore, delete it from your account list and remove any saved information. It reduces your exposure and limits how many databases contain your details.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This breach may not have touched chat logs or payment details, but it shows how fragile the wider AI ecosystem can be. Your data is only as safe as the least secure partner in the chain. With ChatGPT now approaching a billion weekly users, that chain needs tighter rules, better oversight and fewer blind spots. If anything, this should be a reminder that the rush toward AI adoption needs stronger policy guardrails. Companies cannot hide behind transparent emails after the fact. They need to prove that the tools you rely on every day are secure at every layer, including the ones you never see.",

      "A long-running malware campaign quietly evolved over several years and turned trusted Chrome and Edge extensions into spyware. A detailed report from Koi Security reveals that the ShadyPanda operation affected 4.3 million users who downloaded extensions later updated with hidden malicious code.",

      "Malicious extensions spread through trusted browsers and quietly collected user data for years. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the ShadyPanda campaign unfolded",
      "The operation included 20 malicious Chrome extensions and 125 on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store. Many first appeared in 2018 with no obvious warning signs. Five years later, the extensions began receiving staged updates that changed their behavior.",
      "Koi Security found that these updates rolled out through each browser's trusted auto-update system. Users did not need to click anything. No phishing. No fake alerts. Just quiet version bumps that slowly turned safe extensions into powerful tracking tools.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "WeTab functions as a sophisticated surveillance platform disguised as a productivity tool. (Koi)",
      "What the extensions were doing behind the scenes",
      "Once activated, the extensions injected tracking code into real links to earn revenue from user purchases. They also hijacked searches, redirected queries and logged data for sale and manipulation. ShadyPanda gathered an unusually broad range of personal information, including browsing history, search terms, cookies, keystrokes, fingerprint data, local storage, and even mouse movement coordinates. As the extensions gained credibility in the stores, the attackers pushed a backdoor update that allowed hourly remote code execution. That gave them full browser control, letting them monitor websites visited and exfiltrate persistent identifiers.",
      "Researchers also discovered that the extensions could launch adversary-in-the-middle attacks. This allowed credential theft, session hijacking and code injection on any website. If users opened developer tools, the extensions switched into harmless mode to avoid detection. Google removed the malicious extensions from the Chrome Web Store. We reached out to the company, and a spokesperson confirmed that none of the extensions listed are currently live on the platform.",
      "Meanwhile, a Microsoft spokesperson told CyberGuy, \"We have removed all the extensions identified as malicious on the Edge Add-on store. When we become aware of instances that violate our policies, we take appropriate action that includes, but is not limited to, the removal of prohibited content or termination of our publishing agreement.\"",

      "FIRST ON FOX: Senior Israeli intelligence officials say warnings delivered to Australia ahead of a deadly attack at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach were part of a much broader alert: an accelerating global rise in attempts to execute terror attacks across Western countries, increasingly aimed not only at Jewish targets, but also at Christians and large gatherings especially during religious holidays.",

      "Israeli intelligence officials say Australia is not an outlier. From their perspective, recent months have revealed a pattern of attempted and disrupted plots across Europe, North America and beyond, pointing to a sustained global threat rather than sporadic violence.",
      "\"If you knew how many terror attacks we exposed and prevented,\" the senior official said, \"your jaw would drop.\"",
      "Israeli intelligence officials say the rise in attempted attacks is driven in part by how extremist and state-linked networks build terror infrastructure globally while deliberately masking their origins.",
      "Officials say the networks frequently rely on non-Iranian nationals to carry out different roles along the operational chain, including logistics, intelligence gathering, financing and execution, in order to blur any connection to Tehran. In some cases, operatives are recruited from migrant or refugee backgrounds, while in others criminal elements or hired proxies are used to carry out acts of violence.",

      "To avoid detection, officials say the networks rely on encrypted communications and clandestine in-person meetings, sometimes conducted outside the country where an attack is planned. In other cases, instructions are delivered remotely through secure channels that bypass standard telecommunications monitoring.",
      "According to Israeli assessments, extremist networks are increasingly overlapping: jihadist ideology, lone-actor violence and state-linked activity now exist in the same ecosystem, fueled by online radicalization and geopolitical instability. Many plots, officials say, are unsophisticated, making them harder to detect early while still capable of causing mass casualties.",

      "A senior foreign diplomatic source said the current environment is being shaped by what they described as a global contagion effect, in which attacks are amplified online, celebrated across extremist networks and rapidly imitated elsewhere.",

      "The source cautioned that Christian communities and broader civilian gatherings are also vulnerable, particularly during religious holidays and symbolic events that attract large crowds.",
      "This concern has been reflected across Europe in recent weeks, when authorities sharply increased security at Christmas markets and holiday celebrations amid warnings that seasonal events present prime targets for extremist violence.

      "Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson reports on the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker off Venezuela\u2019s coast and the congressional fight over Obamacare subsidies on \u2018Fox News Sunday.\u2019",
      "Chile delivered its sharpest political shift in decades as Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, a hard-right former lawmaker who campaigned on restoring public order and tightening the country\u2019s borders, won the presidency in a decisive vote Sunday.",
      "Kast, who captured 58% of the vote, enters office with a platform centered almost entirely on security and immigration, promising what he describes as the most aggressive public-order campaign in a generation.",
      "The 59-year-old father of nine was born to a German immigrant family in Santiago. He spent years in Chile\u2019s congress and previously ran for president in 2017 and 2021 before breaking through in 2025. His long political trajectory and established conservative identity made him a familiar figure to voters even as he framed this campaign as a mandate for sweeping security reform.",
      "MADURO TRAPPED WITH FEW RETALIATION OPTIONS AFTER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SEIZES VENEZUELAN OIL TANKER",
      "In a message that echoes that of U.S. President Donald Trump, Kast has pledged mass deportations of undocumented migrants, expanded policing and the deployment of the military to confront drug trafficking and organized crime. He argues that rising homicides and cartel activity demand extraordinary measures, including deadlines for irregular migrants to leave the country before facing enforced removal.",
      "His victory reflects a broader regional trend in which voters are turning to candidates who promise crime control rather than ideological transformation.",
      "Chile elected rightwing leader Jos\u00e9 Kast as president.\u00a0 (Juan Gonzalez/Reuters)",
      "Kast defeated left-wing candidate Jeannette Jara, a former labor minister who campaigned on expanding social programs, strengthening workers\u2019 rights and raising taxes on high earners to pay for new public benefits. Jara also backed a more lenient immigration policy and emphasized protections for women and LGBTQ Chileans \u2014 a clear contrast to Kast\u2019s security-first agenda.",
      "\"Here, no individual won, no party won \u2014 Chile won, and hope won,\" Kast said in a victory speech. \"The hope of living without fear. That fear that torments families.\"",
      "He added: \"When we tell an irregular migrant that they are breaking the law and must leave our country if they ever want the chance to return, we mean it \u2026 We must show great firmness against crime, organised crime, impunity and disorder.\"",
      "Kast had predicted his own victory on Chilean radio after Trump won the U.S. election in 2024.",
      "\"We are going to win, too,\" he said at the time.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio was quick to praise Kast's win.",
      "\"Under his leadership, we are confident Chile will advance shared priorities to include strengthening public security, ending illegal immigration and revitalizing our commercial relationship,\" he said.",
      "Chile, long considered one of Latin America\u2019s safest countries, has seen a sharp rise in violent crime in the past several years, driven in part by the spread of transnational criminal groups and a surge in drug trafficking. Homicide rates have climbed to their highest levels in decades, and police say organizations such as Venezuela\u2019s Tren de Aragua have expanded extortion, kidnapping and narcotics operations inside the country.",
      "The spike in violence has unsettled a population accustomed to relative stability and has turned public security into Chile\u2019s top political issue.",
      "Although he has long held staunchly conservative positions on abortion, gender policy and same-sex marriage, Kast downplayed those issues during the campaign as he sought to broaden his appeal. Instead, he emphasized structural changes he says are necessary to confront the security crisis, including shrinking parts of the bureaucracy, tightening Chile\u2019s asylum system and giving the presidency greater authority to respond to organized crime.",
      "BOLIVIA PIVOTS TO US AS IT BREAKS FROM CHINA, MADURO AND YEARS OF LEFTIST RULE",
      "Kast also intends to steer Chile toward a more market-oriented economic model, with tax cuts, deregulation and expanded mining development \u2014 particularly in lithium and copper, two of the country\u2019s most important exports. He has signaled interest in strengthening ties with the United States and other Western partners, even as China remains Chile\u2019s largest trading partner and a major buyer of its mineral output.",

      "Chile\u2019s rightward turn follows a similar shift in neighboring Argentina, which elected libertarian firebrand Javier Milei on a platform of radical economic reform and political disruption.",
      "But the two leaders represent distinct strains of the right: Milei is an anti-establishment libertarian who thrives on theatrical confrontation and sweeping proposals to remake Argentina\u2019s economy, while Kast is a more traditional conservative focused on order, border enforcement and institutional authority. Their wins stem from similar voter frustrations, but they offer sharply different governing styles.",

      "Kast is also one of South America\u2019s most outspoken critics of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, frequently citing Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse and mass migration as warnings for Chile. He has accused Maduro of allowing criminal networks to flourish and has linked Venezuela\u2019s crisis directly to Chile\u2019s migration and security challenges.",
      "His party\u2019s lack of a congressional majority could slow or dilute parts of his agenda, but Kast\u2019s decisive margin suggests Chilean voters are prepared to test his hard-edged security strategy after years of political gridlock and rising public anxiety."

      "Trump first went to social media to blame Reiner, a progressive activist and prominent supporter of the Democratic Party, for his own slaying. Then hours later, Trump told a reporter that Reiner was \"a deranged person\u201d who \u201cwas very bad for our country.\"",
      "\"When people say horrible things about Rob right now, I find it, quite frankly, infuriating and distasteful,\" an emotional Woods, 78, told Fox personality Jesse Watters.",
      "\"Did I agree with his politics? I did not. Did I love him as a friend, as an artist, as an icon of Hollywood and as a patriot? I most certainly did. And I am just absolutely devastated by this terrible event, especially for his family.\"",
      "Woods was nominated for best supporting actor in the 1996 movie \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" directed by Reiner and also starring Alec Baldwin and Whoopi Goldberg.",
      "\"I knew Rob Reiner because at a very, very down point in my career, Rob literally saved my career and really put me back on track in a way that was so important and rewarding in my life,\" Woods said. \"He really fought for me when the studio didn't want me in a movie.\"",
      "Woods played notorious KKK member Byron De La Beckwith, who murdered civil rights leader Medger Evers in 1963 but wasn't convicted of that crime until 1994.",

      "Woods was 49 when \"Ghosts\" hit movie theaters in 1996.  Beckwith was 42 when he murdered Evers and 73 when a jury finally convicted him.",
      "\"I was 32 years too young for the part, but he really believed that I was right and could do it,\" Woods said of Reiner. \"It was something that virtually nobody agreed with except one of his partners, Martin Shafer, who was the head of (Reiner's production company) Castle Rock,\" he added.",
      "\"We did 'Ghosts of Mississippi' together, and I went from really being basically out of a job to getting an Academy Award nomination.\"",
      "Woods said he never hesitated to stick up for Reiner among conservatives.",
      "\"But when people would say to me, 'What do you think of his politics?' I would say, 'I think Rob Reiner is a great patriot,'\" Woods said. \"Do I agree with some of or many of his ideas on how that patriotism should be enacted to celebrate the America that we both love? No. But he doesn't agree with me, either, but he also respects my patriotism.\"",
      "Woods added: \"We had a different path to the same destination, which was a country we both loved. And when people would say terrible things to me on social media about him, I said, 'You got it all wrong.'\"",

      "Nick Reiner, the Reiners' younger son, was arrested and booked on suspicion of murder in the deaths of his parents.",
      "Woods is not the only prominent conservative to denounce disparaging remarks about the Reiners in the wake of their slayings. Several Republican lawmakers specifically slammed Trump's attacks.",
      "Conservative firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., commented on X: \"Rob Reiner and his wife were tragically killed at the hands of their own son, who reportedly had drug addiction and other issues, and their remaining children are left in serious mourning and heartbreak.\"",
      "\"This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,\" Greene wrote above Trump's comments. \"Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It\u2019s incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.\"",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., wrote on X: \u201cThis statement is wrong. Regardless of one\u2019s political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son.

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s official: House Speaker Mike Johnson says he won\u2019t call a vote to extend enhanced subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, effectively guaranteeing they will expire at the end of this month.",
      "That means higher insurance premiums will go into effect for millions of Americans who get coverage through Obamacare next year.",
      "The speaker made the announcement Tuesday after a closed-door Republican caucus meeting, saying that leadership failed to reach a deal with centrist members to bring up an ACA amendment on a health care bill set for a vote on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s about a dozen members in the conference that are in these swing districts who are fighting hard to make sure they reduce costs for all of their constituents. And many of them did want to vote on this Obamacare Covid-era subsidy that Democrats created,\u201d Johnson, R-La., told reporters. \u201cWe looked for a way to try to allow for that pressure release valve, and it just was not to be. We worked on it all the way through the weekend, in fact. And in the end there was not an agreement \u2014 it wasn\u2019t made.\u201d",
      "As Johnson\u2019s office rolled out the bill Friday, GOP leadership aides said they were working with lawmakers on a path forward for a vote on an amendment to keep the ACA funds flowing.",
      "\u201cI certainly appreciate the views and the opinions of every member of this conference,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut I will tell you: One thing they will all join in unity on is voting for this bill that we\u2019ve been discussing this morning.\u201d",
      "The centrist Republicans who have been pushing for an ACA funding extension include Reps. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Mike Lawler of New York \u2014 all of whom represent competitive districts that could make or break the Republican majority in the 2026 midterms.",
      "\u201cI am pissed for the American people. This is absolute bulls---, and it\u2019s absurd,\u201d Lawler said Tuesday. \u201cEverybody has a responsibility to serve their district, to serve their constituents. You know what\u2019s funny? Three-quarters of people on Obamacare are in states Donald Trump won. So maybe, just maybe, everybody should look at this and say, \u2018How do we actually fix the health care system?\u2019\u201d",
      "He faulted the leaders of both parties on the issue.",
      "\u201cYou have two leaders that are not serious about solving this problem,\u201d Lawler said, adding that it would be \u201cidiotic\u201d to not hold a vote on the expiring subsidies.",
      "Asked about Lawler\u2019s criticism, Johnson called him \u201ca very dear friend and a close colleague of mine.\u201d",
      "But, he said, other Republicans come from different districts with \u201cdifferent priorities and ideas.\u201d Many Republicans want the funds to expire on schedule.",
      "Another reason the talks broke down is that leaders told the centrist Republicans that they would need to find spending cuts to pay for an ACA funding extension, which is projected to cost about $35 billion per year. That\u2019s a tall order, and one that went over poorly among those GOP members, particularly as party leaders are regularly willing to waive \u201cpay-for\u201d rules on policies they favor.",
      "Some Republicans who want to extend the subsidies have not ruled out signing onto a \u201cdischarge petition\u201d by Democrats to end-run Johnson and force a vote on a clean three-year extension of ACA subsidies.",
      "\u201cAll options are on the table,\u201d Lawler said.",
      "Asked if he\u2019s open to signing the Democrats\u2019 discharge petition, Fitzpatrick said, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that after today.\u201d",
      "The GOP divisions are likely to empower House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who is insisting on a clean three-year extension with the support of all Democrats. Some Democrats have backed a shorter-term extension with some reforms to win GOP votes, but Jeffries is holding firm.",
      "\u201cThere are 214 Democrats who have signed a discharge petition that would force an up-or-down vote on extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits \u2014 to make sure that tens of millions of Americans don\u2019t experience increased health insurance premiums that will prevent them from being able to go see a doctor when they need one,\u201d Jeffries said Monday. \u201cAll we need are four House Republicans to join us.\u201d",
      "Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., who represents a solidly red district, said members like Lawler should remember that other Republicans also have bills they won\u2019t put to a vote.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have everything every time,\u201d Burchett said. \u201cEven though he\u2019s in a district that Kamala Harris won, we can\u2019t just give all the committees and all the bills to the more liberal members of the party.\u201d",
      "Even if a discharge petition secured the votes to pass, which is far from certain, it would take time to reach the House floor. That effectively guarantees it\u2019ll be pushed into next year, with Republicans hoping to adjourn after this week.",
      "Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., who was just re-elected to serve as House Freedom Caucus chairman for another year, said he isn\u2019t worried about his colleagues signing a discharge petition or even passing a bill to extend ACA funds through the House.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s their right as a member to sign a discharge petition. I\u2019m not afraid of a vote on a discharge petition. These will pass in the House, and then they\u2019ll be killed over in the Senate,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe Senate\u2019s already taken a position on extending the Affordable Care Act to enhance subsidies, and they rejected it.\u201d",
      "Harris added that \u201cit\u2019s possible that we put a package together in January or February\u201d dealing with health care, but he said it must be broader than just addressing ACA enrollees in order to secure his vote.",
      "Asked if he\u2019s worried that moderate Republicans may sign onto Democrats\u2019 discharge petition, Johnson told NBC News, \u201cI don\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "In the summer of 2024, Dr. Bruce Levy, the former chief medical examiner of Tennessee, got a call asking whether he remembered the death of a baby boy, Alex Maze.",
      "The name, from nearly 25 years earlier, faintly stirred Levy\u2019s memory. Levy had conducted an autopsy on the 19-month-old boy, and he had concluded that Alex\u2019s death was a homicide, the result of being violently shaken.",
      "Levy\u2019s testimony was critical in helping Nashville prosecutors secure a murder conviction against Alex\u2019s father, Russell Maze, who was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "For more on this story, watch \u201cHallie Jackson NOW\u201d on NBC News Now today at 5 p.m. ET",
      "For decades, Maze has denied abusing his son. He had been home alone with Alex in May 1999 when the baby suddenly stopped breathing. At the hospital, a pediatrician who specialized in identifying child abuse found what she said were clear signs that Alex was the victim of shaken baby syndrome. Levy later agreed.",
      "Now, decades later, Levy was being asked to re-examine Alex\u2019s death amid an initiative in Nashville investigating potential wrongful convictions. Intrigued, Levy said yes.",
      "This month, in his first public comments on the case, Levy told NBC News that after having received information he never knew about Alex\u2019s medical history, he came to a startling conclusion: He was wrong about Alex\u2019s being abused, and he believes Maze is innocent.",
      "\u201cI have to remember that I\u2019m not perfect and I can make mistakes,\u201d Levy said. \u201cAnd the best that I can do, is when I come to realize that, is to admit that I have made a mistake and try to do what I can to rectify that.\u201d",
      "Thousands of caregivers have been arrested based on the long-held medical belief that three symptoms \u2014 brain swelling, bleeding in the brain and bleeding behind the eyes \u2014 indicate that a young child was deliberately shaken.",
      "But in the decades since Maze was convicted, there has been a growing acknowledgment among experts that the symptoms once believed to be proof of shaken baby syndrome, also known as abusive head trauma, can appear in children for other reasons, like complex medical conditions. And with that shift in understanding, a movement has been growing to re-examine \u2014 and potentially reverse \u2014 some shaken baby convictions, particularly when the evidence of abuse now appears questionable.",
      "In October, NBC News\u2019 \u201cThe Last Appeal\u201d podcast investigated the high-profile case of Robert Roberson, a condemned man on Texas\u2019 death row who was convicted of fatally shaking and abusing his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki, in 2002. On Oct. 9, Texas\u2019 highest criminal court halted the latest attempt to execute Roberson, sending his case back to a lower court for another review. \u201cWe are confident that an objective review of the science and medical evidence will show there was no crime,\u201d Gretchen Sween, Roberson\u2019s attorney, said at the time.",
      "Maze is still waiting for a similar breakthrough.",
      "After he reviewed Maze\u2019s case, Levy wrote an affidavit in September 2024 recanting his homicide finding and determining that Alex had succumbed to a \u201cnatural\u201d death. He joined an ongoing effort by the Nashville district attorney\u2019s office, which has been working to free Maze."

    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 23:34:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Instead of recommending the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, the CDC's guidance is now to consult a health care provider about the birth dose.",
    "story": [
      "Instead of recommending the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now officially advises women who test negative for the virus to consult health care providers about whether their babies should get their first doses within 24 hours of birth.",
      "The agency\u2019s vaccine advisory committee \u2014 whose members Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed this year after he fired the previous ones \u2014 voted for the recommendation earlier this month, upending more than three decades of agency guidance. Acting CDC Director Jim O\u2019Neill accepted the change on Tuesday \u2014 the final step for it to become the agency\u2019s policy.",
      "\u201cWe are restoring the balance of informed consent to parents whose newborns face little risk of contracting hepatitis B,\u201d O'Neill said in a statement.",
      "The CDC had recommended the birth dose of the vaccine since 1991. Many public health experts criticized the advisory committee\u2019s decision: After the meeting, a chorus of doctors, political leaders and health officials called on O\u2019Neill to ignore the suggested change and maintain the CDC\u2019s recommendation, to no avail.",
      "The CDC now suggests waiting until at least 2 months of age for babies\u2019 first hepatitis B shots if they do not receive the birth dose. However, it still recommends that babies born to mothers who test positive for hepatitis B or whose infection statuses are unknown get hepatitis B vaccines within the first day of life.",
      "The agency is still reviewing a secondary recommendation from the panel: that parents consult with health care providers about the possibility of testing children for antibodies to hepatitis B before they decide whether to get second doses of the vaccine. The hepatitis B vaccine is typically given to babies as a three-dose series.",
      "The new policy is one of the most notable examples of the way CDC guidance is diverging from widespread medical consensus. The advisory committee's discussion of hepatitis B vaccines was rife with misinformation and cherry-picked data, and it ignored decades of evidence that hepatitis B vaccines are safe and effective when they are given shortly after birth.",
      "Many public health experts say delaying the hepatitis B vaccine until babies are older could lead to a resurgence of infections and possibly more deaths from liver disease or cancer. Pediatric cases of acute hepatitis B plummeted after the CDC began recommending a universal birth dose, falling by 99% from 1990 to 2019. Hepatitis B can be passed from mother to child during delivery, and not all pregnant women get tested for it. There is no cure.",
      "\u201cEnding the recommendation for newborns makes it more likely the number of cases will begin to increase again. This makes America sicker,\u201d Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a liver doctor who has treated patients with hepatitis B, said on X earlier this month. Cassidy is one of many medical professionals who publicly asked O\u2019Neill not to adopt the advisory panel\u2019s recommendations.",
      "Pediatricians are expected to keep recommending that parents vaccinate their newborns for hepatitis B. The Department of Health and Human Services has said the new recommendations will not affect insurance coverage of the shots. The vaccine will also continue to be offered to newborns through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides free shots for uninsured or underinsured kids.",
      "The hepatitis B decision was the latest in a series of CDC policy changes that have not been backed by science, leading some public health experts to suggest that the agency\u2019s guidance should no longer be trusted.",
      "After Kennedy gutted the long-standing membership of the CDC\u2019s vaccine panel \u2014 formally known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2014 in June, he replaced it with a group that has largely expressed skepticism of vaccines.",
      "O\u2019Neill, a former investment executive who does not have a medical background, previously worked at the Department of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush. He became acting CDC director in August after Kennedy abruptly fired the previous director, Susan Monarez. Kennedy said Monarez was fired for being untrustworthy, but Monarez said Kennedy dismissed her for refusing to blindly approve the vaccine advisory panel\u2019s recommendations.",
      "Last month, the CDC altered a webpage that had once unequivocally said vaccines do not cause autism, claiming instead that studies have not ruled out a link. (In fact, decades of research have found no association.)",
      "In October, O\u2019Neill called on vaccine manufacturers to develop separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella, without evidence to support breaking up the combined vaccine. And in September, the CDC updated its guidance to tell pregnant women to consider avoiding acetaminophen \u2014 the active ingredient in Tylenol \u2014 because of a possible connection to autism in children. (The bulk of scientific literature to date has not found a definitive link.)",
      "After decades of leaning on CDC guidance, many states have begun to defer to recommendations from newly formed public health alliances or professional medical societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics. The AAP continues to recommend a first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth, followed by additional doses at 1 to 2 months and 6 to 18 months."

      "Stepping back from the report and taking a look at 2025 so far, job growth appears to have started faltering in April, around when President Donald Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
      "The year started off strong, with job creation in the first four months averaging about 122,000 per month. That's when the problems began to appear.",
      "From May through November, job growth slowed to a pace of about 32,000 a month. Put another way, about a quarter as many positions have been created monthly since May than during the first four months of the year.",
      "But the monthly data itself can obscure overall trends, with numbers that rise and fall from month to month and political spin on all sides.",
      "Overall, since May there have been four months when payrolls increased and three months when they fell.",
      "Those three months of losses are a sharp departure from the recent past. To find the last time there was any month when the country lost more jobs than it gained, you'd have to go back to 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic paralyzed the U.S. economy and cost millions of workers their jobs.",
      "Black unemployment is rising sharply",
      "The unemployment rate among Black workers has risen higher and faster than the overall rate of joblessness in recent months.",
      "In May, Black unemployment fell to a low for the year of 6.0%, a rate that was just 1.8 percentage points above the overall unemployment rate that month.",
      "By November, the unemployment rate among Black workers stood at 8.3%, a full 3.7 points higher than that of the broader U.S. workforce.",
      "The rate of job losses for Black workers is also outpacing the population overall. From May through November, the U.S. unemployment rate rose just 0.4%, but Black unemployment climbed 2.3%.",
      "Job gains are concentrated in just two sectors",
      "In what JPMorgan Chase called a \"concerning development,\" detailed data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that nearly all the private job growth over the past two months was in just two sectors: health care and social services.",
      "In November, home health care aides and nursing home positions led the growth in health care jobs. Among social services positions, individual and family services, a category that includes services for the elderly and disabled people, were the fastest-growing category last month.",
      "Indeed, Sage Economics noted that almost all of the job growth this year came from the health care and social services sectors.",
      "Factory jobs are disappearing",
      "If health and social welfare jobs are the big winners this year among private-sector positions, manufacturing and white-collar services are the losers.",
      "Outside of government employment, which fell further than any other sector, the biggest sector losses this year were an 80,000-job decline in business services jobs and a loss of 63,000 jobs in manufacturing, according to economist Zach Fritz at Sage Economics.",
      "Those manufacturing jobs were eliminated despite the Trump administration's pledge to revitalize domestic manufacturing in the president's second term.",
      "As for the white-collar job cuts, those come amid the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence across workplaces. While it's not immediately clear how many jobs lost are directly tied to AI, a recent estimate from Goldman Sachs said that if AI were adopted across the board, it \"could displace 6-7% of the US workforce.\"",
      "Teen unemployment has surged",
      "The unemployment rate for teens jumped to 16.3% in November after having hit 13.2% in the most recent jobs report in September, before the government shutdown.",
      "That\u2019s the highest teen unemployment level since August 2020, when Covid had millions of worried parents keeping their teenagers home and out of the workforce."

    "summary": "A Santa Cruz teacher went viral for a post that Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian flirted with him about with a public comment. He tells TODAY.com what happened next.",
    "story": [
      "A Santa Cruz teacher has gone viral after his simple request to have someone ask how his day went was answered by none other than Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.",
      "Jacob Myers, who has been teaching for two and a half years after working as an assistant teacher and substitute, started posting videos on Instagram in October about a day in the life of a high school teacher.",
      "He has shared fit checks and funny clips about his frustrating mornings, and also heartfelt videos about supporting his students and feeling stressed.",
      "But one of his recent videos caught the attention of over 100,000 social media users, including Kardashian. Myers shared a clip of him posing in his classroom. Text over the video included some facts about him, like his Italian roots and past life as a collegiate athlete. In the caption, he wrote, \u201cSomewhere out there is the woman who\u2019s gonna ask how my school day was.\u201d",
      "Kardashian decided to be the one to pose the pivotal question, writing \u201cHow was your day??\u201d in the comments. Her reply received over 80,000 likes and Instagram users immediately chimed in, suggesting that the two meet. Even Kardashian\u2019s close friend Malika Haqq encouraged the potential connection. \u201cIsn\u2019t she the sweetest,\u201d she asked the high school teacher and coach, playing wing woman for her bestie.",
      "Myers left a flirtatious reply: \u201cMine is great now. How was yours?\u201d Then he uploaded a follow-up video, also filmed in his classroom, giving Kardashian a longer response. He shared that he was interested in meeting up in person and pitched being her plus-one to a Kardashian Christmas party.",
      "He tagged Kardashian, Haqq and momager Kris Jenner in the post. \u201cThis is your sign to help a teacher out and tag @khloekardashian. Shooters gotta shoot,\u201d he playfully wrote in the caption.",
      "Myers tells TODAY.com that he decided to post the initial video on a whim when he was preparing for final exams and feeling swamped. He couldn\u2019t have imagined the amount of replies he received.",
      "\u201c(I) honestly never expected the attention. It\u2019s been very overwhelming and exciting at the same time, because I just post the videos for the fun of them,\u201d he shares. \u201cMy students are kind of my main priority. I\u2019m a teacher first and foremost.\u201d",
      "His students were the ones who encouraged him to start using his social media to post about his job.",
      "\u201cThey were like, \u2018Why don\u2019t you make Tiktok videos?\u2019\u201d he recalls them asking. They showed him other TikTokers who are teachers and he realized how many other educators can relate to his experience.",
      "He continues, \u201cI started to create content, and I ended up finding a community of teachers out there that were going through the same things. Just being stressed out as a teacher, but still enjoying it, and I was able to talk to them. Then it ended up creating a little support group in a way. Also, we\u2019re able to trade lesson plans and info. It\u2019s been a huge help to talk with teachers from around the world and connect with them.\u201d",
      "When he saw that Kardashian had noticed his content, he thought he might as well shoot his shot.",
      "\u201cYou never get that many opportunities in my world,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Why not? What\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u2019\u201d",
      "After his interaction with the reality television star, his students, and co-workers, began teasing him that he was all over their For You Pages. He says during a school rally students gave gifts to all the teachers. They presented Myers with a Photoshopped picture of him and Kardashian.",
      "He doesn\u2019t mind the \"overwhelming\" attention or his students poking fun at him. But he says he hopes that his other videos resonate with people.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be known (as) the teacher that asked out Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. I\u2019d rather be known as a great teacher and a great coach, which I think I am,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s my passion.\u201d",
      "Myers, who has nearly 90,000 followers on Instagram now, adds, \u201cIt\u2019s been an exciting opportunity for me to actually shine a light on education and show people what I teach. There\u2019s a lot of other teachers out there that don\u2019t post and you don\u2019t actually see what they do. And there\u2019s a lot of other teachers that are just like me, who are teaching three different subjects and coaching multiple sports and running programs.\u201d",
      "He hopes his followers understand how much work educators put into helping their students.",
      "As for a future date with Kardashian? He hasn\u2019t heard anything yet.",
      "\u201cKhlo\u00e9\u2019s comment was incredibly kind, and of course I\u2019d love the opportunity to meet her,\u201d he says, adding that he is grateful for all the support he has received."

      "The actor and director was previously married to actress and director Penny Marshall. They wed in 1971 and divorced in 1981.",

    "story": [
      "Wassail might be \u201call over the town\u201d this month, but what is it, exactly?",
      "Every holiday season, carolers sing about drinking eggnog by the fire like Medieval people did, or indulging in a holiday punch or Christmas goose like any of a number of Victorian families, all of which many modern folk still enjoy.",
      "However, some songs blaring over shopping mall speakers or the sound systems of holiday-themed bars make us wonder: What the heck is wassail? Why don\u2019t we still eat sugar plums and roasted chestnuts?",
      "And, perhaps most importantly, what is figgy pudding and why does Bing Crosby want it so badly?",
      "Figgy Pudding (\u2018We Wish You a Merry Christmas\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cNow, bring us some figgy pudding and bring it right here\u201d",
      "Merry modern revelers sing this song without knowing that \u201cfiggy pudding\u201d historically did not contain figs, as it was a misinterpretation of a British holiday classic \u2014 plum pudding \u2014 which is not a pudding in the American sense, but a dense, boiled dessert.",
      "The dish that became figgy pudding was originally more on the savory side, with preserved, sweetened meat and boiled vegetables, but eventually included prunes. Also, the word \u201cplum\u201d eventually became a label for all dried fruits, confusing the issue further.",
      "While stateside bakers don\u2019t traditionally prepare this complex treat for the holidays, save for brave souls like YouTubers Tyler Williams and Safiya Nygaard in 2022, it is still regularly sold in British stores.",
      "A version of figgy pudding being sold at luxury department store Harrods features sultanas, raisins, demerara sugar, pitted plums, figs \u2014 unlike its historical predecessor \u2014 and a butterscotch sauce, for $24.",
      "Sugar Plums (\u2018\u2019Twas the Night Before Christmas\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cWhile visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads\u201d",
      "Interestingly, the history of figgy pudding and sugar plums are related since they both use the word \u201cplum\u201d to refer to fruit or dessert.",
      "A sugar plum is a sugar-coated candy popular in Victorian times which often had a dried fruit like a cherry or fig or nut in the center. Not a plum at all, its name referred to its size and shape.",
      "In 2024, YouTuber Max Miller of Tasting History made sugar plums the traditional way and discovered how time-consuming it is to roll a nut in layer after layer of warm sugar until it becomes candy-coated.",
      "This might be why sugar plums live in the lyrics of this Christmas ditty and not actually in our modern tradition.",
      "Cup of Cheer (\u2018A Holly Jolly Christmas\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cHave a cup of cheer\u201d",
      "While a cup that makes you cheerful these days may be a strong cocktail made by Sam Heughan, the term doesn\u2019t only mean adult beverages in vintage Christmas lyricism. A \u201ccup of cheer\u201d can also refer to hot cocoa.",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "Wassail (\u2018Gloucestershire Wassail,\u2019 \u2018Here We Come A-Wassailing\u2019 and More)",
      "Lyric: \u201cWassail! Wassail all over the town!\u201d",
      "The term wassail has an olde English history: The hot mulled punch, which often consists of cider, wine or ale with winter spices, comes from the words \u201cwaes hael\u201d which means \u201cbe healthy.\u201d",
      "The term is also also a verb: Back in olden times, groups of revelers went door-to-door wassailing with a wassailing bowl, offering sips of drink from it for gifts at each home they visited. This tradition may seem familiar because it\u2019s actually where Christmas caroling comes from.",
      "Roasted Chestnuts (\u2018The Christmas Song\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cChestnuts roasting on an open fire\u201d",
      "The opener to Nat King Cole\u2019s classic rendition of \u201cThe Christmas Song\u201d features a once-abundant treat enjoyed by early Americans during the holidays. In the 18th and 19th centuries, chestnuts were one of the most popular ingredients in early American food because of the preponderance of Chestnut trees speckling the East Coast at the time.",
      "For this Christmas tradition, a roasted chestnut has a soft texture and some say it tastes mild and sweet with a fluffy or potato-like texture \u2014 though one social media user who isn\u2019t a fan claims they have a \u201cmealy\u201d texture.",
      "Sadly, in 1904, a fungal disease tore through chestnut tree populations in the U.S., causing them to almost go extinct and fall out of favor as a traditional treat as a result, although countries like Turkey and Italy still feature the glossy brown nut during the holidays."

      "Movie fans are reeling after Rob Reiner was found dead in his Los Angeles home on Dec. 14, along with his wife, Michele.",
      "Reiner, 78, was the son of comedy legend Carl Reiner and found fame in the 1970s on the classic sitcom \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d created by TV legend Norman Lear, whom Reiner knew while growing up.He played Mike Stivic, nicknamed \u201cMeathead\u201d by Carroll O\u2019Connor\u2019s bigoted Archie Bunker.",
      "For his efforts, Reiner won a pair of Emmy Awards, but his future was on the big screen as a director, where he made some of the most memorable movies of the 1980s and \u201890s.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some of the essential works in Reiner\u2019s catalog and how you can catch them. Whether you\u2019ve seen them before or are coming in a blank slate, these are the movies that helped make Reiner a Hollywood icon.",
      "\u201cThis Is Spinal Tap\u201d (1984)",
      "The term \u201cmockumentary\u201d is common now, but it was a novel concept when Reiner helmed this comedy classic chronicling a British heavy metal band\u2019s disastrous tour. It was so groundbreaking that fans may have actually believed the group, portrayed by Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer, was real when it was pure fiction.",
      "\u201cThis Is Spinal Tap\u201d marked Reiner\u2019s big-screen directorial debut. In addition, he starred as Marty DiBergi, the filmmaker who follows the band. Reiner also directed the long-awaited sequel that came out earlier this year.",
      "\u201cStand by Me\u201d (1986)",
      "Adapted by Stephen King\u2019s short story \u201cThe Body,\u201d which was featured in the same book (\u201cDifferent Seasons\u201d) as the story that turned into \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption,\u201d this coming-of-age drama, starring River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Wil Wheaton and Jerry O\u2019Connell, revolves around a group of four 12-year-old boys who take a trip to find a dead body in 1959 Oregon. The film, which Reiner has said he would like to be remembered for when looking at his career, remains popular to this day, with Feldman, Wheaton and O\u2019Connell touring the country with screenings of it.",
      "\u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d (1987)",
      "\u201cMy name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\u201d If that quote doesn\u2019t mean anything to you, do yourself a favor and see this movie. Based on William Goldman\u2019s novel of the same name, this beloved film is a fairy tale about the pirate Westley\u2019s attempt to rescue his love Buttercup from evil Prince Humperdinck. Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Robin Wright (in her film debut), Christopher Guest and Fred Savage all star.",
      "\u201cWhen Harry Met Sally...\u201d (1989)",
      "Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are at the top of their game in this rom-com classic about two polar opposites who go from disliking each other to friends to a couple over the course of many years. The movie begged the question: Can men and women just be friends? It also features the all-time great movie scene set at a deli and punctuated by a woman (played by Reiner\u2019s real-life mother) saying, \u201cI\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having.\u201d",
      "\u201cMisery\u201d (1990)",
      "Reiner went back to Stephen King in 1990, turning the author\u2019s suspenseful masterpiece \"Misery\" into a movie. In the film, an author (James Caan) is saved after a car accident by his biggest fan (Kathy Bates), who holds him captive in her home. Bates won a best actress Academy Award for her role.",
      "\u201cA Few Good Men\u201d (1992)",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t handle the truth!\u201d Maybe not, but we think you can handle a viewing of this movie, which features that iconic line. Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson and Demi Moore headline an all-star cast in this drama, written by Aaron Sorkin, about a lawyer defending a pair of Marines charged with murdering a fellow Marine. The movie scored four Oscar nominations, including best picture.",
      "\u201cThe American President\u201d (1995)",
      "Reiner was skilled at helming movies across genres. Like \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u2026,\u201d \u201cThe American President\u201d showcases his ability to connect with audiences in a romantic flick. In the movie, also written by Sorkin, Michael Douglas is a widowed president who falls for an environmental lobbyist (Annette Bening) during a reelection year. Michael J. Fox and Martin Sheen also star, as does Richard Dreyfuss, who reunited with Reiner after he narrated \u201cStand by Me.\u201d"

      "\"If you've got like an old rambling shambles, old British mansion covered in moss or ivy, and there's a mysterious relationship and he may not be what he seems,\" she said as Colbert\u2019s audience began laughing.",
      "\"And there's been a murder that has happened in the past but there's the idea of a ghost or an actual ghost,\" she continued.",
      "Swift went on to hilariously describe two other book ideas that would pull her in as the audience kept laughing. One centered around a \"mysterious\" family living \"off the coast of Maine,\" and the other concerned a marriage that \"isn't what it seems\" \u2013\u2014\u00a0preferably told by an \"unreliable narrator.\"",
      "\"If you've got any of that, I'm going to need to read that,\" she said, \"and when I say read that, I am going to need someone to read that to me.\"",
      "Swift's record-breaking \"Eras Tour\" took her all over the globe from March 2023 until its final concert in Vancouver, Canada, on Dec. 8, 2024. The tour was chronicled in her new docuseries, \"Taylor Swift: The End of an Era,\u201d which premiered Dec. 12. Two new episodes will drop Dec. 19 before the finale airs Dec. 26."

    "summary": "Lily Collins has a bob in Emily in Paris Season 5. Why did Lily, and therefore Emily, cut their hair so short? Inside the style decision.",
    "story": [
      "New city, new hairstyle. Season 5 of \"Emily in Paris\" has many changes in store for its chipper American protagonist, played by Lily Collins.",
      "TODAY lifestyle contributor Jill Martin ventured to Venice to chat about Season 5 with Collins and her onscreen and real life friend, Ashley Park, who plays Mindy.",
      "Among the topics of their talk? What inspired the sudden strand switch-up for Collins' character.",
      "\"So did Emily get the bob, or did Lily get the bob?\" Martin asked in a segment that will air on TODAY on Dec. 15.",
      "\"Lily got the bob,\" Collins clarified. \"Usually Lily gets the haircuts first, and then Marylin (Fitoussi, the show's costume designer) is inspired by the haircuts to create the new wardrobe for the next season. And then I always go to Darren (Star, the show's creator) and I'm like, 'Hey, can I keep it?'\"",
      "Throughout the series, which returns for Season 5 on Dec. 18, Emily has rarely strayed from her signature long, brunette locks. Except, of course, that time she decided to cut her own bangs in the Season 3 premiere.",
      "As it turns out, this was another case of art imitating life for Collins.",
      "\"In the season with the bangs, we created part of the storyline, you know, Ashley coming in, and being like, 'No!'\" the actor said.",
      "\"Trauma bangs,\" Park noted.",
      "Collins' real-life bob was a bit more of a dramatic mane move than getting bangs. She told Jill it's a style she wouldn't have considered sporting earlier in her life. But her hairstylist, Gregory Russell, convinced her to try it, since he'd always wanted to see her with shorter hair.",
      "\u201cI really love changing my hair, which is ironic, because growing up, I was like, \u2018I never want to cut or color my hair.\u2019 And so I did it, and I didn\u2019t know how people would react. I was like, \u2018Is there going to have to be a wig next season or whatever?'\" she recalled.",
      "Luckily, Star was down to keep the hairstyle, and the duo proceeded to debate if they should write it into the show.",
      "\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Well, we already did that with the bangs.\u2019 So there was one moment, I believe it was cut (from the show) but there was a moment in the very first episode when I go into the Rome office and I sit down. Philippine (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, who plays Sylvie) comes in, and the first thing she says is, \u2018You cut your hair.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh, thanks.\u2019 And she\u2019s like, \u2018It\u2019s not a compliment. We\u2019ve gotta go,\u2019\u201d she remembered.",
      "Park wanted to make sure the merits of Collins' haircut were acknowledged so she improvised a bit while filming.",
      "\u201cI added a line. Because when Mindy comes to Rome, I remember being like, \u2018Wait, hold up. I know that Lily got this haircut, but I feel like Mindy would at least be, like, \u2018Love your hair!\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Martin was also curious to know if becoming a mother inspired Collins' new shorter hairstyle. In January 2025, Collins announced that she had welcomed her first child with her husband Charlie McDowell.",
      "\"No, it didn\u2019t. I always wanted to do it. I had a very short haircut when I was 25 and then it grew out. But then I just kept it growing. No, it is more practical, perhaps,\" she said.",
      "Regardless of her motivation for chopping her hair, the end result is fabulous, if you ask Park.",
      "\"I've never met anybody who could pull off, truly, any hairstyle, any hair color,\" she said."

      "Days of intense negotiations ended with the United States, Ukraine and Europe hailing significant progress as Trump pushes for a deal to end the Kremlin's war by Christmas.",
      "Washington and Kyiv appear to have made notable shifts to secure progress but huge questions remain, not least whether Moscow will once again flatly reject the idea of making any significant concessions.",
      "And while the U.S. has now offered Ukraine the robust security guarantees it has long sought, the fate of key territory on the conflict\u2019s eastern front lines remains pivotal, yet unresolved.",
      "After meetings with Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff, son-in-law Jared Kushner and European leaders in Berlin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters Monday that Kyiv had now been offered an equivalent of NATO\u2019s Article 5 deterrence mechanism, under which an attack on one member is considered an attack on them all.",
      "This guarantee would be legally binding, he said, voted on and approved by the U.S. Congress.",
      "Zelenskyy said the latest draft was not \"perfect\" but was \"very workable.\" He abandoned Ukraine's long-held ambition of joining NATO over the weekend, ahead of the talks.",
      "These guarantees are \"the biggest win so far for Ukraine and for Europe,\" a U.S. official told reporters, warning that they \u201cwill not be on the table forever.\u201d The official added that they believe Russia will accept it in a final deal.",
      "Zelenskyy has maintained that any deal would need to provide concrete security guarantees to prevent future attacks by Russia. It\u2019s a historically sensitive issue for Kyiv since Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 in violation of the Budapest Memorandum, meant to guarantee Ukraine's post-Soviet sovereignty in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons.",
      "European leaders suggested their countries could lead a \u201cmultinational force\u201d supported by the U.S. that would \u201cassist in the regeneration of Ukraine\u2019s forces, in securing Ukraine\u2019s skies, and in supporting safer seas,\u201d alongside a U.S.-led ceasefire monitoring, verification and deconfliction mechanism.",
      "All of this was discussed on a call with Trump, Zelenskyy said, and the American leader appeared happy with the progress.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re closer now than we have been ever,\u201d Trump said Monday.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for further comment on the status of the talks.",
      "But the Kremlin is unlikely to share in the enthusiasm.",
      "\u201cI think that it\u2019s highly unlikely that Putin will buy into this,\u201d said Christopher Tuck, an expert in conflict and security at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThe draft agreement includes clauses that stand in diametric opposition to policy statements made repeatedly by Russia on what it regards as an acceptable basis for resolving the conflict.\u201d",
      "The multinational force is \u201ca clear red line for Putin,\u201d said John Lough, head of foreign policy at the New Eurasian Strategies Centre, a London/Washington-based think tank focused on Russia. The Kremlin will also reject the idea of a U.S.-led ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism, he said, and will likely ask for restrictions on the kinds of weapons systems available to Kyiv\u2019s forces.",
      "Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told ABC News on Monday that while he thinks Russia and the U.S. might be \u201con the verge\u201d of a deal, the agreement can\u2019t include the presence of foreign troops in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cSo this is likely to go a few more rounds,\u201d Lough said.",
      "And still to be worked out is the future of eastern Ukraine.",
      "Putin insists Russia is winning on the battlefield, giving him no incentive to negotiate what he thinks he can achieve by force.",
      "He wants Ukraine to give up its entire Donbas region, even though Kyiv's forces still control a part of it and it is something Zelenskyy has said he will never do.",
      "\u201cThe Americans are trying to find a compromise,\u201d Zelenskyy said Monday. \u201cThey are proposing a \u2018free economic zone\u2019 (in the Donbas). And I want to stress once again: a \u2018free economic zone\u2019 does not mean under the control of the Russian Federation.\u201d",
      "Trump has insisted that Ukraine would have to cede territory, but it's unclear how this compromise would work or whether the Kremlin would give it the time of day.",
      "A U.S. official said they had given Zelenskyy some \"thought-provoking ideas,\" and that they would speak with Russia and Europe about them after his response. Zelenskyy said the U.S. would take the new draft to Russia in the coming days.",
      "Asked if any of the security guarantees floated Monday were unacceptable to the Kremlin, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had yet to see any updated agreements. He reiterated that Russia wants a comprehensive peace deal, not a short-term ceasefire over Christmas as Kyiv has suggested.",
      "\u201cWe want peace. We don\u2019t want a truce to give Ukraine a breathing space and prepare for a continuation of the war,\u201d Peskov told reporters.",
      "But while the Kremlin is likely to stonewall the newest agreements, Tuck said, the proposed security guarantees put pressure on Russia by implying a growing consensus between Ukraine and the West on what a peace agreement should look like.",
      "\u201cThe agreement isn\u2019t nothing, we aren\u2019t back to square one: the statement does indicate a more united front by the West, and getting the U.S. to commit, even in general and early terms, to providing some form of security guarantees is a significant development,\u201d Tuck said."

      "Those were the conditions that Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado faced when she made perhaps the most perilous part of her journey to collect her Nobel Peace Prize in Norway, according to the U.S. Special Forces veteran who planned and aided her escape.",
      "\u201cThere were 5- to 6-foot waves, maybe even bigger waves than that, and we were doing this in the middle of the night,\u201d Bryan Stern, who heads the Tampa, Florida-based Grey Bull Rescue Foundation, told NBC News. \u201cIt was pitch black, almost no moonlight. All of us were very cold and wet.\u201d",
      "But Machado never lost her composure, or her lunch, Stern said, as the skiff lurched in the rough sea and plied through waters that have been targeted, of late, by the U.S. missile strikes on suspected drug smuggling boats.",
      "\u201cShe did fine,\u201d Stern said. \u201cThey call her the Iron Lady for a reason.\u201d",
      "Stern dubbed the extrication operation: \u201cOperation Golden Dynamite.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe is overwhelmingly the highest-profile person we\u2019ve rescued,\u201d said Stern, who noted this was the 800th mission his organization carried out.",
      "Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in October for leading the opposition against Venezuelan strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime, said on Thursday that she got help from the U.S. government to leave her hiding place in Venezuela and collect her award.",
      "Stern insisted the operation was paid for \u201cby a series of unnamed donors,\u201d and the U.S. government was aware of what was going on but not directly involved.",
      "\u201cWe designed and implemented the extrication of Mar\u00eda Corina Machado from Venezuela to a friendly country from which she was flown to her next destination,\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe were not hired by anyone in the U.S. government.\u201d",
      "In fact, Stern added, \u201cI\u2019ve never received a thank-you note, let alone a dollar, from the U.S. government.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to an email from NBC News seeking information about its possible involvement in Machado\u2019s escape.",
      "Stern said he began planning the mission on Dec. 5.",
      "\u201cWe really wanted to get her to the Nobel prize ceremony on time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there were a number of obstacles.\u201d",
      "Getting Machado out of Venezuela required disguising her appearance. Stern did not say exactly what they did to get her out and wouldn\u2019t comment on a Wall Street Journal account that she, at some point, donned a wig.",
      "\u201cHer face was a problem because she is the most famous person in Venezuela outside of Maduro,\u201d he said, noting that there are billboards with Machado\u2019s image everywhere in Venezuela.",
      "The Maduro regime was using Machado\u2019s facial biometrics to try to locate her, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople in the Maduro regime call it the \u2018Hunt for Maria\u2019 the way we would talk about the \u2018Hunt for Bin Laden\u2019,\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe had to use a lot of deception, even with some members of her own team.\u201d",
      "Stern said he met Machado for the first time on Tuesday evening. He would not say exactly when or where he rendezvoused with Machado, but it involved her taking a small skiff from a fishing village and transferring her at sea to the somewhat bigger fishing boat that he was on.",
      "\u201cI was on the second leg of the operation,\u201d he said. \u201cI got very close to Venezuela.\u201d",
      "But Machado\u2019s departure, which was supposed to happen Tuesday morning, was delayed till evening by a broken engine, he said. And what should have been a three or four-hour trip turned into a roughly 16-hour ordeal.",
      "\u201cI first met her at sea,\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe used a fishing boat to get her to her flight.\u201d",
      "Stern said the flight took off from Cura\u00e7ao, which is about 40 miles north of Venezuela and is a self-governing island that is part of the Netherlands.",
      "\u201cI would say we transited through Cura\u00e7ao,\u201d Stern said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t in Cura\u00e7ao. She never cleared immigration in Cura\u00e7ao.\u201d",
      "Stern said this was the most challenging mission he and his group have undertaken. As for Machado, Stern said he\u2019s a big fan.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m starstruck,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a hero of mine.\u201d"

      "With climate change steadily dismantling the icy habitat essential to their existence, new research suggests polar bears are rapidly rewiring their own genetics in a bid to survive.",
      "The species is being forced to adapt to the harsher reality of a warming Arctic, in what scientists believe is the first documented case of rising temperatures driving genetic change in a mammal.",
      "Researchers from the University of East Anglia in Britain say these findings, published Friday in the journal Mobile DNA, offer a rare glimmer of hope for the species.",
      "\"Polar bears are still sadly expected to go extinct this century, with two-thirds of the population gone by 2050,\" Alice Godden, who is the lead author of the study, told NBC News.",
      "\"I believe our work really does offer a glimmer of hope \u2014 a window of opportunity for us to reduce our carbon emissions to slow down the rate of climate change and to give these bears more time to adapt to these stark changes in their habitats.\"",
      "Building on earlier University of Washington research, Godden\u2019s team analyzed blood samples from polar bears in northeastern and southeastern Greenland. In the slightly warmer south, they found that genes linked to heat stress, aging and metabolism behaved differently from those in northern bears.",
      "\u201cEssentially this means that different groups of bears are having different sections of their DNA changed at different rates, and this activity seems linked to their specific environment and climate,\" Godden said in a university press release.",
      "She said this shows, for the first time, that a unique group of one species has been forced to \"rewrite their own DNA,\" adding that this process can be considered \"a desperate survival mechanism against melting sea ice.\"",
      "The Arctic Ocean has repeatedly experienced record-high temperatures in the past few years, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitoring data shows.",
      "Researchers say warming ocean temperatures have reduced vital sea ice platforms that the bears use to hunt seals, leading to isolation and food scarcity.",
      "This led to genetic changes as the animals\u2019 digestive system adapts to a diet of plants and low fats in the absence of prey, Godden told NBC News.",
      "\"Food availability is a real problem for these bears \u2014 everywhere, but most prominently in the south,\" she said. \"This may suggest their body shape and composition is also changing in response to their warmer environments.\"",
      "The lead researcher said that her team decided to focus on the southern group of bears because the area's warmer climate serves as a glimpse of what is to come for other bear populations later this century if current trends in climate change continue.",
      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates there are currently about 26,000 polar bears worldwide. Scientifically known by its Latin name Ursus maritimus, meaning \"sea bear,\" the animals are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, meaning they are considered to be facing \"a high risk of extinction in the wild.\"",
      "The study \"does not mean that polar bears are at any less risk of extinction,\u201d Godden said, though the discovery may \u201cprovide a genetic blueprint for how polar bears might be able to adapt quickly to climate change.\u201d",
      "Godden added: \"We all must do more to mitigate our carbon emissions to help provide and extend this window of opportunity to help save this wonderful vital species.\""

    "story": [
      "The Arctic last season was the hottest it has been in the past 125 years. The extent of sea ice during its usual maximum in March was the lowest in 47 years of satellite recordkeeping. The North American tundra was more green with plant life than ever recorded.",
      "These observations, shared Tuesday in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s annual Arctic report card, show how rapidly and profoundly the region is shifting as the planet warms.",
      "\u201cThe Arctic continues to warm faster than the global average with the 10 years that comprise the last decade marking the 10 warmest years on record,\u201d said Steve Thur, NOAA\u2019s acting chief scientist and its assistant administrator for oceanic and atmospheric research.",
      "As a result of this warming, \u201cmelting permafrost is altering ecosystems, turning over 200 watersheds in Arctic Alaska orange as iron and other elements are released into its rivers,\u201d Thur said. Researchers have observed higher acidity and a greater concentration of toxic metals in these rusting streams.",
      "That is one of many consequences of climate change in the region that the report outlines. This is the 20th year that NOAA has released its Arctic report card, but the first during President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "The Trump administration has taken steps to scuttle or downplay other reports about climate change, including the National Climate Assessment and a database of billion-dollar climate disasters. Trump has also called climate change a \u201ccon job,\u201d and his administration is working to remove the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to regulate the greenhouse gas pollution that causes it.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Matthew Druckenmiller, one of the report's authors and a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, said the team \u201cdid not receive any political interference with our results.\u201d",

      "\u201cI honestly did not see much of a tone shift in comparison to previous Arctic report cards in years past, which was great to see,\u201d said Tom Di Liberto, a climate scientist and the media director at Climate Central. \u201cThe implications of their findings are the same as past Arctic report cards. The Arctic is the canary in the coal mine.\u201d",
      "Di Liberto previously worked in NOAA\u2019s communications office but was laid off in March, when the agency cut workers who were new to their roles. He pointed out that last year\u2019s report called for a reduction of fossil fuel production in its headline, whereas the new one did not mention fossil fuels at all. Otherwise, he didn\u2019t notice a major change.",
      "NOAA unveiled the report, which describes how climate change is scrambling ecosystems and threatening livelihoods in the Arctic region, at the American Geophysical Union\u2019s annual meeting in New Orleans. The event, one of the biggest science conferences of the year, is attended by thousands of scientists.",

      "\u201cRisks to funding and staffing, alongside aging infrastructure, may compound existing AON [Arctic Observing Network] gaps, jeopardizing long-term trend analyses and undermining decision-making,\u201d the report says.",
      "It highlights in particular several satellites that are part of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program and scheduled to be decommissioned in 2026. Their loss will limit measurements of sea ice, according to the report. It also notes that a dataset on tundra greenness won\u2019t be updated because of funding cuts at NASA and that other climate datasets could be affected by federal budget cuts proposed for the 2026 fiscal year.",
      "The Arctic is warming two to four times faster than other parts of the Earth because of a dynamic called Arctic amplification, which changes both ocean currents and how much sunlight is absorbed by the Earth\u2019s surface near the pole.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s this feedback where you lose sea ice, land ice, you start to absorb more sunlight and you start to warm much more rapidly,\u201d Alessi said.",

      "Alon Meltzer, 37, an associate rabbi at the nearby Mizrachi Synagogue, was among those who on Monday sang Hebrew prayers about fellowship, compassion and mercy near the place where two attackers targeted a Hanukkah celebration a day earlier. Officials have designated the incident \u201cantisemitic terrorism.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe whole world feels narrow, dark and turbulent, but have no fear,\u201d Meltzer said, describing one of the prayers.",

      "For Australians, the overwhelming feeling is shock. After a 1996 shooting in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur that killed 35 people, the country overhauled its gun laws precisely to prevent such an attack from ever happening again. According to police, who seized three firearms and two improvised explosive devices from the scene at Bondi Beach, the 50-year-old suspect was a licensed firearms holder who owned six firearms.",
      "There is also anger. Australia has struggled to address a surge in antisemitism fueled in part by Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, and local Jewish groups have criticized what they see as a lack of support from authorities."

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen every manner of exclusion, abuse, attack, harassment, threats, fire bombings, burning of synagogues,\u201d said Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. \u201cThis country has changed fundamentally in two years, and it\u2019s culminated now on the beach.\u201d",
      "In the aftermath of the shooting, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his National Cabinet vowed Monday to eradicate the \u201cevil scourge\u201d of antisemitism and take other steps like further tightening the country\u2019s already stringent gun control measures and establishing a centralized National Hate Crimes and Incidents Database.",
      "Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles said Albanese and the Australian government have, thus far, been \u201call talk and no action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not the first incident of this kind in Australia, just the worst,\u201d he said. \u201cWarm words of embrace are just not going to cut it. We\u2019re looking for action, changes of policies.\u201d",
      "Rabbi Menachem Gluckowsky, the deputy chief justice of the Chabad Rabbinical Court in Israel, echoed Cooper.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a wake-up call for Australia for sure,\u201d Gluckowsky said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a wake-up call for all countries. This is not just our battle. It\u2019s not just a battle for the Jewish people. This is a battle on evil. Just because you feel you\u2019re right, you can\u2019t gun down people cold bloodedly.\u201d",
      "Gluckowsky likened the Bondi Beach attack to the pogroms that European Jews endured for centuries. He said governments worldwide, and especially in the West, have been slow to respond to rising anti-Jewish hatred.",
      "Both Gluckowsky and Cooper contend that pro-Palestinian demonstrations have fanned the flames of antisemitism. And Australia\u2019s decision in September to formally recognize a Palestinian state was a \u201csignal\u201d to terrorists determined to attack Jews, Cooper said.",
      "\u201cThey have allowed Jews to twist in the wind,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday, Albanese was asked whether he saw any link between the recognition of a Palestinian state and the Bondi shooting.",
      "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. And overwhelmingly, most of the world recognizes a two-state solution as being the way forward in the Middle East,\u201d the prime minister said.",
      "\u201cMy job is to provide support for the Jewish community, is to make it clear that Australians overwhelmingly stand with the Jewish community at this difficult time,\u201d he added in response to a follow-up question.",
      "Cooper\u2019s denunciation came a day after a father-son terror team opened fire on a Hanukkah celebration taking place on the iconic beach. The 50-year-old father died at the scene. His 24-year-old son remained in a coma in a hospital on Monday, officials said.",
      "So far, Australian officials have not released their names or divulged a motive. But since the Israeli-Hamas war erupted two years ago, Australian lawmakers and experts have reported a surge in antisemitic incidents.",
      "The Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people in Israel, and the Israeli military response led to the death of over 70,000 in the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Jewish Australians have faced \u201can unprecedented rise in antisemitism across the country,\u201d an Australian parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism concluded in October 2024.",
      "Earlier this month, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry reported 1,654 anti-Jewish incidents across the country between Oct. 1, 2024, and Sept. 30, 2025.",
      "There were 2,062 such incidents the year before, an all-time high for Australia, the organization reported.",
      "Homes, cars and schools were vandalized with anti-Israel messages. A synagogue and childcare center were targeted by arsonists. Two nurses were suspended for posting online that they would kill or not treat Jewish patients.",
      "And police in January foiled what they said was an antisemitic plot when officers seized a travel trailer packed with explosives.",
      "Most of the threats were reported in Sydney and Melbourne, which are Australia\u2019s biggest cities and home to 85% of the country\u2019s Jewish population of around 117,000.",
      "Previously, Australian lawmakers responded to the threats by passing tough hate crime laws that include mandatory jail time for giving a Nazi salute in public.",
      "Now they\u2019re looking into tightening Australia\u2019s gun laws to make it harder for residents to get their hands on the kind of high-powered rifles and shotguns that were reportedly used Sunday to stain the sands of Bondi Beach with blood.",
      "Antisemitism online has also spiked in recent years, fueled by anger around the conflict between Israel and Hamas and enabled by a new freewheeling social media landscape where content moderation on sites like X and others has been loosened.",
      "The Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that researches misinformation and extremism, found a 4,963% increase in the number of antisemitic YouTube comments on conflict-related videos, compared to the days before the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "For months after the incident, the institute found that fringe platforms like 4chan, Bitchute, Gab and Telegram saw a 50% increase in daily antisemitic comments made.",
      "Sunday\u2019s shooting was the deadliest mass shooting in Australia since April 1996, when a gunman armed with two semi-automatic weapons went on a rampage in the tourist town of Port Arthur, on the island of Tasmania, that left 35 dead and 23 wounded.",
      "That bloodletting resulted in legislation that banned ownership of most automatic and semiautomatic rifles and drastically reduced the number of mass killings in Australia.",
      "Growing emotional, Gluckowsky said they are \u201cgoing to stand strong and carry on\u201d despite what happened on Bondi Beach.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t be intimidated or inhibited of who we are as Jews,\u201d he said.",

      "Lai, one of the most prominent critics of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, was arrested in 2020 shortly after Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law in response to the anti-government protests, which roiled Hong Kong for months in 2019 and sometimes turned violent.",
      "He was found guilty of two charges of colluding with foreign forces under the national security law, as well as a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious materials under legislation from Hong Kong\u2019s time as a British colony.",
      "Lai, who turned 78 last week and faces life in prison, will be sentenced later and is allowed to appeal. On Monday, he appeared thin but in good spirits as he entered the courtroom wearing glasses, a pale green sweater and a gray jacket, smiling and waving to his family.",
      "Western governments and rights groups have criticized the 156-day trial, which began in December 2023, as politically motivated. Both the United States and Britain have called for Lai, a British citizen, to be released, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to \u201cfree\u201d him.",
      "In their 855-page verdict, the three handpicked judges focused on Lai's interactions with senior U.S. government officials, including meetings he had at the height of the 2019 protests with Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton and multiple members of Congress.",
      "Judge Esther Toh said Lai had persistently lobbied Washington to \u201chelp bring down\u201d the Chinese government by imposing sanctions, blockades or other hostile measures \u201cwith the excuse of helping the people of Hong Kong.\u201d",
      "She said it was \u201canalogous to the situation where an American national asked for help from Russia to bring down the U.S. government under the guise of helping the state of California.\u201d",

      "Lai, who pleaded not guilty and spent 52 days testifying, denied using his overseas connections to influence foreign policy on China and Hong Kong. He also said he never intended to \u201cpollute\u201d his readers\u2019 minds but was only commenting on facts.",
      "Toh said Lai had \u201cnever wavered in his intention to destabilize\u201d the Chinese government, citing his WhatsApp messages, live chats, Fox News interviews and social media posts. She said he continued to pursue his goals even after the national security law was enacted on June 30, 2020, but \u201cin a less explicit way.\u201d",

      "\u201cJimmy Lai has long used his media outlet, Apple Daily, to wantonly create social conflicts, incite social antagonism, incite hatred, glorify violence and openly beg for foreign sanctions,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "\u201cThe law will never allow anyone, regardless of profession or background, to openly harm their own country and compatriots under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom,\u201d he added.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict. A White House official confirmed to NBC News last month that Trump discussed Lai\u2019s case with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting in South Korea in October.",
      "Lai\u2019s son Sebastien Lai said after the verdict that he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d by his father\u2019s health condition and that \u201cthe U.K. government has to do more.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to put action behind words and make my father\u2019s release a precondition to closer relationships with China,\u201d he told reporters in London.",

      "The Hong Kong and Chinese governments say Lai has received a fair trial and that the criticism is an attempt to undermine the city\u2019s rule of law. They say press freedom continues to be protected under Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution.",
      "A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday that Beijing \u201cexpresses strong dissatisfaction with and firm opposition to the public slanders and smears against Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary by certain countries.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is entirely reasonable, fair and lawful\u201d for Hong Kong\u2019s judicial organs \u201cto perform their duties, uphold the authority of the law and safeguard national security,\u201d said the spokesperson, Guo Jiakun.",
      "Lai has spent nearly five years in solitary confinement since his arrest in 2020, during which time he has been convicted on multiple other charges, including unauthorized assembly and fraud. His family and supporters have expressed growing concern about his health, as Lai suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure, as well as heart palpitations.",
      "The Hong Kong government says Lai has received \u201cadequate and comprehensive\u201d medical services in custody and that it separates people such as Lai from other prisoners at their own request to ensure their \u201cpersonal safety and well-being.\u201d",
      "Though the Lai trial is Hong Kong\u2019s highest-profile case stemming from the crackdown, it has \u201cmuch less significant\u201d implications for the city\u2019s press freedom and autonomy than two other cases from last year, said John Burns, an emeritus professor specializing in Chinese politics at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "Those cases are the convictions of two journalists accused of sedition over their work for the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Stand News and the subversion charges against 47 pro-democracy figures over their involvement in an unofficial primary election, 45 of whom were convicted or pleaded guilty.",
      "Open dissent has been chilled in Hong Kong under the Beijing-imposed national security law and related local legislation, both of which officials say were necessary to restore stability after the 2019 protests. Most of the city\u2019s pro-democracy figures have been imprisoned, quit politics or moved overseas.",
      "The verdict in Lai\u2019s case comes a day after Hong Kong\u2019s last major opposition party, the Democratic Party, disbanded after a vote by its members, who cited pressure from Chinese officials or intermediaries.",
      "It also comes a week after near-record-low turnout in a \u201cpatriots only\u201d legislative election held under rules that were changed in 2021 to require national security vetting of candidates. Officials have defended the new rules as necessary to restore stability, but critics say they have sidelined groups such as the Democratic Party and left the legislature without any meaningful opposition.",
      "Tensions were already running high in Hong Kong amid public grief over a fire at a high-rise housing complex last month that killed at least 160 people in the city\u2019s worst blaze in almost 80 years. Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have vowed to punish any \u201canti-China\u201d forces that try to use the tragedy to \u201crecreate the chaos\u201d of 2019."

      "Kast\u2019s commanding lead in the polls over his rival in the presidential runoff, communist Jeannette Jara, shows how the hard-liner agitating for mass deportations of immigrants has seized the mantle of the traditional right in a country that once defined its post-dictatorship democratic revival with a vow to contain such political forces.",
      "Many voters are frustrated with the options",
      "But much is also up for grabs about Chile\u2019s political direction.",
      "Kast\u2019s claim to a popular mandate depends on his margin of victory on Sunday over Jara, the center-left governing party candidate who narrowly beat him in the first round of elections last month.",
      "Although various right-wing parties won around 70% of the vote in that election and later endorsed Kast, substantial support for Franco Parisi \u2014 a populist center-right candidate who described himself as an alternative to Kast\u2019s \u201cfascism\u201d \u2014 revealed that, between the contrasting ideologies of the front-runners, sit hundreds of thousands of centrist voters with no real representation.",
      "\u201cBoth are too extreme for me,\u201d said Juan Carlos Pileo, 44, who plans to cast a blank ballot Sunday, as voting is now mandatory in Chile\u2019s elections. \u201cI can\u2019t trust someone who says she\u2019s a communist to be moderate. And I can\u2019t trust someone who exaggerates the amount of crime we have in this country and blames immigrants to be fair and respectful.\u201d",
      "Kast raises expectations, but reality is a different story",
      "Even if elected, it remains uncertain whether Kast, an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, can implement his more grandiose promises. They include slashing $6 billion in public spending over just 18 months without eliminating social benefits, deporting over 300,000 immigrants in Chile with no legal status and expanding the powers of the army to fight organized crime in a country still haunted by Gen. Augusto Pinochet\u2019s military dictatorship from 1973 to 1990.",
      "For one, Kast\u2019s far-right Republican Party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning that he\u2019ll need to negotiate with moderate right-wing forces that could bristle at those proposals, significantly shaping policy and his own legacy.",
      "Political compromises could temper Kast\u2019s radicalism, but also jeopardize his position with voters who expect him to deliver quickly on his law-and-order campaign promises.",
      "At each campaign event, Kast has taken to ticking off the number of days remaining until Chile\u2019s March 11 presidential inauguration, warning immigrants without legal status that they should get out before they \u201chave to leave with just the clothes on their backs.\u201d",
      "Jorge Rubio, 63, a Chilean banker in Santiago, the capital, said he and like-minded Chileans are \u201calso counting down the days, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re voting for Kast.\u201d",
      "Boric\u2019s left-wing government is under fire",
      "As the pandemic shuttered borders, transnational criminal organizations like Venezuela\u2019s Tren de Aragua seized clandestine migration routes to gain a foothold in Chile, long considered among Latin America\u2019s safest and wealthiest countries. Homicides hit a record high in 2022, the first year of President Gabriel Boric\u2019s tenure.",
      "Kast insists that Boric\u2019s government is too soft on immigration and crime, which the far-right leader argues are connected although the data does not necessarily support his narrative. Boric\u2019s approval rating has hovered around just 30% for the past two years.",
      "\u201cWe are living through a moment of psychosis, thanks to this government,\u201d said Nati P\u00e9rez, an 87-year-old Peruvian who immigrated to Chile over a decade ago, heading to vote for Kast at an old railroad terminal in central Santiago that was converted into a vast polling center for the day. \u201cHe\u2019s not against immigrants, he\u2019s against crime. Venezuela sent all their criminals here.\u201d",
      "Others say the firebrand former student protester who came to power in 2021 pledging to transform Chile\u2019s market-led economy, has risen to the occasion. Boric went from criticizing the use of police force on the campaign trial to pouring money into the security forces. He sent the military to reinforce Chile\u2019s northern border, stiffened penalties for organized crime and created the country\u2019s first public security ministry.",
      "\u201cI actually thought this government would be worse. I have to admit that it has improved security,\u201d said Mariano Jara, 55, emerging from a polling station where he said he voted for Kast. \u201cThere\u2019s always more that can be done. There\u2019s room to get tougher.\u201d",
      "Chile\u2019s homicide rate has fallen in the last two years, now on par with the rate in the United States. But that has done nothing to change the widespread feeling of insecurity.",
      "In Chile, just 39% of people feel safe walking alone at night, according to a recent Gallup survey of 144 countries. That\u2019s around the same figure as in Ecuador, which is now in the midst of a violent, drug-driven crime wave. In Libya, where fractious militias jostle for political power, over 70% of people said they feel safe.",
      "Crime and migration overshadow all other concerns",
      "As Boric\u2019s former minister of labor, Jara became popular as the architect of the administration\u2019s most important welfare measures.",
      "That matters little now. Voters\u2019 concerns have forced her to switch gears. She has vowed to toughen border security, register undocumented migrants, tackle money laundering and step up police raids.",
      "But promises to restore law and order are more persuasive coming from an insurgent outsider who has made security a key part of his agenda for years.",
      "\u201cKast has been smart and strategic in focusing on migration and security,\u201d said Luc\u00eda Dammert, a sociologist and Boric\u2019s first chief of staff. \u201cIt has been very difficult for the Jara campaign to move him away from those issues.\u201d",
      "Learning from his previous two failed presidential runs, Kast has avoided topics that fire up his critics \u2014 such as his German-born father\u2019s Nazi past, nostalgia for Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship and opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion.",
      "When asked about his deeply conservative values, Kast, a devout Catholic and father of nine, says only that they remain the same. His supporters, including voters who previously spurned him over his stance on social issues, now say they\u2019re willing to trade abstract human rights concerns for increased safety on the streets.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not very nice to hear that he\u2019s going to separate immigrant children from their parents, it\u2019s sad, that\u2019s going to be a problem for me,\u201d said Natacha Feliz, a 27-year-old immigrant from the Dominican Republic, referring to a recent interview in which Kast said immigrant parents without legal status who didn\u2019t self-deport would be obliged to hand their kids over to the state.",
      "\u201cBut this is happening everywhere, not just in Chile. Let\u2019s just hope that our security situation improves.\u201d"

      "\"This was an ISIS attack against the U.S., and Syria, in a very dangerous part of Syria, that is not fully controlled by them,\" Trump said on Truth Social. \"There will be very serious retaliation.\"",
      "Three other U.S. personnel were wounded in the attack in Palmyra, Sean Parnell, the Pentagon\u2019s chief spokesperson, said on X. The soldiers \"were conducting a key leader engagement\" in \"support of ongoing counter-ISIS operations,\" he said.",
      "\"This attack is currently under active investigation,\" Parnell said.",
      "U.S. Central Command said that the attack was an ambush by \"a lone ISIS gunman\" and that the gunman was engaged and killed.",
      "A Pentagon official told NBC News the attack occurred in an area outside the control of Syria\u2019s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on X that U.S. partner forces killed the person who carried out the attack. He did not provide additional details about the perpetrator or the forces involved.",
      "\"The savage who perpetrated this attack was killed by partner forces,\" Hegseth wrote, adding that those who target Americans \"will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Syria\u2019s Interior Ministry, Nour al-Din al-Baba, said on state television that internal security officials had issued warnings to partner forces operating in the Badia region about the possibility of an Islamic State attack. He said the U.S.-led coalition did not take those warnings seriously.",
      "The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had reported that the attacker is a member of Syrian security forces. Al-Baba said the person had no leadership role within Syria's internal security forces and was not serving as an escort to leadership at the time of the attack.",

      "Trump addressed the attack ahead of Saturday's Army-Navy football game in Baltimore, calling it an ambush and mourning the deaths. Asked by a reporter whether the U.S. would retaliate, he said, \"Yeah, we will.\"",
      "The U.S. military has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly stationed in the northeast, where they work with local security to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State. The U.S. and other nations have re-engaged with Damascus under al-Sharaa since rebels ousted former President Bashar al-Assad."

      "Tripoli's Red Castle museum has reopened for the first time since the 2011 uprising that toppled Moammar Gadhafi, unveiling a trove of treasures that span millennia, from ancient mummies to relics of Libya's turbulent and fascinating history.",
      "Formerly known as As-Saraya Al-Hamra, the fortress that houses the museum has long been a central landmark in Libya\u2019s capital, Tripoli. It houses an extensive collection of artifacts tracing 5,000 years of history, from prehistoric times through to Libya\u2019s Roman, Greek and Islamic eras.",
      "Collections include Islamic art and architecture as well as objects from Italian colonial rule, World War II and Libya's independence, with galleries dedicated to the prehistoric period and ancient Libyan tribes, such as the Garamantes.",
      "\u201cThe reopening of the National Museum is not just a cultural moment but a live testimony that Libya is building its institutions,\u201d Abdulhamid al-Dbiebah, prime minister of the Government of National Unity, said at a ceremony on Friday awash with fireworks at the site.",
      "The museum closed in February 2011 during the NATO-backed uprising against Gadhafi, as anti-government protesters in the northeastern city of Benghazi began calling for the leader to step down and for the release of political prisoners. As protests intensified, demonstrators took control of Benghazi and unrest spread to Tripoli, with the Libyan government using lethal force against demonstrators.",
      "When rebels launched their first attack on the Libyan capital in August that year, a group of armed men were reported to have entered the national museum, incorrectly believing it to conceal the entrance of a secret government tunnel. The museum\u2019s artifacts were largely left intact, though a 1960s Volkswagen Beetle belonging to Gadhafi was among the regime-linked objects vandalized.",
      "Gadhafi was eventually toppled with the help of an international coalition that included the U.S.",
      "Renovations for the museum, built in the 1980s and opened by Gadhafi, began in March 2023 by the Tripoli-based GNU.",
      "The reopening of the national museum indicates a recovery in the country\u2019s cultural sector, despite unresolved political dynamics. The country remains divided between administrations in the west and east that have not had a unified budget in more than a decade.",
      "But with a planned election on the horizon in 2026, Hager Ali, a research fellow at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, said the museum's opening carries a political message.",
      "The reopening is \"kind of like a proof of concept of the western government that they are stable, especially in the forerun of elections,\" she told NBC News on Saturday, referring to the GNU.",
      "\"There really isn\u2019t anything that isn\u2019t political right now in Libya,\" she added. \u201cThis is very much a kind of a symbol that everyone can get behind.\"",
      "Since renovations began, Libya has recovered 21 artifacts that were smuggled out of the country after Gadhafi\u2019s fall, notably from France, Switzerland and the United States, the chairman of the board of directors of the antiquities department, Mohamed Farj Shakshoki, told Reuters ahead of the opening.",
      "Libya houses five UNESCO World Heritage sites, which in 2016 were all declared \"endangered\" due to instability and conflict.",
      "The historic town of Ghadames in western Libya was among the sites under threat, but conservation work spearheaded by the Managing Libya's Cultural Heritage project led to the site being officially removed from UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger in July."

    "story": [
      "When Volodymyr Zelenskyy last asked Ukrainians to vote for him, he was a political newbie, a former comedian eager to change his country and talk with Russia to end a protracted conflict.",
      "Six years later, Zelenskyy \u2014 transformed by the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion \u2014 is facing sudden pressure from the United States to hold a new election, even as he navigates Washington\u2019s push for a peace deal that could threaten Ukraine\u2019s future.",
      "President Donald Trump, frustrated by a lack of progress in peace talks, criticized Zelenskyy this week for \u201cusing war not to hold an election.\u201d It\u2019s a narrative that Moscow has exploited to label Zelenskyy\u2019s government \u201cillegitimate\u201d and thus impossible to negotiate with.",
      "Yet an election would currently be illegal, since Ukrainian law prohibits holding elections while martial law is in effect.",
      "Nonetheless, Zelenskyy now appears to be playing ball. But huge questions hang over the idea, from security to logistics, given the fierce fighting on the front lines and the daily Russian aerial assaults on Ukraine\u2019s cities.",
      "\u201cI do not want Ukraine to have a weak position, so that someone could use the absence of elections as an argument against Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskyy said Thursday. Elections could happen in 60 to 90 days, he has said, provided that Ukraine\u2019s allies help provide security on the ground.",
      "Ukraine was scheduled to hold a presidential election in early 2024, but it was postponed because martial law was introduced after Russia\u2019s February 2022 attack.",
      "After Trump\u2019s comment, Zelenskyy said he had asked lawmakers to prepare proposals \u201cenabling changes to the legal framework\u201d that would make elections possible.",
      "Beyond martial law, there are two major challenges, Zelenskyy said: security and the army.",
      "First, how would Kyiv ensure that people who come out to vote won\u2019t be hit in a sudden missile or drone strike? The Kremlin\u2019s attacks regularly plunge Ukrainian cities into frigid darkness for hours, which could complicate voting and ballot counting.",
      "\u201cElections always involve crowds,\u201d said Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko. \u201cWhat do you do about air raid alerts and safeguarding electoral paperwork? If a siren goes off, do you just grab a bunch of election protocols and run into a shelter? I am having a hard time imagining how that could work.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment on how the U.S. might help.",
      "Kyiv would also have to figure out how hundreds of thousands of soldiers fighting on the front lines would vote.",
      "Some forces could perhaps be rotated out to vote in relatively safer areas, but Ukraine is already low on manpower and could risk jeopardizing critical battlefield positions.",
      "To that end, Zelenskyy has called for a ceasefire during the election process. The Kremlin swiftly shot down the suggestion, having long rejected any ceasefire before a full peace deal is reached.",
      "Without a pause in fighting, more than 800,000 personnel in Ukraine\u2019s armed forces would be effectively shut out of any election process, said Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party. It would be unsafe for people overseeing the voting, too, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any observers coming to the front line where you can be killed by a first-person view (FPV) drone like every 15 minutes,\u201d Kravchuk said in an audio message sent to NBC News on WhatsApp.",
      "Kravchuk pointed to the country\u2019s five different presidents since Vladimir Putin came to power in Russia in 2000. \u201cUkrainians understand that during the war, the first goal is to survive and to keep the country, keep the sovereign state,\u201d she said.",
      "Zelenskyy has been under domestic pressure, too, thanks to a corruption scandal. But even his opponents seemed skeptical of a wartime vote.",
      "It would take at least half a year after the end of martial law to organize elections that would be truly free and fair, said opposition lawmaker Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze. \u201cBut discussing all of this right now has little to do with the reality on the ground,\u201d Klympush-Tsintsadze, who represents the European Solidarity Party, said in an audio message on WhatsApp. \u201cWe are very far from the real end of this war,\u201d she added.",
      "Another complicating factor is that millions of Ukrainians fled the country when the war broke out and now live overseas. Millions more have been internally displaced by the fighting or now live in areas occupied by Russia (about 20% of Ukraine\u2019s territory), so simply working out who is eligible to vote and how to reach them would pose an immense challenge, said Fesenko.",
      "Trump and Putin may think that the lack of an election undermines Zelenskyy\u2019s legitimacy, but Ukrainians don\u2019t seem to agree.",
      "An opinion poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in September found  that 63% of Ukrainians believe elections should be held only after a final peace agreement and a complete end to the war. Only 11% support holding elections right now, even without a ceasefire, according to the poll.",
      "Should an election be held in the near future, there is only one candidate who could challenge Zelenskyy, Fesenko said \u2014 Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the former commander in chief.",
      "Zaluzhnyi has remained a popular figure after leading the Ukrainian army through much of the war. He was sacked by Zelenskyy in early 2024 and is now serving as Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Britain. Although Zelenskyy\u2019s position has been weakened by the corruption scandal, the president would still be a front-runner alongside Zaluzhnyi, Fesenko said. \u201cIt\u2019s just these two,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone else has much lower ratings.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the fourth year of the war, everyone is deeply exhausted,\u201d marketing specialist Ivan Datsko told NBC News on the phone from Kyiv on Wednesday.",
      "Datsko, 33, said he felt that elections could be held but that there must at least be a ceasefire. \u201cNo rockets, no [drones] \u2014 and conditions that allow our soldiers to rotate safely. And of course, all Ukrainians who have left the country must also have the opportunity to vote,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf all these conditions are met, it could become a strong step toward real peace talks,\u201d Datsko added. \u201cFirst, silence on the front line, then elections, and after that, an agreement that truly protects Ukraine from future aggression and gives us a chance for peace and a normal life,\u201d he said.",
      "Russia has accused Zelenskyy of trying to cling to power. Last month, Putin said signing a peace deal with Zelenskyy would be \u201cpointless\u201d because he has lost his legitimacy after being too \u201cafraid\u201d to run again. The Kremlin said Friday that Zelenskyy\u2019s declared readiness for an election may simply be his latest attempt to freeze the conflict before negotiating a deeper peace deal \u2014 something Moscow has frequently rejected.",
      "Other countries have held elections in wartime and elected officials\u2019 democratic mandate becomes weaker the longer they are postponed, but elections also need to be practically possible, said Janina Dill, an international law expert on the use of force and a professor of global security at the University of Oxford.",
      "\u201cAnd calls for an election must not be used to weaken Ukrainian agency and resolve in the midst of an existential struggle for national survival,\u201d Dill added."
