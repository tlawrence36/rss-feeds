      "Actor Timothy Busfield has been released from a jail in New Mexico, where he faces charges of child sexual abuse",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Actor Timothy Busfield was released from jail Tuesday night in New Mexico, where he is facing counts of child sexual abuse.",
      "Hours earlier, Busfield's attorneys successfully argued that the actor best known for appearances in \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d \u201cField of Dreams\u201d and \u201cThirtysomething\u201d wasn't a danger to the community and shouldn't be behind bars while he awaits trial. Prosecutors sought to keep him in jail, outlining what they said was grooming behavior and abuse of power by Busfield over three decades.",
      "State District Court Judge David Murphy said while the crimes Busfield is accused of inherently are dangerous and involve children, prosecutors didn't prove the public wouldn't be safe if he's released.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of a pattern of criminal conduct, there are no similar allegations involving children in his past,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cRather this defendant self-surrendered and submitted himself to this court\u2019s jurisdiction, demonstrating compliance with the court order for his arrest.\u201d",
      "Outside the courthouse, Busfield's wife, actor Melissa Gilbert, thanked Murphy for the ruling. She also thanked friends, relatives, co-workers and strangers who she said have showered their family with love. Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls in the 1970s to \u201980s TV series \u201cLittle House on the Prairie,\" sat behind Busfield during the hearing. He was handcuffed and dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit.",
      "Prosecutors declined to comment on the ruling.",
      "Busfield is facing two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse while working as a director on the set of the TV series \u201cThe Cleaning Lady,\" allegations that he denies. He was booked into jail after a warrant was issued for his arrest and he turned himself in.",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the Albuquerque Police Department said a boy reported that Busfield touched him on his private areas over his clothing on one occasion when he was 7 years old and another time when he was 8. The boy\u2019s twin brother told authorities he was also touched by Busfield, but he did not specify where and didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble, the complaint said.",
      "During the hearing Tuesday, Busfield's attorneys pointed out that the children initially said during interviews with police that Busfield didn't touch them inappropriately. Busfield's attorneys then accused the boys' parents of coaching their children toward incriminating statements after the boys lost lucrative roles on the show.",
      "Busfield's defense team called just one witness \u2014 Alan Caudillo, director of photography on \u201cThe Cleaning Lady\u201d \u2014 to testify that children on set were never left alone with individuals, and that the parents were the ones who encouraged hugs with adults on the set.",
      "According to the criminal complaint, one of the boys later disclosed during a therapy session that he was inappropriately touched by Busfield. Those records were obtained by police during the investigation.",

      "Busfield submitted letters vouching for his character, and his attorneys say he passed an independent polygraph test.",

      "The Sundance Film Festival kicks off Thursday in Park City, Utah, marking its final year there",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- The Sundance Film Festival may be a little bittersweet this year. It will be familiar in some ways as it kicks off on Thursday in Park City, Utah. There will be stars, from Natalie Portman to Charli XCX, and breakout discoveries, tearjerkers, comedies, thrillers, oddities that defy categorization and maybe even a few future Oscar nominees. The pop ups and sponsors will be out in full force on Main Street. The lines to get into the 90 movies premiering across 10 days will be long and the volunteers will be endlessly helpful and cheery in subfreezing temperatures.",
      "But the country\u2019s premier showcase for independent film is also in a time of profound transition after decades of relative stability. The festival is bidding farewell to its longtime home and forging forward without its founder, Robert Redford, who died in September. Next year, it must find its footing in another mountain town, Boulder, Colorado.",
      "It\u2019s no surprise that legacy will be a through-line at this year\u2019s final edition in Park City. There will be screenings of restored Sundance gems like \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine,\u201d \u201cMysterious Skin,\u201d \u201cHouse Party\u201d and \u201cHumpday\u201d as well as Redford\u2019s first truly independent film, the 1969 sports drama \u201cDownhill Racer.\u201d Many will also pay tribute to Redford at the institute\u2019s fundraising event, where honorees include Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, Ed Harris and Nia DaCosta.",
      "\u201cSundance has always been about showcasing and fostering independent movies in America. Without that, so many filmmakers wouldn\u2019t have had the careers they have,\u201d said \u201cMysterious Skin\u201d filmmaker Gregg Araki. He first attended the festival in 1992 and has been back many times, including at the labs where Zhao was one of his students.",
      "Quite a few festival veterans are planning to make the trip, including \u201cNavalny\u201d filmmaker Daniel Roher. His first Sundance in 2022 might have been a bit unconventional (made fully remote at the last minute due to the pandemic) but ended on a high note with an Oscar. This year he\u2019s back with two films, his narrative debut \u201cTuner,\u201d and the world premiere of \u201cThe AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist,\u201d which he co-directed with Charlie Tyrell.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going through a weird moment in the world \u2026 There\u2019s something that strikes me about an institution that has been evergreen, that seems so entrenched going through its own transition and rebirth,\u201d Roher told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m choosing to frame this year as a celebration of Sundance and the institute and a future that will ensure the festival goes on forever and ever and ever and stays the vital conduit for so many filmmakers that it has been.\u201d",
      "Over the past four decades, countless careers have been shaped and boosted by the festival and the Institute. Three of this year\u2019s presumed Oscar nominees \u2014 Paul Thomas Anderson, Ryan Coogler and Zhao \u2014 are among those the Institute supported early in their careers.",
      "Jay Duplass, who first came to Sundance in 2003 with his brother, Mark, with what he calls a \u201c$3 film\u201d said it was the place where his career was made.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d probably be a psychologist right now if it wasn\u2019t for Sundance,\u201d Duplass said.",
      "While he\u2019s been to \u201cprobably 15 Sundances\u201d since, it hasn\u2019t lost its luster. In fact, when a programmer called him to tell him that his new film \u201cSee You When I See You\u201d was selected, he cried. The film is based on a memoir in which a young comedy writer (Cooper Raiff) attempts to process the death of his sister (Kaitlyn Dever). It's one of many films that finds humor amid grim subjects.",
      "As always, the lineup is full of starry films as well, including Cathy Yan\u2019s art world satire, \u201cThe Gallerist,\u201d starring Portman, Jenna Ortega, Sterling K. Brown, Zach Galifianakis and Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph. The romantic drama \u201cCarousel,\u201d from Rachel Lambert, features Chris Pine and Jenny Slate as high school exes who rekindle their romance later in life. Araki is also bringing a new film, \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d in which Olivia Wilde plays a provocative artist (Araki described as a cross between Madonna and Robert Mapplethorpe) who takes on Cooper Hoffman as her younger muse.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of a sex-positive love letter to Gen Z,\u201d Araki said. \u201cIt\u2019s a comedy. It has elements of mystery, thriller, murder \u2014 a little bit of \u2018Sunset Boulevard\u2019 \u2026 it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s colorful, it's sexy. It's a ride.\u201d",

      "The 2026 festival features a robust lineup of documentaries too, which have a good track record of snagging eventual Oscar nominations and wins. There are a handful of films about famous faces, including basketball star Brittney Griner, Courtney Love, Salman Rushdie, Billie Jean King, Nelson Mandela and comedian Maria Bamford.",
      "Others delve into newsy subjects past and present, like \u201cWhen A Witness Recants,\u201d in which author Ta-Nehisi Coates revisits the case of the 1983 murder of a boy in his Baltimore middle school and learns the truth. \u201cAmerican Doctor\u201d follows three professionals trying to help in Gaza. \u201cWho Killed Alex Odeh\u201d examines the 1985 assassination of a Palestinian American activist in Southern California. \u201cEverybody To Kenmure Street\u201d is about civil resistance to deportations in Glasgow in 2021.

And they\u2019re all going to mix.\u201d",
      "Araki, like Redford, knew long ago that the festival had outgrown Park City. It will be strange to no longer have its iconic locations like Egyptian Theatre and Eccles and The Ray anymore, but it's also just a place.",
      "\u201cThe legacy and the tradition of Sundance will continue no matter where it is,\u201d Araki said.",

      "Prince Harry's legal battle against British tabloids has entered its final round",
      "LONDON -- The third and final round in Prince Harry 's battle with the British tabloids began Monday with his lawyer alleging that the Daily Mail and its sister Sunday newspaper engaged in a \u201cclear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\u201d for two decades.",
      "Attorney David Sherborne said a longstanding culture of hiring private investigators who practiced \u201cdark arts\u201d to spy on celebrities for scoops had left Harry distressed and isolated.",
      "It was \u201cdisturbing to feel that my every move, thought or feeling was being tracked and monitored just for the Mail to make money out of it,\u201d Harry said, according to his lawyer\u2019s written opening statement.",
      "The intrusions were \u201cterrifying\u201d for his loved ones, created a \u201cmassive strain\u201d on his personal relationships, and the distrust and suspicion they caused left Harry \u201cparanoid beyond belief,\u201d Sherborne said.",
      "Tens of millions of dollars are on the line in the privacy invasion case in which the Duke of Sussex is joined by Elton John, actors Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, and others who claim the publisher of the Mail hired private investigators to bug their cars, obtain their personal records and eavesdrop on phone calls.",
      "Associated Newspapers Ltd. has denied the allegations, called them preposterous and said the articles in question were reported with legitimate sources that included \u201cleaky\u201d associates willing to dish dirt on their famous friends.",
      "The trial in London\u2019s High Court is expected to last nine weeks and will see the return of Harry to the witness box Thursday for the second time since he made history in 2023 by becoming the first senior member of the royal family to testify in more than a century.",
      "Harry, wearing a dark blue suit, cheerfully waved at reporters as he entered the court building via a side entrance. He took a seat in the back row of the courtroom near Hurley and Frost as John watched the proceedings online.",
      "The case in the High Court follows two cases Harry brought against the other major tabloids that grew out of the widespread phone hacking scandal in which some journalists intercepted voicemail messages around the turn of this century.",
      "Harry won a court judgment in 2023 that condemned the publishers of the Daily Mirror for \u201cwidespread and habitual\u201d interception of phone messages. Last year, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s flagship U.K. tabloid made an unprecedented apology for intruding on Harry\u2019s life for years, and agreed to pay substantial damages to settle his privacy invasion lawsuit.",
      "The litigation is part of Harry's self-proclaimed mission to reform the media that he blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris. He also said persistent press attacks on his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, led them to leave royal life and move to the United States in 2020.",
      "Defense lawyer Antony White said the lawsuits were based on weak inferences by trying to connect articles to payments made to investigators.",
      "But he said witnesses, from editors to reporters who have worked for the newspapers for decades, were \u201clining up\u201d to dispute the allegations and explain their sources, which he said were often very close the subjects of the articles.",
      "\u201cThis is in reality little more than guesswork \u2014 it involves jumping to conclusions based on insufficient evidence, or worse, artificially selecting and presenting evidence to fit the preconceived agenda,\u201d White wrote in his opening statement. \u201cIt also ignores the fact that references in articles to a \u2018friend\u2019, or similar, as a source can be accurate.\u201d",

      "Sherborne said the company\u2019s vigorous denials, destruction of records and \u201cmasses upon masses of missing documents\u201d had prevented the claimants from learning what the newspapers had done.",

Harry, Hurley, Frost, and John and his husband, David Furnish, were \u201cjust a small handful of my targets,\u201d Burrows said in a statement read in court.",

The Walt Disney Co. also celebrated another win as their Thanksgiving release \u201cZootopia 2\u201d became the highest grossing animated Motion Picture Association release of all time.",
      "Meanwhile \u201cThe Bone Temple,\u201d directed by Nia DaCosta, landed in second place with $13 million through Sunday. By the end of Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, it's expected to be at $15 million, still trailing \u201cAvatar's\u201d projected $17.2 million. The film, released by Sony Pictures and starring Ralph Fiennes and Jack O\u2019Connell, opened wide this weekend in 3,506 theaters on a wave of hype and strong reviews. It currently has a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, and 72% of audiences said in a PostTrak poll that they would \u201cdefinitely recommend\u201d the movie.

Going into the weekend, \u201cThe Bone Temple\u201d was expected to make at least $20 million through Monday.

      "Third place went to \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d with $8.8 million in its eighth weekend. With global grosses currently at $1.7 billion, it surpassed \u201cInside Out 2\u201d as the highest grossing MPA animated release of all time. The MPA distinction means that the Chinese blockbuster \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d which has made over $2.2 billion, is not included in the rankings. \u201cZootopia 2\u201d is also now the ninth biggest global release of all time",

      "The Pentagon said Thursday that it is changing the independent military newspaper Stars and Stripes so it concentrates on \u201creporting for our warfighters\u201d and no longer includes \u201cwoke distractions.\u201d",
      "That message, in a social media post from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's spokesman, is short on specifics and does not mention the news outlet's legacy of independence from government and military leadership. It comes a day after The Washington Post reported that applicants for jobs at Stars and Stripes were being asked what they would do to support President Donald Trump's policies.",
      "Stars and Stripes traces its lineage to the Civil War and has reported news about the military either in its newspaper or online steadily since World War II, largely to an audience of service members stationed overseas. Roughly half of its budget comes from the Pentagon and its staff members are considered Defense Department employees.",
      "The outlet's mission statement emphasizes that it is \u201ceditorially independent of interference from outside its own editorial chain-of-command\u201d and that it is unique among news organizations tied to the Defense Department in being \u201cgoverned by the principles of the First Amendment.\u201d",
      "Congress established that independence in the 1990s after instances of military leadership getting involved in editorial decisions. During Trump's first term in 2020, Defense Secretary Mark Esper tried to eliminate government funding for Stars and Stripes \u2014 to effectively shut it down \u2014 before he was overruled by the president.",
      "Hegseth's spokesman, Sean Parnell, said on X Thursday that the Pentagon \u201cis returning Stars and Stripes to its original mission: reporting for our warfighters.\u201d He said the department will \u201crefocus its content away from woke distractions.\u201d",
      "\u201cStars and Stripes will be custom tailored to our warfighters,\u201d Parnell wrote. \u201cIt will focus on warfighting, weapons systems, fitness, lethality, survivability and ALL THINGS MILITARY. No more repurposed DC gossip columns; no more Associated Press reprints.\u201d",
      "Parnell did not return a message seeking details. The Daily Wire reported, after speaking a Pentagon spokeswoman, that the plan is to have all Stars and Stripes content written by active-duty service members. Currently, Congress has mandated that the publication's publisher and top editor be civilians, said Max Lederer, its publisher.",
      "The Pentagon also said that half of the outlet's content would be generated by the Defense Department, and that it would no longer publish material from The Associated Press or Reuters news services.",
      "Also Thursday, the Pentagon issued a statement in the Federal Register that it would eliminate some 1990s era directives that governed how Stars and Stripes operates. Lederer said it's not clear what that would mean for the outlet's operations, or whether the Defense Department has the authority to do so without congressional authorization.",
      "The publisher said he believes that Stars and Stripes is valued by the military community precisely because of its independence as a news organization. He said no one at the Pentagon has communicated to him what it wants from Stars and Stripes; he first learned of its intentions from reading Parnell's social media post.",

      "\u201cI think it's very important that Stars and Stripes maintains its editorial independence, which is the basis of its credibility,\u201d Smith said. A longtime newspaper editor in Connecticut, Smith's role was created by Congress three decades ago and she reports to the House Armed Services Committee.",
      "It's the latest move by the Trump administration to impose restrictions on journalists. Most reporters from legacy news outlets have left the Pentagon rather than to agree to new rules imposed by Hegseth that they feel would give him too much control over what they report and write. The New York Times has sued to overturn the regulations.",
      "Trump has also sought to shut down government-funded outlets like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that report independent news about the world in countries overseas.",
      "Also this week, the administration raided the home of a Washington Post journalist as part of an investigation into a contractor accused of stealing government secrets, a move many journalists interpreted as a form of intimidation.",
      "The Post reported that applicants to Stars and Stripes were being asked how they would advance Trump's executive orders and policy priorities in the role. They were asked to identify one or two orders or initiatives that were significant to them. That raised questions about whether it was appropriate for a journalist to be given what is, in effect, a loyalty test.",

      "China's one-child policy led to harsh measures like forced abortions and sterilizations",
      "BEIJING -- China's one-child policy, one of the harshest attempts at population control the world has seen, forced abortions on women, made sterilization widespread and led to baby daughters being sold or even killed, because parents wanted their only child to be a male.",
      "Now, experts say, the question is whether it was all necessary. China's birth rate fell to record lows last year and its population has fallen for four years in a row, official statistics showed this week. Authorities, alarmed by the prospect of a shrinking workforce and an aging population, scrapped the policy in 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to escape the fact that China demographically shot itself in the foot,\u201d said Mei Fong, the author of the 2016 book, \u201cOne Child: The Story of China\u2019s Most Radical Experiment.\u201d",
      "China's leaders saw unbridled population growth as a potential threat in 1980 \u2014 to both economic development and its ability to feed what had grown into a nation of 1 billion people.",
      "The then impoverished country wasn\u2019t the only one worried about having too many people at the time. Population control was a hot topic internationally and experts feared that rapid growth in China, India and elsewhere could overwhelm the earth\u2019s resources.",
      "The birth rate had begun to fall in the 1970s after the government began encouraging people to have fewer children. It's unclear how much its fall since then resulted from the one-child policy and to what degree it would have happened anyway because of the tremendous economic and societal changes over the last four decades.",
      "But the leadership at the time decided to curb population growth more directly, launching the one-child policy and enforcing it with stiff financial penalties for parents who had more than one child, as well as abortions and sterilization campaigns. It lasted for 35 years.",
      "Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, notes that the number of people getting sterilized plunged from 1.4 million women and 180,000 men in 2014, two years before the policy was eased, to 190,000 women and 2,600 men in 2020.",
      "In 2016, the government began allowing two children per couple and raised the limit to three children in 2021. But it has proven more difficult to reverse the mentality of people than the policy.",

      "Now, some from that generation, once dubbed \u201clittle emperors\u201d because they were so fussed over, face the pressure of meeting the expectations, including financial, of being the only child.",
      "As they reach their 30s and 40s, there is only one child to support two parents, and in some cases, up to four grandparents. For some, this can lead to anxiety and depression, Fong said.",
      "\u201cThe little emperor at some point becomes the slave,\u201d she said.",
      "China is an aging society that will likely face a major shortfall in the coming decades: not enough people of working age to support a growing population of retirees. That could burden government finances and pension systems.",
      "The government has launched a slew of polices to try to boost the birth rate, from eliminating a tax exemption for condoms to giving cash subsidies to couples who have children. But the experience of other countries shows that it's difficult to turn around a declining birth rate.",

      "Since June 2022, nearly 24,000 cans of formula have been distributed to groups that aid homeless and other vulnerable families, the company said. All the company's products have been recalled since production began in March 2022 because of potential contamination.",
      "Soon after consuming the ByHeart formula, Ashaan developed severe constipation and muscle weakness, becoming so limp that he couldn\u2019t move his head, Carter said.",
      "After a trip to an emergency room, he was sent to Randall Children\u2019s Hospital in Portland. Doctors there diagnosed him with presumed infant botulism tied to the ByHeart formula, according to Dr. Sylvia Peterson-Perry, a family medicine doctor who delivered Ashaan and cares for him and his mother.",
      "He was treated with BabyBIG, an IV medication that provides antibodies to the infection to stop the progress of the disease.",
      "Ashaan was hospitalized for nearly two weeks in November and discharged without a feeding tube. His health rapidly declined, including dramatic weight loss, and he was hospitalized again in December. He got so sick that his mother was afraid he would die.",

      "The world\u2019s first legally binding agreement to protect marine life in international waters takes effect Saturday",
      "The world\u2019s first legally binding agreement to protect marine life in international waters took effect Saturday, marking a historic moment for ocean conservation after nearly two decades of negotiations.",
      "The High Seas Treaty will govern nearly half the planet\u2019s surface \u2013 the vast ocean areas beyond any country\u2019s control. These waters face mounting threats from destructive fishing practices, shipping, plastic pollution, overfishing and potential deep sea mining, all compounded by climate change. The ocean absorbs carbon dioxide and produces oxygen, making its health critical for addressing the climate crisis.",
      "The treaty entered into force 120 days after it reached the threshold of ratification by 60 countries in September. As of Friday, 83 countries had ratified it, including the recent addition of major maritime powers such as China and Japan.",
      "The treaty creates the first framework for establishing Marine Protected Areas on the high seas, which make up about two-thirds of the world\u2019s ocean. Currently, only around 1% of these international waters are protected.",
      "From Saturday, ratifying countries must begin working together on ocean science and technology as well as help developing nations build capacity to participate in ocean governance. Companies planning activities that could harm marine life must conduct environmental impact assessments that meet the treaty\u2019s standards. Those conducting research on ocean organisms that could be used commercially, such as for new medicines, must notify other countries and share their findings.",
      "Perhaps most significantly, countries must now promote the treaty\u2019s conservation goals when they participate in other international bodies that regulate ocean activities, such as regional fisheries organizations, the International Maritime Organization and the International Seabed Authority.",
      "While key institutions like the treaty\u2019s secretariat and scientific body are still being developed, countries can begin preparing proposals for Marine Protected Areas immediately. Potential sites include the Emperor Seamounts in the North Pacific, the Sargasso Sea in the Atlantic and the Salas y Gomez and Nazca Ridges off South America.",
      "Conservationists warn governments must act quickly to achieve the global goal of protecting 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030 \u2013 a target scientists say is critical for ocean health. Because the high seas make up such a vast portion of the oceans, their protection is essential to reaching that goal.",
      "\u201cThe marine protected areas under the treaty will only be as strong as the governments make them,\u201d said Megan Randles, global political lead for Greenpeace\u2019s Ocean Campaign. \u201cWe can\u2019t trust big fishing industry players to simply stop fishing in these critical ecosystems. We need governments to use the treaty to force their hands.\u201d",
      "How those protected areas will actually be monitored and enforced is undecided. Countries are exploring various options, from satellite technology to coordinating patrols between multiple nations to using other UN agencies to help with oversight, said Rebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance. Those details will be worked out as the first protected areas take shape.",
      "Within a year, the treaty\u2019s first Conference of Parties will meet to decide key operational details, from budgets to the makeup of various committees. Countries have been working through many of those questions at preparatory meetings, with a final session scheduled for late March. The earliest any Marine Protected Areas could actually win approval would be at the second COP, since the scientific body that will review proposals hasn\u2019t yet been established.",

      "Two new studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show wastewater monitoring of measles can flag measles spread days to weeks in advance",
      "Wastewater testing can alert public health officials to measles infections days to months before cases are confirmed by doctors, researchers said in two studies published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Colorado health officials were able to get ahead of the highly contagious virus by tracking its presence in sewer systems, researchers wrote. And Oregon researchers found wastewater could have warned them of an outbreak more than two months before the first person tested positive.",
      "The findings add to evidence that wastewater testing is a valuable weapon in tracking disease, including COVID-19, polio, mpox and bird flu.",
      "But the national wastewater surveillance system, run by CDC since 2020, is newly at risk, under a Trump administration budget plan would slash its funding from about $125 million a year to about $25 million.",
      "Peggy Honein, director of the CDC's division of infectious disease readiness and innovation, said the proposed funding level would \u201csustain some of the most critical activities\u201d but \u201cit would likely require some prioritization.\u201d",
      "The national system covers more than 1,300 wastewater treatment sites serving 147 million people. It includes six \u201ccenters for excellence\u201d \u2014 Colorado among them \u2014 that innovate and support other states in expanding their testing.",
      "The funding cut is still a proposal, and Congress has started pushing back against cuts to health care in general.",
      "But state health departments say they are preparing for a potential loss of federal support regardless. Most state programs are entirely federally funded, Honein said.",
      "Colorado started its wastewater surveillance program in 2020 with 68 utilities participating voluntarily. The program has since narrowed in its focus even as it grew to include more diseases, because it is 100% federally funded, said Allison Wheeler, manager of the Colorado\u2019s wastewater surveillance unit.",
      "The work is funded through 2029, Wheeler said, and the department is talking to state leaders about what to do after that.",
      "\u201cI know that there are other states that haven\u2019t been as fortunate as us,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThey need this funding in order to sustain their program for the next year.\u201d",
      "In the Colorado study, which Wheeler co-authored, officials started testing wastewater for measles in May, as outbreaks in Texas, New Mexico and Utah were growing and five cases had been confirmed in Colorado.",
      "In August, wastewater in Mesa County tested positive about a week before two measles cases were confirmed by a doctor. Neither patient knew that they had been exposed to measles. As they traced 225 household and health care contacts of the first two patients, health officials found five more cases.",

      "The researchers found that wastewater samples from the area were positive for measles about 10 weeks before the first cases were reported. The virus concentration in the wastewater over the weeks also matched the known peak of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cWe knew that we were missing cases, and I think that's always the case in measles outbreaks,\u201d said Dr. Melissa Sutton, of the Oregon Health Authority. \u201cBut this gave us an insight into how much silent transmission was occurring without us knowing about it and without our health care system knowing about it.\u201d",
      "Other states, such as Utah, have integrated wastewater data into their public-facing measles dashboards, allowing anyone to track outbreaks in real time.",
      "And in New Mexico, where 100 people got measles last year and one died, the testing helped state health officials shrink a vast rural expanse. The state's system flagged cases in northwestern Sandoval County while officials were focused on a massive outbreak 300 miles (483 kilometers) away in the southeast, said Kelley Plymesser, of the state health department.",
      "The early warning allowed the department to alert doctors and the public, lower thresholds for testing and refocus their resources. The outbreak ended in September. But because measles continues to spread across the Southwest, the state is still using the system to look for new cases.",

      "The reason for the reversal wasn't immediately clear, and spokespeople for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services didn't respond to requests for comment Wednesday night.",
      "The grant cancellations had pulled back funding for a wide swath of discretionary grants and represented about a quarter of SAMHSA's overall budget. They built on other, wide-ranging cuts that have been made at HHS, including the elimination of thousands of jobs and the freezing or canceling of billions of dollars for scientific research.",
      "The cuts had thrown into jeopardy programs that give direct mental health services, opioid treatment, drug prevention resources, peer support and more to communities affected by addiction, mental illness and homelessness.",
      "\u201cWithout that funding, people are going to lose access to lifesaving services,\u201d Yngvild Olsen, former director of SAMHSA\u2019s Center for Substance Abuse Treatment and a national adviser at Manatt Health, said earlier Wednesday.",
      "SAMHSA, a sub-agency of HHS, notified grant recipients that their funding would be canceled effective immediately in emailed letters on Tuesday evening, according to several copies received by organizations and reviewed by The Associated Press.",

It has raided firms suspected of colluding to secure army contracts, arrested senior officers and seized millions of ringgit in cash, luxury goods and frozen bank accounts believed tied to defence contracts.",

      "Danish veterans feel betrayed as the U.S. escalates threats to seize Greenland, a territory of Denmark",
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- More than 15 years ago, Danish platoon commander Martin Tamm Andersen was leading his countrymen and U.S. Marines through the heat and sand of southern Afghanistan after a Taliban attack.",
      "As Andersen\u2019s vehicle moved at the rear of the column, everything was normal \u2014 until in one instant the world turned sand-colored. His body shook violently. \u201cI had no idea what was going on,\u201d he recalled. He ran his hands over his arms and legs to make sure they were still there.",
      "When the dust settled, he saw one of his soldiers bleeding heavily from his face. Another had been hurled from the turret and lay on the ground, groaning in pain, his back broken in two places. The blast had torn the vehicle apart.",
      "Andersen called in help from the U.S. Marines, who halted a firefight with the Taliban, returned to secure the site, treated the wounded and helped prepare them for evacuation.",
      "At the time, American and Danish troops were comrades in arms who risked their lives for each other in common cause.",
      "Andersen can barely believe what has come of the U.S.-Danish alliance today as President Donald Trump escalates his threats to seize Greenland, a semiautonomous territory belonging to Denmark. Trump has repeatedly said the United States must take control of the strategically located and mineral-rich island, and views force as one way to get it.",

      "\u201cAs a veteran and as a Dane, you know, you feel sad and very surprised that the U.S. wants to take over part of the Kingdom of Denmark,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a betrayal of the loyalty of our nation to the U.S. and to our common alliance, NATO.\u201d",
      "He spoke from the Danish War Museum in Copenhagen, where his armored personnel carrier that hit the improvised explosive device in 2010 in Helmand Province is on display.",
      "Before his deployment to Afghanistan, Andersen had also served in Iraq. Good friends were killed and wounded in both wars. He believed his service in the U.S. wars served the cause of freedom and democracy.",
      "As the U.S. intensifies its threats to seize Greenland, that initial shock felt by many across Europe has evolved into a profound sense of sadness, betrayal and fear of what such a move could mean for Europe\u2019s security at a time of Russian aggression. Denmark\u2019s prime minster has said it would mean the end of NATO.",
      "For Danish veterans, it feels profoundly personal.",
      "A NATO member since 1949, Denmark has been a stalwart ally to America. Forty-four Danish soldiers were killed in Afghanistan, the highest per capita death toll among coalition forces. Eight more died in Iraq.",
      "\u201cIt feels surreal. It feels like it\u2019s a bad joke somehow,\u201d Andersen said. \" I mean, you can\u2019t really fathom that this is actually something that is being said out loud. It just seems too crazy.\u201d",
      "S\u00f8ren Knudsen, a Danish veteran who served twice in Afghanistan, was watching television last year when he heard U.S. Vice President JD Vance say on Fox News that Denmark was \u201cnot being a good ally.\u201d Vance was making Trump\u2019s argument that the United States needed to take more \u201dterritorial interest\u201d in Greenland for the sake of U.S. security, and accusing Denmark of \u201cnot doing its job.\"",
      "He could not believe it. In his Copenhagen home, the 65-year-old Knudsen keeps a photo of himself flanked by children in the Afghan city of Qalat. The mission, as Knudsen understood it at the time, was to help the Americans safeguard the future of Afghanistan's youth. At the end of his second tour, U.S. service members gave him an American flag as a parting gift.",

      "Iran's foreign minister has issued a direct threat against the United States, warning of retaliation if attacked",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran's foreign minister issued the most direct threat yet Wednesday against the United States after Tehran's bloody crackdown on protesters, warning the Islamic Republic will be \u201cfiring back with everything we have if we come under renewed attack.\"",
      "The comments by Abbas Araghchi, who saw his invitation to the World Economic Forum in Davos rescinded over the killings, comes as an American aircraft carrier group moves westward toward the Middle East from Asia. American fighter jets and other equipment appears to be moving in the Mideast after a major U.S. military deployment in the Caribbean saw troops seize Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Meanwhile, an Iranian Kurdish separatist group in Iraq claimed Iran targeted one of its bases in a drone and missile attack that killed at least one fighter. Iran did not immediately acknowledge the attack, which would be the first foreign operation Tehran has launched since the protests started.",
      "Araghchi made the threat in an opinion article published by The Wall Street Journal. In it, the foreign minister contended \u201cthe violent phase of the unrest lasted less than 72 hours\u201d and sought again to blame armed demonstrators for the violence. Videos that have slipped out of Iran despite an internet shutdown appear to show security forces repeatedly using live fire to target apparently unarmed protesters, something unaddressed by Araghchi.",
      "\u201cUnlike the restraint Iran showed in June 2025, our powerful armed forces have no qualms about firing back with everything we have if we come under renewed attack,\u201d Araghchi wrote, referring to the 12-day war launched by Israel on Iran in June. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a threat, but a reality I feel I need to convey explicitly, because as a diplomat and a veteran, I abhor war.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cAn all-out confrontation will certainly be ferocious and drag on far, far longer than the fantasy timelines that Israel and its proxies are trying to peddle to the White House. It will certainly engulf the wider region and have an impact on ordinary people around the globe.\u201d",
      "Araghchi's comments likely refer to Iran's short- and medium-range missiles. The Islamic Republic relied on ballistic missiles to target Israel in the war and left its stockpile of the shorter-range missiles unused, something that could be fired to target American bases and interests in the Persian Gulf. Already, there have been some restrictions on U.S. diplomats traveling to American bases in both Kuwait and Qatar.",
      "Mideast nations, particularly diplomats from Gulf Arab countries, had lobbied Trump not to attack. Last week, Iran shut its airspace, likely in anticipation of a strike.",
      "The USS Abraham Lincoln, which had been in the South China Sea in recent days, had passed through the Strait of Malacca, a key waterway connecting the South China Sea and Indian Ocean, by Tuesday, ship-tracking data showed.",
      "A U.S. Navy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the aircraft carrier and three accompanying destroyers were heading west.",
      "While naval and other defense officials stopped short of saying the carrier strike group was headed to the Middle East, its current heading and location in the Indian Ocean means it is only days away from moving into the region. Meanwhile, U.S. military images released in recent days showed F-15E Strike Eagles arriving in the Mideast and forces in the region moving a HIMARS missile system, the type used with great success by Ukraine after Russia's full-scale invasion in the country in 2022.",

      "Iranian state television, which has confirmed attacks on the group in the past, did not acknowledge the assault.",

The PAK has claimed it launched attacks in Iran as a crackdown on the demonstrations took place, something reported by semiofficial Iranian news agencies as well.",
      "The death toll from the protests has reached at least 4,519 people, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said. The agency has been accurate throughout the years on demonstrations and unrest in Iran, relying on a network of activists inside the country that confirms all reported fatalities. The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll.",
      "The death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding the 1979 revolution that brought the Islamic Republic into being. Although there have been no protests for days, there are fears the death toll could increase significantly as information gradually emerges from a country still under a government-imposed shutdown of the internet since Jan. 8.",
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that the protests had left \u201cseveral thousand\u201d people dead and blamed the United States. It was the first indication from an Iranian leader of the extent of the casualties.",
      "More than 26,300 people have been arrested, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency. Comments from officials have led to fears of some of those detained being put to death in Iran, one of the world\u2019s top executioners. That and the killing of peaceful protesters have been two red lines laid down by Trump in the tensions.",

In order to provide aid to the furry friends and other animals affected by the raging fires in Chile, the national police's canine brigade and teams of volunteers are working against the clock to provide first aid to the pets caught by flames.",

      "Inside a small van, Scalpello and other veterinarians are treating cats, dogs and other animals in a makeshift clinic. Almost all of them arrive with burned whiskers and paws, thirsty or suffering from conjunctivitis \u2014 caused by the toxic fumes \u2014 after spending days under the debris of what once were houses, vehicles or schools.",
      "The small town of Lirqu\u00e9n in south-central Chile was ground zero for the devastating fires that have been burning for days. With around 20,000 inhabitants, the fire consumed 80% of the city. Nationwide, the fires have left at least 20 dead and nearly 300 injured, official data shows.",
      "Many of the furry patients treated in the mobile unit were found in the aftermath of the deadly fires.",
      "\u201cWe usually find cats that were sheltering in small corners and that survived both the fire and the days that followed,\u201d said veterinarian Juan Vivanco, who also works in the unit.",
      "Although the blaze is for now under control in Lirqu\u00e9n, the strong smell of burning and fine ash dust still cover its narrow streets. While the town assesses the damage and debris removal efforts continue, more animals are expected to be rescued in the coming days, according to Vivanco.",
      "But the longer they wait, the less likely they are to survive. \u201cWe\u2019ve also found several pets already deceased\u2026 it happens regularly,\u201d he said.",

      "TOKYO -- A Japanese court sentenced a man who admitted assassinating former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to life imprisonment on Wednesday. The case has revealed decades of cozy ties between Japan\u2019s governing party and a controversial South Korean church.",
      "Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, earlier pleaded guilty to killing Abe in July 2022 during his election campaign speech in the western city of Nara.",
      "Abe, one of Japan\u2019s most influential politicians, was serving as a regular lawmaker after leaving the prime minister's job when he was killed in 2022 while campaigning in the western city of Nara. It shocked a nation with strict gun control.",
      "Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, pleaded guilty to murder in the trial that started in October. The Nara District Court announced Wednesday that it had issued a guilty verdict and sentenced Yamagami to life in prison, as prosecutors requested.",
      "Yamagami said he killed Abe after seeing a video message the former leader sent to a group affiliated with the Unification Church. He added that his goal was to hurt the church, which he hated, and expose its ties with Abe, investigators have said.",
      "Prosecutors demanded life imprisonment for Yamagami, while his lawyers sought a sentence of no more than 20 years, citing his troubles as the child of a church adherent. Japanese law authorizes the death penalty in murder cases, but prosecutors do not usually request it unless at least two people are killed.",
      "The revelation of close ties between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the church caused the party to pull back from the church. It also prompted investigations that ended with a court decision that stripped the church's Japanese branch of its tax-exempt religious status and ordered it dissolved. The church has since appealed, pending a decision.",

      "A national security trial for former organizers of Hong Kong\u2019s Tiananmen Square vigil opens Thursday",
      "HONG KONG -- Two former leaders of a Hong Kong pro-democracy group that for decades organized a vigil commemorating people killed during Beijing\u2019s 1989 Tiananmen crackdown are set to stand trial in a case brought under a national security law that has all but silenced dissent in the city.",
      "A third co-defendant is expected to plead guilty at Thursday's hearing.",
      "Observers say the disappearance of the only large-scale public commemoration of the 1989 crackdown within China is part of a decline in Western-style civil liberties, which Beijing promised to maintain for 50 years when it took control of the former British colony in 1997.",
      "The government said its law enforcement actions were evidence-based and strictly in accordance with the law.",
      "Chow Hang-tung, Lee Cheuk-yan and Albert Ho, former leaders of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, were charged with incitement to subversion in September 2021 under a law imposed by China following massive anti-government protests in 2019.",
      "The Hong Kong Alliance voted to disband weeks after its leaders were charged under the law.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the case:",
      "The 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, led by students, posed one of the most significant challenges to the Communist Party\u2019s rule in China. They ended after the Chinese government sent tanks into Beijing, with troops opening fire in a bloody crackdown that killed hundreds, possibly thousands.",
      "The crackdown has long been a taboo topic in mainland China, but for 30 years the alliance held annual vigils in Hong Kong. The gathering drew tens of thousands to commemorate the victims with a sea of candles until authorities banned it during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt was a group that aimed to seek justice,\u201d former alliance member Tang Ngok-kwan told The Associated Press in early January. Tang, who was a senior member of the group, was charged alongside Chow in another case related to the group.",
      "Tang said he felt a moral burden about the deaths, because he thought the city\u2019s financial support for the movement may have fueled the demonstrators\u2019 conflict with authorities.",
      "Some young people stayed away from the vigil during a rise in localism in the 2010s, deeming the alliance\u2019s goal of building a democratic China irrelevant to Hong Kong. But the last vigil in 2019 drew an estimated 180,000 people days before the city erupted in monthslong protests.",
      "After the pandemic, the former vigil site hosted a carnival showcasing Chinese food and products during the anniversary of the crackdown. Some residents who commemorated the event nearby were detained.",
      "The alliance was one of dozens of civil society groups disbanded during a crackdown that started when Beijing imposed a National Security Law to quell protests.",
      "Other people affected include former pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai, who was convicted of conspiring with others to collude with foreign forces in December and faces up to life in prison.",
      "The Hong Kong Alliance came under increasing pressure in 2021 after police opened an investigation, saying they had reasonable grounds to believe the group was acting as a foreign agent. The group rejected the allegations and refused to cooperate. Chow, Ho and Lee were charged in September 2021, and later that month the alliance\u2019s members voted to disband.",

      "New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has announced a national election will be held Nov. 7",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand will hold a national election on Nov. 7, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon announced Wednesday.",
      "Luxon, the leader of a center-right government, will seek a second term in office, with the election likely to be a ballot on whether his pledges to improve the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic have gained enough traction to convince voters still struggling with living and housing costs. The main center-left opposition Labour Party, lead by Chris Hipkins, has regained support since its poor showing in the previous 2023 election and analysts forecast a tight race.",
      "New Zealand elections are held every three years with the government selecting the exact date. Voters choose which party they prefer to see in government and also select a local candidate to represent their constituency in Parliament.",
      "The country of 5 million people has a unicameral parliament, which means governments are powerful deciders of how the country operates. The National Party and Labour usually must form coalitions with smaller parties to hold a majority in parliament, giving the minor parties unusual sway in which major party leads.",
      "Announcing the election date at a retreat for his party\u2019s lawmakers in the city of Christchurch on Wednesday, Luxon underlined what he said was his party\u2019s track record on working to rebuild a post-pandemic economy. Days earlier in a speech to a business audience in Auckland on Monday, he acknowledged that reversing the country\u2019s fortunes had not been simple and that many New Zealanders have endured \u201ctwo years of hard grind.\u201d",
      "The economy has contracted a further 0.5 percentage point in the most recently measured 12 months, and migration to neighboring, wealthier Australia has at times hit record highs during Luxon\u2019s tenure. Luxon on Monday blamed the former Labour-led government for the country\u2019s woes, saying he had \u201cinherited a mess.\u201d",
      "Analysts said that with inflation trending down and business confidence beginning to grow, Luxon will hope the months until this year\u2019s election will be long enough to convince New Zealanders that the economic reversal he pledged in 2023 is taking root.",
      "Hipkins, his main challenger to lead the country, on Monday dismissed Luxon\u2019s remarks as \u201ca whole lot of management-speak mumbo-jumbo.\u201d The opposition leader added that Luxon hadn\u2019t delivered on political promises he had made, including making housing more affordable in what has been one of the world\u2019s hottest markets and ensuring access to public health care for all.",
      "Paying for the country\u2019s ailing infrastructure and how to fund pensions will also be central economic issues. Luxon decries Labour\u2019s approach as one reliant on accruing national debt, while Hipkins said Monday that National had squandered money on unaffordable tax cuts.",
      "An unusual quirk of the election is that the premiership will once again be contested by two men named Christopher, as it was in 2023. Luxon, 55, is still a relative newcomer to politics, making a rapid ascent to National party leader in 2021 after entering parliament as a constituency lawmaker at the 2020 election.",
      "The millionaire former business executive was the head of the national carrier Air New Zealand before turning to politics and previously worked as an executive for Unilever when he lived in the United States. Luxon pledged to bring managerial experience, but his detractors highlight his political inexperience and say his wealth means he is out of touch with ordinary New Zealanders.",

      "Labour was already flagging in the polls and Hipkins was unable to reverse the party\u2019s fortunes, with a dismal result ushering in Luxon\u2019s center-right government. Critics of Hipkins on the left decry him for being too timid, while those on the right often seek to remind voters of his role in Ardern\u2019s government as its strict COVID-19 lockdowns lost public confidence in some parts of the country.",
      "Under New Zealand\u2019s proportional voting system, political parties must generally form alliances to govern. That makes the votes won by smaller parties crucial to the outcome. Following the election, whichever major party holds the most votes begins negotiations with their traditional governing parties, with minor party leaders sometimes extracting steep policy concessions to secure their support.",
      "Luxon\u2019s government was formed with the libertarian ACT party and populist New Zealand First. Winston Peters, the leader of New Zealand First and current foreign minister, is New Zealand\u2019s longest-serving current lawmaker and has crowned both National and Labour governments before \u2014 but has animosity with Labour and Hipkins after their last period in government together.",
      "On the left, Hipkins would seek support from the left-leaning Green party and Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori, a minor party which contests seats reserved for Indigenous lawmakers. The M\u0101ori party too has sided with both National and Labour governments before, but has supported Labour more recently.",
      "It is rare for New Zealand governments to survive only one term. The last time a government was voted out after a single three-year cycle was in 1975.",

      "Last week, Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke with Trump, telling him that U.S. intervention in Mexico was \u201cnot necessary,\u201d but emphasizing that the two governments would continue to collaborate.",

      "Rescuers reached some of the most badly damaged sections in the multistory Gul Plaza in Karachi, the capital of southern Sindh province, but those areas either have collapsed or been severely weakened since the blaze Saturday. The reasons remain unclear, officials said.",
      "Police and hospital officials said rescuers have so far recovered the remains of at least 23 people, many burned beyond recognition. In several cases, only body parts were found and DNA testing is underway to identify the victims, according to police surgeon Dr. Summaiya Syed.",
      "The sprawling shopping plaza houses about 1,200 shops, most selling imported clothing, cosmetics and plastic household goods. Dozens of the missing were shop owners and customers.",
      "More than 65 people were reported missing and mobile phone data showed at least 31 were inside the plaza on the night of the fire, senior police official Asad Raza said. Authorities believe others reported missing may not have been carrying cellphones, Raza said.",

    "story": [
      "If practicality, fuel economy, and premium amenities are all high on the list of priorities for your next vehicle purchase, a luxury plug-in hybrid sport-utility vehicle might be just what you\u2019re looking for",
      "The BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLE are two popular midsize luxury SUVs that offer the latest in luxury, space and technology. Of course, neither vehicle is aimed at the cost-conscious car shopper, but this is a situation where you do get what you pay for. They\u2019re also notable because they\u2019re among just a few luxury SUVs available with a plug-in hybrid powertrain.",
      "Getting an X5 or a GLE with a plug-in hybrid might be just what you\u2019re looking for if you\u2019re looking to use less gas. These plug-in hybrids have hybrid batteries you can charge with a cord, enabling you to drive short distances on all-electric power. After that, they have a regular gas engine that\u2019s ready to go when the battery runs low. If you make a lot of drives that are less than 40 miles, and can frequently charge up the hybrid battery at home, you can save a lot on gas with these plug-in hybrids.",
      "It\u2019s an appealing proposition. But which plug-in hybrid, the BMW X5 xDrive50e or Mercedes-Benz GLE 450e, is the better buy? Edmunds\u2019 auto experts tested them both to find out.",
      "Interior comfort is one of the GLE 450e\u2019s greatest strengths. Its spacious and classy-looking cabin provides lots of room for occupants in both rows. Seat heating, ventilation and massage functions combined with an excellent climate control system make for a truly relaxing drive. The back seat also offers ample room to accommodate bulky child safety seats, and the anchor points are conveniently located.",
      "The X5 has a similarly roomy interior that offers vault-like isolation from the outside world. Premium materials, near infinite seat adjustability, and LED ambient lighting add to the decidedly upscale vibe. The climate controls and other in-car functions can be frustrating to use, however, because many are buried in the touchscreen display\u2019s labyrinth of menus. We also found it more challenging to install child safety seats in the X5 because the anchor points are more difficult to access.",
      "Winner: Mercedes-Benz GLE 450e",
      "When the battery is charged up, the Mercedes-Benz GLE 450e mainly stays in electric mode, only firing up its gas engine when the driver asks for all of the vehicle\u2019s available power. When the engine does kick in, the transition feels seamless from behind the wheel. At Edmunds\u2019 test track, the GLE 450e accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 5.7 seconds. Light steering makes the GLE 450e easy to maneuver in tight spots, but at higher speeds, it\u2019s not quite as planted as other versions of the GLE.",
      "The BMW X5 xDrive50e\u2019s hybrid system feels just as refined as the GLE\u2019s, but the BMW is noticeably sportier overall. The X5\u2019s powertrain generates gobs of power that push it to 60 mph in a brief 4.6 seconds. The X5 also feels more stable and secure around corners and along curvy roads.",
      "Winner: BMW X5 xDrive50e",
      "Sharp graphics and snappy response make the X5\u2019s infotainment system pleasant to use, but the menu layout can be difficult to navigate. Thankfully, BMW\u2019s voice controls are among the best in the industry, so commonly used functions, like changing the temperature of the air conditioning, can be performed without taking your eyes off the road.",
      "The GLE 450e\u2019s infotainment system also boasts high-resolution graphics and lightning-quick response times, but Mercedes-Benz has gone a step further with some genuinely impressive features that BMW doesn\u2019t offer. For example, an available augmented reality feature for the navigation system makes turn-by-turn directions easier to follow in the GLE by overlaying live video from the front camera with digital graphics like arrows and street names onto the central display.",

      "Both the Mercedes and BMW boast impeccable fit and finish as well as a four-year/50,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty. BMW sweetens the deal with three years of complimentary maintenance, but the GLE 450e wins back some points with efficiency. It is capable of an EPA-estimated 50 miles of all-electric range and then 23 mpg in combined city/highway driving when the battery is depleted. The X5 xDrive50e comes up a bit short with its estimated 38 miles of electric range and 22 mpg combined.",
      "Winner: tie",
      "The 2026 BMW X5 xDrive50e and 2026 Mercedes-Benz GLE 450e are both impressive luxury SUVs that offer plug-in hybrid power and efficiency. You might prefer the X5 if sporty driving is a priority, but otherwise the GLE is the better option due to its more serene comfort and exceptional build quality and easier-to-use technology.",

      "Iran's foreign minister has issued a direct threat against the United States, warning of retaliation if attacked",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran's foreign minister issued the most direct threat yet Wednesday against the United States after Tehran's bloody crackdown on protesters, warning the Islamic Republic will be \u201cfiring back with everything we have if we come under renewed attack.\"",
      "The comments by Abbas Araghchi, who saw his invitation to the World Economic Forum in Davos rescinded over the killings, comes as an American aircraft carrier group moves westward toward the Middle East from Asia. American fighter jets and other equipment appears to be moving in the Mideast after a major U.S. military deployment in the Caribbean saw troops seize Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Meanwhile, an Iranian Kurdish separatist group in Iraq claimed Iran targeted one of its bases in a drone and missile attack that killed at least one fighter. Iran did not immediately acknowledge the attack, which would be the first foreign operation Tehran has launched since the protests started.",
      "Araghchi made the threat in an opinion article published by The Wall Street Journal. In it, the foreign minister contended \u201cthe violent phase of the unrest lasted less than 72 hours\u201d and sought again to blame armed demonstrators for the violence. Videos that have slipped out of Iran despite an internet shutdown appear to show security forces repeatedly using live fire to target apparently unarmed protesters, something unaddressed by Araghchi.",
      "\u201cUnlike the restraint Iran showed in June 2025, our powerful armed forces have no qualms about firing back with everything we have if we come under renewed attack,\u201d Araghchi wrote, referring to the 12-day war launched by Israel on Iran in June. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a threat, but a reality I feel I need to convey explicitly, because as a diplomat and a veteran, I abhor war.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cAn all-out confrontation will certainly be ferocious and drag on far, far longer than the fantasy timelines that Israel and its proxies are trying to peddle to the White House. It will certainly engulf the wider region and have an impact on ordinary people around the globe.\u201d",
      "Araghchi's comments likely refer to Iran's short- and medium-range missiles. The Islamic Republic relied on ballistic missiles to target Israel in the war and left its stockpile of the shorter-range missiles unused, something that could be fired to target American bases and interests in the Persian Gulf. Already, there have been some restrictions on U.S. diplomats traveling to American bases in both Kuwait and Qatar.",

      "A U.S. Navy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the aircraft carrier and three accompanying destroyers were heading west.",
      "While naval and other defense officials stopped short of saying the carrier strike group was headed to the Middle East, its current heading and location in the Indian Ocean means it is only days away from moving into the region. Meanwhile, U.S. military images released in recent days showed F-15E Strike Eagles arriving in the Mideast and forces in the region moving a HIMARS missile system, the type used with great success by Ukraine after Russia's full-scale invasion in the country in 2022.",

The PAK has claimed it launched attacks in Iran as a crackdown on the demonstrations took place, something reported by semiofficial Iranian news agencies as well.",
      "The death toll from the protests has reached at least 4,519 people, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said. The agency has been accurate throughout the years on demonstrations and unrest in Iran, relying on a network of activists inside the country that confirms all reported fatalities. The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll.",
      "The death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding the 1979 revolution that brought the Islamic Republic into being. Although there have been no protests for days, there are fears the death toll could increase significantly as information gradually emerges from a country still under a government-imposed shutdown of the internet since Jan. 8.",
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that the protests had left \u201cseveral thousand\u201d people dead and blamed the United States. It was the first indication from an Iranian leader of the extent of the casualties.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Warren Buffett's successor appears to be considering his first significant move after taking over as CEO this month.",
      "Kraft Heinz warned investors Tuesday that Berkshire Hathaway may be interested in selling its 325 million shares in the name brand food giant that Buffett helped create back in 2015. The news came in a filing with stock market regulators.",
      "Buffett and the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital orchestrated the merger of Kraft and Heinz back then because they already owned Heinz and believed in the power of their brands. Now Greg Abel may be plotting a different course.",
      "Over the years since Buffett had come to realize that the company's competitive moat around its brands wasn't as strong as he thought as consumers have increasingly been willing to switch to store brands and move away from processed foods. Berkshire took a $3.76 billion writedown on its Kraft-Heinz stake last summer. Buffett said last fall that he was disappointed in Kraft Heinz' plan to split the company in two, and Berkshire's two representatives resigned from the Kraft board last spring.",
      "But still it was rare for Buffett to unload an acquisition during his six decades leading Berkshire even when he soured on a business' prospects. Berkshire didn't respond to questions Tuesday about the filing where Kraft Heinz disclosed that its largest shareholder \u201cmay offer to sell, from time to time, 325,442,152 shares.\u201d Kraft Heinz shares fell nearly 4% to $22.85 after the announcement.",
      "There's no sign Berkshire has started selling yet, but CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert wonders if this could be just the beginning of a comprehensive review of Berkshire's varied holdings. In addition to its massive stock portfolio worth over $300 billion, Berkshire owns an assortment of insurers including Geico, several utilities, BNSF railroad and an eclectic mix of manufacturing and retail companies.",

      "\u201cMy sense is that Greg Abel\u2019s leadership style may be a departure from Buffett\u2019s, and this sale, if completed, would represent a shift in corporate mindset,\u201d Seifert said. \"Berkshire under Buffett typically only made acquisitions- not divestitures. It's not inconceivable, in our view, that Abel may likely assess every Berkshire subsidiary and decide to jettison those that do not meet his internal hurdles.\u201c",
      "Of course Abel already knows many of Berkshire's companies well because he has been managing all of the non-insurance companies since 2018. But he only became CEO on Jan. 1. Buffett remains chairman, but investors are watching closely for any changes Abel might make at the venerable conglomerate.",
      "Investor Chris Ballard, who is managing director at Check Capital, said \u201cselling Kraft is probably the most low-hanging fruit for Greg. We personally wouldn't be sad to see the holding go.\u201d",
      "But of course it would be bard for Berkshire to unload all of its shares on the public market because it is such a large stake, so Ballard said he wonders if there could be a large prospective buyer in the wings.",

      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Valentino Garavani\u2019s death cast a long shadow over the opening day of Paris Fashion Week menswear Tuesday, with front-row guests and industry figures mourning the passing of one of the last towering names of 20th-century couture \u2014 an Italian designer whose working life was closely entwined with the Paris runways.",
      "Valentino, 93, died at his Rome residence, the Valentino Garavani and Giancarlo Giammetti Foundation said in a statement announcing his death. While he built his house in Rome, he spent decades presenting collections in France.",
      "He \u201cwas one of the last big couturiers who really embodied what was fashion in the 20th century,\u201d said Pierre Groppo, fashion editor-in-chief at Vanity Fair France.",
      "On a day meant to sell the future, many guests said they were thinking about what fashion has lost: the couturier as a living institution.",
      "Groppo pointed to the codes that made Valentino instantly legible \u2014 \u201cthe dots, the ruffles, the knots\u201d \u2014 and to a generation of designers who, he said, \u201cin a way, invented what is celebrity culture.\u201d",
      "Valentino\u2019s vision was built on a simple idea: make women look luminous, then make the moment unforgettable.",
      "He dressed Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Elizabeth Taylor, among others, fixed his signature \u201cValentino red\u201d in the public imagination, and \u2014 through his decades-long partnership with Giancarlo Giammetti \u2014 helped turn the designer himself into part of the spectacle, as recognizable as the clients in his front row.",
      "Prominent fashion writer Luke Leitch framed the loss in similarly outsized terms, calling Valentino \u201cthe last of the fashion \u2018leviathans of that generation\u2019,\u201d and saying it was \u201cabsolutely\u201d the end of a certain class of designer: figures whose names could carry a global house, and whose authority came not from viral speed but from permanence.",
      "Trained in Paris before founding his maison in Rome, Valentino became a rare bridge figure: Italian by origin, but fluent in the rituals that made Paris couture an institution. His career moved between those two capitals of elegance, bringing Roman grandeur into a system that still treats fashion not only as commerce, but as ceremony.",
      "Even as he aged, the house\u2019s founder kept turning up at its couture and ready-to-wear shows, as observed by one Associated Press journalist \u2014 until he eventually retreated from public life, all the while radiating quiet grandeur from his front-row seat.",
      "For some in Paris on Tuesday, the loss felt personal precisely because Valentino\u2019s world was never only Italian.",
      "Groppo recalled the designer as \u201cvery much more than a fashion brand,\u201d adding: \u201cIt was a lifestyle.\u201d",
      "That lifestyle \u2014 couture polish, social glamour, and the conviction that elegance could be a form of power \u2014 remains a reference point even as fashion accelerates toward louder branding and faster cycles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite sad as he\u2019s so important to the fashion industry, and he contributed a lot and I cannot forget the stunning red he created,\u201d said Lolo Zhang, a Chinese fashion influencer attending Louis Vuitton \u2019s show in Paris.",
      "\u201cHe always celebrated pure beauty, and architecture for the silhouette, and how he used color. The old era just passed by.\u201d",
      "Other guests described a delayed realization \u2014 the kind that arrives only when a figure who seemed permanent is suddenly gone.",

      "The Sagitta is a Liberian-flagged tanker and its registration says it is owned and managed by a company in Hong Kong. The ship last transmitted its location more than two months ago when exiting the Baltic Sea in northern Europe.",
      "The tanker was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department under an executive order related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "The post from U.S. Southern Command indicated the ship had taken oil from Venezuela. It said the capture of the tanker \u201cdemonstrates our resolve to ensure that the only oil leaving Venezuela will be oil that is coordinated properly and lawfully.\u201d",
      "The military command posted what appeared to be aerial footage of the Sagitta sailing on the ocean, but unlike in prior videos the clip did not show U.S. forces flying toward it in helicopters or landing on the deck of the ship.",
      "Since the U.S. ouster of Venezuela President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a surprise nighttime raid on Jan. 3, the Trump administration has set out to control the production, refining and global distribution of Venezuela\u2019s oil products.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump's unprecedented bid to reshape the Federal Reserve board is putting the Supreme Court in a familiar position, weighing an emergency appeal from the president\u2019s lawyers in a politically charged case.",
      "The court is hearing arguments Wednesday over Trump's effort to oust Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook based on allegations she committed mortgage fraud, which she denies.",
      "No president has fired a sitting Fed governor in the agency\u2019s 112-year history.",
      "The true motivation, Trump's critics say, is the Republican president's desire to wrest control of U.S. interest rate policy. Trump wants interest rates to fall sharply so the government can borrow more cheaply and Americans can pay lower borrowing costs for new homes, cars or other large purchases, as worries about high costs have soured some voters on his economic management.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the board cut a key interest rate three times in a row in the last four months of 2025, but that's more slowly than Trump wants. The Fed also suggested it may leave rates unchanged in coming months, concerned about triggering higher inflation.",
      "Powell is expected to be in attendance when the justices take up an emergency plea from the Trump administration to be allowed to remove Cook from her job while her challenge to the firing plays out in court. Judges on lower courts have allowed her to remain in her post as one of seven central bank governors.",
      "If Trump could name someone to take Cook's place, he would have four of his appointees on the seven-member board. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed\u2019s governing board, was appointed in 2022 by President Joe Biden, a Democrat.",
      "The justices are being asked to effectively bless Trump's effort to undermine the Fed's independence, said Columbia University law professor Lev Menand, who has joined a brief in support of Cook.",
      "\u201cThis case is about much more than Cook,\u201d Menand said. \u201cIt\u2019s about whether President Trump will be able to take over the Federal Reserve board in the coming months.\u201d",
      "The threat to the Fed's independence spurred Powell\u2019s three living predecessors, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, to weigh in on Cook\u2019s behalf. They were joined by five former Treasury secretaries appointed by presidents of both political parties and other former high-ranking economic officials.",
      "In their filing, lawyers for the former officials wrote that immediately ousting Cook \u201cwould expose the Federal Reserve to political influences, thereby eroding public confidence in the Fed\u2019s independence and jeopardizing the credibility and efficacy of U.S. monetary policy.\u201d",
      "Economists warn that a politicized Fed that caves in to the president\u2019s demands will damage its credibility as an inflation fighter and likely lead investors to demand higher rates before investing in U.S. treasuries.",
      "With Cook's case under review at the high court, Trump dramatically escalated his confrontation with the Fed. The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation of Powell and has served the central bank with subpoenas.",
      "Powell himself took the rare step of responding to Trump, calling the threat of criminal charges \u201cpretexts\u201d that mask the real reason, Trump's frustration over interest rates. The Justice Department has said the dispute is ostensibly about Powell\u2019s testimony to Congress in June over the cost of a massive renovation of Fed buildings.",
      "In Trump's first year in office, the justices generally, but not always, went along with Trump's pleas for emergency action to counteract lower-court rulings against him, including allowing the firings of the heads of other governmental agencies at the president's discretion, with no claim that they did anything wrong.",
      "But the court has sent signals that it is approaching the independence of the nation's central bank more cautiously, calling the Fed \u201ca uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\u201d",

      "The case against Cook stems from allegations she claimed two properties, in Michigan and Georgia, as \u201cprimary residences\u201d in June and July 2021, before she joined the Fed board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home.",
      "Cook has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. \u201cThere is no fraud, no intent to deceive, nothing whatsoever criminal or remotely a basis to allege mortgage fraud,\u201d a Cook lawyer, Abbe Lowell, wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi in November.",
      "Cook specified that her Atlanta condo would be a \u201cvacation home,\u201d according to a loan estimate she obtained in May 2021. In a form seeking a security clearance, she described it as a \u201c2nd home.\u201d Lowell wrote that the case against her largely rests on \u201cone stray reference\u201d in a 2021 mortgage document that was \u201cplainly innocuous in light of the several other truthful and more specific disclosures\u201d about the homes she has purchased.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the Trump administration had not satisfied a legal requirement that Fed governors can only be fired \u201cfor cause,\u201d which she said was limited to misconduct while in office.",
      "Cobb also held that Trump\u2019s firing would have deprived Cook of her due process, or legal right, to contest the firing.",
      "By a 2-1 vote, a panel of the federal appeals court in Washington rejected the Trump administration\u2019s request to let Cook\u2019s firing proceed.",
      "At the Supreme Court, the administration argues Cook has no right to a hearing and courts have no role to play in reviewing Trump's actions.",
      "Trump lawfully fired Cook, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote, \u201cafter concluding that the American people should not have their interest rates determined by someone who made misrepresentations material to her mortgage rates that appear to have been grossly negligent at best and fraudulent at worst.\u201d",
      "Sauer will face off against Paul Clement, a conservative lawyer who served in Sauer's role under President George W. Bush and has argued for expanding gun rights, against same-sex marriage and for striking down the Affordable Care Act. Both men once worked as law clerks for Justice Antonin Scalia.",
      "Cook's fate should not be determined by \u201cuntested allegations\u201d or \u201cbefore any facts are found,\u201d her lawyers told the court. She should be able to remain in her job at least while her case proceeds, they wrote.",

      "The \"Be The People\" campaign aspires to change the perception that the U.S. is hopelessly divided and that individuals have little power to overcome problems like poverty, addiction, violence and stalled economic mobility. It also wants to move people take action to solve those problems.",
      "Brian Hooks, chairman and CEO of the nonprofit network Stand Together, said the 250th anniversary is a unique moment \u201cto show people that they matter, that they have a part to play, and that the future is unwritten, but it depends on each one of us stepping up to play our part.\u201d",
      "Funded by a mix of 50 philanthropic foundations and individual donors, Be The People builds on research that indicates many people want to contribute to their communities but don't know how. The initiative has raised more than $200 million for its first year's budget.",
      "Founding members range from nonprofits \u2014 including GivingTuesday, Goodwill Industries and Habitat for Humanity, businesses like Ron Howard's Imagine Entertainment and the National Basketball Association, to funders like the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.",
      "Hooks said this is a 10-year commitment toward trying to achieve what would be a profound shift in behavior and culture. He referenced a 2024 Pew Research Center survey that found most Americans in 2023 and 2024 did not believe that the U.S. could solve its most important problems, saying it was a \u201cred alert\u201d for the country.",
      "Hooks said the initiative envisions actions far beyond volunteering or service that people could do in their free time. He pointed to a role for businesses and schools and said the initiative would launch a major data collection effort to track whether people are actually more engaged and whether problems are actually getting solved.",
      "Stand Together, which was founded by the billionaire Charles Koch, works across a broad range of issues and communities in the U.S. and has carved out a role for itself as a convener that can bring coalitions together across ideological lines.",
      "\u201cBe The People,\u201d will not incorporate as a new nonprofit, but act more like a banner for groups to organize under and use to connect to resources. As an example, at the Atlanta Hawks game on Monday, Martin Luther King III and his wife, Arndrea Waters King, linked a program they launched last year, Realize the Dream, which aims to increase acts of service, to the new campaign.",
      "\u201cOur vision is that \u2018Be The People\u2019 helps lift up what is already happening in communities across the country and reminds people that service and shared responsibility are defining parts of the American story,\u201d the Kings said in a written statement.",
      "\u201cBe The People,\u201d will operate similarly to the nonprofit GivingTuesday. While it started as a hashtag to encourage people to donate to nonprofits on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, GivingTuesday has grown into a platform that provides nonprofits with tools, like fundraising kits and advice on how to reach and mobilize their supporters. Nonprofits can participate however they like but gain some momentum by acting alongside many other groups.",

      "BEIJING -- China's one-child policy, one of the harshest attempts at population control the world has seen, forced abortions on women, made sterilization widespread and led to baby daughters being sold or even killed, because parents wanted their only child to be a male.",
      "Now, experts say, the question is whether it was all necessary. China's birth rate fell to record lows last year and its population has fallen for four years in a row, official statistics showed this week. Authorities, alarmed by the prospect of a shrinking workforce and an aging population, scrapped the policy in 2015.",

      "The birth rate had begun to fall in the 1970s after the government began encouraging people to have fewer children. It's unclear how much its fall since then resulted from the one-child policy and to what degree it would have happened anyway because of the tremendous economic and societal changes over the last four decades.",

      "Authorities shut down internet access on Jan. 8 as nationwide protests led to a brutal crackdown that activists say has killed over 4,500 people, with more feared dead. Since then, there has been minimal access to the outside world, with connectivity in recent days restored only for some domestic websites. Google also began partially functioning as a search engine, with most search results inaccessible.",

She cited a separate estimate suggesting internet disruptions around the 2022 Mahsa Amini protests cost the Iranian economy $1.6 billion.",

      "The British government is defending its decision to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the move",
      "LONDON -- A startled British government on Tuesday defended its decision to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, after U.S. President Donald Trump attacked the plan, which his administration had previously supported.",
      "Trump said that relinquishing the remote Indian Ocean archipelago, home to a strategically important American naval and bomber base, was an act of stupidity that shows why he needs to take over Greenland.",
      "\u201cShockingly, our \u2018brilliant\u2019 NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,\" he said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. \"There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness.\"",
      "\u201cThe UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The blast from Trump was a rebuff to efforts by Prime Minister Keir Starmer to calm tensions over Greenland and patch up a frayed trans-Atlantic relationship. Starmer on Monday called Trump's statements about taking over Greenland \u201ccompletely wrong,\u201d but called for the rift to be \u201cresolved through calm discussion.\u201d",
      "The United Kingdom and Mauritius signed a deal in May to give Mauritius sovereignty over the Chago Islands after two centuries under British control, though the U.K. will lease back Diego Garcia where the U.S. base is located, for at least 99 years.",
      "The U.S. government welcomed the agreement at the time, saying it \u201csecures the long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint U.S.-U.K. military facility at Diego Garcia.\u201d",
      "U.K. Cabinet Minister Darren Jones said Tuesday that the agreement would \u201csecure that military base for the next 100 years.\u201d",
      "In recent years, the United Nations and its top court have urged Britain to return the islands to Mauritius, and the British government says it's acting to protect the security of the base from international legal challenge.",
      "A government spokesperson said that \u201cthe U.K. will never compromise on our national security,\u201d and \u201cthis deal secures the operations of the joint U.S.-U.K. base on Diego Garcia for generations, with robust provisions for keeping its unique capabilities intact and our adversaries out.\u201d",
      "But the deal has met strong opposition from British opposition parties, which say that giving up the islands puts them at risk of interference by China and Russia.",

It's due back in the Commons on Tuesday for further debate.",
      "Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticized Starmer's Labour Party government over the agreement.",
      "Badenoch said in an X post that Trump is right and that Starmer's \u201cplan to give away the Chagos Islands is a terrible policy that weakens UK security and hands away our sovereign territory. And to top it off, makes us and our NATO allies weaker in the face of our enemies.\u201d",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, an ally of the president said: \u201cThank goodness Trump has vetoed the surrender of the Chagos islands.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has described the Diego Garcia base, which is home to about 2,500 mostly American personnel, as \u201can all but indispensable platform\u201d for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia and East Africa.",
      "The Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814, when they were ceded by France. Britain split the islands away from Mauritius, a former British colony, in 1965, and evicted as many as 2,000 people from the islands so the U.S. military could build the Diego Garcia base.",
      "An estimated 10,000 displaced Chagossians and their descendants now live primarily in Britain, Mauritius and the Seychelles. Some have fought unsuccessfully in U.K. courts for many years for the right to go home.",
      "The U.K.-Mauritius deal calls for a resettlement fund to be created for displaced islanders to help them move back to the islands \u2014 apart from Diego Garcia.",

      "On the anniversary of his inauguration, President Donald Trump is heading to the World Economic Forum in Davos, an annual gathering of the global elite",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump plans to use a key address Wednesday to try to convince Americans he can make housing more affordable, but he's picked a strange backdrop for the speech: a Swiss mountain town where ski chalets for vacations cost a cool $4.4 million.",
      "On the anniversary of his inauguration, Trump is flying to the World Economic Forum in Davos \u2014 an annual gathering of the global elite \u2014 where he may see many of the billionaires he has surrounded himself with during his first year back in the White House.",
      "Trump had campaigned on lowering the cost of living, painting himself as a populist while serving fries at a McDonald's drive-thru. But in office, his public schedules suggest he's traded the Golden Arches for a gilded age, devoting more time to cavorting with the wealthy than talking directly to his working-class base.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s the investors and billionaires at Davos who have his attention, not the families struggling to afford their bills,\u201d said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal think tank.",

He is now bent on acquiring Greenland to the chagrin of European allies \u2014 a headline likely to dominate his time in Davos, overshadowing his housing ideas.",

      "The White House has tried to shift Trump's focus to affordability issues, a response to warning signs in the polls in a year where control of Congress is at stake in midterm elections.",
      "About six in 10 U.S. adults now say that Trump has hurt the cost of living, according to the latest survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. It's an issue even among Republicans, who have said Trump's work on the economy hasn't lived up to their expectations. Only 16% say Trump has helped \u201ca lot\u201d on making things more affordable, down from 49% in April 2024, when an AP-NORC poll asked Americans the same question about his first term.",
      "The president is banking on investment commitments from billionaires and foreign nations to create a jobs boom, even as his broad tariffs have crimped the labor market and spurred inflation. Trump supporters who attend his rallies \u2014 which the president resumed last month \u2014 are left to trust that Trump\u2019s business ties can eventually help them.",
      "This strategy carries political risks. Voters are more interested in the economy they\u2019re experiencing in their own lives than in Trump\u2019s relationships with billionaires, said Frank Luntz, the Republican-affiliated pollster and strategist.",

      "The magnitude of those gains dwarfs what the bottom 50% of households \u2014 the majority of the country \u2014 received during the same period. Their net worth rose by $2.94 trillion, roughly one-fourth what the top 0.1% got.",
      "One of the biggest concerns for voters is the cost of housing. In recent weeks, Trump has floated proposals like reducing interest rates on home loans by buying $200 billion in mortgage debt and banning large financial companies from buying homes. Yet those efforts would do little to address the core problem in the housing market: a multi-year shortfall in home construction and home prices that have generally risen faster than wages.",

      "Trump takes phone calls from billionaires and CEOs to chat about business, politics and interests such as his planned White House ballroom. He regularly peppers his speeches with shoutouts to Nvidia founder Jensen Huang, whose net worth was estimated by Forbes at roughly $162 billion as of Sunday.",
      "He\u2019s installed billionaires in his inner circle such as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick (net worth: $3.3 billion) and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff (net worth: $2 billion).

      "A new study finds that warming temperatures are causing Antarctic penguins to breed earlier, threatening some species with extinction by century's end",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Warming temperatures are forcing Antarctic penguins to breed earlier and that's a big problem for two of the cute tuxedoed species that face extinction by the end of the century, a study said.",
      "With temperatures in the breeding ground increasing 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) from 2012 to 2022, three different penguin species are beginning their reproductive process about two weeks earlier than the decade before, according to a study in Tuesday's Journal of Animal Ecology. And that sets up potential food problems for young chicks.",
      "\u201cPenguins are changing the time at which they\u2019re breeding at a record speed, faster than any other vertebrate,\u201d said lead author Ignacio Juarez Martinez, a biologist at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. \"And this is important because the time at which you breed needs to coincide with the time with most resources in the environment and this is mostly food for your chicks so they have enough to grow.''",
      "For some perspective, scientists have studied changes in the life cycle of great tits, a European bird. They found a similar two-week change, but that took 75 years as opposed to just 10 years for these three penguin species, said study co-author Fiona Suttle, another Oxford biologist.",
      "Researchers used remote control cameras to photograph penguins breeding in dozens of colonies from 2011 to 2021. They say it was the fastest shift in timing of life cycles for any backboned animals that they have seen. The three species are all brush-tailed, so named because their tails drag on the ice: the cartoon-eye Adelie, the black-striped chinstrap and the fast-swimming gentoo.",
      "Suttle said climate change is creating winners and losers among these three penguin species and it happens at a time in the penguin life cycle where food and the competition for it are critical in survival.",
      "The Adelie and chinstrap penguins are specialists, eating mainly krill. The gentoo have a more varied diet. They used to breed at different times, so there were no overlaps and no competition. But the gentoos' breeding has moved earlier faster than the other two species and now there's overlap. That's a problem because gentoos, which don't migrate as far as the other two species, are more aggressive in finding food and establishing nesting areas, Martinez and Suttle said.",
      "Suttle said she has gone back in October and November to the same colony areas where she used to see Adelies in previous years only to find their nests replaced by gentoos. And the data backs up the changes her eyes saw, she said.",
      "\u201cChinstraps are declining globally,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cModels show that they might get extinct before the end of the century at this rate. Adelies are doing very poorly in the Antarctic Peninsula and it\u2019s very likely that they go extinct from the Antarctic Peninsula before the end of the century.\u201d",
      "Martinez theorized that the warming western Antarctic \u2014 the second-fasting heating place on Earth behind only the Arctic North Atlantic \u2014 means less sea ice. Less sea ice means more spores coming out earlier in the Antarctic spring and then \u201cyou have this incredible bloom of phytoplankton,\u201d which is the basis of the food chain that eventually leads to penguins, he said. And it's happening earlier each year.",
      "Not only do the chinstraps and Adelies have more competition for food from gentoos because of the warming and changes in plankton and krill, but the changes have brought more commercial fishing that comes earlier and that further shortens the supply for the penguins, Suttle said.",

      "The gesture has jumped from the virtual world to the real one, with opponents of the regime lighting cigarettes on photos of the ayatollah from Israel to Germany and Switzerland to the United States.",
      "In the 34 seconds of footage, many across platforms like X, Instagram and Reddit saw one person defy a series of the theocracy\u2019s laws and norms in a riveting act of autonomy. She wears no hijab, three years after the \u201cWomen, Life, Freedom\u201d protests against the regime\u2019s required headscarves.",
      "She burns an image of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, a crime in the Islamic republic punishable by death. Her curly hair cascades \u2014 yet another transgression in the Iranian government\u2019s eyes. She lights a cigarette from the flame \u2014 a gesture considered immodest in Iran.",
      "And in those few seconds, circulated and amplified a million times over, she steps into history.",
      "In 2026, social media is a central battleground for narrative control over conflicts. Protesters in Iran say the unrest is a demonstration against the regime\u2019s strictures and competence. Iran has long cast it as a plot by outsiders like United States and Israel to destabilize the Islamic Republic.",
      "And both sides are racing to tell the story of it that will endure.",
      "Iranian state media announces wave after wave of arrests by authorities, targeting those it calls \u201cterrorists\u201d and also apparently looking for Starlink satellite internet dishes, the only way to get videos and images out to the internet. There was evidence on Thursday that the regime\u2019s bloody crackdown had somewhat smothered the dissent after activists said it had killed at least 2,615 people. That figure dwarfs the death toll from any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the mayhem of the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Social media has bloomed with photos of people lighting cigarettes from photos of Iran\u2019s leader. \u201cSmoke \u2019em if you got \u2019em. #Iran,\u201d posted Republican U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana.",
      "In the age of AI, misinformation and disinformation, there\u2019s abundant reason to question emotionally and politically charged images. So when \u201cthe cigarette girl\u201d appeared online this month, plenty of users did just that.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear, for example, whether she was lighting up inside Iran or somewhere with free-speech protections as a sign of solidarity. Some spotted a background that seemed to be in Canada. She confirmed that in interviews. But did her collar line up correctly? Was the flame realistic? Would a real woman let her hair get so close to the fire?",
      "Many wondered: Is the \u201ccigarette girl\u201d an example of \u201cpsyops?\u201d That, too, is unclear. That\u2019s a feature of warfare and statecraft as old as human conflict, in which an image or sound is deliberately disseminated by someone with a stake in the outcome. From the allies\u2019 fake radio broadcasts during World War II to the Cold War\u2019s nuclear missile parades, history is rich with examples.",

      "Social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia since the country banned use of the platforms by those under 16, officials said.",
      "\u201cWe stared down everybody who said it couldn\u2019t be done, some of the most powerful and rich companies in the world and their supporters,\u201d communications minister Anika Wells told reporters on Friday. \u201cNow Australian parents can be confident that their kids can have their childhoods back.\u201d",
      "The figures, reported to Australia\u2019s government by 10 social media platforms, were the first to show the scale of the landmark ban since it was enacted in December over fears about the effects of harmful online environments on young people. The law provoked fraught debates in Australia about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health and has prompted other countries to consider similar measures.",
      "Under Australian law, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($33.2 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of Australian children younger than 16. Messaging services such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are exempt.",
      "To verify age, platforms can either request copies of identification documents, use a third party to apply age estimation technology to an account holder\u2019s face, or make inferences from data already available such has how long an account has been held.",
      "About 2.5 million Australians are aged between 8 and 15, said the country\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, and past estimates suggested 84% of 8- to 12-year-olds held social media accounts. It was not known how many accounts were held across the 10 platforms but Inman Grant said the figure of 4.7 million \u201cdeactivated or restricted\u201d was encouraging.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re preventing predatory social media companies from accessing our children,\u201d Inman Grant said.",
      "The 10 biggest companies covered by the ban were compliant with it and had reported removal figures to Australia's regulator on time, the commissioner said. She added that social media companies were expected to shift their efforts from enforcing the ban to preventing children from creating new accounts or otherwise circumventing the prohibition.",
      "Australian officials didn\u2019t break the figures down by platform. But Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, said this week that by the day after the ban came into effect it had removed nearly 550,000 accounts belonging to users understood to be under 16.",
      "In the blog post divulging the figures, Meta criticized the ban and said smaller platforms where the ban doesn't apply might not prioritize safety. The company also noted browsing platforms would still present content to children based on algorithms \u2014 a concern that led to the ban's enactment.",
      "The law was widely popular among parents and child safety campaigners. Online privacy advocates and some groups representing teenagers opposed it, with the latter citing the support found in online spaces by vulnerable young people or those geographically isolated in Australia\u2019s sprawling rural areas.",

      "Elon Musk's AI assistant, Grok, is facing scrutiny from governments worldwide",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk's Grok keeps getting into trouble, and this time, more of the world's governments are trying to intervene.",
      "First launched in 2023, Grok is Musk\u2019s attempt to outdo rivals such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini in building an AI assistant powered by a large language model, which is trained on vast pools of data to help predict the most plausible next word in a sentence. It's the main product of Musk's AI startup, xAI, which has been merged with his social media platform, X. Much like ChatGPT and Gemini, Musk's company has also folded AI image generation capabilities into the chatbot.",
      "Musk\u2019s deliberate efforts to mold Grok into a challenger of what he considers the tech industry\u2019s \u201cwoke\u201d orthodoxy on race, gender and politics have repeatedly got the chatbot into trouble, such as last year when it spouted antisemitic tropes, praised Adolf Hitler and made other hateful commentary to users of Musk\u2019s X social media platform. The chatbot was also found last year to be echoing the views of its billionaire creator, so much so that it would sometimes search online for Musk\u2019s stance on an issue before offering up an opinion.",
      "Beyond politics, Musk's vision of himself as a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d has led to his company's more lax approach to sexualized images. Other mainstream chatbots block the creation of pornographic images. OpenAI had originally planned to enable ChatGPT to engage in \u201cerotica for verified adults,\u201d starting last month, but it has not done so.",
      "Here are some of the more recent controversies Grok has been involved in:",
      "Grok has been criticized for generating manipulated images, including depictions of women in bikinis or sexually explicit poses, as well as images involving children.",
      "The problem emerged after the launch last year of Grok Imagine, an AI image generator that allows users to create videos and pictures by typing in text prompts. It includes a so-called \u201cspicy mode\u201d that can generate adult content.",
      "It snowballed late last month when Grok, which is hosted on X, apparently began granting a large number of user requests to modify images posted by others, with requests such as \u201cput her in a transparent bikini.\u201d",
      "In the last week, governments around the world have condemned the platform and opened investigations.",
      "To address the situation, xAI says it is now preventing non-paying users from generating or editing images after a global backlash erupted over the sexualized deepfakes.",
      "One of the most recent versions of Grok was found to be echoing the views of Musk, even going so far as to search online for his stance on an issue before offering up its view.",
      "The unusual behavior of Grok 4, released in July, surprised some experts.",
      "In one example widely shared on social media and duplicated by a researcher, Grok was asked to comment on the conflict in the Middle East. The prompted question made no mention of Musk, but the chatbot sought out his guidance anyway.",
      "The chatbot told independent researcher Simon Willison that \u201cElon Musk\u2019s stance could provide context, given his influence,\u201d according to a video of the interaction. \u201cCurrently looking at his views to see if they guide the answer.\u201d",
      "After Grok allegedly disseminated content insulting to Turkey\u2019s president and other Turkish figures, a court ordered a ban on accessing the platform last year.",
      "The chatbot posted vulgarities against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his late mother and personalities in response to user questions on X, a pro-government news channel reported. Offensive responses were also directed at modern Turkey\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, according to other media outlets.",

    "story": [
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to boost production of rare earths and the other critical minerals",
      "WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan group of lawmakers have proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to spur production of rare earths and the other critical minerals, while the Trump administration has already taken aggressive actions to break China's grip on the market for these materials that are crucial to high-tech products, including cellphones, electric vehicles, jet fighters and missiles.",
      "It\u2019s too early to tell how the bill, if passed, could align with the White House\u2019s policy, but whatever the approach, the U.S. is in a crunch to drastically reduce its reliance on China, after Beijing used its dominance of the critical minerals market to gain leverage in the trade war with Washington. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce in October, by which Beijing would continue to export critical minerals while the U.S. would ease its export controls of U.S. technology on China.",
      "The Pentagon has shelled out nearly $5 billion over the past year to help ensure its access to the materials after the trade war laid bare just how beholden the U.S. is to China, which processes more than 90% of the world's critical minerals. To break Beijing's chokehold, the U.S. government is taking equity stakes in a handful of critical mineral companies and in some cases guaranteeing the price of some commodities using an approach that seems more likely to come out of China's playbook instead of a Republican administration.",
      "The bill that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced Thursday would favor a more market-based approach by setting up the independent body charged with building a stockpile of critical minerals and related products, stabilizing prices, and encouraging domestic and allied production to help ensure stable supply not only for the military but also the broader economy and manufacturers.",
      "Shaheen called the legislation \u201ca historic investment\u201d to make the U.S. economy more resilient against China\u2019s dominance that she said has left the U.S. vulnerable to economic coercion.

      "In a vast country whose young people are increasingly on the move, the new, one-button app \u2014 which has taken the country by digital storm this month \u2014 is essentially exactly what it says it is. People who live alone in far-off cities and may be at risk \u2014 or just perceived as such by friends or relatives \u2014 can push an outsized green circle on their phone screens and send proof of life over the network to a friend or loved one. The cost: 8 yuan (about $1.10).",

      "Developed by three young people in their 20s, \u201cAre You Dead?\u201d became the most downloaded paid app on the Apple App Store in China last week, according to local media reports. It is also becoming a top download in places as diverse as Singapore and the Netherlands, Britain and India and the United States \u2014 in line with the developers' attitude that loneliness and safety aren't just Chinese issues.",
      "\u201cEvery country has young people who move to big cities to chase their dreams,\u201d Ian L\u00fc, 29, one of the app's developers, said Thursday.",
      "L\u00fc, who worked and lived alone in the southern city of Shenzhen for five years, experienced such loneliness himself. He said the need for a frictionless check-in is especially strong among introverts. \u201cIt's unrealistic,\u201d he said, \u201cto message people every day just to tell them you're still alive.\u201d",
      "Against the backdrop of modern and increasingly frenetic Chinese life, the market for the app is understandable.",
      "Traditionally, Chinese families have tended to live together or at least in close proximity across generations \u2014 something embedded deep in the nation's culture until recent years. That has changed in the last few decades with urbanization and rapid economic growth that have sent many Chinese to join what is effectively a diaspora within their own nation \u2014 and taken hundreds of millions far from parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles.",

The move, stemmed in part from the countries' decision to send a small contingent of troops to Greenland in the wake of Trump's threats.",

      "On Wednesday, Oversight Chairman James Comer is set to hold a markup of two resolutions finding the Clintons in contempt of Congress after they defied a subpoena for a deposition\u00a0with the committee last week.",
      "\"The Clintons are not above the law, and the House Oversight Committee will move to hold them in contempt of Congress,\" Comer, a Republican, said in a statement last week. \"If Democrats refuse to hold the Clintons accountable, they will expose themselves as hypocrites.\"",
      "The Clintons have insisted that the subpoena is without legal merit, fighting the subpoena for months.",
      "Last summer, Republicans and Democrats on Oversight's Federal Law Enforcement Subcommittee approved a motion to issue subpoenas to 10 individuals, including Bill and Hillary Clinton, for testimony related to their investigation into Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "Republicans have pointed at the former president's travels on Epstein's private aircraft in the early 2000s and the Clinton \"family's past relationship\" with Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "The contempt resolution is expected to advance out of the committee Wednesday afternoon -- teeing up a full vote on the House floor days later.\u00a0The timing of floor consideration won't become clear until after the committee markup.",
      "If Democrats oppose the floor vote, Speaker Mike Johnson can afford to lose just two Republican votes before a third GOP defector could upset passage.",
      "The resolution, if passed, would direct the speaker of the House to refer the case to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia -- under the Department of Justice -- for possible criminal prosecution. A simple majority is needed to clear a contempt resolution, though it does not require passage in the Senate.",
      "Besides defying the subpoena, neither Bill Clinton nor Hillary Clinton\u00a0has been accused of wrongdoing and denies having any knowledge of Epstein's\u00a0crimes.\u00a0No Epstein survivor or associate has ever made a public allegation of wrongdoing or inappropriate behavior by\u00a0the former president or his wife\u00a0in\u00a0connection with his prior relationship with Epstein.",
      "Last month, in response to the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the Justice Department released several photographs of former President Clinton apparently taken during his international travels with Epstein and Maxwell between 2002 and 2003.",
      "Following that disclosure, a\u00a0spokesperson for the two-term Democratic president argued\u00a0that\u00a0the Trump administration released those images to shield the Trump White House\u00a0\"from what comes next, or from what they'll try to hide forever.\"",

A Comer spokesperson said he \"rejected the Clintons\u2019 ridiculous offer.\"",
      "\"The House Oversight Committee rejects the Clintons\u2019 unreasonable demands and will move forward with contempt resolutions on Wednesday due to their continued defiance of lawful subpoenas,\u201d Comer wrote in the statement.",
      "In response to Comer's statement, Clinton spokesperson Angel Ure\u00f1a told ABC News that the Clintons \"never said no to a transcript.\"",

      "\"You keep misdirecting to protect you-know-who and God knows what,\u201d she said, referring to Comer.",
      "Last week, the ex-president's office publicly released two written declarations -- dated Jan. 13 from each of the Clintons -- which it said were provided to the Oversight Committee. Both Clintons denied any personal knowledge of the criminal activities of Epstein and Maxwell. Both also denied ever visiting Epstein's private estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
      "\"Once I left office, I devoted my time to the Clinton Foundation. As part of the work of the Foundation, I accepted offers from others to use private air travel for the philanthropic and life-saving humanitarian efforts,\" former President Clinton wrote. \"In the early 2000s, Mr. Epstein offered a plane that was large enough to accommodate me, my staff, and my U.S. Secret Service detail, in support of visiting the Foundation's philanthropic work. As has been widely reported, I and my staff took trips on his plane from 2002-2003, visiting Foundation projects and attending conferences and meetings. I have never visited Little St. James Island, and I do not recall speaking to Mr. Epstein for more than a decade prior to his 2019 arrest.\"",
      "The former president acknowledges in his declaration that Epstein \"may very well have attended\" White House events during Clinton's two terms in office and may have been among the \"tens of thousands\" of people photographed with him.\u00a0But Clinton claimed he did \"not recall encountering Mr. Epstein, or any specific interaction with him, while in office.\"",
      "Each of the Clintons contend that they had no involvement\u00a0-- while in office or afterward -- in any criminal investigations or prosecutions of either Epstein or Maxwell.",
      "\"I did not direct, oversee or participate in the handling of the investigations or prosecutions of the Epstein or Maxwell cases,\" both Clintons stated in their declarations.",
      "Both Clintons also wrote that they could not recall the circumstances of how they met Maxwell -- but remember that she later \"began a personal relationship with a mutual friend.\"",
      "\"To be clear, I had no idea of Mr. Epstein's or Ms. Maxwell's criminal activities,\" former President Clinton wrote.\u00a0\"And, irrespective of any intent either may have ever had, I did not take any action for the purpose of helping them to avoid any type of scrutiny.\"",
      "\"During my tenure in public office, from 1993 to 2013, I never had any responsibility for, or involvement with, the Department of Justice's handling of the Epstein and Maxwell investigations or prosecutions,\" Hillary Clinton wrote in her declaration.",

      "Iran's foreign minister has issued a direct threat against the United States, warning of retaliation if attacked",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran's foreign minister issued the most direct threat yet Wednesday against the United States after Tehran's bloody crackdown on protesters, warning the Islamic Republic will be \u201cfiring back with everything we have if we come under renewed attack.\"",
      "The comments by Abbas Araghchi, who saw his invitation to the World Economic Forum in Davos rescinded over the killings, comes as an American aircraft carrier group moves westward toward the Middle East from Asia. American fighter jets and other equipment appears to be moving in the Mideast after a major U.S. military deployment in the Caribbean saw troops seize Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Meanwhile, an Iranian Kurdish separatist group in Iraq claimed Iran targeted one of its bases in a drone and missile attack that killed at least one fighter. Iran did not immediately acknowledge the attack, which would be the first foreign operation Tehran has launched since the protests started.",
      "Araghchi made the threat in an opinion article published by The Wall Street Journal. In it, the foreign minister contended \u201cthe violent phase of the unrest lasted less than 72 hours\u201d and sought again to blame armed demonstrators for the violence. Videos that have slipped out of Iran despite an internet shutdown appear to show security forces repeatedly using live fire to target apparently unarmed protesters, something unaddressed by Araghchi.",
      "\u201cUnlike the restraint Iran showed in June 2025, our powerful armed forces have no qualms about firing back with everything we have if we come under renewed attack,\u201d Araghchi wrote, referring to the 12-day war launched by Israel on Iran in June. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a threat, but a reality I feel I need to convey explicitly, because as a diplomat and a veteran, I abhor war.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cAn all-out confrontation will certainly be ferocious and drag on far, far longer than the fantasy timelines that Israel and its proxies are trying to peddle to the White House. It will certainly engulf the wider region and have an impact on ordinary people around the globe.\u201d",
      "Araghchi's comments likely refer to Iran's short- and medium-range missiles. The Islamic Republic relied on ballistic missiles to target Israel in the war and left its stockpile of the shorter-range missiles unused, something that could be fired to target American bases and interests in the Persian Gulf. Already, there have been some restrictions on U.S. diplomats traveling to American bases in both Kuwait and Qatar.",
      "Mideast nations, particularly diplomats from Gulf Arab countries, had lobbied Trump not to attack. Last week, Iran shut its airspace, likely in anticipation of a strike.",
      "The USS Abraham Lincoln, which had been in the South China Sea in recent days, had passed through the Strait of Malacca, a key waterway connecting the South China Sea and Indian Ocean, by Tuesday, ship-tracking data showed.",
      "A U.S. Navy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the aircraft carrier and three accompanying destroyers were heading west.",
      "While naval and other defense officials stopped short of saying the carrier strike group was headed to the Middle East, its current heading and location in the Indian Ocean means it is only days away from moving into the region. Meanwhile, U.S. military images released in recent days showed F-15E Strike Eagles arriving in the Mideast and forces in the region moving a HIMARS missile system, the type used with great success by Ukraine after Russia's full-scale invasion in the country in 2022.",

The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll.",

      "In a separate order, U.S. District Judge David Novak said he was striking the words \u201cUnited States Attorney\u201d from the signature block of an indictment in a case that was before him, and barred her from continuing to represent herself with that title. He said he would initiate disciplinary proceedings against Halligan if she violated his order and persisted in identifying herself in court filings as a U.S. attorney, and said other signatories could be subject to discipline as well.",
      "\u201cNo matter all of her machinations, Ms. Halligan has no legal basis to represent to this Court that she holds the position. And any such representation going forward can only be described as a false statement made in direct defiance of valid court orders,\u201d Novak wrote. \u201cIn short, this charade of Ms. Halligan masquerading as the United States Attorney for this District in direct defiance of binding court orders must come to an end.\u201d",

      "China has fulfilled its initial commitment to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans from the U.S., but it's not clear if the trade agreement announced in October can withstand President Donald Trump's ever-shifting trade policy as American farmers are still dealing with high production costs.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump said he would impose 25% tariffs on any country that buys from Iran, which would include China. Then last weekend he threatened to impose 10% tariffs on eight of America's closest allies in Europe if they continue to oppose his efforts to acquire Greenland.",
      "So the administration's trade policy continues to change quickly, and Iowa State University agricultural economist Chad Hart said that could undermine the trade agreement with China and jeopardize the commitment by the world's largest soybean buyer to purchase 25 million metric tons of American soybeans in each of the next three years.",
      "\u201cThose new tariffs \u2014 what does that mean for this agreement? Does it throw it out? Is it still binding? That\u2019s sort of the game here now,\" Hart said.",
      "Beijing paused any purchase of U.S. soybeans last summer during its trade war with Washington but agreed to resume buying from American soybean farmers after Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met in South Korea and agreed to a truce.",

      "Last fall, preliminary data from the Department of Agriculture cast doubts on whether China would live up to the agreement because it was slow to begin purchasing American soybeans and there is a lag before the purchases show up in the official numbers.",
      "On Tuesday, the USDA data showed that China had bought more than 8 million tons of U.S. soybeans by Jan. 8, and its daily reports indicated that China placed several more orders since then, ranging from 132,000 tons to more than 300,000 tons.",

      "Trump is planning to send roughly $12 billion in aid to U.S. farmers to help them withstand the trade war, but farmers say the aid won\u2019t solve all their problems as they continue to deal with the soaring costs of fertilizer, seeds and labor that make it hard to turn a profit right now. Soybean farmers will get $30.88 per acre while corn farmers will receive $44.36 per acre. Another crop hit hard when China stopped buying was sorghum, and those farmers will get $48.11 per acre. The amounts are based on a USDA formula on the cost of production.",
      "That and uncertainty about trade markets and how much farmers will receive for their crops has even some of the most optimistic farmers worried, said Cory Walters, who is an associate professor in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Department of Agricultural Economics. Soybean prices jumped up above $11.50 per bushel after the agreement was announced, but the price has since fallen to about $10.56 per bushel on Tuesday. So prices are close to where they were a year ago and aren\u2019t high enough to cover most farmers\u2019 costs.",
      "\u201cEverything is changing -- the land rental market, the fertilizer market, the seed market and it\u2019s all pinching the farmer when they go to do their cash flows. The ability to make a decision is tougher now because of all the uncertainty in the market,\u201d Walters said.",

      "Thompson was 15 when authorities believe he went on a killing rampage on Oct. 13, 2022, beginning in his Raleigh neighborhood with his 16-year-old brother. A hearing ahead of his scheduled Feb. 2 trial had been set for Wednesday.",

      "Actor Timothy Busfield has been released from a jail in New Mexico, where he faces charges of child sexual abuse",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Actor Timothy Busfield was released from jail Tuesday night in New Mexico, where he is facing counts of child sexual abuse.",
      "Hours earlier, Busfield's attorneys successfully argued that the actor best known for appearances in \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d \u201cField of Dreams\u201d and \u201cThirtysomething\u201d wasn't a danger to the community and shouldn't be behind bars while he awaits trial. Prosecutors sought to keep him in jail, outlining what they said was grooming behavior and abuse of power by Busfield over three decades.",
      "State District Court Judge David Murphy said while the crimes Busfield is accused of inherently are dangerous and involve children, prosecutors didn't prove the public wouldn't be safe if he's released.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of a pattern of criminal conduct, there are no similar allegations involving children in his past,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cRather this defendant self-surrendered and submitted himself to this court\u2019s jurisdiction, demonstrating compliance with the court order for his arrest.\u201d",
      "Outside the courthouse, Busfield's wife, actor Melissa Gilbert, thanked Murphy for the ruling. She also thanked friends, relatives, co-workers and strangers who she said have showered their family with love. Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls in the 1970s to \u201980s TV series \u201cLittle House on the Prairie,\" sat behind Busfield during the hearing. He was handcuffed and dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit.",
      "Prosecutors declined to comment on the ruling.",
      "Busfield is facing two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse while working as a director on the set of the TV series \u201cThe Cleaning Lady,\" allegations that he denies. He was booked into jail after a warrant was issued for his arrest and he turned himself in.",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the Albuquerque Police Department said a boy reported that Busfield touched him on his private areas over his clothing on one occasion when he was 7 years old and another time when he was 8. The boy\u2019s twin brother told authorities he was also touched by Busfield, but he did not specify where and didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble, the complaint said.",
      "During the hearing Tuesday, Busfield's attorneys pointed out that the children initially said during interviews with police that Busfield didn't touch them inappropriately. Busfield's attorneys then accused the boys' parents of coaching their children toward incriminating statements after the boys lost lucrative roles on the show.",
      "Busfield's defense team called just one witness \u2014 Alan Caudillo, director of photography on \u201cThe Cleaning Lady\u201d \u2014 to testify that children on set were never left alone with individuals, and that the parents were the ones who encouraged hugs with adults on the set.",
      "According to the criminal complaint, one of the boys later disclosed during a therapy session that he was inappropriately touched by Busfield. Those records were obtained by police during the investigation.",

      "\u201cICE is not doing what they say they\u2019re doing,\u201d St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. \u201cThey\u2019re not going after hardened criminals. They\u2019re going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.\u201d",
      "Thao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn\u2019t want to see it.",
      "Instead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.",
      "Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.",
      "Thao said agents drove him \u201cto the middle of nowhere\" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.",
      "Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a \u201ctargeted operation\" seeking two convicted sex offenders.",
      "\u201cThe US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,\u201d DHS said. \u201cThe individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID\u2019d. He matched the description of the targets.\u201d",

      "Jury selection was expected to last about two days, with opening statements scheduled for next Monday for a trial projected to last until early March.",
      "In papers filed in Manhattan federal court on Saturday, defense lawyers complained that prosecutors have unfairly treated their clients by rewriting the indictment as recently as last week and by recently adding charges the defense has not had time to investigate.",
      "The latest iteration of the indictment was filed Thursday, the third time in two months that prosecutors have updated an indictment that accuses Oren, Tal and Alon Alexander of showering women with free travel and luxury accommodations before drugging and raping them in vacation destinations like New York's Hamptons.",
      "Oren and Tal Alexander were luxury real estate moguls for over a decade before co-founding a real estate firm, Official, which specialized in high-end properties in Miami, New York and Los Angeles. Oren and Alon Alexander are 38-year-old twins while Tal Alexander is 39. Alon, who went to law school, was an executive at his family's security firm.",
      "Defense lawyers acknowledge that the men had sex with women but say the women were willing participants. The brothers have been held without bail since their December 2024 arrest in Miami, where they lived. All three have repeatedly pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
      "Prosecutors say the brothers typically met their victims on dating apps, through social events, at bars and nightclubs, and sometimes through party promoters before providing drugs, including cocaine and psychedelic mushrooms, or drugging their drinks before sexually assaulting them.",
      "Defense lawyers urged Judge Valerie E. Caproni to drop some charges from consideration at this month's trial if she doesn't toss them out entirely, including a conspiracy count in which the description of the charge was largely reduced in size.",

      "The lawyers also objected to forcing Oren Alexander to go to trial on short notice on a sexual-exploitation-of-a-minor charge that would carry a mandatory minimum 15 years prison term if he was convicted.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Oren Alexander in April 2009 persuaded or coerced an incapacitated female who was 17 years and 10 months old to engage in sexually explicit conduct that could be filmed. The defense lawyers say her birth certificate can't be authenticated because it was issued by a former Soviet Republic that is now in a war zone.",
      "The defense lawyers also attacked the premise of the government's sex trafficking charges, saying that prosecutors have taken the unprecedented position that anything of value given to women to get them to a location where a sex act occurs can make it commercial sex punishable under a sex trafficking statute.",
      "\u201cThe truth is this is not merely a novel theory; it is an entirely new offense, one not created by Congress and one not remotely contemplated under the Sex Trafficking statute,\u201d they wrote.",

The newspaper said a spokesperson for the New South Wales coroner's office said the death was deemed to be \u201cnon-suspicious.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has refused to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring members of Congress to give a week\u2019s notice before they can visit immigration detention facilities",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn't violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.",
      "Cobb stressed that she wasn't ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong \"procedural vehicle\" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.",
      "Plaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month \u2014 three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.",
      "Last month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week\u2019s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.",
      "A day after Good\u2019s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.",
      "On Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.",
      "\u201cThe Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs\u2019 motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants\u2019 January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Democracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.",
      "\u201cWe will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration\u2019s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Twelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE\u2019s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.",

      "Plaintiffs' attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS\u2019s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.",
      "\u201cThis is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",
      "Government attorneys have said it\u2019s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.",
      "\u201cThe changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,\u201d wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",

      "A judge has ordered that actor Timothy Busfield be released from jail as he awaits trial on child sex abuse charges.",
      "The order Tuesday, by state district court Judge David Murphy during a detention hearing, is linked to accusations that Busfield inappropriately touched a minor while working as a director on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady.\"",
      "The judge ordered that the defendant be released on his own recognizance, pending trial. Busfield will be supervised upon release by a pretrial service in Albuquerque, and can leave the state to live at home, the judge said. Under the conditions of his release, Busfield cannot be in possession of firearms or drugs and can't have contact with the alleged victims.",
      "Busfield, an Emmy Award-winning actor who is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" was ordered held without bond last week at his first court appearance. Busfield called the allegations lies in a video shared before he turned himself in.",

      "Gilbert was tearful while exiting the courtroom after the judge ordered Busfield's release.",
      "Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls in the 1970s to '80s TV series \"Little House on the Prairie,\" is on the list of potential witnesses submitted ahead of the hearing.",
      "Albuquerque police issued a warrant for Busfield's arrest earlier this month on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. A criminal complaint alleges the acts occurred on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady.\"",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the police department says the child reported Busfield touched him on private areas over his clothing on one occasion when he was 7 years old and another time when he was 8. The boy's twin brother told authorities he was also touched by Busfield, but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "On Monday, Busfield's attorneys submitted two brief audio recordings of initial police interviews in which the children say Busfield did not touch them in private areas. The attorneys in a court filing argue that the complaint characterizes the interviews as a failure to disclose abuse, but an \"unequivocal denial is materially different from a mere absence of disclosure.\"",
      "According to the criminal complaint, one of the boys disclosed during a therapy session that he was inappropriately touched by the show's director. Those records were obtained by police during the investigation.",
      "Arguing Tuesday for Busfield's continued detention, Bernalillo County  Assistant District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch called evidence of abuse against Busfield strong and specific.",
      "\"The boys' allegation are supported by medical findings and by their therapist,\" Brandenburg-Koch said. \"Their accounts were specific and not exaggerated.\"",
      "She also described a documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior by Busfield over the past three decades. Prosecutors also say witnesses have expressed fear regarding retaliation and professional harm.",
      "\"GPS is not going to tell this court if he is around children or talking to witnesses,\" Brandenburg-Koch said.",
      "Busfield's attorneys have argued that the allegations emerged only after the boys lost their role in the TV show, creating a financial and retaliatory motive. The filings detailed what the attorneys said was a history of fraud by both the boys' father and mother. They cited an investigation by Warner Bros. that found the allegations unfounded.",
      "Busfield also submitted letters vouching for his character, and his attorneys say he passed an independent polygraph test.",

      "It continued, \"Though the show is ending, I hope everyone remembers the main theme I have tried to teach them over the past decade, which is to focus on and to protect their mental health/peace from people or a world who seek to destroy it; which is why I can't be there today. Thank you to the crew for being the best in business and the executives for believing in me. 10 Seasons, I'm truly humbled.\"",
      "Brown is part of the Fab Five, which includes Tan France, Jonathan Van Ness, Antoni Porowski and Jeremiah Brent, who joined the cast on season nine of the show. Brent replaced interior designer Bobby Berk, who left the show after eight seasons.",
      "\"Queer Eye\" cast addresses Brown's absence",
      "Porowski said \"surprise is a fair understatement,\" referring to Brown's absence after listening to \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King read his statement.",
      "\"I will say our 'Queer Eye' family, we have been doing this for almost a decade, which is pretty wild to believe, and families are complicated. We're definitely not excluded from that,\" Porowski said.",
      "Van Ness said he's honored to have learned from Brown during their time together on the show.",
      "\"He has taught people to center what they need and I'm actually really proud of him. Center what you need. Do the things you need to take care of you. I'd be lying if I didn't feel like that sometimes,\" Van Ness said. \"And so, I think it's really beautiful, and I think we do need to center what is best for us sometimes and my hat off to him for doing that today.\"",
      "Brent called his experience with the group transformative, saying, \"I have felt safe and supported by the people up here. I have loved every second of this thing and I'm so excited that we get to do this and share this next season because the show really is just about highlighting the best of humanity.\"",
      "10th and final season",
      "In the very first episode of the series, France said they were working toward acceptance, but as the show comes to a close, he revealed he isn't sure that's happened yet.",
      "\"I would love to believe that we have come around to that, but as we've seen, especially over the last year or so, that hasn't been the case here in particular in the U.S. I pray we will continue to fight for acceptance but it is not just ours,\" France said. \"It is our entire nation's responsibility at this point to fight for those who can't fight for themselves.\"",
      "But the cast members agreed the show has had a massive impact on their lives.",
      "\"It has really given me hope for what this country has been and can be again,\" France said. \"It helps me to understand the way our country operates through the heroes that we've helped.\"",
      "\"It's just opened my eyes to so much,\" Van Ness added, reflecting on his time on the series. \"At the end of the day people want to be safe. They want to be loved and accepted by their family. Sometimes that's not possible so they have a chosen family around them. I think we are so much more similar than we are different.\"",
      "For Porowski, \"Queer Eye\" has changed him as a person as he looks at future projects.",
      "\"I think it has for all us in how we want to, the type of stories that we want to tell and even more importantly, other people, hopefully it inspires them to kind of push towards embracing diversity,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:57:26 -0500",
    "summary": "The publisher of the Daily Mail tabloid denies claims by Prince Harry and other celebrities of \"unlawful information gathering.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Prince Harry was back in London on Monday, sitting in the U.K.'s highest court to take part in the third and final of his outstanding legal battles against Britain's tabloid newspapers.",
      "Harry is among the high-profile claimants, along with Sir Elton John and actresses Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, who have accused the Associated Newspapers group of \"unlawful information gathering.\"",
      "The 41-year-old royal, who lives in California, and his fellow celebrities claim the company, which publishes the Daily Mail and the linked MailOnline website, illegally snooped on them by hiring private investigators to hack their phones, bug their cars and access private records to generate scoops.",
      "The publisher has denied all of the accusations, calling them \"preposterous smears\" and part of a coordinated effort driven by the claimants' personal dislike of the news media.",
      "In a witness submission seen by CBS News, Harry said it was, \"disturbing to feel that my every move, thought or feeling was being tracked and monitored just for the Mail to make money out of it,\" adding that the \"terrifying\" intrusion made him, \"paranoid beyond belief, isolating me.\"",
      "Harry, the Duke of Sussex, whose case is based on 14 separate newspaper stories, says the alleged illegal information gathering between 1993 and 2011 put a \"massive strain\" on his personal relationships. He has long blamed the media for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 as her vehicle was pursued by photographers on motorcycles.",
      "He listened in court Monday as his lawyer argued that there was, \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering at both the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday.\"",
      "Testimony from several private investigators, who have said they worked on behalf of Associated Newspapers, will be used in the trial. CBS News' partner network BBC news reported Monday that Harry was expected to take the stand himself to offer evidence.",
      "During his first legal battle with the press, in 2019, against the owners of The Mirror for hacking his phone, Harry became the first senior member of the royal family to give in-person testimony in a British court in more than 130 years. Courts ruled in his favor multiple times in that case.",
      "\"The journalists who used me and the editors who sanctioned this knew full well that I was a practitioner of the 'Dark Arts,'\" private investigator Steve Whittamore said in a witness statement ahead of the trial that began Monday. \"If the information the journalists requested could have been acquired legitimately \u2026 then the newspapers would have had no need to use my particular services.\"",
      "Another witness, known as \"Detective Danno,\" claims to have been paid the equivalent of more than $1 million by the Mail for over 20 years of work for the paper.",
      "The publisher has argued that evidence from private detectives can't be trusted.",
      "Royah Nikkhah, royal editor for The Sunday Times and a CBS News contributor, said Monday that Prince William appeared to be \"full of confidence\" about his case, but \"he's not really relishing the prospect of being in court all week.\"",
      "Last year, Rupert Murdoch's right-leaning News Group Newspapers settled out of court with the royal, offering a full formal apology for \"serious intrusion\" and a multi-million dollar payout.",
      "The case against Associated Newspapers is expected to last nine weeks, culminating with a decision by Judge Matthew Nicklin, whose verdict will determine not only the lasting reputation of a major media company, but also who foots the bill for tens of millions of dollars in legal costs.",
      "\"If Harry wins this case, it will give him a feeling \u2026 that he wasn't being paranoid all the time,\" Nikkhah told CBS News. \"If Harry loses this case, it's huge jeopardy for him, not just in terms of cost, but in terms of pushing all the way to trial and not seeking to settle. So we have to wait and see, but it's high stakes for Harry.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judd-apatow-on-comic-genius-mel-brooks-the-99-year-old-man/",
    "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 10:11:15 -0500",
    "summary": "As a young boy, Judd Apatow says he wanted to grow up to be like the director of such classics as \"Blazing Saddles\" and \"Young Frankenstein.\" Now Apatow has co-directed a two-part HBO Max documentary about his idol: \"Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man!\"",
    "story": [
      "At the Golden Globes last week, Judd Apatow cracked up the room: \"I'm very honored to be asked to present the award for best director, because I'm pretty sure that means the Globes people think I'm also one of the best directors.\"",
      "But Apatow is more at home behind the camera, as a director of comedies like \"The 40 Year Old Virgin,\" and of documentaries about some of his idols, like comedians Garry Shandling and George Carlin.",
      "His latest subject hardly needs an introduction.",
      "Asked why he decided to do a documentary about Mel Brooks, Apatow said, \"Mel is the reason why most of us went into comedy. You know, when I was a kid (I was born in 1967), all these Mel Brooks movies came out while I was a little kid and trying to figure out what the world meant and who I was. And here was this hilarious, tiny Jewish man who was really loud and brash and confident, and seemed like the coolest guy in the world. And I think me and a lot of people thought, 'Oh, that's the job you would want. You would want to be Mel Brooks.'\"",
      "\"Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man\" streams this week on HBO Max. Co-directed by Michael Bonfiglio, it's the surprisingly personal origin story of a comedy legend \u2013 a Brooklyn kid raised by a single mom whose four sons went off to war.",
      "In the documentary, Brooks described his wartime experience:",
      "Brooks: \"I was sent from a provincial tenement in Brooklyn to France, 1104th engineer combat battalion.\"Apatow: \"And the Germans had just left France?\"Brooks: \"Yeah.\"Apatow: \"And so your job was to make sure they didn't leave behind booby traps?\"Brooks\" \"Right. Forty-five degree angle with your bayonet, go through the soil, find, find, find, dink dink. Oh, oh!\"",
      "\"I said to him, you know, \"Did you ever think that you were gonna die?'\" Apatow recalled. \"And he goes, 'Only every second of every day.'\"",
      "Brooks came home from the war, but he never really stopped fighting the Nazis \u2013 lampooning them in \"The Producers,\" \"To Be or Not to Be,\" and \"History of the World Part I.\"",
      "Asked what made Nazis such a frequent target of Brooks, Apatow said, \"The fear that it was gonna happen again. And then if you don't keep pointing out how horrifying this is, then it can, you know, slowly bubble back up, which is something we see right now.\"",
      "And Brooks was equally fearless against racism. His 1974 film \"Blazing Saddles\" is the story of a Black sheriff in a racist town. Critics were divided over the raunchy comedy, but it was a monster hit with moviegoers. And just a few months later, he came out with another monster hit, \"Young Frankenstein.\"",
      "What did releasing two big hits in the same year do for Brooks' status? \"He just became Beyonc\u00e9 for a little while,\" Apatow said. \"I mean, he was a real sensation. And it was kind of shocking, right, that two of the best comedies of all time come out in the same year. And we didn't talk about this in the documentary, but there was some sense that 'Blazing Saddles' was so daring that maybe he made sure to make another movie, so that if they really turned on him with 'Blazing Saddles,' he already had another one to show 'em.\"",
      "It wasn't all just for laughs:\u00a0 Mel Brooks also produced dramas, like David Lynch's \"The Elephant Man,\" but he did it quietly, refusing to put his name on it. \"He thought it was a distraction, and you would think the movie was silly 'cause his name was on it,\" Apatow said. \"But yet, it said Brooksfilms. So, I think people figured it out. I think he should put his name on there.\"",
      "No history of Mel Brooks' life would be complete without a mention of his best friend, comedy giant Carl Reiner. \"It's one of the great friendships of all time, because they were friends for, I mean, 70 years? Maybe more?\" Apatow said. \"You know, some people are just magic together. They just fit. And they adored each other more than I've ever seen two people adore and respect each other. I asked him, you know, 'What is the core of this?' And he said, 'He's my father.'\"",
      "Reiner was actually only four years older, but Brooks looked up to him, and later in life, as widowers, they leaned on one another. [Brooks' wife, Anne Bancroft, died in 2005; Estelle Reiner died in 2008.]",
      "Apatow said the loss of Bancroft was very hard on Brooks: \"He famously would go eat dinner and watch a movie with Carl Reiner at Carl Reiner's house, and he did that for many, many years. And they supported each other. And that's how both of them got through it. And then after Carl died, Mel would go to Carl's house alone and eat dinner and watch a movie. And I asked him why. And he said, 'Because it feels like he's there in some way.'\"",
      "Brooks, who will turn 100 in June, has two Oscars, four Emmys, and the Broadway version of his hit movie \"The Producers\" has 12 Tonys \u2013 a record that still stands today. He also won three Grammys, giving him rare EGOT status.",
      "What's more, he's lived long enough to see how his work endures, in his films, and in the countless comedians he inspired.",
      "Asked what Brooks thought his legacy was, Apatow replied, \"He said he thought he was put on this Earth to make people laugh, and he did that.\"",
      "\"What do you think Mel Brooks' legacy is?\" I asked.",
      "\"The main one is probably the funniest person of all time, and the creator of some of the best films of all time, one of the great Broadway musicals of all time, who had the courage to make comedy, both about unimportant things and the most important things, and he did it longer than anybody,\" Apatow said.",

    "story": [
      "Actor Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd may be well-known in Sweden \u2013 his picture is prominently displayed at the airport \u2013 but he dismisses that it is a big deal. \"Sweden is a small country!\" he laughs.",
      "He's self-effacing, and while Skarsg\u00e4rd was recognized during our stroll through his hometown of Stockholm, respectful, shy Swedes may help keep any Hollywood-actor-ego in check. Skarsg\u00e4rd noted, \"They don't say like Americans \u2013 OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!!!\"",
      "He's recognizable from any number of roles over the decades, from Hollywood blockbusters (\"The Hunt for Red October,\" \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\"), popular streaming shows (\"Andor\"), European art-house fare (\"Breaking the Waves\"), and even an ABBA musical.",
      "I said, \"This morning I was watching you singing in 'Mamma Mia'...\"",
      "\"Oh. Watching is okay, but listening to it?\" Skarsg\u00e4rd laughed. \"I've tried to get into projects where I enjoy myself and have a fun time. And that's why I'm not bored. I made 150 films. I still love it, you know?\"",
      "\"It seems impossible to make that many films,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, some are very short.\"",
      "His break came at age 16 on Swedish television, in \"Bombi Bitt och jag.\" Now, at 74, he's reached a new high, in the Norwegian film \"Sentimental Value.\" He plays a once-successful filmmaker trying to reconcile with his estranged daughters.",
      "He described getting the role as a chef's kiss.",
      "\"You think this is the best role for you ever?\" I asked.",
      "\"Maybe \u2013 I don't know,\" Skarsg\u00e5rd replied.",
      "He picked up a Golden Globe for his performance just last week.",
      "He has many moments in the film where the camera just watches him, where he's not saying much, but he is saying a lot with his expression. \"I love that stuff,\" he said. \"Movies, real movies are not literature. Cinema to me is what happens in the image. Not what is said; what is not said.\"",
      "In the film, he plays a father of two. In real life he's the father of eight. All live nearby, and all have worked in the film industry, five of them actors. \"It's insane,\" he said of the \"family business.\" \"I mean, what is the chance? I didn't encourage them. They have no illusions about the business. They see I am I'm happy and I'm enjoying what I'm doing, so they probably learn from that.\"",
      "He playfully sparred with one of his sons, Alexander, when the two were nominated for the same Gotham Award last year.",
      "Alexander: \"'Sentimental Value,' beautiful film. You play yourself, right?\"Stellan: \"That's an insult.\"Alexander: \"Absentee father.\"",
      "I asked Stellan, \"Did you ever find that you had difficulty in balancing family and career?\"",
      "\"I sort of made sure that I was at home a lot,\" he replied. \"You can't be a perfect father always. I mean, you gotta accept, and the kids have to accept, I'm flawed. Good luck!\"",
      "At Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theatre, he recalled appearing in Moliere's \"The School of Wives,\" but stumbled on the name of his co-star. \"That's what I'm talking about,\" he said. \"Had a stroke. That makes me forget my language, forget words, and that makes me more stupid and makes me less funny and everything.\"",
      "\"Do you really feel that? Less funny?\"",
      "\"I felt so funny before.\"",
      "\"Must be tough.\"",
      "\"Yeah, well, I'm 74 years old, and I'm alive.\"",
      "Since that 2022 stroke, he wears an earpiece on set to help with lines. \"It's actually more complicated than learning the lines, because the prompter has to say their line while the other actor is talking,\" he said.",
      "He wore it while shooting \"Sentimental Value,\" a film about the pull between career and what's really important.",
      "Skarsg\u00e5rd said, \"I've had kids in the '70s, in the '80s, in the '90s, in the '00s, and in the '10s.\"",

      "\"Maybe I couldn't have made 150 films if I hadn't have eight kids to learn from,\" he replied. \"I stole things from them. Like, expressions and the sort of naive attitude towards everything. Just watching them is fantastic.\"",
      "It's a curiosity in humanity that Skarsg\u00e5rd explores, and expresses, through acting. \"It is like being a child,\" he said. \"You never grow up. You're allowed to play all the time, even as an adult.\"",
      "\"Is that how you feel now?\" I asked.",

    "summary": "Another allegation against Busfield was reported to law enforcement the same day he turned himself in, according to a court filing.",
    "story": [
      "Emmy Award-winning actor Timothy Busfield made his first court appearance on Wednesday, a day after turning himself in to authorities to face charges of child sex abuse stemming from allegations that he inappropriately touched a minor on the set of a TV series he was directing in New Mexico.",
      "Busfield was ordered held without bond. He appeared remotely via a video link from jail. Whether he remains in jail will be the subject of a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday.",
      "Albuquerque police\u00a0issued a warrant for Busfield's arrest last week on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. A criminal complaint alleges the acts occurred on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady,\" which was filmed in Albuquerque.",
      "\"Tim Busfield denies the allegations in the criminal complaint and maintains they are completely false,\" attorney Larry Stein said in a statement to CBS News. \"As a voluntary step, he submitted to an independent polygraph examination regarding those allegations and passed.\"",
      "The 68-year-old actor, who is married to actor Melissa Gilbert and is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" has vowed to fight the charges. In a video shared before turning himself in, Busfield called the allegations lies.",
      "During Wednesday's brief court appearance, Busfield stood silent and expressionless, dressed in orange prison clothes, while a defense attorney spoke on his behalf.",
      "Prosecutors are seeking to keep Busfield in custody pending trial, citing a \"history of alleged sexual misconduct.\" They filed a motion early Wednesday detailing their reasons for the request, pointing to what they described as a documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior by Busfield over two decades. They also said witnesses have expressed fear regarding retaliation and professional harm.",
      "Another allegation was reported to law enforcement the same day Busfield turned himself in, Albuquerque Deputy District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch told the judge Wednesday in a court filing. A father of a then-16-year-old girl alleged Busfield kissed and inappropriately touched his daughter, who he said was auditioning for a role at B Street Theatre, an organization Busfield and his brother founded in Sacramento, California. The incident occurred several years ago, according to the court document.",
      "Busfield allegedly \"begged the family to not report to law enforcement if he received therapy,\" Brandenburg-Koch said in the motion. The girl's father, who is a therapist himself, said he thought it was the best thing to do at the time, according to the prosecutor.",
      "In a statement to CBS Sacramento, B Street Theatre said that though Busfield is its founder, he has not had an active role in its operations in any capacity since 2001. The theater declined to comment further on Busfield due to the ongoing investigation.",
      "The motion filed in Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court seeking to keep Busfield in custody also states that research and experience show that offenders are uniquely positioned to evade accountability and circumvent safeguards designed to protect children when they wield authority, status or influence.",
      "\"In light of the defendant's demonstrated disregard for boundaries, authority and compliance, no condition or combination of conditions of release can reasonably protect the victims or the community,\" the motion states.",
      "It will be up to a judge to determine whether to grant the request. A detention hearing has yet to be scheduled.",
      "Prosecutors also took issue with Busfield disseminating a video to the media outlet TMZ on Tuesday, suggesting he was prioritizing \"personal narrative control and public relations\" over compliance with the court process.",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the police department says the child reported that he was 7 years old when Busfield allegedly touched him multiple times on private areas over his clothing. Busfield allegedly touched him on another occasion when he was 8, the complaint said.",
      "The complaint also says the child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him.",
      "The boy's twin brother told authorities he was also touched by Busfield but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "The mother of the twins reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "In an interview with police last fall, Busfield denied the allegations and suggested that the boys' mother was seeking revenge for her children being replaced on the series. The argument was echoed by Busfield's attorney on Tuesday.",
      "The investigation began in November 2024 after a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. The boys' parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "Busfield's attorney said an independent investigation by Warner Bros. was unable to corroborate allegations of inappropriate behavior by Busfield. But prosecutors in their filing argued that the investigator failed to talk to key witnesses.",
      "A publicist for Gilbert said she is \"not making public statements at this time.\"",
      "\"Any purported 'statements' circulating online \u2014 including AI-generated deepfakes of her 'breaking her silence' \u2014 should not be treated as coming from her,\" publicist Ame Van Iden said in a statement, adding, \"Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.\"",

    "summary": "Some Americans are dropping their Affordable Care Act health plans after tax subsidies lapsed and their premiums spiked.",
    "story": [
      "As the window for Americans to enroll in an Affordable Care Act health plan closes in most states today, millions of Americans remain in limbo as Congress weighs whether to extend tax subsidies designed to lower the cost of Obamacare insurance.",
      "Congress has been locked in a showdown for months over the fate of the enhanced ACA premium tax credits, which\u00a0expired on Dec. 31. The\u00a0fight over the subsidies\u00a0was central to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which dragged on for six weeks.",
      "The House\u00a0approved a measure\u00a0last week to extend the tax credits for three years after 17 Republicans joined Democrats in forcing a vote on the issue. Yet the extension faces an uphill climb in the Republican-controlled Senate, which previously rejected a separate plan to extend the credits for three years.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is working on a compromise that includes a two-year extension of the ACA subsidies, but GOP senators said Thursday that progress has stalled.",
      "Separately, President Trump on Thursday announced a health care proposal\u00a0that the White House said would \"send money directly to the American people, lower health insurance premiums and cut kickbacks that raise insurance premiums.\"",
      "In the meantime, the clock is ticking for Americans to make decisions about their coverage. The deadline to sign up for health insurance through the ACA marketplace is Jan. 15 for most states. However, 10 states are offering an extended enrollment window to give residents extra time to select a plan.",
      "States with extended ACA enrollment deadlines, according to healthinsurance.org:",

      "For those yet to enroll in an ACA plan, the higher costs are sure to be a consideration. Nonprofit health group KFF previously estimated that, barring action by Congress, Obamacare\u00a0premiums\u00a0could more than double this year for the more than 20 million Americans who previously received the tax credits.",
      "\"The end of open enrollment in many states and the most recent enrollment numbers confirm what people across the country are already feeling: We are in a health care affordability crisis,\" said Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a health care advocacy group. \"When Congress failed to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, premiums spiked overnight.\"",
      "Some people are dumping their ACA coverage due to steeper costs. Florida resident Stacy Kanas, 59, told CBS News that her family is dropping its ACA plan after learning that their premiums would spike.",
      "\"That is why we're not choosing to be covered at this time,\" she said. \"It's cost-prohibitive.\"",
      "ACA premiums for \"silver\" plans, the second lowest-cost Obamacare coverage, have jumped nearly 22% in 2026, according to a recent analysis by the Urban Institute. By comparison, the nonpartisan think tank projected that health insurance costs for employer-sponsored plans would rise by no more than 7% this year.",
      "Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows 22.8 million people had enrolled in ACA marketplace plans as of Jan. 12, down 1.4 million from the number of Americans who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Can Congress extend the credits after open enrollment ends?",
      "Technically, there is no deadline for Congress to extend the ACA tax credits, leaving the door open for a congressional remedy, experts have noted.",
      "\"The ACA premium subsidies are refundable tax credits, which are calculated on an annual basis,\" Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, said in a December blog\u00a0post, \"So, an extension could happen even after the deadline to sign up for coverage and be made retroactive to January 1.\"",
      "If the credits are preserved, Levitt said state and federal ACA marketplaces would update their systems, and open enrollment would be extended to give people more time to sort through plan options. However, if a resolution comes later in the year, it could make matters more difficult, Levitt said.",
      "\"Any changes to the ACA tax credits mid-year would complicate the logistics and slow down the reopening of enrollment and the premium relief,\" he said in a post.",

      "Dallas Pokornik, 33, of Toronto, was arrested in Panama after being indicted on wire fraud charges in federal court in Hawaii last October. He pleaded not guilty Tuesday following his extradition.",
      "If convicted, Pokornik faces up to 20 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, plus a term of supervised release, the Justice Department said.",
      "According to court documents, Pokornik was a flight attendant for a Toronto-based airline from 2017 to 2019, then used fake employee identification from that carrier to obtain tickets reserved for pilots and flight attendants on three other airlines.",
      "U.S. prosecutors said Tuesday that Pokornik even requested to sit in an extra seat in the cockpit - the \"jump seat\" - typically reserved for off-duty pilots. It wasn't clear from court documents whether he ever actually rode in a plane's cockpit, and the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to say.",
      "The indictment didn't identify the airlines except to say they're based in Honolulu, Chicago and Fort Worth, Texas. Representatives for Hawaiian Airlines, United Airlines and American Airlines - which are respectively based in those cities - didn't immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Air Canada, which is based in Toronto, also didn't respond to an email seeking comment.",

      "Glassdoor bases its rankings on insiders' takes on criteria that can determine a\u00a0good job, ranging from opportunities for career growth to satisfaction with compensation and benefits. Its proprietary awards algorithm analyzed anonymous reviews of U.S.-based employers posted on the site from October 2024 through October 2025.",
      "\"Flexibility is extremely important for employees right now, and that doesn't just mean remote work,\" Glassdoor chief economist Daniel Zhao told CBS News. \"Some companies are willing to be flexible on hours or give more autonomy to workers in terms of how they manage their careers.\"",
      "Still, most American workers are disengaged at work, meaning they're either doing the bare minimum or are resentful or unhappy, Gallup's latest State of the Global Workplace report found. Only 3 in 10 workers are engaged, the lowest level in a decade.",
      "Engaged workers tend to have higher productivity and create better business outcomes, Gallup noted. Workers are checking out amid new pressures in the workplace, from the disruption of artificial intelligence to budget cuts, Gallup said.",
      "Tech companies losing dominance",
      "Although tech companies remain the best-represented industry on the list, taking 24 spots, they appear to be losing their luster among workers. That number is down from 26 spots in 2025 and 31 in 2024.",
      "\"This is part of an ongoing trend where many tech employers are trimming some of the things that made the job so appealing over the last year,\" Zhao said. \"They are pushing harder and harder on efficiency and productivity.\"",
      "To be sure, \"there is still an enormous career and income upside, and you see that reflected in chipmaker Nvidia ranking third,\" he said.",
      "This year's rankings added nineteen companies to the list, including Alaska Airlines at No. 38, Bath and Body Works at No. 80, Dutch Bros Coffee at No. 75 and Bank of America at No. 96.",
      "Only two companies have made the list for each of the 18 years Glassdoor has released the rankings: Bain & Company, which ranked No. 8 in 2026, and Google, which stands at No. 11 this year.",
      "Some white-collar employers are also dropping off the list, as some workers start to view blue-collar work as less likely to be supplanted by AI, Zhao said.",
      "\"There is still a balance with many industries represented,\" Zhao said. \"But it is reflective of the overall trend in the job market where we are seeing hiring freeze up in white-collar industries.\"",

      "Major tech stocks took a hit, with the Nasdaq Composite sinking 2.4%. Nvidia and Amazon shares dropped 3.6% and 3.7%, respectively.",
      "The rocky day on Wall Street came after President Trump said on Saturday on Truth Social that he would impose a\u00a010% tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland beginning in February. Trump said the tariffs would rise to 25% on June 1 and apply to imports from NATO countries until a deal is reached for the purchase of Greenland.",

      "The European Union accounts for a large share of U.S. imports, with annual shipments from its member nations exceeding those from Mexico and China combined.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-10-percent-credit-card-rate-cap-banks-january-20/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:33:32 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year 10% cap on credit card rates starting Jan. 20. Here's what credit card companies are doing.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump had set Jan. 20 as a deadline for credit card companies to lower their interest rates to 10% for one year. Now that the date has arrived, most banks and card issuers have largely kept their rates unchanged, while also pushing back against an idea that they say lacks key policy details necessary for them to comply.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the cap on Jan. 9, giving banks and issuers just 11 days to meet his demand. In his Truth Social post announcing the proposal, he said he wanted to ensure that Americans wouldn't get \"'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration.\"",
      "The interest rate cap has drawn bipartisan support from some lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri. If enacted, the proposal could save consumers $100 billion per year in reduced interest payments, but the banking industry warns that it could backfire because issuers would be forced to reduce credit access to millions of consumers.",
      "Banks and credit issuers are also seeking more information about the cap, although Mr. Trump has announced no further details on how he'd legislate or enforce the proposed one-year limit on the annual percentage rate (APR) that credit issuers can charge consumers.",
      "Credit card rates have been sliding lower during the past year, thanks partly to the Federal Reserve's series of 2025 rate cuts. The average APR stood at 19.7% at the end of December, a full percentage point lower than the record high set in August 2024, according to Bankrate.",
      "And many banks offer zero-percent APR cards, which typically provide cards with no interest for an introductory period of, say, 12 to 15 months. After that period, the cards' APRs can rise to a range of roughly 17% to 27%, depending on a consumer's credit score. Mr. Trump's proposal would cap those rates to 10%, as well as any other card that's currently above that level.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Mr. Trump expects credit card companies to comply with the demand.",
      "\"I don't have a specific consequence to outline for you, but certainly this is an expectation and frankly a demand that the president has made,\" she said Jan. 16.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on how it will enforce the policy or determine if banks are complying with the new proposed rule.",
      "What do experts say?",
      "Banks and bank lobbyists say they are largely in the dark on how to respond to the proposed cap.",
      "Currently, there's no law or executive order in place mandating that lenders charge no more than 10% interest on credit cards. There's also no generally applicable federal law that limits the interest rate that can be charged by a credit card company, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "Experts say that a rate cap would likely require approval from Congress.",
      "Mr. Trump could seek to drum up support around a bipartisan bill, such as this one introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2025, said Brian Shearer, the author of the Vanderbilt University\u00a0analysis\u00a0that found a 10% limit would save consumers $100 billion per year in interest payments.",
      "If that bill became law, Mr. Trump could force banks to comply. But mandating a rate cap through an executive action may not be enforceable, he said.",
      "How are banks responding?",
      "Because a cap on APRs would eat into bank profits, card issuers would be likely to cut off the most vulnerable borrowers from credit, banks and bank lobbyists say.",
      "Two-thirds of credit card users carrying a balance would be likely to see their credit lines reduced or canceled entirely, according to a Jan. 12\u00a0analysis from America's Credit Unions, an industry group representing credit unions. Almost all 47 million Americans with a subprime credit score would lose access to credit, the group found.",
      "In a Jan. 12 investor call, JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum said the proposed interest rate cap would be bad for consumers and could hurt the economy.",
      "\"Specifically, people will lose access to credit, like on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it the most, ironically,\" he said. \"And so, that's a pretty severely negative consequence for consumers, and frankly, probably also a negative consequence for the economy as a whole right now.\"",
      "The bank also pointed to products it already offers consumers, including cards that offer customers introductory interest rates of 0% for up to 18 months.",
      "In the meantime, one company is stepping up to offer new credit cards that meet Mr. Trump's proposal. Bilt, a fintech company, said it is\u00a0rolling out new credit cards\u00a0that cap interest rates at 10% for one year.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:28:57 -0500",
    "summary": "A new BNPL pilot from financial technology company Affirm will give renters the option to break up their rent into two equal payments.",
    "story": [
      "Americans have historically turned to buy now, pay later (BNPL) financing to cover the cost of everyday expenses like groceries and consumer purchases such as clothing and furniture. Now, some of these lending companies are turning their attention to a bigger expense: Monthly rent.",
      "A new BNPL option from fintech company Affirm will give renters the option to break up their rent into two equal payments instead of a single lump sum payment.",
      "Affirm, one of the biggest BNPL companies, told CBS News the service is starting as a limited pilot program through a partnership with New York-based company Esusu. The latter company reports consumers' payment information to the major credit agencies, according to its website.",
      "A spokesperson from Affirm said the company underwrites every application and approves only people it believes can \"responsibly afford to repay.\"",
      "\"If a tenant applies through Esusu and is approved by Affirm, they are eligible to receive a 0% interest loan to be repaid in two, biweekly installments without any fees,\" the spokesperson said in an email. \"Esusu and Affirm are not offering interest-bearing loans as part of this program.\"",
      "Affirm isn't the first company to offer BNPL loans for rent payments, but it could have a wider reach, according to Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, an association of non-profit consumer organizations. Approximately 24 million Americans use Affirm's BNPL services.",
      "\"Affirm is one of the leaders in this space,\" Rust said. \"Their reach is going to be different.\"",
      "The Affirm spokesperson did not disclose how long the pilot will last or whether it plans to expand the BNPL rent option once the pilot ends. Fintech company Zip also offers a BNPL product for rent, according to trade publication PaymentsDive.",
      "BNPL comes with risks",
      "BNPL has grown in popularity because it gives consumers the option to split their payments into multiple bite-sized installments rather than paying the full cost of big-ticket items up front.",
      "A December report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that upwards of 50 million consumers took out at least one BNPL loan in 2023 from one of the six major lenders in 2023.",
      "BNPL plans typically give customers the option to pay back the cost of a purchase in four installments with no interest, according to CFPB.",
      "While this may seem like an alluring option, it can come with hidden risks. Taking out multiple loans with different deadlines can make it difficult to keep track of repayments and lead to missed payments, for which some companies charge late fees.",
      "\"It is easy to get turned around,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree.",
      "In some cases, missed BNPL payments can get reported to the credit bureaus, taking a toll on your credit score.",
      "Affirm says on its website that it's the only major BNPL service to report loan activity to U.S. credit bureaus. The San Francisco-based company shares payment information with Experian and TransUnion, two of the three main credit reporting agencies.",
      "Housing security",
      "Experts, meanwhile, have warned that BNPL can be a slippery slope that can end up pushing consumers further into debt \u2014 an issue that could pose bigger risks when dealing with monthly rent.",
      "\"You can see the problem of how borrowing could lead to a death spiral that actually threatens a tenant's housing security,\" Rust said, adding that few examples exist where tenants can borrow money to pay their rent.",
      "Schulz thinks Affirm's new option could offer tenants more flexibility, but said it could also cause people to overextend themselves.",
      "\"They might feel like they can afford a bigger monthly rent because they're able to spread the cost out over multiple paychecks,\" he said. \"That's a pretty risky game.\"",
      "Still, Schulz thinks BNPL for rent will only continue to grow in popularity as people seek out flexible payment options.",
      "\"Lenders and businesses are clearly seeing the demand for these types of offerings, and I'd suspect that we will only see more of these loans in the near future,\" he said.",

    "summary": "What's a \"peanut butter\" raise? Here's what it means, and why this is the type of pay hike you should expect this year.",
    "story": [
      "Your 2026 pay raise could be a \"peanut-butter\"-style increase, with new research from compensation expert Payscale finding more than four in 10 companies are opting to give identical, across-the-board hikes rather than merit-based raises.",
      "This year, 44% of companies plan to rely on the peanut-butter approach \u2014 a method of evenly spreading pay hikes across the workforce \u2014 according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0from Payscale.",
      "Some employers are moving away from performance-based pay increases because of concerns that the practice is too subjective and potentially biased, Payscale noted. Spreading pay hikes out evenly across a workforce is also easier from an administrative perspective, which can save companies money.",
      "Pay hikes will hold steady at 3.5% in 2026, unchanged from 2025, the group found. Still, merit-based pay hikes remain the predominant method used by companies, with 48% of organizations saying they plan to rely on performance-based raises, Payscale said.",
      "There are downsides to peanut-butter raises, as they can discourage some employees from putting in extra effort if they don't expect they'll be rewarded for going the extra mile, Payscale said.",
      "\"With no differentiation based on performance, it's easier to give everyone something. But there is a risk that top performers will feel disadvantaged in that environment,\" Ruth Thomas, chief compensation strategist at Payscale, told CBS News.",
      "She noted that companies that eschew merit-based pay increases can still reward top performers with bonuses or promotions, for example.",
      "\"Base pay is not your only lever, and organizations may look more at bonuses and promotions when base pay budgets are restricted,\" she added.",
      "Peanut-butter raises started gaining traction after the Great Recession as budget-constrained companies turned to the strategy, Thomas said. She added that more companies are once again tightening their budgets.",
      "\"We're now seeing a slow decline in pay increase budgets again, so it's easier to give everyone a relatively flat increase,\" Thomas said.",
      "Small company, big raise",
      "Smaller establishments with fewer than 100 employees are offering higher pay increases \u2014 4% \u2014 compared to their larger counterparts. Businesses with between about 10,000 to 50,000 workers said they plan to hand out 3% raises in 2026, the report found.",
      "\"Smaller employers appear to be using pay more aggressively to compete for talent, while larger organizations face structural and budgetary challenges that limit flexibility,\" the researchers said in the report.",
      "Average raises also vary by industry, with companies in sectors struggling to find workers offering above-average pay hikes. For example, these sectors are offering above-average pay increases:",

    "summary": "\"We have a fiduciary duty to Nippon,\" U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said, but noted, \"We're still mined, melted and made in the good ol' USA.\"",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Steel's acquisition last year by Japan's Nippon Steel came with a notable condition to win approval from the Trump administration: a so-called \"golden share\" that gives President Trump the power to approve certain major corporate decisions, including closing plants or changing locations. But CEO David Burritt tells CBS News, \"There's nothing in this golden share that prevents us from doing what we want to do.\"",
      "\"We're aligned with what the president wants us to do. In fact, we wouldn't agree to this thing if we weren't sure it was going to be great for our workers and great for our company,\" Burritt told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil at one of the company's plants in Pittsburgh.",
      "Burritt downplayed some of the provisions in the deal, saying there were certain aspects that would need approval, such as changing the company's name or being forced to follow existing trade laws, that don't have any impact on what U.S. Steel's plans were to begin with.",
      "But asked if the company would require Mr. Trump's approval for business decisions down the line, such as closing a plant, Burritt insisted, \"We don't see us closing the plant. In fact, we just did have an opening here because of demand increasing at Granite City [Illinois].\"",
      "Burritt said, despite Mr. Trump's own claims last year, that the president did not veto the company's decision to close down the Granite City operation, which had been dormant since 2023. He said the company recently restarted a blast furnace at the location due to increased customer demand.",
      "Burritt acknowledged that in the future, \"If we had to make a difficult business decision, we would have to get approval to close a plant.\"",
      "\"But we don't see a reason to do that,\" he added.",
      "\"We can't guarantee things are going to stay open,\" Burritt said. \"We are going to manage the business and we're going to keep a great relationship with this administration, who did so much for us and the United States, to help get this deal done.\"",
      "Burritt touted the acquisition, saying, \"Without the partnership, we would not be able to invest as much money as what we are now. ... This is really a wonderful thing for the workers, and the workers are the ones who made this happen.\"",
      "He also highlighted the $14 billion investment from the deal that, he says, the company will be spending in the coming years, supporting as many as \"100,000 direct or indirect jobs.\"",
      "Burritt said, despite the acquisition, U.S. Steel is \"absolutely\" still a U.S. company.",
      "\"U.S. Steel Corporation: That's our brand. That's our name. Headquartered right here in Pittsburgh, and we're gonna keep it there and continue to build here,\" he said.",
      "\"We have a fiduciary duty to national security. And we have a fiduciary duty to Nippon. We keep them aligned and it's a beautiful thing,\" he said, adding: \"We're still mined, melted and made in the good ol' USA.\"",
      "Burritt called Mr. Trump's tariffs a \"game changer,\" saying, \"We really appreciate that the tariffs are in place. This strengthens national security, economic security and also makes sure we have job security and creates jobs.\"",

      "As in every tax season, a filer's situation will hinge on multiple factors.",
      "\"Everyone's situation is different,\" said Kate Wood, a lending expert from NerdWallet. \"It's hard to say kind of how everything is going to stack up for most homeowners, because so much will depend on your income and then also where you live.\"",
      "Still, it can pay \u2014 quite literally \u2014 to be prepared.",
      "The deductions available to homeowners are fairly consistent with years past, with a few changes following last year's passage of the Republicans' new tax and spending law.",
      "The IRS will start accepting tax returns on Jan. 26.",
      "What deductions can I claim as a homeowner?",
      "The mortgage interest deduction remains one of the chief tax breaks for homeowners.",
      "However, fewer people have claimed this since the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which nearly doubled the size of the standard deduction, Wood said. Still, it remains an option for taxpayers who itemize \u2014 meaning they add up eligible expenses such as mortgage interest, state and local taxes and charitable donations, and claim them only if the combined total exceeds the standard deduction.",
      "The standard deduction for 2025 is $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly.",
      "Filers can deduct up to $750,000 of mortgage debt, or up to $375,000 for married people who file separately, according to the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Other common deductions for homeowners, according to NerdWallet, include:",
      "Home equity loan and home equity line of credit (HELOC) interest.\u00a0\u00a0Filers can only take this deduction if the money was spent on qualifying home improvements. \"Say you took out a home equity loan because you were trying to consolidate other debt, or something like that,\" Wood said. \"In that case, the interest would not be deductible.\"Home office expenses.

      "What's new this year?",
      "There are two main changes this year for homeowners stemming from the \"big, beautiful bill\" act that President Trump signed into law last year.",
      "The first is the expansion of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The \"big, beautiful bill\" Act raises the cap from $10,000 to $40,000, allowing taxpayers to deduct up to $40,000 in combined property taxes and either state and local income taxes or sales taxes.",
      "Single filers can now deduct up to to $40,000, while married couples can deduct up to $20,000 each if they are filing separately. The deduction phases out for people with adjusted gross incomes over $500,000.",
      "The degree to which any given filer will benefit from the higher SALT cap will depend on where they live, the type of property they own and the amount they pay in property taxes, Wood said.",
      "\"If you're someone who has a large, high-interest-rate mortgage, and you're living in a high property tax area, you could potentially get a significant boost from itemizing,\" she said. \"But if you're someone who's paying low interest, has a modest mortgage, is in a lower tax location, the standard deduction might be just fine for you.\"",
      "The second major change homeowners should be aware of is the elimination of energy-focused\u00a0home improvement tax credits, which were phased out at the end of 2025 under the \"big, beautiful bill.\" The credits were intended to help taxpayers offset the cost of clean-energy upgrades, such as installing solar panels or improving insulation.",
      "To qualify for the credits this tax season, homeowners must have completed their energy upgrades in 2025, Wood said. \"Not just that you purchased the items, but that the work was completed by Dec. 31, 2025,\" she said.",

    "published": "Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:53:52 -0500",
    "summary": "Nearly 3,000 high-level participants from business, government and beyond are converging on the Swiss town of Davos for the annual meeting.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly 3,000 high-level participants from business, government and beyond \u2014 plus untold numbers of activists, journalists and outside observers \u2014 are converging in the Swiss town of Davos this week for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.",
      "What is the World Economic Forum?",
      "The forum is a think tank and event organizer based in Geneva whose main event \u2014 the annual meeting \u2014 debuted in 1971 in Davos, a ski-resort town of about 10,000 people at a height of about 1,500 meters (nearly 5,000 feet) in the Alps of eastern Switzerland.",
      "The first edition, hosted by forum founder Klaus Schwab, featured a gathering of business executives.",
      "Since then, the meeting has swelled into a catch-all conference on issues as diverse as economic disparity, climate change, technology, and global cooperation \u2014 as well as competition and conflict.",
      "This year's event runs from Jan. 19-23.",
      "What is the theme at this year's Davos forum?",
      "Davos conference organizers always trot out buzzwords for the meeting, and this year's is \"A Spirit of Dialogue\" \u2014 around five themes of cooperation, growth, investment in people, innovation and building prosperity. More than 200 sessions will tackle a wide array of issues.",
      "Critics say Davos is too much talk and not enough action to rectify gaping inequality in the world and address troubles like climate change.",
      "The world's richest people saw their fortunes surge in 2025, part of a long-running trend of widening wealth inequality, according to a\u00a0new report from anti-poverty charity Oxfam released to coincide with the forum. The wealth of billionaires grew three times faster last year than the average pace of the previous five years, reaching a record $18.3 trillion, the group said.",
      "At the same time, one in four people worldwide experiences food insecurity and regularly skips meals, Oxfam said.",
      "\"The widening gap between the rich and the rest is at the same time creating a political deficit that is highly dangerous and unsustainable,\" said Oxfam executive director Amitabh Behar in a statement.",
      "Who will attend in 2026?",
      "Organizers says a record of nearly 400 top political leaders, including more than 60 heads of state and government, and nearly 850 chairs and chief executives of many of the world's leading companies.",
      "Headlining the lineup is U.S. President Donald Trump, who's set to deliver a speech on Wednesday, and several Cabinet ministers and top advisers including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron of France, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, President Ahmad al-Sharaa of Syria, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Felix Tshisekedi of Congo, Vice Premier He Lifeng of China, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine are among the who's-who of top attendees.",
      "Organizers say 55 ministers for economy and finance, 33 ministers for foreign affairs, 34 ministers for trade, commerce and industry, and 11 central bank governors are also expected.",
      "Tech titans scheduled to be on hand include Jensen Huang of Nvidia. Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind, and Arthur Mensch of France's Mistral AI.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala are among scores of top officials from international institutions.",
      "What other issues are at stake?",
      "The geopolitical context has become incredibly complex this year: Trump's pronouncements and policies on subjects as diverse as Venezuela, Greenland and Iran \u2014 not to mention his tariff policies \u2014 have raised questions about America's role in the world.",
      "The advent of AI \u2014 its promise and perils \u2014 has also become a hot topic. Business executives will examine how to apply it to boost efficiency and profits; labor leaders and advocacy groups will warn of its threat to jobs and livelihoods, and policymakers will look to navigate the best way forward between regulation and right to innovate.",

    "story": [
      "A Georgia-based food company has recalled thousands of pounds of ready-to-eat chicken products, which were sold in seven different states, after determining the products may have been contaminated with listeria, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0announced.",
      "Suzanna's Kitchen, headquartered in Norcross, Georgia, recalled roughly 13,720 pounds of its ready-to-eat grilled chicken breast fillet products, according to the Food Safety and Inspection Service, a branch of the Department of Agriculture.",
      "The recalled products were produced on Oct. 14, 2025, and sold in 10-pound cases containing two 5-pound bags of cooked grilled chicken breast fillets with rib meat, health officials said. They were sent to distribution centers for food service sales in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Ohio.",
      "There have been no confirmed reports of illness linked to the consumption of the recalled products. Officials said the problem was discovered by a third-party laboratory, which tested the chicken fillets and reported a positive result for Listeria monocytogenes, a type of disease-causing bacteria that can infect people when they eat food that has been contaminated with it.",
      "The bacteria can be found in a number of places, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including soil, water, sewage, vegetation and animals. It can survive and grow even when products it contaminates are refrigerated, and is generally transmitted when food is \"harvested, processed, prepared, packed, transported, or stored in manufacturing or production environments contaminated with L. monocytogenes,\" the FDA says.",
      "Listeria infections are the third-leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimates that 1,250 people contract the infection each year and 172 people die from it.",
      "Although no illnesses have been reported in connection with the recalled products from Suzanna's Kitchen, officials have encouraged anyone with concerns to contact a healthcare provider.",
      "Cases and packaging of potentially contaminated meat have the establishment number P-1382 inside the USDA mark of inspection. They also have the lot code 60104 P1382 287 5 J14.",

    "published": "Sat, 17 Jan 2026 07:00:13 -0500",
    "summary": "As the president prepares to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, he's made no secret of his goal for lower interest rates \u2014 but there are a few political roadblocks in the way.",
    "story": [
      "As President Trump prepares to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming months, he hasn't been shy about his goal for the powerful economic posting: lower interest rates.",
      "\"I want somebody that when the market is doing great, interest rates can go down because our country becomes stronger,\" the president said during a speech in Detroit on Tuesday. He's long pushed for lower rates, which could boost economic growth and make it cheaper to borrow.",
      "He has also made no secret of his frustration with outgoing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who has supported cutting interest rates at a fairly slow clip, wary of causing inflation to resurge. For months, Mr. Trump has called Powell \u2014 whom the president appointed Fed chief during his first term \u2014 a \"moron,\" a \"stubborn mule,\" a \"real stiff\" and \"Mr. Too Late.\"",
      "And then, in a surprising Sunday night video message, Powell announced the Fed had received grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department \"threatening a criminal indictment\" over Powell's testimony to Congress about a pricey renovation to the Fed's headquarters. He accused the administration of using the renovation cost overruns and his testimony as \"pretexts.\" He also argued the independence of the Fed, which operates separately from the executive branch and isn't funded by tax dollars, is at risk.",
      "\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said, asserting that this threat \"is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions \u2014 or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\"",
      "The White House says Mr. Trump didn't direct the Justice Department to issue subpoenas, and U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro has insisted the subpoenas were \"not a threat,\" but were instead issued because the Fed wasn't answering questions. In an interview with CBS News, Mr. Trump brushed off allegations of political retribution, saying: \"I can't help what it looks like.\"",
      "But the subpoenas have outraged some Republican lawmakers, jeopardizing Mr. Trump's plan to immediately nominate a new Fed chair when Powell's term ends in May.",
      "That congressional pushback is just the latest roadblock in Mr. Trump's quest to get the Fed to cut rates. There's also the looming possibility that Powell could remain on the Federal Reserve's board even after his term as chair ends. And ultimately, the decisions on interest rates are made by a committee that's largely out of the president's reach.",
      "\"As we learned this week, [Mr. Trump] may not have as much freedom to pick a Fed chair as he thought,\" David Wessel, director of the Brookings Institution's Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, told CBS News.",
      "New Fed chair will need to get through a skeptical Senate",
      "Mr. Trump has identified two leading candidates to replace Powell as Fed chair: White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett and former Fed board member Kevin Warsh.",
      "\"The two Kevins are very good,\" the president told Reuters.",
      "But the next chair will need to be confirmed by the Senate \u2014 and there are signs the Justice Department's investigation into Powell could complicate things, as several GOP lawmakers have raised concerns that the Fed's delicate independence may be at risk.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina reacted furiously to the Powell probe, writing on X that Trump advisers were \"actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve.\"",
      "\"I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed\u2014including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy\u2014until this legal matter is fully resolved,\" Tillis wrote just hours after Powell publicly announced the subpoenas.",
      "Tillis sits on the Senate Banking Committee, and if he were to vote with the panel's Democrats to oppose Mr. Trump's nominee, the committee would deadlock 12-12.",
      "Any nominee who makes it to the full Senate could face skepticism from several other Senate Republicans. In the current Senate, Mr. Trump can afford to lose only three GOP votes if all Democrats vote against his Federal Reserve pick.",
      "Among the GOP skeptics: Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told reporters that Powell's video revealing the subpoenas raised \"a lot of disturbing questions,\" and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she sees the investigation as a bid to \"intimidate, threaten and coerce.\" Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said he thinks it's unlikely that Powell did anything wrong and warned the conflict between Mr. Trump and the Fed chief could be economically damaging.",
      "\"If you wanted to design a system to cause interest rates to go up and not down, you would have the Federal Reserve of the United States and the executive branch of the United States get into a pissing contest. We don't need it,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who has the ability to bypass a deadlocked Banking Committee and enable a nominee to reach the floor for a vote, acknowledged to reporters Monday that the investigation could make it challenging to confirm new nominees to the Fed.",
      "\"If the Justice Department is pursuing something, I hope they have a smoking gun or something, because I don't think you trifle with the Federal Reserve,\" the South Dakota Republican said Tuesday.",
      "What if Powell doesn't step down?",
      "Another possible wrinkle: Powell's term as Fed chair expires in May, but his term as a rank-and-file member of the Fed's Board of Governors doesn't end for another two years.",
      "All seven members of the board serve 14-year terms, but the board's chair serves a separate four-year term. In recent history, most Fed chairs have resigned from the board altogether when their time as boss runs out, but there's nothing requiring them to do so.",
      "Powell has served on the Fed since 2012. He was nominated to a 14-year term by former President Barack Obama two years later, was elevated to chair during Mr. Trump's first term and was nominated to a second term as chair by former President Joe Biden. The 72-year-old Powell hasn't said whether he plans to leave the Fed when his term as chair expires.",
      "Murkowski told reporters Monday that if the goal of the scrutiny on Powell is to get him to speed up his departure from the Fed, it could have the opposite effect.",
      "\"When you get pressured, when you get threatened in this way, most of us would say, 'I'm not going anywhere,'\" she said.",
      "Wessel told CBS News he doesn't think Powell is likely to stay on the Fed board, but said: \"I do think there's a possibility, and I think the possibility went up over the last week.\"",
      "If Powell decides to stick around until his term ends in January 2028, it could cause a few problems for Mr. Trump's push for a Fed that aligns with his views on interest rates.",
      "Because the new Fed chair must be selected from among the existing seven Fed governors, there needs to be a vacancy on the board in order for Mr. Trump to appoint a new person as chair. If Powell doesn't create a vacancy by resigning, the president would likely need to nominate his chair to the board seat currently occupied by Stephen Miran.",
      "A Trump economic adviser, Miran was confirmed to a short-term posting on the Fed board last year after a Biden-nominated governor resigned before her term expired. His term as a Fed governor ends on Jan. 31, but it's not clear if Mr. Trump had planned to nominate him to a fresh 14-year term after that. (If a successor to Miran isn't nominated when his current term ends, he can remain in place until the Senate confirms a replacement, under federal law.)",
      "If Mr. Trump replaces Miran with his handpicked Fed chair and Powell remains on the board, only three of the Fed's seven governors would be Trump nominees: the chair, plus two officials who were initially appointed during Mr. Trump's first term, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller.",
      "That could increase to four Trump nominees out of seven after Powell's term ends in 2028. But the three remaining governors \u2014 all Biden nominees \u2014 have terms that end in 2032 or later, keeping them on the Fed until well after Mr. Trump leaves office unless they choose to resign.",
      "Chair doesn't set interest rates on his own",
      "The composition of the Fed's rank-and-file board members matters for Mr. Trump because, when it comes to interest rate-setting decisions, the chair is technically one vote out of a dozen.",
      "Interest rate policy is overseen by a 12-member panel called the Federal Open Market Committee, which is made up of all seven Fed governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating cast of four of the other 11 regional Fed bank chiefs.",
      "Mr. Trump has very little control over the regional Fed presidents who sit on the committee. They're hired for five-year terms by each regional bank's board of directors, and while the Fed's Board of Governors needs to approve their appointments, the board voted unanimously to extend most sitting regional bank presidents' terms until 2031 last month. Wessel said the board can fire presidents.",
      "So, depending on whether Powell stays on the Fed, either three or four of the Federal Open Market Committee's 12 members are set to be Trump nominees.",
      "When the committee meets eight times a year to set interest rate targets, the Fed chair traditionally plays a key role in helping the panel form consensus, but the members vote on their own. It's not uncommon for members to dissent from the committee's decisions, and there's no guarantee that their views will align with Mr. Trump's.",
      "\"If they don't respect the chairman, and the chairman bows to pressure from Trump and wants to do a deep interest rate cut that the other members of the committee think is nuts, they will vote against it,\" Wessel said.",
      "Dissents have been commonplace in recent months. When the committee voted to leave rates flat in July, Bowman and Waller pushed for a rate cut \u2014 but their stance hinged on a belief that the economy is softening, not that it's extremely strong as Mr. Trump argues. And in December, when the committee voted to cut rates by 0.25 points, Miran dissented and called for a larger 0.5-point cut, while two regional presidents favored no cut at all.",
      "And if Powell stays on as a Fed governor, Wessell said he could have \"considerable influence,\" too.",
      "Can Trump fire Fed officials?",
      "Mr. Trump is fighting in court for an extra board seat \u2014 and for more power to shape the board.",
      "Over the summer, the president attempted to fire board member Lisa Cook, accusing the Biden nominee of making false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "The dramatic move posed the first-ever test of a president's power to fire Fed members. Under federal law, the president can only remove board members \"for cause,\" a term that isn't defined.",
      "Cook has sued over the firing, arguing that an \"unsubstantiated allegation about private mortgage applications\" doesn't meet the law's requirement for cause. But the Trump administration has argued the president acted within his power.",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in Cook's case on Jan. 21. The courts have let Cook remain in her job \u2014 and vote on interest rate policy \u2014 while the lawsuit plays out, but the federal government is asking the Supreme Court to allow her to be removed for the time being.",
      "It's not clear how the high court might rule. In a separate case that's also set to be decided this term, the Supreme Court appears to be leaning toward giving the president more power to fire members of independent government agencies without cause. But the court has hinted in the past that it views the Federal Reserve as special.",
      "In an order last year that let Mr. Trump fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, the Supreme Court explicitly said that the Fed wouldn't be impacted, calling it a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "The case could have broad implications for whether the Fed remains independent.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is delaying its plans to withhold pay from student loan borrowers who default on their payments, backing off a measure that threatened to deliver a financial blow to millions of Americans.",
      "The Education Department announced Friday that involuntary collections on federal student loans will remain on hold as the agency finalizes new repayment plans. The shift reverses course on earlier plans to restart wage garnishments this month after a pandemic-era pause.",
      "Nicholas Kent, the department's higher education chief, said the agency is \"committed to helping student and parent borrowers resume regular, on-time repayment, with more clear and affordable options.\"",
      "\"The Department determined that involuntary collection efforts such as Administrative Wage Garnishment and the Treasury Offset Program will function more efficiently and fairly after the Trump Administration implements significant improvements to our broken student loan system,\" Kent said in a statement.",
      "Federal student loan borrowers can have their wages garnished and their federal tax refunds withheld if they default on their loans, meaning they are at least 270 days behind on payments. The penalties were put on hold during a pandemic-era pause on student loan payments that the Trump administration lifted.",
      "Last spring, Trump officials said they would resume targeting tax refunds for borrowers in default. In December, officials said they would restart wage garnishment in January, with initial notices being sent to 1,000 borrowers the week of Jan. 7.",
      "Both penalties \u2014 withholding wages and federal payments \u2014 are being paused, according to the Friday announcement.",
      "The department did not set a new date for involuntary collections. It said the delay will give borrowers time to evaluate new repayment plans that are scheduled to be available starting July 1.",
      "Secretary of Education Linda McMahon indicated earlier this week that the department was planning to pause wage garnishment efforts in remarks to local reporters in Rhode Island.",
      "More than 5 million Americans were in default on their federal student loans as of September, according to department data. Millions more have fallen behind on loan payments and are at risk of going into default this year. Nearly 10% of borrowers were delinquent by more than 90 days in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Payments on student loans were paused from March 2020 to April 2023, and for a one-year grace period after that, borrowers who missed payments could avoid default. The Education Department announced in May that it would resume collections activity.",
      "McMahon said earlier this week that \"we had an incredible falloff in people repaying their loans\" during the pandemic-era pause.",
      "Friday's announcement was welcomed by student loan advocates who urged the department not to resume wage garnishment.",
      "\"The administration's plans would have been economically reckless and would have risked pushing nearly 9 million defaulted borrowers even further into debt,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the nonprofit Protect Borrowers, told the Associated Press.",
      "Congress last year ordered the department to overhaul repayment plans that critics said had become too confusing. New borrowers will have two options: a standard plan and a plan that lowers payments based on the borrower's income.",
      "Last month the department scrapped the SAVE Plan, which was created under former President Joe Biden and offered lower payments and a quicker path to student loan forgiveness. The plan had been blocked by a federal judge after Missouri and other states challenged it in court.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration says it has completed the first sale of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. Will it mean lower prices at the pump?",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says it has completed the first sale of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. \u2014 a shipment the president valued at $500 million.",
      "It's part of the administration's push to tap into Venezuela's oil reserves, some of the largest in the world.",
      "What does that mean for U.S. drivers?",
      "Gas is currently at $2.67 a gallon nationally, the lowest it's been since May 2021. But prices have been steadily declining since last November, weeks before the U.S. military operation\u00a0that captured Venezuela's autocratic leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Will Venezuelan oil push prices even lower?",
      "Economists are divided on when or how much these developments may affect consumer prices.",
      "\"If I know prices are going to be lower in the future because I expect this Venezuelan crude, that'll impact prices now,\" said Dr. Ian Lange, a professor of economics and business at the Colorado School of Mines. He also served as a senior economist on the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Trump's first term.",
      "However, others say it's too soon for Venezuela to be a factor at the pump.",
      "\"It's far too early for any measurable impact on what consumers are paying at the pump \u2014 whether prices go up or down \u2014 as it would likely take years to see a meaningful increase in oil output there,\" wrote Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, in their weekly price update.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. imported nearly 3.1 billion barrels of crude oil, and just 2.75% came from Venezuela. Even before 2019 sanctions, Venezuelan oil made up roughly 8% of yearly U.S. imports \u2014 about the same share Mexico holds today.",
      "In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Venezuela supplied 1 to 1.8 million barrels per day to the United States. Now the country's current production caps at 750,000 barrels per day.",
      "Returning to that higher level of production, if possible, wouldn't necessarily be a good thing for the global oil supply chain.",
      "\"A big ramp-up in production from Venezuela would sort of add to an already oversupplied market,\" said Lange.",
      "In any case, that ramp-up in production hasn't happened yet.\u00a0Venezuela's oil infrastructure\u00a0has suffered from years of underinvestment, corruption and sanctions, and so far, U.S. companies appear\u00a0reluctant to invest\u00a0in rebuilding it.",
      "\"It could take years of positive developments for additional supply to meaningfully move the needle,\" said De Haan. \"The impact on U.S. gasoline prices may ultimately be limited.\"",
      "Over the past decade, Canadian crude has dominated U.S. heavy oil imports while sanctions have virtually ceased Venezuelan shipments.",
      "Canada now supplies the majority of the heavy crude that American refineries need.",
      "\"It's certainly possible that a large increase in the oil coming out of Venezuela outcompetes Canadian oil, even as most of our refineries are going to be in the Gulf Coast,\" Lange said.",
      "But Lange says Venezuela is not ready to compete in that way right now. It depends on concessions from the Venezuelan government to U.S. energy producers.",
      "Why the U.S. needs heavy crude oil",
      "The U.S. is one of the world's largest oil producers. So why Import billions of barrels per year?",
      "It comes down to the type of oil. The U.S. produces mostly \"light crude,\" which is less dense and cheaper to refine. But American refineries, especially those along the Gulf Coast, are designed to process a mix of light and heavy crude.",
      "\"Most of our production of crude oil in the United States is on the light side, and most refineries need a mix of light and heavy,\" Lange said. \"Right now, we get a lot of our heavies from Canada, which may be supplemented by Venezuela in the near future.\"",
      "Venezuela's oil reserves total roughly 300 billion barrels \u2014 about 17% of the world's proven reserves. Much of it is heavy rude, exactly what Gulf Coast refineries need.",
      "If Venezuela can ramp up production, it could mean competition with Canada \u2014 and that's good for consumers, according to Lange.",
      "\"Refineries would pay less as they play the Canadians and the Venezuelans off each other,\" Lange said. \"And that would lead to a lower price of refined products for the end consumer.\"",
      "Can prices drop too low?",
      "More oil sounds good for drivers. But flooding an already oversupplied market carries risks.",
      "If crude prices fall too far, American producers start to cut back. Light crude \u2014 the kind that the U.S. produces \u2014 would become less profitable to drill. The going price for a barrel of oil, roughly 42 gallons, is just over $60.",
      "Experts caution scaling back would mean closing down refineries and cutting industry jobs in places like Texas and the Dakotas.",
      "\"If we don't import crude, we'd close a refinery. And that's not good,\" Lange said. \"That's jobs and economic activity.\"",
      "The cycle of supply and demand continues. If domestic production slows, supply tightens and prices rise again.",

      "Airlines could have weight loss drug manufacturers to thank for savings if passengers become lighter, allowing carriers to spend less money on fuel.",
      "As GLP-1 medications for weight loss become accessible to more Americans, they are expected to have a slimming down effect on society. The implication for airlines is lower fuel consumption and therefore cost savings, a recent analysis from Jefferies Research Services shows.",
      "Fuel costs are directly related to the weight of planes, including passengers, their luggage and other essential cargo. A heavier plane requires more fuel, while a lighter aircraft uses less.",
      "Airlines have always taken steps to keep aircraft as light as possible and limit fuel consumption, from serving pit-less olives to using thin or light paper stock, according to the Jefferies analysis.",
      "Airlines \"have a long history of searching for unique methods to reduce the weight of the aircraft, in turn reducing fuel consumption and limiting an airline's largest cost bucket,\" analysts said in the report.",
      "They have no ability to limit how much passengers weigh, however.",
      "If weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy lead to a 10% slimmer society, the analysts found that would translate to total airline passenger weight declining by 2%. For airlines, this means 1.5% in fuel savings, plus a 4% boost to earnings per share, according to the analysis.",
      "Jefferies used the example of a Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft to model the savings. It weighs 99,000 pounds empty and can carry 46,000 pounds of fuel. If it seats 178 passengers with an average weight of 180 pounds, plus about 4,000 pounds of other cargo, its total takeoff weight reaches 181,200 pounds. By contrast, if passengers slim down by 10%, to weigh an average of 162 pounds, that aircraft's total weight drops to 177,996 pounds.",
      "Jefferies found that translates to $580 million in fuel savings annually for the top four carriers in the U.S. \u2014 American, Delta, Southwest and United. Those airlines are expected to spend $38.6 billion combined on jet fuel this year.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:25:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's plans to ease the financial pressures on Americans are bold but could backfire, experts said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is taking aim at three major pillars of the U.S. financial system \u2014 the Federal Reserve, the credit card industry and the housing market \u2014 that together wield enormous influence over Americans' finances.",
      "The efforts, announced separately over the past week, are tied to President Trump's push to lower borrowing costs as consumers grapple with inflation and affordability pressures. Specifically, Mr. Trump has floated a ban on\u00a0institutional investors\u00a0buying single-family homes, and also capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year. The Department of Justice launched an\u00a0investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a probe that Powell said is a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence in setting interest rates.",
      "Although experts note that such measures could reduce borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to credit cards, economists warn they also risk backfiring \u2014 potentially reigniting inflation, restricting access to credit and undermining confidence in the U.S. financial system.",
      "\"Increasing affordability is a worthy goal of this administration, but none of the policies on the table are going to achieve that,\" said Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Cato Institute, where he focuses on monetary policy.",
      "He added, \"In fact, most of them are likely to hurt consumers more than they will help them, whether it be price controls, intervening in the Federal Reserve, or intervening in the housing market. All of these interventions are more likely to distort the market than actually help it.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, White House spokesman Davis Ingle said Mr. Trump will unveil more details about his plans for making homes more affordable at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which starts on January 19.",
      "\"President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply and lowering costs. President Trump is working tirelessly to undo the severe damage the Biden Administration inflicted on the American people through high prices,\" Ingle said.",
      "The White House referred questions about the Powell investigation to the Justice Department, which didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Risks of targeting Powell",
      "President Trump has grown\u00a0increasingly critical of Powell, regularly pressing him to lower interest rates and questioning his economic judgment.",
      "Powell does not set rates alone. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, he is one of 12 officials whose majority vote determines whether the Fed cuts, raises or holds interest rates steady.",
      "The latest effort by the Trump administration to target Powell comes after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate three times since September, with Powell citing easing inflation and a slowing labor market as justification for the cuts. Powell has long stressed that the Fed bases its rate decisions on economic data, emphasizing the central bank's traditional independence from political influence.",
      "On Sunday, Powell linked the Justice Department to efforts to undermine the Fed's independence when setting interest rates.",
      "\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a statement.",
      "Research has found that countries where central banks are more vulnerable to political influence have suffered from economic problems such as runaway inflation.",
      "It's important that \"the Federal Reserve can act as it sees fit, and it can make the decisions that it believes to be right without fearing repercussions,\" Cato's Anthony said. \"And when you do fear those repercussions, that's when we see situations where there's hyperinflation abroad, because the only concern was making sure that the leader, whether elected or authoritarian, was presented in the best light possible.\"",
      "Borrowing costs could decline if the White House is successful in pressuring Fed officials to lower interest rates, but the flip side could be surging inflation, noted Nigel Green of investment advisory firm deVere Group.",
      "Any legal action against Powell also could undermine investor confidence in U.S. monetary policy, weakening the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency and destabilizing the bond market, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"The Fed must remain independent in order for the central bank to remain effective and \u2014 this is important \u2014 for the integrity of the U.S. dollar and the all-important Treasury markets to remain the world's benchmarks,\" said Mark Malek, CIO at Siebert Financial, in an email.",
      "Unintended consequences?",
      "Americans have about $1.2 trillion in outstanding credit card debt, with lenders charging an average APR of about 23.8%, according to LendingTree.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump called for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card rates, writing in a social media post that he \"will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies.\"",
      "Cutting credit card rates by more than half could save Americans $100 billion in interest annually, Vanderbilt University researchers\u00a0said in a September report.",
      "But a 10% cap could also have adverse consequences, experts added. Credit card companies would likely reduce credit for more than 80% of customers, with almost every account for people with credit scores below 740 closed or severely restricted to offset the reduced fees from a 10% cap, according to an analysis from the Electronic Payments Coalition, a financial industry trade group.",
      "Credit card spending also accounts for 30% to 40% of total annual consumer spending, so tighter credit for lower-income Americans could reduce overall consumer spending by roughly 5% \u2014 a significant economic hit, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.",
      "Housing's biggest problem",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump is tackling housing affordability at a time when homeownership is increasingly out of reach for many Americans.",
      "His approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes \u2014 by directing the federal government to\u00a0purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds\u00a0and banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.",
      "On Friday, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage dipped below 6%, its lowest level in three years. But experts said the strategies fail to address the housing market's biggest problem \u2014 a lack of available homes that stems from underbuilding after the Great Recession.",
      "\"The affordability crisis is fundamentally a supply problem, and meaningful relief requires adding homes, both through new construction or through inventory gains in chronically constrained markets, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest,\" said Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel in an email.",
      "For that reason, banning institutional investors from single-family home purchases \"is unlikely to move the needle on affordability,\" he concluded.",
      "The lack of supply to meet demand from buyers is an issue that will take years to resolve, experts said.",
      "To be sure, banning institutional investors could help reduce competition for homes in some markets.

    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:55:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the U.S., the country's neighbor and longtime ally.\u200b",
    "story": [
      "Breaking with the United States, Canada has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday.",
      "Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to about 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.",
      "Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the U.S., the country's neighbor and longtime ally.",
      "\"Our relationship has progressed in recent months with China. It is more predictable and you see results coming from that,\" Carney said.",
      "Carney hasn't been able to reach a deal with President Trump to reduce some tariffs that are punishing some key sectors of the Canadian economy and Mr. Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state.",
      "The prime minister, speaking outside against the backdrop of a traditional pavilion and a frozen pond at a Beijing park, said meetings in China have been historic and productive.",
      "Earlier Friday, he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.",
      "Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.",
      "\"It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China-Canada relations toward improvement,\" China's top leader said.",
      "Carney looks to improve global governance",
      "Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, told Xi that better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as \"under great strain.\"",
      "Later, he said at the news conference that the system may give way at least in part to country-to-country or regional agreements rather than the global ones that have underpinned economic growth in the post-World War II era.",
      "\"The question is: What gets built in that place? How much of a patchwork is it?\" he said.",
      "The new reality reflects in large part the so-called America-first approach of Mr. Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called \"a time of global trade disruption.\"",
      "A Canadian business owner in China called Carney's visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.",
      "\"These three things we didn't have,\" said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. \"The parties were not talking for years.\"",
      "Canada had been aligned with U.S. on tariffs",
      "Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney's predecessor.",
      "China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China's imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.",
      "Carney tried to address the concerns of Canadian automakers and autoworkers by saying the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.",
      "More than half of the Chinese EVs exported to Canada would have an import price of less than 35,000 Canadian dollars ($25,000) within five years, he said, making them accessible to consumers.",
      "\"We're building (a) new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,\" he said.",
      "\"For the exchange of a small piece of the Canadian market, we have a commitment. We are waiting for an investment commitment in Canada. The real leaders of the new industry. So it's an agreement that will create the future for our industry.\"",
      "China sees an opening under Trump",
      "China is hoping Mr. Trump's pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States.",
      "Carney, though, noted Canada's relationship with the U.S. is much more multifaceted, deeper and broader. Canada and China have different systems and disagree on issues such as human rights, he said, limiting the scope of their engagement even as they seek ways to cooperate on areas of common interest.",
      "The Canadian leader leaves China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. He will meet business leaders and investors in Qatar to promote trade and investment, his office said.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly 1 million Frigidaire-branded minifridges are now being recalled over potential fire hazard risk, as part of an expanded recall issued by a Canadian company last year.",
      "Curtis International, which manufactures and distributes electronic and appliances, is recalling 330,000 minifridges, adding to the 634,000 minifridges it recalled in July 2024, according to a notice published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) on Thursday.",
      "The government agency stated that internal electrical components in the appliance can short-circuit, causing the surrounding plastic to ignite and posing fire and burn hazards.",
      "The recall involves Curtis International 6-can minifridge model EFMIS121, sold exclusively at Target stores and on Target.com from January 2020 through October 2023. The affected minifridges are red and have the word \"Frigidaire\" printed on the front. Curtis International has received \"at least\" six reports of this specific model catching fire, according to the recall notice.",
      "The initial recall notice, which involved different Frigidaire minifridge models, documented 26 reports of minifridges smoking, sparking, burning, melting, overheating and catching fire. CPSC said property damages for those incidents totaled more than $700,000.",
      "The units in the earlier recall were sold at Walmart and Amazon.com.",
      "CPSC advises consumers who purchased the model EFMIS121 minifridge to stop using it immediately.

    "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:07:08 -0500",
    "summary": "A new tax deduction for senior citizens is kicking in this tax season, potentially providing bigger refunds to millions, the AARP says.",
    "story": [
      "A new $6,000 tax deduction for Americans 65 and older could boost refunds for millions of older taxpayers, putting an average of about $670 more in their pockets this year, according to advocacy group AARP.",
      "But some older Americans could see far more. AARP notes that taxpayers in the 22% tax bracket \u2014 roughly those earning between $44,000 and the deduction's $75,000 income cap \u2014 could save as much as $1,320 per person.",
      "\"The benefits could be vast,\" said Bill Sweeney, AARP's senior vice president of government affairs, in a conference call Thursday. \"The bonus deduction will run through 2028 \u2014 that is four years of immediate relief at a time when older Americans are facing really high costs.\"",
      "The $670 figure is based on a 2025\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which assessed the impact of the new deduction included in Republican lawmakers' tax and spending law, known as the \"big, beautiful bill\" act.",
      "The tax break comes as seniors tell AARP they are struggling to keep pace with the rising cost of medicine, food and other basic expenses, said Nancy LeaMond, the group's chief advocacy and engagement officer.",
      "\"In focus groups last fall, we heard about people still working long after they thought they'd be retired,\" she said. \"Sometimes in the world we live in, $600 doesn't sound like a lot, but we can tell you, based on conversations with our members, that it is a very, very significant help to them.\"",
      "AARP officials expressed concern that some older Americans may miss out on the new senior deduction because they are unaware of the tax break, which takes effect for the 2025 tax season. The IRS will start accepting tax filings on Jan. 26.",
      "Who qualifies for the $6,000 senior deduction?",
      "People who turned 65 by Dec. 31, 2025, are eligible for the new deduction,\u00a0according to the IRS. The deduction provides $6,000 for each qualifying individual, or $12,000 for married couples who both qualify.",
      "The tax break is subject to income limits. Single filers 65 and older qualify for the full $6,000 deduction if their modified adjusted gross income was below $75,000 last year, while married couples must earn less than $175,000 to receive the full $12,000.",
      "The deduction is reduced by six cents for every $1 above those thresholds, and is fully phased out for single filers earning more than $175,000 and married couples earning more than $250,000.",
      "Individuals also need a work-authorized Social Security number to qualify for the senior deduction, H&R Block notes.",
      "Can you claim the tax break if you take the standard deduction?",
      "Yes, the deduction is available to people who itemize, as well as for those who take the standard deduction, which stands at $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly, according to H&R Block.",
      "The new tax break comes on top of an existing $2,000 deduction for seniors. Combined with the standard deduction, that means single filers 65 and older can deduct a total of $23,750, while married couples can deduct up to $46,700, H&R Block said.",
      "Does this mean my Social Security income won't be taxed?",
      "No, because this is a deduction that beneficiaries can use to lower their taxable income. But it\u00a0doesn't specifically apply to Social Security benefits, which remain subject to federal income taxes.",
      "However, the deduction will benefit seniors by lowering their taxable income, shielding more of it from federal income taxes and providing more money in their pockets, Sweeney of the AARP said.",
      "H&R Block notes that Americans who aren't yet receiving Social Security can still claim the $6,000 deduction.",

    "story": [
      "A coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups is calling on Google and Apple to remove access to social media platform X and its AI app, Grok, from their app stores after Grok allowed users to generate sexualized images of minors and women.",
      "The organizations, which focus on child safety, women's rights and privacy, expressed their concerns in\u00a0letters\u00a0on Wednesday to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that Grok's content violates the technology companies' policies.",
      "\"We demand that Google leadership urgently remove Grok and X from the Play Store to prevent further abuse and criminal activity,\" the groups said, using the same language in its letter to Apple.",
      "Apple and Google didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "On Thursday, xAI, the company that developed Grok, said in a safety\u00a0update posted on X that it would now \"geoblock\" users from generating \"images of real people in bikinis, underwear and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal.\"",
      "It also said the image creation tool will only be available to paid subscribers.",
      "\"We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,\" the company said. \"This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Elon Musk, who owns X and xAI, said in a\u00a0post\u00a0that he is \"not aware of naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.\" He also said the chatbot declines prompts to generate illegal images.",
      "\"There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Grok backlash",
      "Criticism of Grok escalated in early January after the generative-AI app enabled users to create images of minors wearing minimal clothing. In response to a user prompt, Grok acknowledged lapses in its digital safeguards.",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, told CBS News earlier this month that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok. In a December\u00a0analysis, the group estimated the chatbot was creating \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which seeks to eliminate child sexual abuse from the internet, has also raised concerns about Grok and other AI tools.",
      "\"We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material.\" Ngaire Alexander, head of hotline at IWF, told CBS News in a statement last week. \"Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream.\"",
      "California opens probe",
      "Grok is also attracting scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and authorities overseas. On Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta\u00a0announced he was opening an investigation into the sexually explicit material produced using Grok.",
      "\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer last week raised the possibility of banning X, which uses Grok, in Britain over the AI tool's generation of sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "The European Commission is also monitoring the steps X is taking to prevent Grok from generating inappropriate images of children and women, Reuters reported Wednesday.",

      "Washington \u2014 More than 10 countries have signed on to join President Trump's \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza, sources familiar with the discussions told CBS News, but not all have said so publicly.",
      "Israel, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Kosovo, the United Arab Emirates, Belarus, Morocco, Hungary and Canada have announced they're accepting his invitation.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said so Wednesday, as did Egypt's foreign ministry.",
      "As the president envisions it, the group would be comprised of world leaders, with him as its chairman. Countries can contribute $1 billion to become permanent members, rather than holding a typical three-year membership, the White House said, although Canada has said it won't pay to join.",
      "Some countries will contribute far less, possibly around $20 million, one of the sources said.",
      "A White House official told CBS News over the weekend that \"virtually every dollar\" raised would be spent on the board's mandate in Gaza. Fundraising to rebuild Gaza will be a separate effort, one U.S. official said.",
      "Another U.S. official told CBS News the president wants a signing ceremony for the board at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, and has been contemplating whether the board's work should extend beyond Gaza, and perhaps be a rival to the United Nations.",
      "But the group's formation is facing serious headwinds from U.S. allies, particularly as the president renews his push to acquire Greenland and has not ruled out the use of military force to do so. Low support for the board could be embarrassing for the administration in Davos.",
      "Norway and Sweden\u00a0 said Wednesday they're holding off, at least for now, due to concerns about the terms for joining.",
      "Russia has been invited, despite its continued assault on Ukraine and the Trump administration's statement that the Kremlin poses such a threat to national security that the U.S. must acquire Greenland to counter it.",
      "On Monday night, the president threatened France with 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne \u2014 which would likely make those products far more expensive for Americans \u2014 if the French don't join the board. The White House hasn't yet said whether Mr. Trump was serious or whether he was joking. At this point, France doesn't intend to give a favorable response to the U.S., according to a source familiar with its deliberations.",
      "The White House says the Board of Peace will \"play an essential role in fulfilling all 20 points of the president's Gaza plan, providing strategic oversight, mobilizing international resources, and ensuring accountability as Gaza transitions from conflict to peace and development.\"",

    "summary": "At least one federal lawsuit and two bills in Congress aim to strip President Trump's name from the exterior sign at the Kennedy Center.",
    "story": [
      "The move by the board to add President Trump's name to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., has triggered a series of legal and legislative challenges. At least one federal lawsuit and two congressional measures seek to strip Trump's name from the exterior signs and website of the historic theater complex.",
      "In a federal civil lawsuit, Rep. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat who serves as one of the Kennedy Center's trustees, is asking a court to rule that her fellow Kennedy Center board members violated the law in December 2025, in voting to add Mr. Trump's name to the center.",
      "The suit also seeks a judge's order to \"declare that the name of Kennedy Center is 'The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts' and declare that the vote to change the Kennedy Center's name is null and void, and without legal effect.\"",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News the Trump administration is expected to formally respond to Beatty's lawsuit by the end of February.",
      "In her suit, Beatty noted that soon after President Kennedy was assassinated, Congress designated the yet-to-be-built Kennedy Center \"as the sole national memorial to the late President within the nation's capital.\"",
      "\"Because Congress named the center by statute, changing the Kennedy Center's name requires an act of Congress,\" Beatty's lawsuit said. \"But on Dec. 18 and 19, 2025 \u2014 in scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic \u2014 the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump. This is a flagrant violation of the rule of law, and it flies in the face of our constitutional order.\"",
      "The decision by the new board to rename the Kennedy Center, part of an overhaul of the facility by Mr. Trump, was denounced by his critics. The president ousted a group of Kennedy Center board members in February and installed close allies as replacements.",
      "Comprising largely Trump loyalists, the board elected Mr. Trump as chairman in February. Longtime Trump ally Richard Grenell was named interim president and executive director of the Kennedy Center.",
      "The cost of the changes to the signage, website and other Kennedy Center monikers is unknown. In response to questions from CBS News about the pricetag, a Kennedy Center spokeswoman issued a statement saying, \"President Trump deserves credit for saving America's cultural center after years of neglect \u2014 as the very legislators attacking him now sat idly by while the center fell into disrepair.\"",
      "Norm Eisen, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who is among those challenging the name change in the lawsuit, told CBS News, \"The damages have been substantial, and that will be addressed in the case. They include far more, of course, than the high cost of signage and of the other naming changes. The losses to the performing corps, to the audience base, to the bottom line of the Center, to its memorial and other activities and indeed to the arts and arts education themselves have been vast.\"",
      "Aside from Rep. Beatty, other Congressional Democrats are also attempting to remove Mr. Trump's name from the Kennedy Center.",
      "In the House, Democratic members have introduced two bills to intervene.",
      "Rep. April McClain Delaney, a first-term Democrat from the Washington, D.C., suburbs in Maryland, has introduced a bill to \"require the removal of any signage or other identification from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts that differs from the designation 'John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\"",
      "McClain Delaney told CBS News, \"A president can't enshrine himself. This is what authoritarian leaders do,\" adding that \"it's arrogant and it's narcissistic.\"",
      "In a separate House resolution, Rep. Stephen Lynch, a longtime Massachusetts congressman who serves on the House Oversight Committee, is seeking a formal statement from the House that the renaming of Kennedy Center violates federal law.",
      "In a December floor speech, Rep. Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat, blasted the effort by Trump allies, calling it \"a sacrilege to a martyred, heroic, historic American president whose name was attached to the Kennedy Center for his support for cultural excellence in America and because he was an assassinated president who we all mourned.\"",
      "\"The idea that Donald Trump would want his name to go before Kennedy's \u2014 or even with Kennedy's \u2014 is a sacrilege,\" Cohen said. \"It should not be changed ever, and it should go through this Congress, who named it the Kennedy Center, on a bill in this House and signed by President Lyndon Johnson.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 06:00:08 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans escalated the standoff with Bill and Hillary Clinton after they refused to appear in person before the committee.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Oversight Committee is set to vote Wednesday on holding former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in criminal contempt after the pair refused to appear before the Republican-led panel, which is investigating the Justice Department's handling of the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The committee is scheduled to meet at 10 a.m. to consider the matter.",
      "If the committee votes to recommend holding them in criminal contempt of Congress, the issue would advance to the full House for a vote on whether to find them in contempt and refer the matter to the Justice Department. The decision to prosecute would be up to the Justice Department, which would have to seek an indictment from a grand jury.",
      "On Tuesday, House Oversight Republicans said the Clintons' attorneys \"made an untenable offer\" for the GOP chairman and top Democrat on the committee to travel to New York to speak with Bill Clinton. The proposal allowed each lawmaker to bring two staff members and the meeting would not be transcribed, according to the committee. Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the committee's chairman, rejected the offer.",
      "\"The Clintons' latest demands make clear they believe their last name entitles them to special treatment,\" Comer said in a statement.",
      "A Clinton spokesperson denied the transcript stipulation, saying \"interviews are on the record and under oath.\"",
      "The committee subpoenaed the Clintons in August, along with former Justice Department officials dating back to George W. Bush's administration. Since then, only Bill Barr, who served as attorney general during President Trump's first term, has provided closed-door testimony to the committee, while the panel has accepted written statements from the others.",
      "In letters to the committee last week explaining their decision not to appear, the Clintons and their legal team accused Comer of trying to embarrass and punish Mr. Trump's political rivals. Their lawyers vowed to fight the subpoenas, calling them \"invalid and legally unenforceable\" because they did not have a valid legislative purpose.",
      "\"No one's accusing Bill Clinton of any wrongdoing. We just have questions,\" Comer told reporters last week.",
      "Photos of Bill Clinton have appeared in the Epstein-related materials released by the Justice Department, along with references to the current president, though neither have been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "The Clintons submitted sworn declarations to the committee last week describing their interactions with Epstein.",
      "In his declaration, Bill Clinton said Epstein offered his private plane to the former president, his staff and his Secret Service detail in support of the Clinton Foundation's philanthropic work between 2002 and 2003. He denied ever visiting Epstein's private island in the Virgin Islands, where a number of the late financier's alleged crimes occurred, and maintained that he had not been in contact with Epstein for more than a decade before his 2019 arrest.",
      "Hillary Clinton, in her declaration, said she did not recall encountering Epstein or any specific interactions with him. She also said she never flew on his plane or visited his private island.",
      "The Clintons also did not recall when they met convicted Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell or their interactions with her, but said she later was in a relationship with a mutual friend of theirs. They did not remember exactly when their last interaction with Maxwell was beyond \"many years ago.\"",
      "\"To be clear, I had no idea of Mr. Epstein's or Ms. Maxwell's criminal activities,\" their declarations said.",
      "\"And, irrespective of any intent either may have ever had, I did not take any action for the purpose of helping them to avoid any type of scrutiny,\" Bill Clinton's declaration added.",
      "Jonathan Shaub, a law professor at the University of Kentucky, said both Clintons have strong arguments for why they should not be compelled to testify, and the potential decision to prosecute puts the Justice Department in a tricky position that could have ramifications for Mr. Trump and officials in his administration if Democrats have control of Congress and the executive branch.",
      "\"There are some past Justice Department opinions that suggest, particularly with President Clinton, that a former president is immune from compelled congressional testimony,\" Shaub, who worked in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel during the Obama administration, told CBS News.",
      "That argument would not apply to Hillary Clinton, though the committee would have to establish that it has a specific legislative interest in having her testify, Shaub said.",
      "\"That's a harder argument to make given what exists in the public record,\" Shaub said, referring to Hillary Clinton's absence in the Epstein files that have been made public. \"She would have stronger arguments in the prosecution to say that they don't have a legislative interest here.\"",
      "In Tuesday's statement, Comer said the committee is seeking testimony from Hillary Clinton \"given her knowledge from her time as Secretary of State of the federal government's work to counter international sex-tracking rings, her personal knowledge of Ms. Maxwell, and her family's relationship with Mr. Epstein.\"",

The president then boarded a different aircraft bound for Davos."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-bars-lindsey-halligan-u-s-attorney-title/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:18:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Lindsey Halligan has departed the Justice Department after a federal judge Tuesday barred her from referring to herself as a U.S. attorney in court filings.",
    "story": [
      "Lindsey Halligan has departed the Justice Department after a federal judge Tuesday barred her from referring to herself as a U.S. attorney in court filings, finding that her continued use of the title \"ignores a binding court order\" that disqualified her from the position last year.",
      "In a statement posted to social media Tuesday night, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed Halligan's exit, calling her departure a \"significant loss for the Department of Justice and the communities she served.\"",
      "Bondi also described the \"circumstances that led up to this outcome\" as \"deeply misguided.\"",
      "The announcement followed an\u00a018-page ruling Tuesday\u00a0from U.S. District Judge David Novak, who sits on the federal bench in Richmond, Virginia. Novak ruled that Halligan's \"continued identification of herself as the United States Attorney for this District ignores a binding court order and may not continue,\" and ruled that Halligan could face disciplinary proceedings if she continues to use that \"improper moniker.\"",
      "Novak's ruling came after a November ruling from U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie found that Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia was invalid and violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause. She dismissed the cases Halligan had brought against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The Justice Department has appealed the ruling.",
      "The statute invoked by the Trump administration to appoint Halligan allows an interim U.S. attorney to serve for 120 days. After that, the interim U.S. attorney may be extended by the U.S. district court judges for the region.",
      "Earlier this month, Novak ordered Halligan to provide the basis for her repeated use of the title of U.S. attorney and explain why it \"does not constitute a false or misleading statement,\" after she listed herself on an indictment returned in the district in December as a \"United States attorney and special attorney.\"",
      "Top Justice Department officials defended Halligan's attempts to remain in her position as a U.S. attorney in court filings, accusing the Trump-appointed judge of \"gross abuse of power\" and attempting to \"coerce the Executive Branch into conformity.\"",
      "The filing, signed by Halligan, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, called Novak's move an \"inquisition,\" \"insult,\" and a \"cudgel\" against the executive branch. The Justice Department argued that Currie's ruling in November applied only to the Comey and James cases and did not bar Halligan from calling herself U.S. attorney in other cases that she oversees.",
      "However, earlier Tuesday, prior to Bondi's announcement that Halligan was departing the Justice Department, the DOJ had reversed course, telling prosecutors to stop referring to Halligan as U.S. attorney and to refer to her instead as special attorney going forward, according to a source familiar with the matter. CBS News reached out to the Justice Department for clarification.",
      "In his ruling, Novak wrote that the Justice Department's argument \"rings hollow,\" and \"fundamentally misunderstands\" the legal issue at question.",
      "\"Judge Currie, speaking for all district judges in this District, found Ms. Halligan's appointment as Interim United States Attorney unlawful and issued two orders dismissing indictments, both of which were premised directly on that rationale,\" Novak wrote. \"Those Orders, though currently on appeal, have not been overturned or stayed, and thus constitute the law of this District. Having been found by this Court to be unlawfully appointed, Ms. Halligan lacks lawful authority to represent herself as the United States Attorney before this Court.\"",
      "Novak also criticized the quality of the Justice Department's response to his order, stating that it had \"unnecessary rhetoric\" that \"contains a level of vitriol more appropriate for a cable news talk show and falls far beneath the level of advocacy expected from litigants in this Court, particularly the Department of Justice.\"",
      "Instead of working through \"numerous legal options\" that would have allowed her to identify herself as U.S. attorney while the appeal of Currie's ruling continues, \"she elected to simply ignore valid court orders.\"",
      "\"The Court finds it inconceivable that the Department of Justice, which holds a duty to faithfully execute the laws of the United States even those with which it may have disagreement, would repeatedly ignore court orders, while simultaneously prosecuting citizens for breaking the law,\" Novak wrote. \"If the Court were to allow Ms. Halligan and the Department of Justice to pick and choose which orders that they will follow, the same would have to be true for other litigants and our system of justice would crumble.\"",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who was a member of President Trump's legal team and joined Mr. Trump's White House staff after he won a second term in 2024. In September, Halligan was selected to serve as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after her predecessor abruptly left the post amid concerns he would be forced out for failing to prosecute James.",
      "She was appointed to her post on Sept. 22 for a total of 120 days, which Novak said expired Tuesday. While Halligan has been nominated by the White House, neither of Virginia's Democratic senators has signed on to advance the nomination for a vote in the Senate.",
      "Days after she was appointed, Halligan sought and secured a two-count indictment against Comey alleging he lied to Congress during testimony in September 2020. James, the New York attorney general, was indicted on bank fraud charges in early October. Both pleaded not guilty and pursued several arguments to have their respective indictments dismissed, including the validity of Halligan's appointment and claims of vindictive prosecution.",
      "\"The Court recognizes that Ms. Halligan lacks the prosecutorial experience that has long been the norm for those nominated to the position of United States Attorney in this District,\" Novak wrote. \"Consequently, and in light of her inexperience, the Court grants Ms. Halligan the benefit of the doubt and refrains from referring her for further investigation and disciplinary action regarding her misrepresentations to this Court at this time.\"",
      "Also on Tuesday, the chief federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia posted that the court is seeking applicants to replace Halligan. Federal law says that judges in a district without a Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney are tasked with selecting a replacement, although President Trump could fire whomever the court chooses to succeed Halligan.",

    "summary": "As the EU calls Trump's threat to tariff allies for rejecting his bid for Greenland a mistake, Denmark's leader laments \"being threatened by our closest ally.\"",
    "story": [
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called President Trump's threat to hit eight of America's NATO allies with tariffs over their stance on Greenland a \"mistake\" on Tuesday. Speaking at the opening of the Davos economic conference in Switzerland, Von der Leyen said Mr. Trump's threat risked plunging Europe's relations with the U.S. into a \"downward spiral.\"",
      "\"When it comes to the security of the Arctic region, Europe is fully committed and we share the objectives of the United States,\" von der Leyen said, highlighting as an example a move by Finland, NATO's newest member, to sell ice breakers to the U.S.",
      "\"It shows that our northern NATO members have Arctic-ready forces right now. And above all, that Arctic security can only be achieved together. And this is why the proposed additional tariffs are a mistake, especially between long-standing allies. The European Union and the United States have agreed to a trade deal last July, and in politics, and in business, a deal is a deal, and when friends shake hands, it must mean something,\" von der Leyen said.",
      "Greenland has been a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark for more than 70 years, and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told the country's parliament on Tuesday that, \"the worst may still be ahead of us\" regarding the standoff with the Trump administration.",
      "\"We are now being threatened by our closest ally,\" she said, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Both Frederiksen's and Von der Leyen's remarks came after President Trump threatened to impose a blanket 10% tariff on imports from eight NATO allies, including Denmark, if they continue rejecting his bid to acquire Greenland. Mr. Trump has said those tariffs could rise to 25% by June if the countries continue resisting.",
      "Von der Leyen said the EU's 27 member nations, \"consider the people of the United States not just our allies, but our friends, and plunging us into a downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of the strategic landscape. So our response will be unflinching, united and proportional.\"",
      "She said the EU was working on a package of measures to further support Arctic security, the first principle of which is \"full solidarity with Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark.\"",
      "\"The sovereignty and integrity of their territory is non-negotiable,\" Von der Leyen said, adding that the EU would work with Greenland and Denmark to look at how it could support infrastructure there, as well as \"work with the United States and all partners on wider Arctic security. This is clearly in our shared interest, and we will step up investment.\"",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who is not attending the Davos conference, said his government had met with NATO members and other allies, and that Western countries should be united by \"respect for national, territorial integrity (and) respect for international law,\" according to The Associated Press.",

    "summary": "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and others were subpoenaed in connection with a DOJ probe into an alleged conspiracy to impede federal immigration officers, three sources said.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department on Tuesday served subpoenas to the offices of multiple Democratic officials in Minnesota, including Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, in connection with a probe into an alleged conspiracy to impede federal immigration officers, three sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "The subpoenas represent a significant escalation between the Justice Department and Minnesota officials, who have clashed over the Trump administration's intense crackdown against immigrants living in the state illegally. They were served on the same day that Attorney General Pam Bondi arrived for a visit in Minnesota, multiple sources told CBS.",
      "The subpoenas were sent in connection with a Justice Department investigation into state and local officials to see if they may have conspired to impede federal officers from discharging their duties, sources said.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A copy of a subpoena seen by CBS does not specify which criminal violations the department is probing. However, multiple sources previously told CBS the primary statute being used as the basis for the probe is 18 USC 372 \u2014 the same one that was used against some of the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, including members of the far-right Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys.",
      "Mr. Trump granted clemency to the more than 1,500 people who were convicted of crimes in connection with the Capitol riot during his first day in office one year ago.",
      "Earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security staged a massive deployment of federal immigration agents to the Minneapolis region, saying they would be tasked with arresting people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally and probing allegations of fraud.",
      "In total, roughly 3,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents have been dispatched to the Twin Cities, a force that is nearly five times the size of the Minneapolis police department, which employs about 600 officers.",
      "The high-profile federal deployment has been strongly opposed by state and local leaders, including Walz, Ellison and Frey, and angered many local residents, who have denounced actions and operations by federal agents as heavy-handed and indiscriminate.",
      "Protests and confrontations between residents and federal agents have become a near-daily occurrence, especially after the killing of Minneapolis mother Renee Good by an ICE officer on Jan. 7.",
      "Walz's office confirmed to CBS News that it received a subpoena. In a statement, Walz said Minnesota would \"not be drawn into political theater,\" and alleged that the Justice Department's investigation \"does not seek justice,\" but is a \"partisan distraction.\"",
      "\"Minnesotans are more concerned with safety and peace than baseless legal tactics aimed at intimidating public servants standing shoulder to shoulder with their community,\" Walz said.",
      "Frey, in a statement to CBS News, confirmed receiving the subpoena and said the Justice Department is pursuing him for merely disagreeing with the administration.",
      "\"When the federal government weaponizes its power to try to intimidate local leaders for doing their jobs, every American should be concerned,\" he said. \"We shouldn't have to live in a country where people fear that federal law enforcement will be used to play politics or crack down on local voices they disagree with. In Minneapolis, we won't be afraid. We know the difference between right and wrong, and, as Mayor, I'll continue doing the job I was elected to do: keeping our community safe and standing up for our values.\"",
      "Ellison, in a statement to CBS, also confirmed that his office has received a grand jury subpoena seeking records, and noted that the subpoena is not directed to him personally.",
      "\"Less than two weeks ago, federal agents shot and killed a Minnesotan in broad daylight. Now, instead of seriously investigating the killing of Renee Good, Trump is weaponizing the justice system against any leader who dares stand up to him,\" he said. \"Everything about this is highly irregular, especially the fact that this comes shortly after my office sued the Trump Administration to challenge their illegal actions within Minnesota.\"",
      "Casper Hill, a spokesperson for Ramsey County \u2014 which includes St. Paul, Minnesota's capital city \u2014 told CBS News in a statement that Ramsey County was also served with a subpoena.",
      "Hennepin County spokesperson Daniel Borgertpoepping told CBS News that \"[n]either Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty nor the Hennepin County Attorney's Office was served with a subpoena,\" but that Hennepin County, whose county seat is in Minneapolis, was served with a subpoena. \"The Civil Division of the Hennepin County Attorney's Office represents Hennepin County in legal matters and will be advising the County on the subpoena,\" Borgertpoepping said.",
      "The subpoena sent to Frey's office orders the office's custodian of records to appear for testimony on Feb. 3.",
      "It also asks for eight categories of documents, including all records and communications issued by the office since Jan. 1, related to federal immigration enforcement in Minnesota, any communications related to the lack of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement and any directives issued to Minnesota residents concerning their interactions with immigration officers.",
      "Legal experts remain skeptical that the Justice Department has enough evidence to secure any indictments in the case.",
      "\"A grand jury subpoena should not be issued to an individual who is merely exercising their First Amendment rights,\" said Gene Rossi, a former federal prosecutor who is now an attorney with Carlton Fields.",
      "\"Impeding an investigation is not done by words. It is done by actions. And all they are doing is criminalizing the policy of a president. If that is the basis for a grand jury investigation, the entire country could be subject to a grand jury investigation.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/reza-valizadeh-detained-iran/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:44:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Lawyers for Reza Valizadeh, a U.S. citizen arrested in 2024 by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, filed a petition Tuesday with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.",
    "story": [
      "When Abdolreza \"Reza\" Valizadeh returned to Iran in the spring of 2024, it was the first time he had set foot in his home country in 15 years. The veteran journalist, who had spent more than a decade in exile, traveled to Iran to see and care for his aging parents.",
      "Six months later, he was in solitary confinement in Tehran's notorious Evin Prison.",
      "Valizadeh, a 49-year-old dual U.S.-Iranian citizen and longtime critic of Iran's security establishment, was arrested on Sept. 22, 2024, by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). His detention, detailed in a petition filed Tuesday by his attorney with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, comes amid Iran's sweeping crackdown on protests across the country, and as tensions with Washington simmer.",
      "The State Department formally designated Valizadeh as \"wrongfully detained\" in May 2025, placing his case under the authority of the U.S. government's hostage affairs office. Valizadeh is one of at least four Iranian-Americans currently held in Iran, including 70-year-old Kamran Hekmati and at least one other septuagenarian, a woman, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "\"In lodging this petition to the UN, alongside pulling every lever of power available to us in D.C., we are committed to bringing attention to Reza's case, not only to secure his release, but to send an unequivocal message that the targeting of U.S. citizens abroad will not be tolerated,\" Ryan Fayhee, counsel to Valizadeh and a partner at the law firm Akin Gump, said in a statement.",
      "\"Every day that Reza remains behind bars, the Iranian regime is emboldened to target Americans who dare to advocate for truth, justice, and a better future for the Iranian people,\" Fayhee said.",
      "Valizadeh's case continues to unfold against a volatile backdrop inside Iran, where thousands of protesters\u00a0are believed to have been killed, and many thousands more arrested, as authorities have cracked down on recent demonstrations over economic hardship and political repression. A near-total internet and communications blackout has been in place for more than two weeks.",
      "U.S. officials have condemned Tehran's treatment of protesters, warning of further economic pressure \u2014 and possible military strikes \u2014 while leaving open the possibility of talks. Iranian leaders have accused Washington of interference, raising concerns among rights advocates that Americans held in Iran could be used as leverage as tensions sharpen.",
      "President Trump said last week he held off on striking Iran after being assured by the regime that the executions of hundreds of protesters had been \"canceled,\" but in a recent interview called for \"new leadership\" in Iran. The U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group has begun to move west from the Indo-Pacific towards the Middle East, CBS News has confirmed, and is expected to arrive in the coming days.",
      "\"The Trump administration is closely monitoring Mr. Valizadeh's case. President Trump has been clear that he wants every wrongfully detained American returned home,\" a senior administration official told CBS News.",
      "The State Department and a spokesperson for the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "\"These Americans must come home\"",
      "Valizadeh became a U.S. citizen in 2022 through his work for U.S.-funded broadcaster Radio Farda, the Persian branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.",
      "According to messages relayed to his attorney by his family, Valizadeh believed he had been given assurances by Iranian authorities that it was safe to return to Tehran, where most of his family resides. His brother has said he now believes those guarantees were part of a trap, possibly involving a former colleague who had ties to the IRGC.",
      "Reporting by Persian-language media later cited sources who said Iranian intelligence had hoped to pressure Valizadeh into cooperating against his former employer, Radio Farda, for which he reported on corruption, protests and the influence of the IRGC. He refused.",
      "Days later, IRGC agents detained him on a Tehran street, confiscated his belongings, including his U.S. passport, and took him to Evin Prison, where he spent weeks in isolation and under intense interrogation. Iranian officials did not publicly acknowledge his arrest for nearly two months.",
      "Valizadeh was eventually charged with \"collaborating with a hostile government,\" a vague national security offense that Iranian authorities routinely use against journalists and activists.",
      "In December 2024, after what the petition to the U.N. describes as a sham trial lasting less than an hour, and in which the judge acted as both prosecutor and adjudicator, Valizadeh was sentenced to 10 years in prison. His appeal to the regime was rejected in January 2025.",
      "Since then, his family says Valizadeh's health has steadily deteriorated. He suffers from asthma, which has been worsened by overcrowded cells, poor air quality and exposure to smoke and debris \u2014 conditions that intensified after Israeli airstrikes struck parts of Evin Prison in June 2025 during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran. He has endured frequent coughing fits and has been denied basic medications, dental care and treatment for gastrointestinal problems.",
      "After the June strikes, Valizadeh was among prisoners who were shackled and transferred to another facility without their belongings or medicine, according to the U.N. filing, before being returned to Evin Prison, where his brother says he now shares a small cell with up to 18 other inmates amid severe shortages of food, water, sanitation and medical care.",
      "Attorneys for other American citizens who were wrongfully detained have petitioned the U.N. for help in the recent past. They included\u00a0Baquer Namazi, who was permitted to leave Iran for life-saving surgery in the UAE in 2022, and Ryan Corbett, who was imprisoned by the Taliban in Afghanistan and released in a prisoners swap in January 2025.",
      "\"Family is at the heart of the Iranian culture. This is why so many Iranian Americans travel back to Iran \u2014 to visit elderly parents and connect with extended family. Unfortunately, this respect for family is also what gives the regime a steady influx of dual nationals to feast on,\" Neda Sharghi, the sister of former wrongful detainee Emad Shargi and an advocate for American hostages and their families, told CBS News. (The siblings use slightly different spellings of their last name.)",
      "\"President Trump has witnessed the brutality of the Iranian regime. He also knows that we have innocent Americans, like recently detained Reza Valizadeh and Kamran Hekmati, among others, ensnared in the regime's hostage-taking tentacles. These Americans must come home and President Trump and his team have shown us that, at least when it comes to American hostages and wrongful detainees, they will do whatever they need to attain their freedom,\" Sharghi said.",
      "With help from Sharghi and Valizadeh's family, Fayhee has received since September three pre-recorded voice messages from Valizadeh describing the circumstances of his detention. The last came on Dec. 20.",
      "Neither Valizadeh nor his family have been in contact since Iran's crackdown and nationwide internet blackout began.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-lisa-cook-federal-reserve/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:01:43 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump moved to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in August.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to convene Wednesday to consider President Trump's bid to remove Lisa Cook from her post on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, a case that could have significant ramifications for the independence of the central bank.",
      "The case arose after Mr. Trump attempted to oust Cook from the board last year \u2014 an unprecedented move that marked the first time in the Fed's 112-year history that a president tried to fire a sitting governor. So far, lower courts and the Supreme Court have allowed Cook to continue serving in her post while litigation over her removal proceeds.",
      "But the case is being closely watched for its potential implications for the Fed's independence. Also looming over the legal battle is a criminal investigation by the Justice Department related to testimony Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave to the Senate Banking Committee last June about a multi-year project to renovate the central bank's Washington, D.C., headquarters.",
      "Powell, a frequent target of Mr. Trump's attacks, is set to attend arguments Wednesday, a source directly familiar with his plans confirmed to CBS News.",
      "\"We have never seen a direct showdown between the president and the Federal Reserve in terms of the president trying to fire the governors of the Fed,\" said Adam White, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the Supreme Court. \"We don't even know what the rules are really for this kind of showdown.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 allows the president to remove a member of the Fed's Board of Governors \"for cause,\" though it does not define the term. The president invoked that law last August when he informed Cook in a\u00a0letter\u00a0that she had been fired. Mr. Trump cited as the basis for her ouster allegations from a senior member of his administration, Federal Housing Director Bill Pulte, that Cook made misrepresentations on mortgage documents relating to properties in Michigan and Atlanta.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove Cook because of what he claimed was \"deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter.\"",
      "Cook has denied wrongdoing, and her lawyers called the allegations against her \"flimsy\" and \"unproven.\" They argued that the accusations were \"conveniently timed\" after Mr. Trump criticized the Fed's decisions surrounding interest rates. The president has expressed frustration that the central bank has not moved quickly enough to lower interest rates and denounced Powell as \"incompetent\" and \"crooked.\"",
      "On the heels of her purported removal, Cook filed a lawsuit challenging the move and arguing that the president violated the Federal Reserve Act. Cook also said she was entitled to and deprived of notice and the opportunity for a hearing before she was fired.",
      "A U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., ruled for Cook and reinstated her to the role, finding that Mr. Trump had not validly removed her \"for cause.\" Judge Jia Cobb also ruled that Cook was likely to succeed on her argument that her due-process rights were deprived because she did not receive the necessary process before her firing.",
      "After a divided panel of three appeals court judges continued to block Cook's removal, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene and allow the president to fire her.",
      "But the high court in October scheduled arguments in the case and allowed Cook to remain in her position while it weighs Mr. Trump's bid for emergency relief. As a result, she participated in the past two meetings of the Fed's interest rate-setting committee. Its next meeting is set for late January.",
      "Arguments in the legal battle come weeks after the Supreme Court considered another effort by Mr. Trump to fire members of independent agencies. In that case, the Justice Department argued that for-cause removal protections for those officials are unconstitutional because the president has unrestricted power to remove executive officers.",
      "But in the court fight involving the Fed, the Trump administration is not challenging the constitutionality of the removal restriction for members of the Fed board. Instead, the issues are whether Mr. Trump needed to give Cook notice and a hearing before removing her, if the president had cause to fire her \u2014 and what constitutes \"cause\" \u2014 and whether courts can review that finding.",
      "\"This is the first fight between the president and a Fed governor over how to carry out that power that's been in the law for a century, but mercifully we've never used it,\" White said. \"I think the court will save the Federal Reserve Act, but not necessarily save this Federal Reserve actor.\"",
      "In Supreme Court filings, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued the president lawfully ousted Cook after \"concluding that the American people should not have their interest rates determined by someone who made misrepresentations material to her mortgage rates that appear to have been grossly negligent at best and fraudulent at worst.\"",
      "Cook's alleged conduct \"created an intolerable appearance of impropriety in someone charged with the weightiest responsibilities in our financial system,\" he wrote. \"There is a world of difference between that removal and removals grounded in policy disagreements.\"",
      "Sauer also told the justices in papers that courts cannot second-guess the president's determination that there was cause to fire Cook. But even if they could, Mr. Trump identified a valid reason for doing so: her \"apparent fraud or gross negligence in a financial matter,\" the solicitor general said.",
      "But Cook's lawyers argued that the Fed's independence and for-cause removal protection prohibit her firing. They told the Supreme Court in filings that the allegations of private, pre-office conduct do not constitute \"cause\" for removal. Cook was appointed by President Joe Biden to the Fed Board in May 2022, and the allegations involve mortgage agreements from 2021.",
      "Cook also did not receive the notice and opportunity to be heard that she is due under federal law and the Constitution's Fifth Amendment, they said.",
      "Accepting Mr. Trump's claim that removals from the Fed Board are not subject to judicial scrutiny would \"eviscerate\" Congress' choice to safeguard the central bank's independence, Cook's lawyers warned.",
      "\"Congress did not mean for the nation's monetary policy to turn on that game of find-an-alleged crime,\" they said.",
      "The Supreme Court has indicated in a string of decisions that it believes the president has the power to remove members of independent agencies at will. But it has also suggested that the Fed is different from entities like the Federal Trade Commission and National Labor Relations Board. In a May order allowing Mr. Trump to fire members of two labor boards without cause, the high court singled out the central bank as a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Then, in arguments in December, Justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed concerns about undermining the independence of the Fed. He suggested the court could create an exception for the central bank to the president's otherwise unrestricted power to remove certain executive officers.",
      "But some legal experts question that path. Ilan Wurman, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, warned that it may be difficult for the Supreme Court to explain why the Fed should be treated differently from other independent agencies.",
      "\"There's no exception in the Constitution to the constitutional separation of powers, to the president's oversight of law execution for financial regulators. There just isn't,\" he said. \"Go look for a clause in the Constitution that says financial regulators are different. You're not going to find it. If the Federal Reserve is exercising executive power, it's no different than any other exercises of executive power.\"",
      "Cook has argued that the mortgage allegations are pretextual, and Mr. Trump moved to fire her because he disagrees with her monetary-policy decisions. Powell, too, said the threats of criminal charges are \"pretexts\" and a consequence of the Fed setting interest rates that differ from Mr. Trump's preferences.",
      "As to the Fed chair, Wurman said, \"It's clear they're trying to build a case for-cause on the assumption that the court will, in fact, think the Fed is different.\"",
      "Fed governors serve 14-year terms. If Mr. Trump is ultimately allowed to fire Cook and the president appointed a successor, it would mean he will have named the majority of the seven-member Board of Governors. With Powell's tenure as chair also set to end in May, the president has been meeting with candidates to succeed him.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:11:02 -0500",
    "summary": "A trio of Republican senators asked the Trump administration to end a visa waiver program in far-flung U.S. territories in the Pacific that they say encourages \"birth tourism.\"",
    "story": [
      "A trio of Republican senators asked the Trump administration to end a visa waiver program that they say encourages \"birth tourism\" from Chinese nationals and allows them \"to obtain fast-track American citizenship.\"",
      "The program currently allows Chinese nationals to visit the U.S. territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands visa-free for up to\u00a0 14 days.",
      "In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum dated Jan. 15, the three GOP senators \u2014 Rick Scott of Florida, Jim Banks of Indiana and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma \u2014 urged the Trump administration to end the Guam-CNMI waiver program, saying it \"has opened the United States to significant security threats by creating a veritable cottage industry of Chinese nationals giving birth in the [Mariana Islands] and gaining access to U.S. citizenship.\"",
      "The senators' letter comes as Scott pushes for a bill he introduced in November that would ban the use of surrogacy in the U.S. by people from certain foreign countries, including China. Scott's bill highlights a Chinese-born couple in California who had nearly two dozen babies born to surrogates removed from their care last year amid a child abuse investigation.",
      "President Trump raised the issue of Chinese \"birth tourism\" during a press briefing on Tuesday, speaking on a wide range of topics \u2014 including birthright citizenship \u2014 while marking the first year of his second term.",
      "\"China is making a big business out of that,\" said Mr. Trump. \"They come to the country. They have a child. They're an American citizen. They get all the benefits.\"",
      "The Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program was created in 2009. It allows holders of Hong Kong passports to travel to the islands for up to 45 days without obtaining a visa.",
      "In the years after its creation, Saipan, the capital of the Northern Marianas, became a hotspot for birth tourism.",
      "But by 2024, births to tourists on the island dropped significantly. There were only 58 live births to tourists at the islands' hospital, down from a high of 581 in 2018 during the first Trump administration, according to data provided to CBS News by the office of Kimberlyn King-Hinds, who represents the Northern Mariana Islands as a non-voting delegate in the House.",
      "In its final weeks, the Biden administration expanded the program, allowing citizens of mainland China to travel to the islands without a visa for up to 14 days.",
      "The GOP senators worry the Guam and Northern Mariana visa waiver policies create a long-term security risk, saying that people born through the program could eventually \"apply for high positions within the U.S. federal government and likely receive priority consideration due to fluency in Mandarin.\"",
      "\"This is an ongoing security vulnerability that Xi Jinping and his successors in the [Chinese Communist Party] will be more than happy to exploit,\" they wrote, later adding that \"birth tourism\" has \"overwhelmed\" the Northern Marianas' only public hospital.",
      "But King-Hinds, a fellow Republican, disagrees.",
      "\"Congresswoman King-Hinds does not support changes to the CNMI-Guam Visa Waiver Program based on claims that 'birth tourism' is overwhelming the Commonwealth Health Center,\" said her spokesperson, Christopher Concepcion. \"Birth tourism in the CNMI is not a major issue when viewed in the context of total foreign births in the United States today, particularly given that millions of Chinese nationals travel to the mainland United States each year.\"",
      "Simon Hankinson, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the visa waiver program should be reserved for countries that share criminal record information and whose travelers rarely overstay visas. \"None of that applies with China,\" Hankinson said.",
      "\"We should not have any visa waiver program involving China,\" Hankinson said. \"China is a competitor at best, a threat at worst, and their people should be screened for visas, just like people from most of the rest of the world.\"",
      "In 2017, the Justice Department scored marquee victories in its fight against \"birth tourism\" schemes in Saipan. Chinese national Sen Sun was sentenced to a year in federal prison for an illegal business that catered to pregnant foreigners. In a separate case, Richard Peng, who had dual citizenship in the U.S. and Taiwan, received a six-month sentence for running a business \"harboring\" birth tourists, housing them on a farm on the island.",
      "In their letter, Scott and the other senators pointed to a more recent pair of cases that they say point to continued vulnerabilities with the visa program. Last year, a Chinese national named Kangle Jiang was sentenced to 30 days in prison for transporting eight other Chinese nationals from Saipan to Guam. \"Most of the passengers were later encountered in or near sensitive military installations,\" according to the Justice Department.",
      "In November, four other men received sentences ranging from 37 days to 30 months for smuggling 21 people to Guam, all of whom were Chinese nationals who the Justice Department said were attempting to avoid airport immigration checks.",
      "The senators said the cases refute the idea that the visa waiver program benefits the islands, saying the schemes \"hardly offered a reliable source of economic development for U.S. citizens and residents residing in the Marianas.\"",
      "Benjamin Jensen, a senior fellow at the bipartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies, emphasized national security concerns. He said the program could allow China \"to take advantage of that loophole, to then get operatives in place to monitor U.S. military facilities, which are all increasingly being expanded and upgraded in that area.\"",
      "\"We're expanding out all sorts of runways and facilities across the entire region as part of creating mobility to get back and forth between the U.S. mainland and even Japan and the first island chain. So there's tons of refurbishment all throughout the area of old, even World War II fields,\" Jensen said. \"So it's key for military options, which is why anything that might compromise it is a real issue.\"",
      "Customs and Border Protection abruptly halted processing of applications under the program in April 2025, before resuming in July. The absence of tourists under the program during those months led to a 30% drop in visitors and a spike in hotel vacancies, the Marianas Visitors Authority said in July, calling the \"pipeline\" to \"non-visa holders from Hong Kong and China, something we desperately need to revive our tourism economy.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:23:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Hawaii enacted a rule that bars people from bringing guns onto private property that is open to the public, like shops or gas stations, unless the owner gives express authorization.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared skeptical of a Hawaii law that bars people with concealed-carry licenses from bringing their handguns onto private property that is open to the public unless they receive permission from the owner.",
      "Several of the conservative justices suggested during oral arguments that Hawaii was treating the Second Amendment differently than other constitutional rights and had enacted a restriction that singles out firearms.",
      "\"You're just relegating the Second Amendment to second-class status,\" Justice Samuel Alito told Neal Katyal, who argued in defense of Hawaii's law in the case known as Wolford v. Lopez. \"I don't see how you can get away from that.\"",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts cited previous Supreme Court decisions that raised concerns that the Second Amendment is a \"disfavored right.\" Roberts pressed Katyal to justify the distinction between the First and Second Amendments as it relates to private property.",
      "\"It strikes me that one of the things that your side has to come to grips with is it is a very clear constitutional right,\" Roberts said of the Second Amendment.",
      "The chief justice argued that under the First Amendment, a candidate for public office can knock on a voter's door without needing express permission from the property owner. But in Hawaii, a person who is armed must first receive authorization to enter private property.",
      "\"I'm trying to figure out what exactly the difference is between the First Amendment and the Second Amendment,\" he said.",
      "At issue in the case is Hawaii's default rule that bars people with concealed-carry licenses from bringing their guns onto private property that is open to the public, like shops or gas stations, unless the owner gives express authorization. Carrying a gun in violation of the law is a misdemeanor that is punishable by up to one year in prison.",
      "Four other states \u2014 California, Maryland, New Jersey and New York \u2014 have imposed restrictions similar to Hawaii's and limit carry by license-holders on private property. But in the remaining 45 states, licensed handgun owners can generally carry arms onto private property that's open to the public.",
      "Hawaii's default rule is one of 15 location-based restrictions that, according to gun-rights backers, effectively ban public carry in much of the state.",
      "Three Maui County residents and the Hawaii Firearms Coalition, a gun-rights group, sued state officials in 2023, challenging the state's restriction as a violation of their Second Amendment right and seeking a court order blocking its enforcement. As part of their suit, the plaintiffs also challenged measures prohibiting handguns in restaurants, bars, beaches, parks and banks or other financial institutions. Those provisions are not at issue in the case before the Supreme Court.",
      "The restrictions were signed into law by Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, a Democrat, in the wake of the Supreme Court's landmark 2022 decision in the case New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, in which the justices ruled that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to carry handguns in public.",
      "The court's decision established a new framework for evaluating whether firearms restrictions comport with the Second Amendment. Under its new test, the government must justify its regulation by showing that it is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "A U.S. district court sided with the plaintiffs and found that Hawaii's rule likely violates the Second Amendment as applied to property that is open to the public. The state appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed the decision and upheld Hawaii's measure.",
      "\"Nothing in the text of the Second Amendment or otherwise suggests that a private property owner \u2014 even owners who open their private property to the public \u2014 must allow persons who bear arms to enter,\" a 9th Circuit panel of judges found.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed in October to decide whether the Second Amendment allows a state to bar concealed-carry license-holders from carrying firearms on private property open to the public.",
      "Alan Beck, who argued on behalf of the carry-license holders and the Hawaii Firearms Coalition, told the justices that the state's rule \"runs roughshod\" over the right to bear arms. He argued Hawaii enacted its law to undermine the Second Amendment, and said the state failed to show that it was rooted in the nation's tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "\"Our national tradition is that people are allowed to carry on private property that is open to the public,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration is backing the plaintiffs in the case. Sarah Harris, a lawyer in the Solicitor General's Office, told the justices that Hawaii's law \"offends our history and tradition.\" She warned that a public-carry licensee running errands with a gun in their purse risks committing a crime merely by stopping to put gas in their vehicle.",
      "In a Supreme Court filing, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the state's default rule is \"blatantly unconstitutional\" and effectively prevents public carry.",
      "\"Because most owners do not post signs either allowing or prohibiting firearms, Hawaii's law effectively means that ordinary citizens licensed to publicly carry may not carry firearms in public at all,\" Sauer wrote. \"That near-total ban defies the 'general right to publicly carry arms.'\"",
      "Citing the Supreme Court's history-and-tradition test for evaluating gun restrictions, Justice Brett Kavanaugh indicated that the case should be an easy one because Hawaii fails to satisfy it.",
      "\"Here, there's no sufficient history supporting the regulation. End of case,\" he told Harris.",
      "But Katyal, who defended the law, argued that while the Constitution protects the right to bear arms, it doesn't create implied consent to bring those arms onto private property.",
      "\"In some places, it's reasonable to assume guns are welcome. In others, it's pretty clear an invitation to shop is not an invitation to bring your Glock,\" he said.",
      "Katyal wrote in a Supreme Court brief that Hawaii's law respects the Second Amendment, but also vindicates citizens' right to \"exclude unwanted entry onto private property.\"",
      "\"Hawai'i is free to enact a law clarifying that the public's implied license to enter private property does not include an invitation to bring a gun, particularly because that accords with the well-established custom in Hawai'i,\" he said.",
      "Gun violence prevention groups urged the Supreme Court to uphold Hawaii's rule, arguing that it promotes public safety. In a friend-of-the-court brief, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence and Giffords Law Center said that private-property owners who want to exercise their own right to self-defense may not want visitors to carry weapons.",
      "\"Hawai\u02bbi's default rule does not bar individuals from exercising their Second Amendment right to carry firearms in public. It does not create gun-free zones. Instead, Hawai'i's default rule allows private property owners to choose whether to permit firearms on their property before any visitors enter with a concealed weapon,\" lawyers for the groups wrote.",
      "They argued that Hawaii's law respects the rights of private property and personal security.",
      "The dispute over Hawaii's restriction is one of two cases involving the Second Amendment that the Supreme Court is hearing in its current term. The high court will also decide the constitutionality of a federal law that prohibits unlawful drug users from having firearms, with arguments set for early March.",

    "story": [
      "Why does the United States want control of Greenland? President Trump has made it clear that he thinks the U.S. needs to control the island to ensure the security of America and its NATO allies, a point those allies \u2014 and Greenland \u2014 vehemently disagree with.",
      "Here's why Mr. Trump insists the U.S. needs to control the semi-autonomous Danish territory, and why NATO allies and Greenland say the U.S. could achieve its aims without a takeover.",

      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes.",
      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Jan. 4, claiming \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "Mikkel Olesen, a Danish foreign policy and diplomacy researcher, told CBS News earlier this month that there aren't Russian and Chinese ships all over the Arctic, but there are Russian planes, and there has historically been a lack of situational awareness in the region.",
      "\"This is something that the U.S. used to do itself. I mean, throughout the Cold War, the U.S. had a line of radar stations across Greenland and the U.S. chose to close down those radar stations because the Cold War ended,\" Olesen said. \"Now, that's not to say that Denmark as an ally isn't obligated to try to help the U.S. handling that problem, not at all. I'm just saying that the status quo before Donald Trump was that the U.S was very happy about being able to just have a free hand in Greenland to handle those issues.\"",
      "The Danish government has made it clear that the U.S. is welcome to expand its military presence in Greenland, and that protecting the island from any potential adversaries should be the joint responsibility of the NATO alliance.",
      "\"Put up warning systems, missile systems, soldiers, etc. Just by asking, you can,\" Danish lawmaker Lars Christian Brask, vice-chair of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, told CBS News earlier this month. \"It's not you [the U.S.] running the country, but you have the options, the possibility, of having troops, material ... equipment in Greenland. You just have to ask.\"",
      "Members of the U.S. Congress have openly questioned Mr. Trump's claim of a Russian or Chinese security threat to Greenland, including Senate Intelligence Committee deputy chair Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, who said \"The only country that is, frankly, benefiting the most from this chaos are both Russia and China.\"",
      "Former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark Rufus Gifford also disputed\u00a0Mr. Trump's claim of a threat to the island from the U.S. adversaries.",
      "When asked earlier this month what specifically the United States would gain in terms of national security by taking control of Greenland, given all that the U.S. is able to do already, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"More control over the Arctic region and ensuring that China and Russia and our adversaries cannot continue their aggression in this very important and strategic region. And there would be many other benefits as well that, again, the president and his national security team are currently talking about.\"",

      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages.",
      "The Northwest Passage, which comes close to Greenland, is not currently viable for the entire year.",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages that enable shippers to save time and millions of dollars in fuel by taking shorter routes between Europe and Asia that were long only passable in warmer months.",
      "There are a couple primary routes through the Arctic becoming more viable. The Northern Sea Route, which follows Russia's long northern border, doesn't bring ships too close to Greenland, and Russia and China agreed to jointly develop that path and have been making greater use of it in recent years.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the Northern Sea Route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "The other route, called the Northwest Passage, comes close to Greenland's coastal waters and is more likely of concern to the Trump administration.",
      "Before those two routes started becoming viable during the winter, the only way to move goods from ports in Russia or the manufacturing powerhouses of East Asia was to go south. But those paths are about 3,000 miles longer, and thus much more expensive.",
      "Greenland's natural resources",

      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for them continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "The U.S. \"can explore, of course if you live up to environmental regulations, etc., all the rare earths and minerals that you want in Greenland on a commercial basis. There won't be any hold back on that,\" Danish lawmaker Brask told CBS News earlier this month.",
      "Olesen, the Danish foreign policy researcher, said these minerals are still very expensive to extract, so it hasn't so far made economic sense for private companies to go after them.",
      "\"The position of the Greenland government has been for a long time that Greenland is open for business, and with few exceptions, the main reason for why not much has happened has been that there hasn't been a business case for American companies,\" Olesen said, adding, \"nothing has prevented U.S. companies from going in for a long time.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 GOP Rep. Julia Letlow is jumping into the Louisiana Senate race after President Trump encouraged her to challenge sitting Sen. Bill Cassidy in the state's primary.",
      "Mr. Trump encouraged Letlow to run for the seat in a post on Truth Social on Saturday, pledging to endorse her should she enter the race.",
      "\"Today, I am announcing my candidacy for the United States Senate to ensure the nation we leave our children is safer and stronger,\" Letlow said in a post on X Tuesday morning. \"Louisiana deserves a conservative Senator who will not waver. I am honored to have President Trump's endorsement and trust.\"",
      "The Greater Baton Rouge Business Report said\u00a0earlier Tuesday that Letlow announced she was entering the race at a breakfast event hosted by the publication in Louisiana.",
      "Cassidy said Letlow also called him to share the news.",
      "\"Congresswoman Letlow called me this morning to say she was running,\" Cassidy said in a statement to CBS News. \"She said she respected me and that I had done a good job. I will continue to do a good job when I win re-election. I am a conservative who wakes up every morning thinking about how to make Louisiana and the United States a better place to live.\"",
      "Letlow has represented Louisiana's 5th Congressional District in the House since 2021, when she won a special election for the seat following the death of her husband, who died from complications related to COVID-19 before he could be sworn into office. Letlow, 44, became the first Republican woman elected to represent Louisiana in Congress.",
      "The president called Letlow a \"TOTAL WINNER!\" and \"Great Star\" in his post on Truth Social backing her potential Senate bid.",
      "\"A Proud Mother of two children, Julia is a wonderful person, has ALWAYS delivered for Louisiana, and would continue doing so in the United States Senate,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Should she decide to enter this Race, Julia Letlow has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, JULIA, RUN!!!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to back Letlow comes as Cassidy, a Republican who has occasionally broken with his party, is seeking a third term in the Senate.",
      "Cassidy, 68, was one of seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Mr. Trump in his impeachment trial after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol in 2021. And more recently, the Louisiana Republican, who's a medical doctor, has also been at odds with the administration over HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership.",
      "Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance Kennedy's nomination out of committee and assure his confirmation in February, despite doubts over Kennedy's views on vaccines. But Cassidy has since broken with the HHS secretary on multiple occasions.",
      "He has made an effort to work with the administration on health care issues like addressing the cost of insurance, introducing a measure to put funds into health savings accounts as the president pushed for sending money directly to Americans rather than insurance companies.",
      "Letlow said in a video announcing her candidacy that \"a state as conservative as ours, we shouldn't have to wonder how our senator will vote when the pressure's on.\"",
      "\"Louisiana deserves conservative champions \u2014 leaders who will not flinch,\" she added.",
      "Letlow's entrance into the race, and the president's backing, is expected to create difficulties for Senate GOP leaders. Just days ahead of the president's announcement, Senate Majority Leader John Thune joined Cassidy on the campaign trail in Louisiana. And although the seat is considered safe for Republicans, the president's move could threaten key votes in the Senate going forward, since Cassidy may be less inclined to fall in line.",

    "summary": "Congress has until Jan. 30 to fund the remaining government agencies and programs following the longest government shutdown in history in November.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Leaders in Congress released the final four measures to fund the government\u00a0Tuesday, as lawmakers race to avoid another government shutdown at the end of the month.",
      "Congress has until Jan. 30 to fund the remaining government agencies and programs, after approving a three-bill funding package as part of the effort to end the longest government shutdown in history in November, while the majority of government funding was extended on a temporary basis.",
      "Since then, the House and Senate approved another three-bill funding package, and last week, the House approved two more funding measures, which the Senate is expected to take up upon its return to Washington next week.",
      "House and Senate appropriators released the text of the final package of four bills, known as a \"minibus,\" Tuesday. The legislation would provide funding related to the departments of Defense; Labor, Health and Human Services, Education; Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Homeland Security.",
      "The House had dropped plans to include the Homeland Security Department appropriations last week following the deadly shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis.",
      "Democrats had threatened to withhold their support for the funding if it did not include ICE reforms. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said in a statement Tuesday that Democrats had reined in the GOP on the funding measure.",
      "\"In this bill, Democrats defeated Republicans' hard-fought push to give ICE an even bigger annual budget, successfully cut ICE's detention budget and capacity, cut CBP's budget by over $1 billion, and secured important, although still insufficient, new constraints on DHS,\" Murray said. \"The bill rejects all Republican poison pill riders and significantly reduces Secretary Noem's ability to move around funding as she sees fit under a CR.\"",
      "Democrats lauded new restrictions on DHS' ability to allocate funds for things like immigration enforcement if it does not comply with reporting requirements, along with new training requirements for officers. The funding measure allocates $20 million for body cameras for immigration enforcement agents.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democratic appropriator in the House, acknowledged some of her colleagues \"may be dissatisfied with any bill that funds ICE,\" adding that while the bill \"takes several steps in the right direction,\" it doesn't include broader reforms that Democrats had proposed.",
      "But the two Democratic appropriators urged that neither of the alternatives in the funding fight \u2014 a continuing resolution to keep the government funded or a government shutdown \u2014 would rein in ICE, due to funding allocated in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year.",
      "The House is expected to vote on the final funding measures before breaking for recess at the end of the week, while the Homeland Security funding measure will likely be considered\u00a0 separately from the other three measures. The package would then move to the Senate, which will have a few days to approve the six funding bills by Jan. 30, before sending them to the president's desk for his signature.",

    "story": [
      "St. Paul, Minn. \u2014 Federal immigration agents forced open a door and detained a U.S. citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out onto the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by The Associated Press.",
      "ChongLy \"Scott\" Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law woke him up from a nap Sunday afternoon and said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St. Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.",
      "\"I was shaking,\" he said. \"They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.\"",
      "Amid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.",
      "\"ICE is not doing what they say they're doing,\" St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. \"They're not going after hardened criminals. They're going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.\"",
      "Thao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained, he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn't want to see it.",
      "Instead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.",
      "Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.",
      "\"It is heartbreaking. It is infuriating to see U.S. citizens, and this gentleman was a U.S. citizen, ripped out of his house without a shirt on, without a coat, without pants, wearing his boxers and Crocs. I don't know how anyone could watch that happen to anyone,\" Mark Goldberg told CBS News Minnesota.",
      "Goldberg was alerted about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation through a community network.",
      "\"Less than five minutes. It all happens very, very quickly, and almost looked like military precision,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Thao said agents drove him \"to the middle of nowhere\" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.",
      "Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a \"targeted operation\" seeking two convicted sex offenders.",
      "ICE offers reason for raid, which is then challenged",
      "\"The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,\" DHS said. \"The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID'd. He matched the description of the targets.\"",
      "Thao's family said in a statement that it \"categorically disputes\" the DHS account and \"strongly objects to DHS's attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.\"",
      "Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.",
      "DHS did not respond to a request from The Associated Press seeking the identities of the \"two convicted sex offenders\" or why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.",
      "Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend. Court records show that the boyfriend shares the first name of another Asian man who has been convicted of a sex offense. Chris Thao said the two people are not the same.",
      "The family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao's treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.",
      "Thao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's \"Secret War\" from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.",
      "Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, \"treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,\" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on an online fundraising page for the family.",
      "ChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.",
      "\"I don't feel safe at all,\" Thao said. \"What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything.\"",

      "According to court filings reviewed by CBS News, Johnson allegedly tried to silence the alleged victim in the case by offering a payout. A police affidavit alleged Johnson told the victim that he had been \"pardoned for storming the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and he was being awarded $10 million as a result of being a 'Jan 6er.'\" The affidavit said Johnson told the victim that Johnson \"would be putting (the victim) in his will to take any money he had left over.\"",
      "Johnson, 44, is accused of molesting the victim over the course of several months, beginning in 2024. After the Capitol riot, Johnson pleaded guilty to four federal charges in connection with his role in the siege. In August 2024, a judge sentenced Johnson to a year in prison for the Jan. 6 case. Johnson was accused of breaking into a private U.S. Senate meeting room and menacing police with vulgarities, while amid the riotous mob on Jan. 6. Photos obtained by the government allegedly showed Johnson climbing through a broken window in the U.S. Capitol that day.",
      "Mr. Trump's pardon a year ago wiped away Johnson's conviction and prison term before he completed his sentence.",
      "In the new Florida prosecution, police alleged Johnson was \"transient\" in July 2025 and was potentially sleeping in a bed in the back of a van he was driving.",
      "Johnson has pleaded not guilty in the case.",
      "A spokesman for the Florida state prosecutor in Hernando County told CBS News, \"Any case that involves the exploitation and molestation of minors, is of the utmost importance.\u00a0 Defendants who commit these crimes deserve to be punished with the full weight of the criminal justice system.\"",
      "If Johnson is released before trial, he would be subject to GPS monitoring and must appear in person for all court dates, the spokesman added, and deferred further comment until there is a verdict in the trial.",

As of last week, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement held 73,000 detainees in custody, the most ever recorded.

      "Flexing American power overseas, realigning U.S. foreign policy",
      "Some of the most consequential moves of the president's term so far have involved his willingness to exert American military power overseas and upend relations with longstanding U.S. allies.In June, the U.S. carried out major strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities in an operation called \"Operation Midnight Hammer.\" Mr. Trump has recently threatened to strike the Iranian regime again over its crackdown and killing of protesters.\u00a0Amid a military buildup in Latin America, the U.S. has carried out at least 34 known strikes on boats the administration claimed were ferrying drugs in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans. The strikes have killed more than 120 people.In an extraordinary and controversial military feat, U.S. forces infiltrated Venezuela and captured then-President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Jan. 3. Mr. Trump soon announced the U.S. would be running the country and taking control of Venezuela's oil infrastructure. The U.S., the White House says, will sell the oil for the benefit of Venezuelans, Americans and U.S. oil companies.Asserting power over Venezuela is one part of the president's \"Donroe Doctrine,\" which holds that the U.S. should wield influence over the Western Hemisphere and play less of a role in Europe's affairs.But the president's audacious campaign to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, has sparked intense concern among NATO allies, flying in the face of modern Western democracies' rejection of imperial expansion. The president has refused to rule out the use of military force to acquire the territory, and says he'll impose tariffs on European countries objecting to his efforts \u2014 telling several countries he no longer feels \"an obligation to think purely of Peace\" because he wasn't awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.The president has pushed for a resolution to the war in Ukraine, but peace efforts stalled after a high-level summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August.The Trump administration, with the help of partners in the Middle East, brokered a long-sought ceasefire and peace deal between Israel and Hamas in October.

Mr. Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in October and struck a deal that partially defused tensions.The president's signature economic legislation, which he calls the \"big, beautiful bill,\" extended a set of tax cuts passed in Mr. Trump's first term, partially paid for through restrictions on Medicaid and food stamps.",

      "Despite Republican control of both chambers of Congress, Washington has passed few pieces of major legislation, with Mr. Trump relying heavily on executive actions to accomplish his objectives. He signed 228 executive orders \u2014 not including other types of executive actions \u2014 in 2025 and the first weeks of 2026, according to the Federal Register, easily outpacing all other presidents in their first year in office.The president's use of emergency powers to levy tariffs without approval from Congress has been challenged all the way to the Supreme Court. The justices are expected to rule soon on whether the president had the constitutional right to impose the tariffs. If the court rules he did not, the U.S. government may have to find a way to repay the levies.The president's uses of military force without congressional approval in Syria, Iran and Venezuela \u2014 and his deployments of National Guard forces to U.S. cities \u2014 have also raised questions about constitutionality and the limits of executive power.

    "summary": "The Justice Dept. says it's investigating a group of protesters in Minnesota who disrupted services at a church where a local ICE official  apparently serves as a pastor.",
    "story": [
      "Minneapolis \u2014 The Department of Justice said Sunday it is investigating a group of protesters in Minnesota who disrupted services at a church where a local official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement apparently serves as a pastor.",
      "A livestreamed video posted on the Facebook page of Black Lives Matter Minnesota, one of the protest's organizers, shows a group of people interrupting services at the Cities Church in St. Paul by chanting \"ICE out\" and \"Justice for Renee Good.\" The 37-year-old mother of three was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month amid a surge in federal immigration enforcement activities.",
      "The protesters allege that one of the church's pastors - David Easterwood - also leads the local ICE field office overseeing the operations that have involved violent tactics and illegal arrests.",
      "Justice Department Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations \"by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.\"",
      "\"A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!\" she said on social media.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying she's \"been in constant communication with (Dhillo)\u00a0 today over these events which (the Justice Department) is investigating at my direction. Any violation of federal law will be prosecuted.\"",
      "Bondi added that she \"just spoke to the Pastor in Minnesota whose church was targeted. Attacks against law enforcement and the intimidation of Christians are being met with the full force of federal law. If state leaders refuse to act responsibly to prevent lawlessness, this Department of Justice will remain mobilized to prosecute federal crimes and ensure that the rule of law prevails.\"",
      "Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents' actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.",
      "\"When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,\" said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. \"If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.\"",
      "The website of St. Paul-based Cities Church lists David Easterwood as a pastor, and his personal information appears to match that of the David Easterwood identified in court filings as the acting director of the ICE St. Paul field office. Easterwood appeared alongside DHS Secretary Kristi Noem at a Minneapolis press conference last October.",
      "Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood's personal contact information could not immediately be located.",
      "Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.",
      "In a Jan. 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE's tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents \"knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.\"",
      "\"Agitators aren't just targeting our officers. Now they're targeting churches, too,\" the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. \"They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.\"",
      "Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ's prosecution was misguided.",
      "\"If you got a head - a leader in a church - that is leading and orchestrating ICE raids, my God, what has the world come to?\" Cullars-Doty said. \"We can't sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray.\"",
      "President Trump weighed in on his Truth Social platform early Tuesday, saying he'd \"Just watched footage of the Church Raid in Minnesota by the agitators and insurrectionists. These people are professionals! No person acts the way they act. They are highly trained to scream, rant, and rave, like lunatics, in a certain manner, just like they are doing. They are troublemakers who should be thrown in jail, or thrown out of the Country. The first to go should be (Minn. Gov. Tim) Walz, and Fake Sleazebag, (Democratic Minnesota) Rep. Ilhan Omar, who is supposedly worth over $30 Million Dollars, even though she's never had anything but a Government job. Investigate these Corrupt Politicians, and do it now.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-greenland-norway-letter-standoff-nato-allies-nobel-peace-prize/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 01:43:00 -0500",
    "summary": "As his standoff with America's closest allies escalates, President Trump says not getting the Nobel Peace Prize means he's no longer obligated \"to think purely of Peace.\"",
    "story": [
      "America's European allies stood united Monday against President Trump's escalating campaign to take control of Greenland,\u00a0accusing him of blackmail with a new threat of tariffs if they continue rejecting his bid for the U.S. to acquire the vast island. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, appeared to hint that he was still willing to use the U.S. military to achieve his objective.",
      "In a message sent to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re and shared with other NATO allies, Mr. Trump said that due to the decision to\u00a0award someone other than himself the Nobel Peace Prize this year, he no longer feels \"an obligation to think purely of Peace,\" and that he \"can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.\"",
      "In the next sentence, Mr. Trump refers to his controversial demand that the U.S. take ownership of Greenland, which has been a territory of American ally Denmark for centuries. He renews his claim that only full U.S. control can prevent the\u00a0strategic Arctic island from falling into the hands of China or Russia.",
      "But speaking to reporters at Palm Beach International Airport late Monday night after attending\u00a0the college football championship game\u00a0in Miami, Mr. Trump said he doesn't care about the Nobel prize, though he continued to say Norway controls who gets it.",
      "\"If anybody thinks that Norway doesn't - doesn't control the Nobel prize, they're just kidding. They (the Peace prize decision makers) have a board, but it's controlled by Norway. And I don't care what Norway says. But I really don't care about that. What I care about is saving lives. And I think I've saved tens of millions of lives.\"",
      "The president also said he thinks European leaders will be conciliatory about Greenland at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week. \"I don't think they're going to push back too much,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Look, we have to have it, they have to have this done. They can't protect it.\"",
      "On his Truth Social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he \"had a very good telephone call with Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO, concerning Greenland. I agreed to a meeting of the various parties in Davos, Switzerland. As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back \u2014 On that, everyone agrees!",
      "He also posted a picture of himself claiming Greenland as a U.S. territory, with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio at his side.",
      "Trump's claims about Greenland and U.S. security",
      "America's closest allies in NATO have rejected Mr. Trump's argument, along with U.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, that the U.S. needs to own Greenland for security reasons.",
      "They note that Greenland already falls under the transatlantic alliance's protection as a Danish territory, that the U.S. has had at least one military base on the island since World War II and Denmark has given an open invitation for Washington to boost that defense presence in partnership with its allies.",
      "Despite those facts, and efforts by Denmark and other European NATO members to show an understanding of and willingness to address rising competition over\u00a0control of vital new shipping lanes around the resource-rich island, Mr. Trump claims again in his message to Norway's leader that \"the World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.\"",
      "He argues that Denmark is incapable of securing the Arctic territory in the face of Russian and Chinese threats \u2014 threats that Senator Mark Warner, the Democratic vice chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee,\u00a0called fictitious over the weekend.",
      "\"Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China,\" Mr. Trump wrote, ignoring the fact that, for almost 80 years, since the U.S. and its European allies committed to the principle of joint security with NATO's founding treaty, Greenland's protection has been a shared responsibility.",
      "Mr. Trump questions in the note, as he's done previously, Denmark's right to any claim over Greenland, arguing that the basis is only that \"a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also.\"",
      "Denmark became the colonial power in Greenland in the early 18th century, about 50 years before the United States became a sovereign nation with its own navy. Greenland remained a Danish colony until 1953, when the island gained its current semi-autonomy.",
      "Though the population is tiny at around 60,000 people, Greenland has its own elected government, and both the island's leaders and the Greenlandic people have made it abundantly clear that they do not want to become part of the U.S.",
      "Norway's leader responds to Trump's message",
      "The Norwegian government\u00a0shared a statement on Monday from Prime Minister St\u00f8re in which he confirms that he received Mr. Trump's message on Sunday afternoon.",
      "He said it came in response to a text message he'd sent along with Finland's President Alexander Stubb.",
      "\"In our message to Trump we conveyed our opposition to his announced tariff increases against Norway, Finland and select other countries. We pointed to the need to de-escalate and proposed a telephone conversation between Trump, Stubb and myself on the same day. The response from Trump came shortly after the message was sent,\" St\u00f8re said in the statement, adding that it was Mr. Trump's \"decision to share his message with other NATO leaders.\"",
      "\"Norway's position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter. We also support that NATO in a responsible way is taking steps to strengthen security and stability in the Arctic,\" said St\u00f8re.",
      "He added, \"As regards the Nobel Peace Prize, I have clearly explained, including to President Trump what is well known, the prize is awarded by an independent Nobel Committee and not the Norwegian Government.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said Monday the president \"believes Greenland is a strategically important location that is critical from the standpoint of national security,\" and is \"confident Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States from modern threats in the Arctic region.\"",
      "U.K. leader doubts Trump will use U.S. military to take Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump stunned America's NATO allies over the weekend by\u00a0threatening to impose new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European nations if they continue to reject his demands to take over Greenland.",
      "After holding talks among themselves on Sunday, the eight countries issued a joint statement saying they were \"committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest,\" while reiterating their support for Denmark and Greenland.",
      "They said they were \"ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" and warned that threats of tariffs undermine \"transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\"",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has maintained good relations with Mr. Trump and spoke with him on the phone Sunday, acknowledged in televised remarks on Monday morning that the Arctic region \"will require greater attention, greater investment and stronger collective defense\" and said the U.S. would \"be central to that effort and the U.K. stands ready to contribute fully alongside our allies, through NATO.\"",
      "\"But there is a principle here that cannot be set aside, because it goes to the heart of how stable and trusted international cooperation works, and so any decision about the future status of Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone,\" said Starmer.",
      "\"Denmark is a close ally of the U.K. and of the U.S. \u2014 a proud NATO member that has stood shoulder to shoulder with us, including at real human cost in recent decades,\" Starmer said, alluding to Danish troops fighting alongside U.S. and British forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, as part of the NATO alliance.",
      "\"Alliances endure because they're built on respect and partnership, not pressure. That is why I said the use of tariffs against allies is completely wrong. It is not the right way to resolve differences within an alliance, nor is it helpful to frame efforts to strengthen Greenland's security as a justification for economic pressure,\" he said. \"A trade war is in no one's interest.\"",
      "As for Mr. Trump not ruling out the use of the American military to seize territory from a NATO ally, Starmer said he didn't believe it would come to that.",
      "\"I don't, actually,\" he said. \"I think this can and should be resolved through calm discussion, but with the application of principles I've set out in terms of who decides the future of Greenland.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Justice says claims made in a lawsuit seeking an immediate stop to the surge\u00a0of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minnesota are \"legally frivolous.\"",
      "The federal agency made the remark in a memorandum filed with the U.S. District Court in Minnesota on Monday, which argued against a motion made by the state of Minnesota, Minneapolis and St. Paul for a temporary injunction.",
      "While Monday is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a federal holiday, the judge said the issue was too important to wait.",
      "U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez is considering whether to grant an immediate temporary restraining order limiting ICE activities. She said last week she would not issue the temporary restraining order until she heard a response from the federal government.",
      "The lawsuit, filed late last week, argues the unprecedented surge of an estimated 3,000 federal agents is endangering citizens. It accuses ICE of violating the First and Tenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.",
      "According to the memorandum, the DOJ argues the plaintiffs' \"Tenth Amendment and related claims have not a shred of legal support\" and that their \"motion should therefore be denied.\"",
      "\"The Tenth Amendment at the heart of Plaintiffs' claims is far different from the Tenth Amendment in the Constitution, which states only a 'truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered,'\" the memorandum said. \"Among the powers the States did not retain at ratification is the power to veto federal action justified under one of the federal government's enumerated powers.\"",
      "The lawsuit alleges that federal law enforcement officers have \"engaged in unlawful conduct\" that harms residents and \"infringes\" on state and local police powers. The Justice Department pushed back, saying, \"Defendants are in Minnesota to enforce federal immigration law, not to run (or close) schools or enforce Minnesota state law.\"",
      "The lawsuit also alleges that DHS agents have conducted warrantless arrests, citing an instance on Dec. 5 when a federal agent entered a south Minneapolis restaurant without a warrant. When the general manager of the restaurant asked for it, the agent said, \"We don't need one.\"",
      "Menendez is the same judge who blocked the use of pepper spray, nonlethal munitions",
      "The notice of appeal comes days after Menendez blocked federal agents deployed to Minnesota, as part of the Trump administration's immigration operations, from using pepper spray or nonlethal munitions on, or arresting, peaceful protesters in the Twin Cities and throughout Minnesota.",
      "The order also bars federal law enforcement from stopping or detaining drivers and passengers when there is \"no reasonable articulable suspicion\" that people driving near protests are forcibly interfering with law enforcement operations.",
      "On Sunday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the order \"a little ridiculous.\"",
      "\"We only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law and order to keep people safe,\" Noem said. \"So that judge's order didn't change anything for how we're operating on the ground, because it's basically telling us to do what we've already been doing.\"",

    "story": [
      "New dinosaur fossils were discovered at the Dinosaur National Monument, leading to the first excavation there in more than 100 years, officials revealed Friday.",
      "The National Park Service said that parking lot construction was underway in September near the Quarry Exhibit Hall in the Utah side of the park when the dinosaur fossils were uncovered. Dinosaur National Monument is located on the border between Colorado and Utah, about 300 miles west of Denver.",
      "A portion of dinosaur-bearing sandstone was exposed when asphalt was removed on Sept. 16 by workers. Construction was immediately paused to allow paleontologists to assess and excavate the fossils.",
      "\"The fossils belong to a large, long-necked dinosaur, most like Diplodocus, which is common in this bonebed,\" the NPS said in a statement.",
      "Approximately 3,000 pounds of fossils and rock were removed during the excavation between mid-September and mid-October, the NPS said. The fossils are being cleaned and studied at the Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum in Vernal, Utah.",
      "According to NPS, the bonebed area had not been excavated for fossils since the original excavations at the site ended in 1924. Meanwhile, the parking lot and road improvement construction project was completed once the excavation was done.",
      "Research released last October suggests that dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before an asteroid smacked the Earth 66 million years ago.",
      "In January 2025, a nearly\u00a070-million-year-old dinosaur fossil was discovered during a parking lot project at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. It is the oldest dinosaur fossil ever found within Denver's city limits.",

    "summary": "Four Artemis II astronauts plan to fly around the moon and back next month, traveling farther from Earth than any humans before them.",
    "story": [
      "After months of meticulous preparation, NASA's 32-story-tall Space Launch System rocket, the most powerful operational booster in the world, was hauled to its seaside launch pad Saturday in Florida, setting the stage for a long-awaited flight next month to send four astronauts on a trip around the moon.",
      "The 5.7-million-pound rocket, carried by an upgraded Apollo-era crawler-transporter tipping the scales at some six million pounds, began the trip to pad 39B just after 7 a.m. local time, creeping out of NASA's cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building at a top speed of just under 1 mile per hour.",
      "Hundreds of space center workers, family members and guests gathered near the VAB and along the crawlerway to take in the sight, posing for selfies and enjoying a chilly Saturday morning as the towering moon rocket slowly rolled past.",
      "New NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman and the Artemis II astronauts \u2014 Cmdr. Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen \u2014 were also on hand to witness the milestone.",
      "\"Wow. LETS GO!!!\" Wiseman posted on the social media platform X with a photo of the SLS rocket moving out of the VAB. In another post, he called the SLS and its Orion crew capsule \"engineering art.\"",
      "Wow. LETS GO!!! pic.twitter.com/xozFfnJI8c",
      "Generating some 8.8 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, the SLS is the most powerful rocket ever operated by NASA, including the agency's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket. It has a little more than half the thrust of SpaceX's Super Heavy-Starship rocket, but after a successful unpiloted test flight in 2022 \u2014 Artemis I \u2014 NASA deemed it safe enough to put astronauts aboard.",
      "The SpaceX rocket is still in the test phase, and it's not known when it might make its first flight with people on board.",
      "The Artemis II crew plans to blast off in early February to test drive their Orion crew capsule in Earth orbit before heading into deep space on a flight around the moon that will carry them farther from Earth than any astronauts have ever ventured. In the process, they will get a chance to observe the far side of the moon in some detail.",
      "\"I think one of the most magical things for me in this experience is when I looked out a few mornings ago, there was a beautiful crescent (moon) in the morning sunrise, and I truly just see the far side,\" Wiseman told reporters during the SLS rollout. \"It was a waning crescent here, so it's a waxing gibbous on the far side.\"",
      "He added: \"And you just think about all the landmarks we've been studying on that far side, and how amazing that will look, and seeing Earth rise, those sorts of things, just flipping the moon over and seeing it from the other perspective is what I think when I look out (at the moon) right now.\"",
      "The trip to launch pad 39B took about eight hours, kicking off a busy few weeks of tightly scripted tests and checkouts before a critical fueling test around Feb. 2 when nearly 800,000 gallons of super cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen will be pumped aboard for a \"wet\" dress rehearsal countdown.",
      "\"One of the first things that happens after we get to the pad, we get  connected ... all the validations, getting tied back to the firing  room, getting ready to power up the individual elements,\" said launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson. \"We will get into our crew module  work (and) we're going to power everything up.\"",
      "Blackwell-Thompson added: \"We have  incrementally tested all of this offline or in the integrated  environment of the VAB and now it's just getting out to the pad and  testing those pad interfaces. ... Wet dress is the big test at the pad.  That's the one to keep an eye on, I guess, that's the driver to launch.\"",
      "The maiden flight of the SLS rocket in 2022 was delayed multiple times by propellant loading problems and persistent hydrogen leaks. For the rocket's second flight, NASA and its contractor team have implemented multiple upgrades and procedural changes to minimize or eliminate any such problems the second time around.",
      "\"Artemis I was a test flight, and we learned a lot during that campaign getting to launch,\" said Blackwell-Thompson. \"And the things that we learned relative to how to go load this vehicle, how to load (liquid oxygen), how to load hydrogen, have all been rolled into the way in which we intend to load the Artemis II vehicle.\"",
      "Because of the relative positions of the Earth and moon, along with the trajectory NASA plans to use for Artemis II, the agency only has five launch opportunities in February: Feb. 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11. Because rollout came a few days later than planned, pushing the fueling test into early February, it would appear only the final three opportunities are still available.",
      "But a leak-free fueling test, in the absence of any other major issues, will clear the way for a launch attempt on one or two of those days. If not, the next set of launch windows opens in March.",
      "A wild card in the mission planning is the launch of a fresh crew to the International Space Station to replace four crew members who returned to Earth ahead of schedule Thursday because of a medical issue affecting one of the astronauts. That launch originally was scheduled for Feb. 15, but NASA managers are looking into moving it up by several days to minimize the gap between crews.",
      "NASA flight controllers want to avoid flying two piloted spacecraft at the same time. If the space station crew replacement flight stays on track, or if problems are found during the SLS fueling test, agency managers might be forced to delay the Artemis II launch to the next set of opportunities in March.",
      "But Isaacman is keeping NASA's options open.",
      "\"We have, I think, zero intention of communicating an actual launch date until we get through wet dress,\" he said. \"But look, that's our first window, and if everything is tracking accordingly, I know the teams are prepared, I know this crew is prepared. We'll take it.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:17:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Depending on the timing, NASA could launch a fresh crew to the space station while four other astronauts are flying around the moon.",
    "story": [
      "With a space station medical evacuation safely completed, NASA is focused on two challenging missions proceeding in parallel: launching four astronauts on a flight around the moon, at the same time as the agency is planning to send four replacement astronauts to the International Space Station.",
      "Engineers plan to haul the Artemis 2 moon rocket to launch pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday for tests leading to launch early next month on a historic piloted flight around the moon.",
      "At the same time, NASA is gearing up to launch four Crew 12 astronauts to the space station, possibly while the Artemis 2 moon mission is underway, to replace four Crew 11 crew members who cut their mission short and returned to Earth ahead of schedule Thursday because of a medical issue.",
      "The Artemis 2 mission and Crew 12's planned space station flight present a unique challenge for NASA. The agency has not managed two piloted spacecraft at the same time since a pair of two-man Gemini capsules tested rendezvous procedures in low-Earth orbit in 1965. The agency has never flown a deep space mission amid another launch to Earth orbit.",
      "\"This is exactly what we should be doing at NASA,\" Jared Isaacman, NASA's new administrator, said Thursday. \"We have the means as an agency ... to be able to bring our astronauts home at any time ... while making preparations to pull forward our next mission, like Crew 12, while also progressing on our Artemis 2 campaign.\"",
      "He described the moon mission as \"probably one of the most important human spaceflight missions in the last half century.\"",
      "The world's most powerful rocket booster",
      "NASA's towering 322-foot-tall Space Launch System rocket, the most powerful operational booster in the world, will be hauled out of the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building early Saturday atop an upgraded Apollo-era crawler transporter. Including at least one stop along the way, the 4-mile move to the pad is expected to take eight to 10 hours.",
      "\"It takes us a little while to get out of the building,\" said Launch Director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson. \"But about an hour after we get that first motion, you'll begin to see that beautiful vehicle cross over the threshold of the VAB and come outside for the world to have a look.\"",
      "Once at the pad, engineers will carry out a variety of tests and work to ready the rocket and its Orion crew capsule for blastoff early next month on the Artemis 2 moon mission.",
      "\"It really doesn't get much better than this,\" John Honeycutt, chairman of the Artemis 2 Mission Management Team, told reporters Friday. \"We're making history.\"",
      "Commander Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen planned to be on hand for the rollout. If all goes well, the crew will test the Orion capsule in Earth orbit before heading into deep space, flying farther from home than any other humans as they loop around the far side of the moon.",
      "Artemis 2 mission plan",
      "The Artemis 2 mission follows a similar flight in 2022 that sent an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon to pave the way for next month's flight. The Artemis 2 mission, in turn, will set the stage for Artemis 3, a long-awaited and oft-delayed mission to land astronauts near the moon's south pole. The current target date for Artemis 3 is 2028.",
      "Despite Saturday's planned rollout, the Artemis 2 launch date is still uncertain.",
      "It will depend in large part on the results of a fueling test around the first of the month when engineers plan to load the booster's 21-story-tall first stage with 733,000 gallons of super-cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen along with a full load of propellants for the booster's 45-foot-tall second stage, the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage, or ICPS.",
      "During tests of the SLS rocket used for the Artemis 1 mission in 2022, multiple fueling tests had to be carried out before engineers finally resolved a series of propellant leaks. The SLS rolling out on Saturday features multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize or eliminate any such leakage.",
      "If the upcoming fueling test goes well, Wiseman and his crewmates could be cleared to blast off a few days before Feb. 11, the end of next month's launch period. If any major problems are found during the propellant loading exercise, Artemis 2 likely will slip to early March when the next set of launch windows becomes available.",
      "Next space station crew",
      "Amid the work to ready the Artemis 2 rocket for launch, NASA managers are also working to move up the launch of the Crew 12 space station crew. Commander Jessica Meir, Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency Sophie Adenot and cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are officially scheduled for launch on Feb. 15.",
      "The crew they are replacing, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, originally expected to return to Earth around Feb. 20 after helping familiarize their replacements with the intricacies of space station operation.",
      "But Crew 11 was ordered to cut their mission short after one of the crew members developed a medical issue of some sort. They returned to Earth Thursday, leaving just three people aboard the space station: cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams. They were launched to the outpost in November aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the Crew 12 launch date to minimize the gap between the two NASA missions. Depending on where it ends up, NASA could be orchestrating a launch to the International Space Station while the Artemis 2 crew is flying around the moon.",
      "\"I don't see any reason why we wouldn't continue along those parallel paths,\" Isaacman said. \"And if it comes down to a point in time where we have to de-conflict between two human spaceflight missions, that is a very good problem to have at NASA.\"",
      "Jeff Radigan, lead flight director for Artemis 2, agreed it made sense to continue preparing for both missions.",
      "\"I know the agency is preparing to launch Crew 12,\" he told reporters. \"There are a lot of preparations going on, but there absolutely are constraints.\"",
      "\"It's not prudent for us to put both of those up at the same time, but we also have to ensure that both of them are ready to go. We may run into an issue, and the last thing we want to do is make a decision too early and then lose an opportunity. That would not be responsible of us.",
      "\"So, we need to keep pressing with both missions, we need to ensure that we're doing that at the right speed, and we're looking at the right technical constraints. As we get closer, either the decision will come about because the hardware's talking to us and we have an issue that we have to go deal with, or we have to pick one.\"",
      "But, he added, \"that doesn't mean we should stop preparing for either mission right now, but we need to do that at the right pace.\"",

      "Four space station fliers undocked and plunged back to Earth, safely splashing down in the Pacific Ocean early Thursday off the Southern California coast six days after NASA ordered them home early\u00a0because of a medical issue.",
      "Descending under four large parachutes, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, co-pilot Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov landed in the Pacific off San Diego at 3:41 a.m. EST, closing out a 167-day stay in space.",
      "\"On behalf of SpaceX and NASA, welcome home, Crew 11,\" a SpaceX flight controller radioed.",
      "\"It's so good to be home, with deep gratitude to the teams that got us there and back,\" Cardman replied.",
      "SpaceX support crews stationed near the landing site quickly reached the gently bobbing spacecraft and hauled it aboard a company recovery ship where flight surgeons were standing by to carry out initial medical checks.",
      "Under strict medical privacy guidelines, NASA has not identified the astronaut who had the medical issue in orbit or provided any details about its nature.",
      "But the crew appeared healthy and in good spirts as they were helped out of the cramped capsule and onto waiting stretchers -- normal procedure for returning station crews -- smiling and waving as they began re-adjusting to gravity after five-and-a-half months in weightlessness.",
      "\"All crew members are currently undergoing the routine post-splashdown medical evaluation,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said during a post-landing news conference. \"The crew member of concern is doing fine. We will share updates on their health as soon as it's appropriate to do so.\"",
      "All four were expected to be flown to shore by helicopter for more extensive diagnostic evaluation at an unidentified area hospital.",
      "\"All four crew members will be transported to a local hospital for additional evaluation, taking advantage of medical resources on Earth to provide the best care possible,\" NASA said in a blog post.",
      "\"Following a planned overnight hospital stay, the crew will return to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will reunite with their families and undergo standard post-flight reconditioning and evaluations.\"",
      "Left behind in orbit were Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, who took over command of the space station from Fincke, and the cosmonaut's two Soyuz MS-28 crewmates, Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams. They were launched last November for a planned eight-month stay in space.",
      "Cardman and her crewmates, who launched to space on Aug. 1, 2025, were originally expected to return to Earth around Feb. 20 to wrap up a 202-day mission.",
      "But last Wednesday, the day before a planned spacewalk by Cardman and Fincke, one of the crew members experienced a medical issue of some sort and the next day, NASA managers decided the issue was serious enough to bring the crew home early for a more extensive diagnostic evaluation.",
      "NASA's chief medical officer said it was not an emergency return in any normal sense, but the decision marked the first time in NASA history that a spaceflight was cut short due to a medical concern.",
      "In a long post on LinkedIn, Fincke said the crew was in good shape, but he added the decision was \"the right call.\" All four astronauts looked to be in good spirits during a change of command ceremony Monday when Fincke officially turned the space station over to cosmonaut Kud-Sverchkov.",
      "None of the crew members mentioned the issue in the week between their initial request for a private medical conference and their return to Earth. In a final post on X Wednesday, Yui sent down pictures of Mount Fuji, saying \"Hello! The day has finally arrived for our departure to Earth.\"",
      "\"I haven't had a chance to photograph daytime Japan recently, but at the very last moment, we passed over the Pacific side of Japan,\" he said. \"Mount Fuji bid us farewell, adorned with a touch of crimson makeup from the setting sun.\"",
      "The space station is continuously staffed by a crew of seven: Three launch and return to Earth aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft and four fly to and from the lab aboard NASA-managed SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ships.",
      "Both spacecraft serve as lifeboats during a crew's long-duration space station stay. If a Soyuz or Crew Dragon flyer gets sick or is seriously injured aboard the station, that person is joined by all of his or her crewmates for the flight back to Earth.",
      "With that possibility in mind, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon. The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one crew depart early.",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Williams will be on his own managing the U.S. segment of the space station until Crew 12 arrives in February.",
      "Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, a space station veteran, rookies Jack Hathaway and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot, and veteran cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are officially scheduled for launch Feb. 15. However, NASA and SpaceX are looking into moving that launch up a few days amid work to ready a Space Launch System rocket for launch as early as Feb. 6 to send four astronauts on a looping fight around the moon.",

    "story": [
      "OpenAI announced Friday that it will begin testing ads on ChatGPT in the coming weeks, opening the door to another potential revenue stream for the AI company in addition to its subscription-based models.",
      "The ads will appear at the bottom of the chat window \"when there's a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation,\" OpenAI said in a blog post.",
      "In one example shared by the AI company, a user asks for authentic Mexican dish recommendations. ChatGPT responds with ideas for carne asada and pollo al carbon dishes and then links to a grocery brand advertising hot sauce.",
      "Only adults who use the free version of ChatGPT, or ChatGPT Go, a new low-cost subscription plan OpenAI announced Friday, will be shown ads. Higher-tier subscriptions, including Pro, which now costs $200 a month, will not include ads, OpenAI said.",
      "Asked how long the ad testing phase will last, and whether it has plans to scale the use of ads, an OpenAI spokesperson told CBS News, \"We will look at early user feedback and quality signals to see if early testing meets our bar before expanding.\"",
      "The AI company said the ads will not influence the answers ChatGPT provides and that it will not share conversations users have with the chatbot \u2014 or their data \u2014 with advertisers.",
      "The OpenAI spokesperson did not disclose the companies it intends to advertise on ChatGPT but said the company will \"have more to share about our early partners soon.\"",
      "OpenAI framed the introduction of the ads as a way to keep the free and low-cost versions of the chatbot accessible to more users.",
      "\"Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong, and we believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone,\" OpenAI said in its blog post.",
      "The AI company, which launched ChatGPT in 2022, is valued at $500 billion, but hasn't turned a profit yet, CNBC reported in November. The additional cash flow generated from ads could help ChatGPT invest in its growth and fund ongoing expenses, Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, told CBS News.",

      "ChatGPT \"convinced Austin \u2014 a person who had already told ChatGPT that he was sad, and who had discussed mental health struggles in detail with it \u2014 that choosing to live was not the right choice to make,\" according to the complaint. \"It went on and on, describing the end of existence as a peaceful and beautiful place, and reassuring him that he should not be afraid.\"",
      "ChatGPT also effectively turned his favorite childhood book, Margaret Wise Brown's \"Goodnight Moon,\" into what the lawsuit refers to as a \"suicide lullaby.\" Three days after that exchange ended in late October 2025, law enforcement found Gordon's body alongside a copy of the book, the complaint alleges.",
      "The lawsuit accuses OpenAI of designing ChatGPT 4, the version of the app Gordon was using at the time of his death, in a way that fosters people's \"unhealthy dependencies\" on the tool.",
      "\"That is the programming choice defendants made; and Austin was manipulated, deceived and encouraged to suicide as a result,\" the suit alleges.",
      "Paul Kiesel, a lawyer for Gordon's family, said in a statement to CBS News that, \"This horror was perpetrated by a company that has repeatedly failed to keep its users safe. \u00a0This latest incident demonstrates that adults, in addition to children, are also vulnerable to AI-induced manipulation and psychosis.\"",

    "summary": "Grok faces mounting scrutiny from government officials and advocacy groups after people used the AI chatbot\nto create sexualized images of minors and women.",
    "story": [
      "A coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups is calling on Google and Apple to remove access to social media platform X and its AI app, Grok, from their app stores after Grok allowed users to generate sexualized images of minors and women.",
      "The organizations, which focus on child safety, women's rights and privacy, expressed their concerns in\u00a0letters\u00a0on Wednesday to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that Grok's content violates the technology companies' policies.",
      "\"We demand that Google leadership urgently remove Grok and X from the Play Store to prevent further abuse and criminal activity,\" the groups said, using the same language in its letter to Apple.",
      "Apple and Google didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "On Thursday, xAI, the company that developed Grok, said in a safety\u00a0update posted on X that it would now \"geoblock\" users from generating \"images of real people in bikinis, underwear and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal.\"",
      "It also said the image creation tool will only be available to paid subscribers.",
      "\"We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,\" the company said. \"This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Elon Musk, who owns X and xAI, said in a\u00a0post\u00a0that he is \"not aware of naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.\" He also said the chatbot declines prompts to generate illegal images.",
      "\"There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Grok backlash",
      "Criticism of Grok escalated in early January after the generative-AI app enabled users to create images of minors wearing minimal clothing. In response to a user prompt, Grok acknowledged lapses in its digital safeguards.",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, told CBS News earlier this month that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok. In a December\u00a0analysis, the group estimated the chatbot was creating \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which seeks to eliminate child sexual abuse from the internet, has also raised concerns about Grok and other AI tools.",
      "\"We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material.\" Ngaire Alexander, head of hotline at IWF, told CBS News in a statement last week. \"Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream.\"",
      "California opens probe",
      "Grok is also attracting scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and authorities overseas. On Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta\u00a0announced he was opening an investigation into the sexually explicit material produced using Grok.",
      "\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer last week raised the possibility of banning X, which uses Grok, in Britain over the AI tool's generation of sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "The European Commission is also monitoring the steps X is taking to prevent Grok from generating inappropriate images of children and women, Reuters reported Wednesday.",

      "Washington \u2014 More than 10 countries have signed on to join President Trump's \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza, sources familiar with the discussions told CBS News, but not all have said so publicly.",
      "Israel, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Kosovo, the United Arab Emirates, Belarus, Morocco, Hungary and Canada have announced they're accepting his invitation.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said so Wednesday, as did Egypt's foreign ministry.",
      "As the president envisions it, the group would be comprised of world leaders, with him as its chairman. Countries can contribute $1 billion to become permanent members, rather than holding a typical three-year membership, the White House said, although Canada has said it won't pay to join.",
      "Some countries will contribute far less, possibly around $20 million, one of the sources said.",
      "A White House official told CBS News over the weekend that \"virtually every dollar\" raised would be spent on the board's mandate in Gaza. Fundraising to rebuild Gaza will be a separate effort, one U.S. official said.",
      "Another U.S. official told CBS News the president wants a signing ceremony for the board at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, and has been contemplating whether the board's work should extend beyond Gaza, and perhaps be a rival to the United Nations.",
      "But the group's formation is facing serious headwinds from U.S. allies, particularly as the president renews his push to acquire Greenland and has not ruled out the use of military force to do so. Low support for the board could be embarrassing for the administration in Davos.",
      "Norway and Sweden\u00a0 said Wednesday they're holding off, at least for now, due to concerns about the terms for joining.",
      "Russia has been invited, despite its continued assault on Ukraine and the Trump administration's statement that the Kremlin poses such a threat to national security that the U.S. must acquire Greenland to counter it.",
      "On Monday night, the president threatened France with 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne \u2014 which would likely make those products far more expensive for Americans \u2014 if the French don't join the board. The White House hasn't yet said whether Mr. Trump was serious or whether he was joking. At this point, France doesn't intend to give a favorable response to the U.S., according to a source familiar with its deliberations.",
      "The White House says the Board of Peace will \"play an essential role in fulfilling all 20 points of the president's Gaza plan, providing strategic oversight, mobilizing international resources, and ensuring accountability as Gaza transitions from conflict to peace and development.\"",

    "story": [
      "The move by the board to add President Trump's name to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., has triggered a series of legal and legislative challenges. At least one federal lawsuit and two congressional measures seek to strip Trump's name from the exterior signs and website of the historic theater complex.",
      "In a federal civil lawsuit, Rep. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat who serves as one of the Kennedy Center's trustees, is asking a court to rule that her fellow Kennedy Center board members violated the law in December 2025, in voting to add Mr. Trump's name to the center.",
      "The suit also seeks a judge's order to \"declare that the name of Kennedy Center is 'The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts' and declare that the vote to change the Kennedy Center's name is null and void, and without legal effect.\"",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News the Trump administration is expected to formally respond to Beatty's lawsuit by the end of February.",
      "In her suit, Beatty noted that soon after President Kennedy was assassinated, Congress designated the yet-to-be-built Kennedy Center \"as the sole national memorial to the late President within the nation's capital.\"",
      "\"Because Congress named the center by statute, changing the Kennedy Center's name requires an act of Congress,\" Beatty's lawsuit said. \"But on Dec. 18 and 19, 2025 \u2014 in scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic \u2014 the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump. This is a flagrant violation of the rule of law, and it flies in the face of our constitutional order.\"",
      "The decision by the new board to rename the Kennedy Center, part of an overhaul of the facility by Mr. Trump, was denounced by his critics. The president ousted a group of Kennedy Center board members in February and installed close allies as replacements.",
      "Comprising largely Trump loyalists, the board elected Mr. Trump as chairman in February. Longtime Trump ally Richard Grenell was named interim president and executive director of the Kennedy Center.",
      "The cost of the changes to the signage, website and other Kennedy Center monikers is unknown. In response to questions from CBS News about the pricetag, a Kennedy Center spokeswoman issued a statement saying, \"President Trump deserves credit for saving America's cultural center after years of neglect \u2014 as the very legislators attacking him now sat idly by while the center fell into disrepair.\"",
      "Norm Eisen, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who is among those challenging the name change in the lawsuit, told CBS News, \"The damages have been substantial, and that will be addressed in the case. They include far more, of course, than the high cost of signage and of the other naming changes. The losses to the performing corps, to the audience base, to the bottom line of the Center, to its memorial and other activities and indeed to the arts and arts education themselves have been vast.\"",
      "Aside from Rep. Beatty, other Congressional Democrats are also attempting to remove Mr. Trump's name from the Kennedy Center.",
      "In the House, Democratic members have introduced two bills to intervene.",
      "Rep. April McClain Delaney, a first-term Democrat from the Washington, D.C., suburbs in Maryland, has introduced a bill to \"require the removal of any signage or other identification from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts that differs from the designation 'John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\"",
      "McClain Delaney told CBS News, \"A president can't enshrine himself. This is what authoritarian leaders do,\" adding that \"it's arrogant and it's narcissistic.\"",
      "In a separate House resolution, Rep. Stephen Lynch, a longtime Massachusetts congressman who serves on the House Oversight Committee, is seeking a formal statement from the House that the renaming of Kennedy Center violates federal law.",
      "In a December floor speech, Rep. Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat, blasted the effort by Trump allies, calling it \"a sacrilege to a martyred, heroic, historic American president whose name was attached to the Kennedy Center for his support for cultural excellence in America and because he was an assassinated president who we all mourned.\"",
      "\"The idea that Donald Trump would want his name to go before Kennedy's \u2014 or even with Kennedy's \u2014 is a sacrilege,\" Cohen said. \"It should not be changed ever, and it should go through this Congress, who named it the Kennedy Center, on a bill in this House and signed by President Lyndon Johnson.\"",

      "Equipped with a thick stack of papers labeled \"Accomplishments,\" the president recited a lengthy list of actions he and his administration have taken since his inauguration, emphasizing his immigration crackdown and economic policies.",
      "He acknowledged that his message has not always resonated with voters, and said the briefing was part of his attempt to correct that. \"I think we've done a much better job than we're able to promote. We're not promoting. We're doing a great job, and we're sort of letting the promoting take care of itself,\" he said.",
      "The president also touched on a number of hot-button issues, including his pursuit of Greenland, tensions with NATO allies and his \"Board of Peace\" in Gaza. Asked how far he's willing to go to acquire Greenland, the president said, \"You'll find out.\"",
      "Mr. Trump departed Washington Tuesday night to travel to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum, the annual gathering of world leaders, policymakers and business figures. However, shortly after takeoff, White House officials said a \"minor electrical issue\" forced the plane to return to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. The president then boarded a different aircraft bound for Davos."

      "A car wash chain with locations across Indiana and Minnesota ranks as the best place to work in the U.S., according to employee reviews on job site Glassdoor.",
      "Crew Carwash scored the top spot on Glassdoor's 100 Best Places to Work in 2026. Crew, a family-owned business that last year earned the second spot on the list, employs about 1,000 part- and full-time workers across its 55 locations in the Midwest.",
      "Glassdoor bases its rankings on insiders' takes on criteria that can determine a\u00a0good job, ranging from opportunities for career growth to satisfaction with compensation and benefits. Its proprietary awards algorithm analyzed anonymous reviews of U.S.-based employers posted on the site from October 2024 through October 2025.",
      "\"Flexibility is extremely important for employees right now, and that doesn't just mean remote work,\" Glassdoor chief economist Daniel Zhao told CBS News. \"Some companies are willing to be flexible on hours or give more autonomy to workers in terms of how they manage their careers.\"",
      "Still, most American workers are disengaged at work, meaning they're either doing the bare minimum or are resentful or unhappy, Gallup's latest State of the Global Workplace report found. Only 3 in 10 workers are engaged, the lowest level in a decade.",
      "Engaged workers tend to have higher productivity and create better business outcomes, Gallup noted. Workers are checking out amid new pressures in the workplace, from the disruption of artificial intelligence to budget cuts, Gallup said.",
      "Tech companies losing dominance",
      "Although tech companies remain the best-represented industry on the list, taking 24 spots, they appear to be losing their luster among workers. That number is down from 26 spots in 2025 and 31 in 2024.",
      "\"This is part of an ongoing trend where many tech employers are trimming some of the things that made the job so appealing over the last year,\" Zhao said. \"They are pushing harder and harder on efficiency and productivity.\"",
      "To be sure, \"there is still an enormous career and income upside, and you see that reflected in chipmaker Nvidia ranking third,\" he said.",
      "This year's rankings added nineteen companies to the list, including Alaska Airlines at No. 38, Bath and Body Works at No. 80, Dutch Bros Coffee at No. 75 and Bank of America at No. 96.",

      "Some white-collar employers are also dropping off the list, as some workers start to view blue-collar work as less likely to be supplanted by AI, Zhao said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-bars-lindsey-halligan-u-s-attorney-title/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:18:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Lindsey Halligan has departed the Justice Department after a federal judge Tuesday barred her from referring to herself as a U.S. attorney in court filings.",
    "story": [
      "Lindsey Halligan has departed the Justice Department after a federal judge Tuesday barred her from referring to herself as a U.S. attorney in court filings, finding that her continued use of the title \"ignores a binding court order\" that disqualified her from the position last year.",
      "In a statement posted to social media Tuesday night, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed Halligan's exit, calling her departure a \"significant loss for the Department of Justice and the communities she served.\"",
      "Bondi also described the \"circumstances that led up to this outcome\" as \"deeply misguided.\"",
      "The announcement followed an\u00a018-page ruling Tuesday\u00a0from U.S. District Judge David Novak, who sits on the federal bench in Richmond, Virginia. Novak ruled that Halligan's \"continued identification of herself as the United States Attorney for this District ignores a binding court order and may not continue,\" and ruled that Halligan could face disciplinary proceedings if she continues to use that \"improper moniker.\"",
      "Novak's ruling came after a November ruling from U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie found that Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia was invalid and violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause. She dismissed the cases Halligan had brought against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The Justice Department has appealed the ruling.",
      "The statute invoked by the Trump administration to appoint Halligan allows an interim U.S. attorney to serve for 120 days. After that, the interim U.S. attorney may be extended by the U.S. district court judges for the region.",
      "Earlier this month, Novak ordered Halligan to provide the basis for her repeated use of the title of U.S. attorney and explain why it \"does not constitute a false or misleading statement,\" after she listed herself on an indictment returned in the district in December as a \"United States attorney and special attorney.\"",
      "Top Justice Department officials defended Halligan's attempts to remain in her position as a U.S. attorney in court filings, accusing the Trump-appointed judge of \"gross abuse of power\" and attempting to \"coerce the Executive Branch into conformity.\"",
      "The filing, signed by Halligan, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, called Novak's move an \"inquisition,\" \"insult,\" and a \"cudgel\" against the executive branch. The Justice Department argued that Currie's ruling in November applied only to the Comey and James cases and did not bar Halligan from calling herself U.S. attorney in other cases that she oversees.",
      "However, earlier Tuesday, prior to Bondi's announcement that Halligan was departing the Justice Department, the DOJ had reversed course, telling prosecutors to stop referring to Halligan as U.S. attorney and to refer to her instead as special attorney going forward, according to a source familiar with the matter. CBS News reached out to the Justice Department for clarification.",
      "In his ruling, Novak wrote that the Justice Department's argument \"rings hollow,\" and \"fundamentally misunderstands\" the legal issue at question.",
      "\"Judge Currie, speaking for all district judges in this District, found Ms. Halligan's appointment as Interim United States Attorney unlawful and issued two orders dismissing indictments, both of which were premised directly on that rationale,\" Novak wrote. \"Those Orders, though currently on appeal, have not been overturned or stayed, and thus constitute the law of this District. Having been found by this Court to be unlawfully appointed, Ms. Halligan lacks lawful authority to represent herself as the United States Attorney before this Court.\"",
      "Novak also criticized the quality of the Justice Department's response to his order, stating that it had \"unnecessary rhetoric\" that \"contains a level of vitriol more appropriate for a cable news talk show and falls far beneath the level of advocacy expected from litigants in this Court, particularly the Department of Justice.\"",
      "Instead of working through \"numerous legal options\" that would have allowed her to identify herself as U.S. attorney while the appeal of Currie's ruling continues, \"she elected to simply ignore valid court orders.\"",
      "\"The Court finds it inconceivable that the Department of Justice, which holds a duty to faithfully execute the laws of the United States even those with which it may have disagreement, would repeatedly ignore court orders, while simultaneously prosecuting citizens for breaking the law,\" Novak wrote. \"If the Court were to allow Ms. Halligan and the Department of Justice to pick and choose which orders that they will follow, the same would have to be true for other litigants and our system of justice would crumble.\"",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who was a member of President Trump's legal team and joined Mr. Trump's White House staff after he won a second term in 2024. In September, Halligan was selected to serve as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after her predecessor abruptly left the post amid concerns he would be forced out for failing to prosecute James.",
      "She was appointed to her post on Sept. 22 for a total of 120 days, which Novak said expired Tuesday. While Halligan has been nominated by the White House, neither of Virginia's Democratic senators has signed on to advance the nomination for a vote in the Senate.",
      "Days after she was appointed, Halligan sought and secured a two-count indictment against Comey alleging he lied to Congress during testimony in September 2020. James, the New York attorney general, was indicted on bank fraud charges in early October. Both pleaded not guilty and pursued several arguments to have their respective indictments dismissed, including the validity of Halligan's appointment and claims of vindictive prosecution.",
      "\"The Court recognizes that Ms. Halligan lacks the prosecutorial experience that has long been the norm for those nominated to the position of United States Attorney in this District,\" Novak wrote. \"Consequently, and in light of her inexperience, the Court grants Ms. Halligan the benefit of the doubt and refrains from referring her for further investigation and disciplinary action regarding her misrepresentations to this Court at this time.\"",
      "Also on Tuesday, the chief federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia posted that the court is seeking applicants to replace Halligan. Federal law says that judges in a district without a Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney are tasked with selecting a replacement, although President Trump could fire whomever the court chooses to succeed Halligan.",

    "summary": "An infectious disease physician and former CDC official said he does not \"have faith\" that the U.S. is \"handling measles very well.\"",
    "story": [
      "South Carolina's measles outbreak continues to grow, with officials on Tuesday announcing an additional 88 cases in the state. There have been 646 cases of measles reported there since October, according to the\u00a0South Carolina Department of Public Health.",
      "The ongoing spread of measles cases in the United States has led to concern that the U.S. will lose its measles elimination status. A country is considered as having eliminated measles if there are \"no locally transmitted measles infections or outbreaks lasting 12 months or longer,\" according to the World Health Organization.",
      "The South Carolina outbreak is centered around Spartanburg County. Recent public exposure locations include multiple schools, a Publix supermarket and the South Carolina State Museum, according to the department.",
      "\"The majority of the cases [are] occurring in the under-vaccinated, close-knit community in the Spartanburg area,\" Dr. Ralph Lee Abraham, the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a phone briefing. He said the CDC \"continues to investigate transmission patterns and is working closely with South Carolina health officials.\"",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases. In some cases, it can cause severe infections that lead to hospitalization and death.",
      "Doctors and health officials say the measles vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination MMR vaccine in childhood, is highly effective and safe. Vaccination rates for measles have dropped in recent years, with many areas falling below the herd immunity threshold experts say is necessary to keep the disease from circulating.",
      "In 2025, the United States saw over 2,240 cases of measles \u2014 the most in 30 years, according to the CDC. Many of those cases were connected to an outbreak in West Texas.",
      "As of Jan. 13, the U.S. has recorded 171 measles nationwide in 2026, the CDC said. The agency plans\u00a0to release new numbers for measles cases on Friday.",
      "\"I don't have faith that we're in a place where we can say that we're handling measles very well. Texas was an example. South Carolina is now the new example,\" said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, an infectious disease physician and former leader of immunization and respiratory disease strategy at the CDC. \"South Carolina is another example of what we see when there's low vaccination rates and a public health system that's not really able to robustly address what's happening.\"",
      "Measles elimination status at risk",
      "The Pan American Health Organization, the regional office for the World Health Organization in the Americas, will meet in April to review measles elimination status for the United States and Mexico.",
      "Canada lost its measles elimination status in November, 27 years after it was considered eliminated in that country.",
      "The U.S. officially eliminated measles in 2000.",
      "\"Measles elimination status is a milestone for a country,\" Daskalakis said. \"It indicates that its public health system is healthy and able to respond to measles, which is the most infectious virus that we know. If you can handle measles, the implication is that you have the infrastructure to be able to handle a lot of other infectious diseases as well.\"",
      "Daskalakis said he was skeptical that the U.S. will maintain its elimination status in 2026, which could open the door for further outbreaks of previously eliminated or rare diseases, he said.",
      "\"If this is our vital sign, we're in the ICU,\" he said. \"The future could be that we are going to be looking at measles becoming part of every day.\"",
      "Staying safe amid measles outbreaks",

    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 19:42:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and others were subpoenaed in connection with a DOJ probe into an alleged conspiracy to impede federal immigration officers, three sources said.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department on Tuesday served subpoenas to the offices of multiple Democratic officials in Minnesota, including Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, in connection with a probe into an alleged conspiracy to impede federal immigration officers, three sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "The subpoenas represent a significant escalation between the Justice Department and Minnesota officials, who have clashed over the Trump administration's intense crackdown against immigrants living in the state illegally. They were served on the same day that Attorney General Pam Bondi arrived for a visit in Minnesota, multiple sources told CBS.",
      "The subpoenas were sent in connection with a Justice Department investigation into state and local officials to see if they may have conspired to impede federal officers from discharging their duties, sources said.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A copy of a subpoena seen by CBS does not specify which criminal violations the department is probing. However, multiple sources previously told CBS the primary statute being used as the basis for the probe is 18 USC 372 \u2014 the same one that was used against some of the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, including members of the far-right Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys.",
      "Mr. Trump granted clemency to the more than 1,500 people who were convicted of crimes in connection with the Capitol riot during his first day in office one year ago.",
      "Earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security staged a massive deployment of federal immigration agents to the Minneapolis region, saying they would be tasked with arresting people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally and probing allegations of fraud.",
      "In total, roughly 3,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents have been dispatched to the Twin Cities, a force that is nearly five times the size of the Minneapolis police department, which employs about 600 officers.",
      "The high-profile federal deployment has been strongly opposed by state and local leaders, including Walz, Ellison and Frey, and angered many local residents, who have denounced actions and operations by federal agents as heavy-handed and indiscriminate.",
      "Protests and confrontations between residents and federal agents have become a near-daily occurrence, especially after the killing of Minneapolis mother Renee Good by an ICE officer on Jan. 7.",
      "Walz's office confirmed to CBS News that it received a subpoena. In a statement, Walz said Minnesota would \"not be drawn into political theater,\" and alleged that the Justice Department's investigation \"does not seek justice,\" but is a \"partisan distraction.\"",
      "\"Minnesotans are more concerned with safety and peace than baseless legal tactics aimed at intimidating public servants standing shoulder to shoulder with their community,\" Walz said.",
      "Frey, in a statement to CBS News, confirmed receiving the subpoena and said the Justice Department is pursuing him for merely disagreeing with the administration.",
      "\"When the federal government weaponizes its power to try to intimidate local leaders for doing their jobs, every American should be concerned,\" he said. \"We shouldn't have to live in a country where people fear that federal law enforcement will be used to play politics or crack down on local voices they disagree with. In Minneapolis, we won't be afraid. We know the difference between right and wrong, and, as Mayor, I'll continue doing the job I was elected to do: keeping our community safe and standing up for our values.\"",
      "Ellison, in a statement to CBS, also confirmed that his office has received a grand jury subpoena seeking records, and noted that the subpoena is not directed to him personally.",
      "\"Less than two weeks ago, federal agents shot and killed a Minnesotan in broad daylight. Now, instead of seriously investigating the killing of Renee Good, Trump is weaponizing the justice system against any leader who dares stand up to him,\" he said. \"Everything about this is highly irregular, especially the fact that this comes shortly after my office sued the Trump Administration to challenge their illegal actions within Minnesota.\"",
      "Casper Hill, a spokesperson for Ramsey County \u2014 which includes St. Paul, Minnesota's capital city \u2014 told CBS News in a statement that Ramsey County was also served with a subpoena.",
      "Hennepin County spokesperson Daniel Borgertpoepping told CBS News that \"[n]either Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty nor the Hennepin County Attorney's Office was served with a subpoena,\" but that Hennepin County, whose county seat is in Minneapolis, was served with a subpoena. \"The Civil Division of the Hennepin County Attorney's Office represents Hennepin County in legal matters and will be advising the County on the subpoena,\" Borgertpoepping said.",
      "The subpoena sent to Frey's office orders the office's custodian of records to appear for testimony on Feb. 3.",
      "It also asks for eight categories of documents, including all records and communications issued by the office since Jan. 1, related to federal immigration enforcement in Minnesota, any communications related to the lack of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement and any directives issued to Minnesota residents concerning their interactions with immigration officers.",
      "Legal experts remain skeptical that the Justice Department has enough evidence to secure any indictments in the case.",
      "\"A grand jury subpoena should not be issued to an individual who is merely exercising their First Amendment rights,\" said Gene Rossi, a former federal prosecutor who is now an attorney with Carlton Fields.",
      "\"Impeding an investigation is not done by words. It is done by actions. And all they are doing is criminalizing the policy of a president. If that is the basis for a grand jury investigation, the entire country could be subject to a grand jury investigation.\"",

    "summary": "A judge has ordered that actor Timothy Busfield be released from jail during a detention hearing on child sex abuse charges.",
    "story": [
      "A judge has ordered that actor Timothy Busfield be released from jail as he awaits trial on child sex abuse charges.",
      "The order Tuesday, by state district court Judge David Murphy during a detention hearing, is linked to accusations that Busfield inappropriately touched a minor while working as a director on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady.\"",
      "The judge ordered that the defendant be released on his own recognizance, pending trial. Busfield will be supervised upon release by a pretrial service in Albuquerque, and can leave the state to live at home, the judge said. Under the conditions of his release, Busfield cannot be in possession of firearms or drugs and can't have contact with the alleged victims.",
      "Busfield, an Emmy Award-winning actor who is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" was ordered held without bond last week at his first court appearance. Busfield called the allegations lies in a video shared before he turned himself in.",
      "At the hearing Tuesday, Busfield was handcuffed and dressed in an orange jail uniform in a New Mexico state district court, while wife and actor Melissa Gilbert watched from the court gallery.",
      "Gilbert was tearful while exiting the courtroom after the judge ordered Busfield's release.",
      "Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls in the 1970s to '80s TV series \"Little House on the Prairie,\" is on the list of potential witnesses submitted ahead of the hearing.",
      "Albuquerque police issued a warrant for Busfield's arrest earlier this month on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. A criminal complaint alleges the acts occurred on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady.\"",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the police department says the child reported Busfield touched him on private areas over his clothing on one occasion when he was 7 years old and another time when he was 8. The boy's twin brother told authorities he was also touched by Busfield, but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "On Monday, Busfield's attorneys submitted two brief audio recordings of initial police interviews in which the children say Busfield did not touch them in private areas. The attorneys in a court filing argue that the complaint characterizes the interviews as a failure to disclose abuse, but an \"unequivocal denial is materially different from a mere absence of disclosure.\"",
      "According to the criminal complaint, one of the boys disclosed during a therapy session that he was inappropriately touched by the show's director. Those records were obtained by police during the investigation.",
      "Arguing Tuesday for Busfield's continued detention, Bernalillo County  Assistant District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch called evidence of abuse against Busfield strong and specific.",
      "\"The boys' allegation are supported by medical findings and by their therapist,\" Brandenburg-Koch said. \"Their accounts were specific and not exaggerated.\"",
      "She also described a documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior by Busfield over the past three decades. Prosecutors also say witnesses have expressed fear regarding retaliation and professional harm.",
      "\"GPS is not going to tell this court if he is around children or talking to witnesses,\" Brandenburg-Koch said.",
      "Busfield's attorneys have argued that the allegations emerged only after the boys lost their role in the TV show, creating a financial and retaliatory motive. The filings detailed what the attorneys said was a history of fraud by both the boys' father and mother. They cited an investigation by Warner Bros. that found the allegations unfounded.",
      "Busfield also submitted letters vouching for his character, and his attorneys say he passed an independent polygraph test.",
      "Legal experts say New Mexico is among a few states that allow polygraph evidence in criminal cases, but a judge has final say over whether one can be used. There are strict requirements for admission.",

      "Beltr\u00e1n moved up steadily each year he was on the ballot, from 46.5% in 2023 to 57.1% the following year and 70.3% in 2025, when he fell 19 votes short as Ichiro Suzuki, CC Sabathia and Billy Wagner were elected.\u00a0 The threshold for entrance into the Hall is 75%.",
      "Beltr\u00e1n played 20 seasons in Major League Baseball, making the All-Star team nine times and ending with a career .279 average with 435 homers and 1,587 RBI. He is one of only five players in league history with 500 doubles, 400 homers and 300 steals, according to MLB. The others are Alex Rodr\u00edguez, Barry Bonds, Andre Dawson and Willie Mays.",
      "Beltr\u00e1n began his career with the Kansas City Royals in 1999, winning AL Rookie of the Year. In June of 2004, the Royals traded Beltr\u00e1n to the Houston Astros, and he went on to hit eight home runs in the postseason that year, putting him in a seven-way tie as of his induction for second most home runs in a single postseason.",
      "The following year, he signed with the New York Mets, where he played from 2005-2011, winning three Gold Gloves and two Silver Slugger awards during that stretch.",
      "Beltr\u00e1n went on to have relatively short playing stints with the San Francisco Giants, St. Louis Cardinals, New York Yankees and Texas Rangers before returning to Houston for the 2017 season, when he won his only World Series title.",
      "Beltr\u00e1n was hired as Mets manager on Nov. 1, 2019, but stepped down two months later without having managed a game, three days after he was the only Astros player mentioned by name in a report by MLB regarding the team's illicit use of electronics to steal signs during Houston's run to the 2017 World Series championship.",
      "\"We all did what we did. Looking back today, we were wrong,\" Beltr\u00e1n said on the Yankees' YES Network broadcast in 2022, after he was hired as an analyst. \"I wish I would've asked more questions about what we were doing. I wish the organization would've said to us, `Hey man, what you guys are doing, we need to stop this.'\"",
      "Jones hit .254 with 434 homers, 1,289 RBIs and 152 stolen bases in 17 seasons with Atlanta (1996-2007), the Los Angeles Dodgers (2008), Texas (2009), the Chicago White Sox (2010) and the Yankees (2011-12).

But, according to MLB, Jones ranked third in Baseball-Reference WAR (57.6) from 1998 to 2007, behind only Alex Rodriguez and Barry Bonds.",
      "In the 1996 World Series opener at Yankee Stadium, at 19 years, 5 months, Jones became the youngest player to homer in a World Series game, beating Mickey Mantle's old mark by 18 months. Going deep against Andy Pettitte in the second inning and Brian Boehringer in the third of a 12-1 rout, Jones became the second player to homer in his first two Series at-bats after Gene Tenace in 1972.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-lisa-cook-federal-reserve/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:01:43 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump moved to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in August.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to convene Wednesday to consider President Trump's bid to remove Lisa Cook from her post on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, a case that could have significant ramifications for the independence of the central bank.",
      "The case arose after Mr. Trump attempted to oust Cook from the board last year \u2014 an unprecedented move that marked the first time in the Fed's 112-year history that a president tried to fire a sitting governor. So far, lower courts and the Supreme Court have allowed Cook to continue serving in her post while litigation over her removal proceeds.",
      "But the case is being closely watched for its potential implications for the Fed's independence. Also looming over the legal battle is a criminal investigation by the Justice Department related to testimony Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave to the Senate Banking Committee last June about a multi-year project to renovate the central bank's Washington, D.C., headquarters.",
      "Powell, a frequent target of Mr. Trump's attacks, is set to attend arguments Wednesday, a source directly familiar with his plans confirmed to CBS News.",
      "\"We have never seen a direct showdown between the president and the Federal Reserve in terms of the president trying to fire the governors of the Fed,\" said Adam White, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the Supreme Court. \"We don't even know what the rules are really for this kind of showdown.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 allows the president to remove a member of the Fed's Board of Governors \"for cause,\" though it does not define the term. The president invoked that law last August when he informed Cook in a\u00a0letter\u00a0that she had been fired. Mr. Trump cited as the basis for her ouster allegations from a senior member of his administration, Federal Housing Director Bill Pulte, that Cook made misrepresentations on mortgage documents relating to properties in Michigan and Atlanta.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove Cook because of what he claimed was \"deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter.\"",
      "Cook has denied wrongdoing, and her lawyers called the allegations against her \"flimsy\" and \"unproven.\" They argued that the accusations were \"conveniently timed\" after Mr. Trump criticized the Fed's decisions surrounding interest rates. The president has expressed frustration that the central bank has not moved quickly enough to lower interest rates and denounced Powell as \"incompetent\" and \"crooked.\"",
      "On the heels of her purported removal, Cook filed a lawsuit challenging the move and arguing that the president violated the Federal Reserve Act. Cook also said she was entitled to and deprived of notice and the opportunity for a hearing before she was fired.",
      "A U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., ruled for Cook and reinstated her to the role, finding that Mr. Trump had not validly removed her \"for cause.\" Judge Jia Cobb also ruled that Cook was likely to succeed on her argument that her due-process rights were deprived because she did not receive the necessary process before her firing.",
      "After a divided panel of three appeals court judges continued to block Cook's removal, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene and allow the president to fire her.",
      "But the high court in October scheduled arguments in the case and allowed Cook to remain in her position while it weighs Mr. Trump's bid for emergency relief. As a result, she participated in the past two meetings of the Fed's interest rate-setting committee. Its next meeting is set for late January.",
      "Arguments in the legal battle come weeks after the Supreme Court considered another effort by Mr. Trump to fire members of independent agencies. In that case, the Justice Department argued that for-cause removal protections for those officials are unconstitutional because the president has unrestricted power to remove executive officers.",
      "But in the court fight involving the Fed, the Trump administration is not challenging the constitutionality of the removal restriction for members of the Fed board. Instead, the issues are whether Mr. Trump needed to give Cook notice and a hearing before removing her, if the president had cause to fire her \u2014 and what constitutes \"cause\" \u2014 and whether courts can review that finding.",
      "\"This is the first fight between the president and a Fed governor over how to carry out that power that's been in the law for a century, but mercifully we've never used it,\" White said. \"I think the court will save the Federal Reserve Act, but not necessarily save this Federal Reserve actor.\"",
      "In Supreme Court filings, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued the president lawfully ousted Cook after \"concluding that the American people should not have their interest rates determined by someone who made misrepresentations material to her mortgage rates that appear to have been grossly negligent at best and fraudulent at worst.\"",
      "Cook's alleged conduct \"created an intolerable appearance of impropriety in someone charged with the weightiest responsibilities in our financial system,\" he wrote. \"There is a world of difference between that removal and removals grounded in policy disagreements.\"",
      "Sauer also told the justices in papers that courts cannot second-guess the president's determination that there was cause to fire Cook. But even if they could, Mr. Trump identified a valid reason for doing so: her \"apparent fraud or gross negligence in a financial matter,\" the solicitor general said.",
      "But Cook's lawyers argued that the Fed's independence and for-cause removal protection prohibit her firing. They told the Supreme Court in filings that the allegations of private, pre-office conduct do not constitute \"cause\" for removal. Cook was appointed by President Joe Biden to the Fed Board in May 2022, and the allegations involve mortgage agreements from 2021.",
      "Cook also did not receive the notice and opportunity to be heard that she is due under federal law and the Constitution's Fifth Amendment, they said.",
      "Accepting Mr. Trump's claim that removals from the Fed Board are not subject to judicial scrutiny would \"eviscerate\" Congress' choice to safeguard the central bank's independence, Cook's lawyers warned.",
      "\"Congress did not mean for the nation's monetary policy to turn on that game of find-an-alleged crime,\" they said.",
      "The Supreme Court has indicated in a string of decisions that it believes the president has the power to remove members of independent agencies at will. But it has also suggested that the Fed is different from entities like the Federal Trade Commission and National Labor Relations Board. In a May order allowing Mr. Trump to fire members of two labor boards without cause, the high court singled out the central bank as a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Then, in arguments in December, Justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed concerns about undermining the independence of the Fed. He suggested the court could create an exception for the central bank to the president's otherwise unrestricted power to remove certain executive officers.",
      "But some legal experts question that path. Ilan Wurman, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, warned that it may be difficult for the Supreme Court to explain why the Fed should be treated differently from other independent agencies.",
      "\"There's no exception in the Constitution to the constitutional separation of powers, to the president's oversight of law execution for financial regulators. There just isn't,\" he said. \"Go look for a clause in the Constitution that says financial regulators are different. You're not going to find it. If the Federal Reserve is exercising executive power, it's no different than any other exercises of executive power.\"",
      "Cook has argued that the mortgage allegations are pretextual, and Mr. Trump moved to fire her because he disagrees with her monetary-policy decisions. Powell, too, said the threats of criminal charges are \"pretexts\" and a consequence of the Fed setting interest rates that differ from Mr. Trump's preferences.",
      "As to the Fed chair, Wurman said, \"It's clear they're trying to build a case for-cause on the assumption that the court will, in fact, think the Fed is different.\"",
      "Fed governors serve 14-year terms. If Mr. Trump is ultimately allowed to fire Cook and the president appointed a successor, it would mean he will have named the majority of the seven-member Board of Governors. With Powell's tenure as chair also set to end in May, the president has been meeting with candidates to succeed him.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-10-percent-credit-card-rate-cap-banks-january-20/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:33:32 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year 10% cap on credit card rates starting Jan. 20. Here's what credit card companies are doing.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump had set Jan. 20 as a deadline for credit card companies to lower their interest rates to 10% for one year. Now that the date has arrived, most banks and card issuers have largely kept their rates unchanged, while also pushing back against an idea that they say lacks key policy details necessary for them to comply.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the cap on Jan. 9, giving banks and issuers just 11 days to meet his demand. In his Truth Social post announcing the proposal, he said he wanted to ensure that Americans wouldn't get \"'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration.\"",
      "The interest rate cap has drawn bipartisan support from some lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri. If enacted, the proposal could save consumers $100 billion per year in reduced interest payments, but the banking industry warns that it could backfire because issuers would be forced to reduce credit access to millions of consumers.",
      "Banks and credit issuers are also seeking more information about the cap, although Mr. Trump has announced no further details on how he'd legislate or enforce the proposed one-year limit on the annual percentage rate (APR) that credit issuers can charge consumers.",
      "Credit card rates have been sliding lower during the past year, thanks partly to the Federal Reserve's series of 2025 rate cuts. The average APR stood at 19.7% at the end of December, a full percentage point lower than the record high set in August 2024, according to Bankrate.",
      "And many banks offer zero-percent APR cards, which typically provide cards with no interest for an introductory period of, say, 12 to 15 months. After that period, the cards' APRs can rise to a range of roughly 17% to 27%, depending on a consumer's credit score. Mr. Trump's proposal would cap those rates to 10%, as well as any other card that's currently above that level.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Mr. Trump expects credit card companies to comply with the demand.",
      "\"I don't have a specific consequence to outline for you, but certainly this is an expectation and frankly a demand that the president has made,\" she said Jan. 16.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on how it will enforce the policy or determine if banks are complying with the new proposed rule.",
      "What do experts say?",
      "Banks and bank lobbyists say they are largely in the dark on how to respond to the proposed cap.",
      "Currently, there's no law or executive order in place mandating that lenders charge no more than 10% interest on credit cards. There's also no generally applicable federal law that limits the interest rate that can be charged by a credit card company, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "Experts say that a rate cap would likely require approval from Congress.",
      "Mr. Trump could seek to drum up support around a bipartisan bill, such as this one introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2025, said Brian Shearer, the author of the Vanderbilt University\u00a0analysis\u00a0that found a 10% limit would save consumers $100 billion per year in interest payments.",
      "If that bill became law, Mr. Trump could force banks to comply. But mandating a rate cap through an executive action may not be enforceable, he said.",
      "How are banks responding?",
      "Because a cap on APRs would eat into bank profits, card issuers would be likely to cut off the most vulnerable borrowers from credit, banks and bank lobbyists say.",
      "Two-thirds of credit card users carrying a balance would be likely to see their credit lines reduced or canceled entirely, according to a Jan. 12\u00a0analysis from America's Credit Unions, an industry group representing credit unions. Almost all 47 million Americans with a subprime credit score would lose access to credit, the group found.",
      "In a Jan. 12 investor call, JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum said the proposed interest rate cap would be bad for consumers and could hurt the economy.",
      "\"Specifically, people will lose access to credit, like on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it the most, ironically,\" he said. \"And so, that's a pretty severely negative consequence for consumers, and frankly, probably also a negative consequence for the economy as a whole right now.\"",
      "The bank also pointed to products it already offers consumers, including cards that offer customers introductory interest rates of 0% for up to 18 months.",
      "In the meantime, one company is stepping up to offer new credit cards that meet Mr. Trump's proposal. Bilt, a fintech company, said it is\u00a0rolling out new credit cards\u00a0that cap interest rates at 10% for one year.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/affirm-buy-now-pay-later-rent/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:28:57 -0500",
    "summary": "A new BNPL pilot from financial technology company Affirm will give renters the option to break up their rent into two equal payments.",
    "story": [
      "Americans have historically turned to buy now, pay later (BNPL) financing to cover the cost of everyday expenses like groceries and consumer purchases such as clothing and furniture. Now, some of these lending companies are turning their attention to a bigger expense: Monthly rent.",
      "A new BNPL option from fintech company Affirm will give renters the option to break up their rent into two equal payments instead of a single lump sum payment.",
      "Affirm, one of the biggest BNPL companies, told CBS News the service is starting as a limited pilot program through a partnership with New York-based company Esusu. The latter company reports consumers' payment information to the major credit agencies, according to its website.",
      "A spokesperson from Affirm said the company underwrites every application and approves only people it believes can \"responsibly afford to repay.\"",
      "\"If a tenant applies through Esusu and is approved by Affirm, they are eligible to receive a 0% interest loan to be repaid in two, biweekly installments without any fees,\" the spokesperson said in an email. \"Esusu and Affirm are not offering interest-bearing loans as part of this program.\"",
      "Affirm isn't the first company to offer BNPL loans for rent payments, but it could have a wider reach, according to Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, an association of non-profit consumer organizations. Approximately 24 million Americans use Affirm's BNPL services.",
      "\"Affirm is one of the leaders in this space,\" Rust said. \"Their reach is going to be different.\"",
      "The Affirm spokesperson did not disclose how long the pilot will last or whether it plans to expand the BNPL rent option once the pilot ends. Fintech company Zip also offers a BNPL product for rent, according to trade publication PaymentsDive.",
      "BNPL comes with risks",
      "BNPL has grown in popularity because it gives consumers the option to split their payments into multiple bite-sized installments rather than paying the full cost of big-ticket items up front.",
      "A December report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that upwards of 50 million consumers took out at least one BNPL loan in 2023 from one of the six major lenders in 2023.",
      "BNPL plans typically give customers the option to pay back the cost of a purchase in four installments with no interest, according to CFPB.",
      "While this may seem like an alluring option, it can come with hidden risks. Taking out multiple loans with different deadlines can make it difficult to keep track of repayments and lead to missed payments, for which some companies charge late fees.",
      "\"It is easy to get turned around,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree.",
      "In some cases, missed BNPL payments can get reported to the credit bureaus, taking a toll on your credit score.",
      "Affirm says on its website that it's the only major BNPL service to report loan activity to U.S. credit bureaus. The San Francisco-based company shares payment information with Experian and TransUnion, two of the three main credit reporting agencies.",
      "Housing security",
      "Experts, meanwhile, have warned that BNPL can be a slippery slope that can end up pushing consumers further into debt \u2014 an issue that could pose bigger risks when dealing with monthly rent.",
      "\"You can see the problem of how borrowing could lead to a death spiral that actually threatens a tenant's housing security,\" Rust said, adding that few examples exist where tenants can borrow money to pay their rent.",
      "Schulz thinks Affirm's new option could offer tenants more flexibility, but said it could also cause people to overextend themselves.",
      "\"They might feel like they can afford a bigger monthly rent because they're able to spread the cost out over multiple paychecks,\" he said. \"That's a pretty risky game.\"",
      "Still, Schulz thinks BNPL for rent will only continue to grow in popularity as people seek out flexible payment options.",
      "\"Lenders and businesses are clearly seeing the demand for these types of offerings, and I'd suspect that we will only see more of these loans in the near future,\" he said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-birth-tourism-visa-waiver-program-republican-senators/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:11:02 -0500",
    "summary": "A trio of Republican senators asked the Trump administration to end a visa waiver program in far-flung U.S. territories in the Pacific that they say encourages \"birth tourism.\"",
    "story": [
      "A trio of Republican senators asked the Trump administration to end a visa waiver program that they say encourages \"birth tourism\" from Chinese nationals and allows them \"to obtain fast-track American citizenship.\"",
      "The program currently allows Chinese nationals to visit the U.S. territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands visa-free for up to\u00a0 14 days.",
      "In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum dated Jan. 15, the three GOP senators \u2014 Rick Scott of Florida, Jim Banks of Indiana and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma \u2014 urged the Trump administration to end the Guam-CNMI waiver program, saying it \"has opened the United States to significant security threats by creating a veritable cottage industry of Chinese nationals giving birth in the [Mariana Islands] and gaining access to U.S. citizenship.\"",
      "The senators' letter comes as Scott pushes for a bill he introduced in November that would ban the use of surrogacy in the U.S. by people from certain foreign countries, including China. Scott's bill highlights a Chinese-born couple in California who had nearly two dozen babies born to surrogates removed from their care last year amid a child abuse investigation.",
      "President Trump raised the issue of Chinese \"birth tourism\" during a press briefing on Tuesday, speaking on a wide range of topics \u2014 including birthright citizenship \u2014 while marking the first year of his second term.",
      "\"China is making a big business out of that,\" said Mr. Trump. \"They come to the country. They have a child. They're an American citizen. They get all the benefits.\"",
      "The Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program was created in 2009. It allows holders of Hong Kong passports to travel to the islands for up to 45 days without obtaining a visa.",
      "In the years after its creation, Saipan, the capital of the Northern Marianas, became a hotspot for birth tourism.",
      "But by 2024, births to tourists on the island dropped significantly. There were only 58 live births to tourists at the islands' hospital, down from a high of 581 in 2018 during the first Trump administration, according to data provided to CBS News by the office of Kimberlyn King-Hinds, who represents the Northern Mariana Islands as a non-voting delegate in the House.",
      "In its final weeks, the Biden administration expanded the program, allowing citizens of mainland China to travel to the islands without a visa for up to 14 days.",
      "The GOP senators worry the Guam and Northern Mariana visa waiver policies create a long-term security risk, saying that people born through the program could eventually \"apply for high positions within the U.S. federal government and likely receive priority consideration due to fluency in Mandarin.\"",
      "\"This is an ongoing security vulnerability that Xi Jinping and his successors in the [Chinese Communist Party] will be more than happy to exploit,\" they wrote, later adding that \"birth tourism\" has \"overwhelmed\" the Northern Marianas' only public hospital.",
      "But King-Hinds, a fellow Republican, disagrees.",
      "\"Congresswoman King-Hinds does not support changes to the CNMI-Guam Visa Waiver Program based on claims that 'birth tourism' is overwhelming the Commonwealth Health Center,\" said her spokesperson, Christopher Concepcion. \"Birth tourism in the CNMI is not a major issue when viewed in the context of total foreign births in the United States today, particularly given that millions of Chinese nationals travel to the mainland United States each year.\"",
      "Simon Hankinson, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the visa waiver program should be reserved for countries that share criminal record information and whose travelers rarely overstay visas. \"None of that applies with China,\" Hankinson said.",
      "\"We should not have any visa waiver program involving China,\" Hankinson said. \"China is a competitor at best, a threat at worst, and their people should be screened for visas, just like people from most of the rest of the world.\"",
      "In 2017, the Justice Department scored marquee victories in its fight against \"birth tourism\" schemes in Saipan. Chinese national Sen Sun was sentenced to a year in federal prison for an illegal business that catered to pregnant foreigners. In a separate case, Richard Peng, who had dual citizenship in the U.S. and Taiwan, received a six-month sentence for running a business \"harboring\" birth tourists, housing them on a farm on the island.",
      "In their letter, Scott and the other senators pointed to a more recent pair of cases that they say point to continued vulnerabilities with the visa program. Last year, a Chinese national named Kangle Jiang was sentenced to 30 days in prison for transporting eight other Chinese nationals from Saipan to Guam. \"Most of the passengers were later encountered in or near sensitive military installations,\" according to the Justice Department.",
      "In November, four other men received sentences ranging from 37 days to 30 months for smuggling 21 people to Guam, all of whom were Chinese nationals who the Justice Department said were attempting to avoid airport immigration checks.",
      "The senators said the cases refute the idea that the visa waiver program benefits the islands, saying the schemes \"hardly offered a reliable source of economic development for U.S. citizens and residents residing in the Marianas.\"",
      "Benjamin Jensen, a senior fellow at the bipartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies, emphasized national security concerns. He said the program could allow China \"to take advantage of that loophole, to then get operatives in place to monitor U.S. military facilities, which are all increasingly being expanded and upgraded in that area.\"",
      "\"We're expanding out all sorts of runways and facilities across the entire region as part of creating mobility to get back and forth between the U.S. mainland and even Japan and the first island chain. So there's tons of refurbishment all throughout the area of old, even World War II fields,\" Jensen said. \"So it's key for military options, which is why anything that might compromise it is a real issue.\"",
      "Customs and Border Protection abruptly halted processing of applications under the program in April 2025, before resuming in July. The absence of tourists under the program during those months led to a 30% drop in visitors and a spike in hotel vacancies, the Marianas Visitors Authority said in July, calling the \"pipeline\" to \"non-visa holders from Hong Kong and China, something we desperately need to revive our tourism economy.\"",
      "Concepcion said King-Hinds credits President Trump for work during his first and second terms that has allowed the islands' depleted tourism industry to remain \"on life support.\"",
      "\"Hastening the collapse of the CNMI's only industry by further restricting customers entering the Commonwealth and hindering the government's dire need for revenue would do far greater harm to the fragile healthcare system on the islands,\" Concepcion said.",
      "The senators asked for a response from Noem by Jan. 28. A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior referred CBS News to the Department of Homeland Security, which said it replies to correspondence from senators through official channels.",
      "\"We would strongly urge that you require a standard tourist visa for Chinese nationals visiting the CNMI, which is a unilateral decision that can be made by the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security,\" the senators wrote.",

    "summary": "Hawaii enacted a rule that bars people from bringing guns onto private property that is open to the public, like shops or gas stations, unless the owner gives express authorization.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared skeptical of a Hawaii law that bars people with concealed-carry licenses from bringing their handguns onto private property that is open to the public unless they receive permission from the owner.",
      "Several of the conservative justices suggested during oral arguments that Hawaii was treating the Second Amendment differently than other constitutional rights and had enacted a restriction that singles out firearms.",
      "\"You're just relegating the Second Amendment to second-class status,\" Justice Samuel Alito told Neal Katyal, who argued in defense of Hawaii's law in the case known as Wolford v. Lopez. \"I don't see how you can get away from that.\"",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts cited previous Supreme Court decisions that raised concerns that the Second Amendment is a \"disfavored right.\" Roberts pressed Katyal to justify the distinction between the First and Second Amendments as it relates to private property.",
      "\"It strikes me that one of the things that your side has to come to grips with is it is a very clear constitutional right,\" Roberts said of the Second Amendment.",
      "The chief justice argued that under the First Amendment, a candidate for public office can knock on a voter's door without needing express permission from the property owner. But in Hawaii, a person who is armed must first receive authorization to enter private property.",
      "\"I'm trying to figure out what exactly the difference is between the First Amendment and the Second Amendment,\" he said.",
      "At issue in the case is Hawaii's default rule that bars people with concealed-carry licenses from bringing their guns onto private property that is open to the public, like shops or gas stations, unless the owner gives express authorization. Carrying a gun in violation of the law is a misdemeanor that is punishable by up to one year in prison.",
      "Four other states \u2014 California, Maryland, New Jersey and New York \u2014 have imposed restrictions similar to Hawaii's and limit carry by license-holders on private property. But in the remaining 45 states, licensed handgun owners can generally carry arms onto private property that's open to the public.",
      "Hawaii's default rule is one of 15 location-based restrictions that, according to gun-rights backers, effectively ban public carry in much of the state.",
      "Three Maui County residents and the Hawaii Firearms Coalition, a gun-rights group, sued state officials in 2023, challenging the state's restriction as a violation of their Second Amendment right and seeking a court order blocking its enforcement. As part of their suit, the plaintiffs also challenged measures prohibiting handguns in restaurants, bars, beaches, parks and banks or other financial institutions. Those provisions are not at issue in the case before the Supreme Court.",
      "The restrictions were signed into law by Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, a Democrat, in the wake of the Supreme Court's landmark 2022 decision in the case New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, in which the justices ruled that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to carry handguns in public.",
      "The court's decision established a new framework for evaluating whether firearms restrictions comport with the Second Amendment. Under its new test, the government must justify its regulation by showing that it is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "A U.S. district court sided with the plaintiffs and found that Hawaii's rule likely violates the Second Amendment as applied to property that is open to the public. The state appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed the decision and upheld Hawaii's measure.",
      "\"Nothing in the text of the Second Amendment or otherwise suggests that a private property owner \u2014 even owners who open their private property to the public \u2014 must allow persons who bear arms to enter,\" a 9th Circuit panel of judges found.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed in October to decide whether the Second Amendment allows a state to bar concealed-carry license-holders from carrying firearms on private property open to the public.",
      "Alan Beck, who argued on behalf of the carry-license holders and the Hawaii Firearms Coalition, told the justices that the state's rule \"runs roughshod\" over the right to bear arms. He argued Hawaii enacted its law to undermine the Second Amendment, and said the state failed to show that it was rooted in the nation's tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "\"Our national tradition is that people are allowed to carry on private property that is open to the public,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration is backing the plaintiffs in the case. Sarah Harris, a lawyer in the Solicitor General's Office, told the justices that Hawaii's law \"offends our history and tradition.\" She warned that a public-carry licensee running errands with a gun in their purse risks committing a crime merely by stopping to put gas in their vehicle.",
      "In a Supreme Court filing, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the state's default rule is \"blatantly unconstitutional\" and effectively prevents public carry.",
      "\"Because most owners do not post signs either allowing or prohibiting firearms, Hawaii's law effectively means that ordinary citizens licensed to publicly carry may not carry firearms in public at all,\" Sauer wrote. \"That near-total ban defies the 'general right to publicly carry arms.'\"",
      "Citing the Supreme Court's history-and-tradition test for evaluating gun restrictions, Justice Brett Kavanaugh indicated that the case should be an easy one because Hawaii fails to satisfy it.",
      "\"Here, there's no sufficient history supporting the regulation. End of case,\" he told Harris.",
      "But Katyal, who defended the law, argued that while the Constitution protects the right to bear arms, it doesn't create implied consent to bring those arms onto private property.",
      "\"In some places, it's reasonable to assume guns are welcome. In others, it's pretty clear an invitation to shop is not an invitation to bring your Glock,\" he said.",
      "Katyal wrote in a Supreme Court brief that Hawaii's law respects the Second Amendment, but also vindicates citizens' right to \"exclude unwanted entry onto private property.\"",
      "\"Hawai'i is free to enact a law clarifying that the public's implied license to enter private property does not include an invitation to bring a gun, particularly because that accords with the well-established custom in Hawai'i,\" he said.",
      "Gun violence prevention groups urged the Supreme Court to uphold Hawaii's rule, arguing that it promotes public safety. In a friend-of-the-court brief, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence and Giffords Law Center said that private-property owners who want to exercise their own right to self-defense may not want visitors to carry weapons.",
      "\"Hawai\u02bbi's default rule does not bar individuals from exercising their Second Amendment right to carry firearms in public. It does not create gun-free zones. Instead, Hawai'i's default rule allows private property owners to choose whether to permit firearms on their property before any visitors enter with a concealed weapon,\" lawyers for the groups wrote.",
      "They argued that Hawaii's law respects the rights of private property and personal security.",
      "The dispute over Hawaii's restriction is one of two cases involving the Second Amendment that the Supreme Court is hearing in its current term. The high court will also decide the constitutionality of a federal law that prohibits unlawful drug users from having firearms, with arguments set for early March.",

    "summary": "In an exclusive interview from her jail cell, Aimee Bock defended her conduct in Minnesota's Feeding Our Future fraud case, but admitted regrets.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has justified its ongoing immigration crackdown in Minnesota by citing a need to curb fraud and pointing to a widening scandal involving members of the Somali American community. Yet prosecutors say the mastermind of the state's biggest fraud scheme to date was not Somali but a White woman \u2014 45-year-old Aimee Bock.",
      "In an exclusive interview from her jail cell, Bock defended her conduct, admitted regrets and argued that state officials who she worked with should bear some of the blame. It was the first time Bock spoke publicly since she was arrested for her role in what prosecutors say was a $250 million COVID-era effort to defraud a federal program to feed hungry children.",
      "\"I wish I could go back and do things differently, stop things, catch things,\" said Bock, who was the head of Feeding Our Future, the now-infamous nonprofit that signed up restaurants and caterers to receive taxpayer money for providing meals to kids. \"I believed we were doing everything in our power to protect the program.\"",
      "So far, prosecutors have charged 78 defendants connected to Feeding Our Future, with more than 60 pleading guilty or convicted at trial. Nearly all are East African or of Somali descent, except for Aimee Bock.",
      "During a five-week trial last year, prosecutors alleged Bock signed off reimbursement claims for millions of meals that were never served. She was also charged with collecting bribes. Together, she and the meal site operators were accused of stealing tens of millions of federal dollars and spending it on luxury cars, real estate ventures and vacations.",
      "\"That money did not go to feed kids,\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Lisa D. Kirkpatrick at the time. \"It was used to fund their lavish lifestyle.\"",
      "A jury convicted her on all counts. She's now awaiting sentencing and faces up to 33 years in prison. Evidence submitted at trial included text messages where Bock compared Feeding Our Future to the mob.",
      "\"The jury saw overwhelming evidence of what Bock knew,\" said lead prosecutor Joe Thompson following the verdict. \"She was at the head of the scheme from Day One. She signed every single fraudulent claim that was submitted to the state of Minnesota.\"",
      "Bock told CBS News she was neither mastermind nor mob boss.",
      "\"It was heartbreaking,\" Bock said, describing the moment she heard the verdict. \"I believe in accountability. If I had done this, I would've pled guilty. I wouldn't have gone to trial. I wouldn't have put my children and my family through what we've been through. I've lost everything.\"",
      "Last month, a judge ordered her to forfeit more than $5 million in proceeds from the scheme.",
      "\"We relied on the state\"",
      "Most of the millions federal officials seized from her were sitting in a bank account for the nonprofit, and Bock denied she personally lived a lavish lifestyle. She downplayed the items FBI agents found at her home when they raided it in 2022 \u2014 a home she had lived in for more than a decade.",
      "\"They found minimal jewelry,\" Bock said. \"I believe it was like two pairs of earrings, a bracelet, a watch. There was some cash there.\"",
      "Bock's attorney, Kenneth Udoibok, shared video showing stacks of food at meal sites operated by Feeding Our Future contractors. Bock said she was doing everything in her power to root out fraud and terminated agreements with dozens of entities she believed were cheating the system.",
      "\"I was the only one that stopped a claim and said, this is fraudulent,\" Bock said. \"There are tens of millions of dollars in claims that we did not pay, that we refused.\"",
      "The sudden growth of Bock's organization was staggering. In 2019, Feeding Our Future submitted $3.4 million worth of meal claims. In 2021, it submitted nearly $200 million. Bock attributed the increase to the looser guidelines during the pandemic that allowed parents to pick up meals and bring them home. Asked whether the spike in volume raised red flags at the time, Bock claimed she had sign-off from Minnesota officials.",
      "\"We relied on the state,\" she said, adding that local officials, including Rep. Ilhan Omar, would often visit the meal sites. \"We told the state, this site is going to operate at this address, this time, and this number of children. The state would then tell us that's approved.\"",
      "Omar has denied she was aware of individuals defrauding the food program, and previously has condemned the misuse of funds. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has drawn widespread scrutiny for his handling of fraud in the state. But Walz has defended his administration's response, saying \"we've spent years cracking down on fraudsters\" and accusing the Trump administration of \"politicizing the issue to defund programs that help Minnesotans.\"",
      "Udoibok, Bock's attorney, said state officials at the time weren't particularly interested in stopping the fraud, because the nonprofit was providing at least some food to an important constituency during a time of significant instability.",
      "\"What is a lie is that they were policing this fraudulent activity at any time,\" Udoibok said. \"They wanted a scapegoat. She ran the only food program in the state, so they pinned it on her.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Walz did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"Nobody wants to be labeled a racist\"",
      "Bock spoke to CBS News in the aftermath of the killing of Renee Good, as Minneapolis became a flashpoint in the administration's push to crackdown on illegal immigration. According to Bock, some of the individuals picked up in ICE sweeps are now being held at the jail where she is being held until she is sentenced.",
      "In some ways, it's possible to trace origins of the current tensions in Minnesota to Bock and her nonprofit. Good was killed by an ICE agent after the Department of Homeland Security surged thousands of personnel into the state with a twin mandate to enforce immigration laws and help investigate fraud.",
      "Yet long before the issue of fraud became a galvanizing issue for the right \u2014 and fodder for conservative influencers \u2014 federal prosecutors in Minnesota had zeroed in on Bock. A lifelong Minnesotan, Bock earned a degree in elementary education and held roles at day cares and early childhood centers before starting Feeding Our Future in 2016.",
      "\"Our goal as an organization was to reach the kids that were not being fed,\" said Bock, who has two sons of her own. \"There is kind of this quiet need in Minnesota, these food deserts, where there's just not access to healthy nutritionist food for children.\"",
      "The nonprofit became a so-called \"sponsor\" for two federal nutrition programs funded by the Department of Agriculture and overseen by Minnesota's Education Department that paid for kids' meals during the school year and over the summer. When COVID hit, the USDA issued waivers that gave sponsors like Feeding Our Future more flexibility in how they distributed the food.",
      "\"During COVID, for obvious reasons, parents were allowed to come and pick up meals,\" Bock explained. \"So we suddenly were able to reach more children. We were also able to deliver meals to homes.\"",
      "Restaurants and caterers, particularly from Minnesota's large Somali immigrant community, were eager to sign up. Bock said her organization was well-positioned to fill the need, but state education officials were wary about letting in some of the business that applied.",
      "\"The Department of Education was sitting on the applications,\" Bock said. \"They were just not processing them.\"",
      "As racial justice protests swept the country in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, Bock filed a lawsuit, alleging the state's scrutiny of Somali applicants was discriminatory and deprived low-income and minority children access to \"desperately needed federal food programs.\"",
      "Asked how she believed state officials received the lawsuit, Bock acknowledged \"nobody wants to be labeled as racist.\"",
      "That aggressive advocacy won her praise from the tight-knit Somali community. One community leader told a local reporter Bock was \"a modern-day Robin Hood.\"",
      "Bock denied the lawsuit was a scare tactic. The parties reached a settlement where Minnesota's Education Department agreed to process applications to the meal program \"reasonably promptly.\"",
      "\"The notion that a state government is paralyzed and has to allow this level of fraud because they were afraid of what I might do in a lawsuit is preposterous,\" Bock said.",
      "Years later, education officials told a state watchdog \"the threat of legal consequences and negative media attention\" intimidated them into easing off. Still, officials with Minnesota's Department of Education (MDE) insist they did act, noting they were the ones who referred Bock to the FBI in 2021.",
      "\"Criminals took advantage of the program even though MDE met or exceeded federal regulations,\" the education commissioner wrote in a letter to the state watchdog. \"At all times MDE made its best judgments about its authority for oversight in the context of legal requirements and pushback.\"",
      "Editor's note: This story has been updated to clarify wording about\u00a0the descent of other Feeding Our Future defendants.",

    "summary": "What's a \"peanut butter\" raise? Here's what it means, and why this is the type of pay hike you should expect this year.",
    "story": [
      "Your 2026 pay raise could be a \"peanut-butter\"-style increase, with new research from compensation expert Payscale finding more than four in 10 companies are opting to give identical, across-the-board hikes rather than merit-based raises.",
      "This year, 44% of companies plan to rely on the peanut-butter approach \u2014 a method of evenly spreading pay hikes across the workforce \u2014 according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0from Payscale.",
      "Some employers are moving away from performance-based pay increases because of concerns that the practice is too subjective and potentially biased, Payscale noted. Spreading pay hikes out evenly across a workforce is also easier from an administrative perspective, which can save companies money.",
      "Pay hikes will hold steady at 3.5% in 2026, unchanged from 2025, the group found. Still, merit-based pay hikes remain the predominant method used by companies, with 48% of organizations saying they plan to rely on performance-based raises, Payscale said.",
      "There are downsides to peanut-butter raises, as they can discourage some employees from putting in extra effort if they don't expect they'll be rewarded for going the extra mile, Payscale said.",
      "\"With no differentiation based on performance, it's easier to give everyone something. But there is a risk that top performers will feel disadvantaged in that environment,\" Ruth Thomas, chief compensation strategist at Payscale, told CBS News.",
      "She noted that companies that eschew merit-based pay increases can still reward top performers with bonuses or promotions, for example.",
      "\"Base pay is not your only lever, and organizations may look more at bonuses and promotions when base pay budgets are restricted,\" she added.",
      "Peanut-butter raises started gaining traction after the Great Recession as budget-constrained companies turned to the strategy, Thomas said. She added that more companies are once again tightening their budgets.",
      "\"We're now seeing a slow decline in pay increase budgets again, so it's easier to give everyone a relatively flat increase,\" Thomas said.",
      "Small company, big raise",
      "Smaller establishments with fewer than 100 employees are offering higher pay increases \u2014 4% \u2014 compared to their larger counterparts. Businesses with between about 10,000 to 50,000 workers said they plan to hand out 3% raises in 2026, the report found.",
      "\"Smaller employers appear to be using pay more aggressively to compete for talent, while larger organizations face structural and budgetary challenges that limit flexibility,\" the researchers said in the report.",
      "Average raises also vary by industry, with companies in sectors struggling to find workers offering above-average pay hikes. For example, these sectors are offering above-average pay increases:",

    "story": [
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called President Trump's threat to hit eight of America's NATO allies with tariffs over their stance on Greenland a \"mistake\" on Tuesday. Speaking at the opening of the Davos economic conference in Switzerland, Von der Leyen said Mr. Trump's threat risked plunging Europe's relations with the U.S. into a \"downward spiral.\"",
      "\"When it comes to the security of the Arctic region, Europe is fully committed and we share the objectives of the United States,\" von der Leyen said, highlighting as an example a move by Finland, NATO's newest member, to sell ice breakers to the U.S.",
      "\"It shows that our northern NATO members have Arctic-ready forces right now. And above all, that Arctic security can only be achieved together. And this is why the proposed additional tariffs are a mistake, especially between long-standing allies. The European Union and the United States have agreed to a trade deal last July, and in politics, and in business, a deal is a deal, and when friends shake hands, it must mean something,\" von der Leyen said.",
      "Greenland has been a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark for more than 70 years, and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told the country's parliament on Tuesday that, \"the worst may still be ahead of us\" regarding the standoff with the Trump administration.",
      "\"We are now being threatened by our closest ally,\" she said, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Both Frederiksen's and Von der Leyen's remarks came after President Trump threatened to impose a blanket 10% tariff on imports from eight NATO allies, including Denmark, if they continue rejecting his bid to acquire Greenland. Mr. Trump has said those tariffs could rise to 25% by June if the countries continue resisting.",
      "Von der Leyen said the EU's 27 member nations, \"consider the people of the United States not just our allies, but our friends, and plunging us into a downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of the strategic landscape. So our response will be unflinching, united and proportional.\"",
      "She said the EU was working on a package of measures to further support Arctic security, the first principle of which is \"full solidarity with Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark.\"",
      "\"The sovereignty and integrity of their territory is non-negotiable,\" Von der Leyen said, adding that the EU would work with Greenland and Denmark to look at how it could support infrastructure there, as well as \"work with the United States and all partners on wider Arctic security. This is clearly in our shared interest, and we will step up investment.\"",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who is not attending the Davos conference, said his government had met with NATO members and other allies, and that Western countries should be united by \"respect for national, territorial integrity (and) respect for international law,\" according to The Associated Press.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:44:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Lawyers for Reza Valizadeh, a U.S. citizen arrested in 2024 by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, filed a petition Tuesday with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.",
    "story": [
      "When Abdolreza \"Reza\" Valizadeh returned to Iran in the spring of 2024, it was the first time he had set foot in his home country in 15 years. The veteran journalist, who had spent more than a decade in exile, traveled to Iran to see and care for his aging parents.",
      "Six months later, he was in solitary confinement in Tehran's notorious Evin Prison.",
      "Valizadeh, a 49-year-old dual U.S.-Iranian citizen and longtime critic of Iran's security establishment, was arrested on Sept. 22, 2024, by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). His detention, detailed in a petition filed Tuesday by his attorney with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, comes amid Iran's sweeping crackdown on protests across the country, and as tensions with Washington simmer.",
      "The State Department formally designated Valizadeh as \"wrongfully detained\" in May 2025, placing his case under the authority of the U.S. government's hostage affairs office. Valizadeh is one of at least four Iranian-Americans currently held in Iran, including 70-year-old Kamran Hekmati and at least one other septuagenarian, a woman, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "\"In lodging this petition to the UN, alongside pulling every lever of power available to us in D.C., we are committed to bringing attention to Reza's case, not only to secure his release, but to send an unequivocal message that the targeting of U.S. citizens abroad will not be tolerated,\" Ryan Fayhee, counsel to Valizadeh and a partner at the law firm Akin Gump, said in a statement.",
      "\"Every day that Reza remains behind bars, the Iranian regime is emboldened to target Americans who dare to advocate for truth, justice, and a better future for the Iranian people,\" Fayhee said.",
      "Valizadeh's case continues to unfold against a volatile backdrop inside Iran, where thousands of protesters\u00a0are believed to have been killed, and many thousands more arrested, as authorities have cracked down on recent demonstrations over economic hardship and political repression. A near-total internet and communications blackout has been in place for more than two weeks.",
      "U.S. officials have condemned Tehran's treatment of protesters, warning of further economic pressure \u2014 and possible military strikes \u2014 while leaving open the possibility of talks. Iranian leaders have accused Washington of interference, raising concerns among rights advocates that Americans held in Iran could be used as leverage as tensions sharpen.",
      "President Trump said last week he held off on striking Iran after being assured by the regime that the executions of hundreds of protesters had been \"canceled,\" but in a recent interview called for \"new leadership\" in Iran. The U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group has begun to move west from the Indo-Pacific towards the Middle East, CBS News has confirmed, and is expected to arrive in the coming days.",
      "\"The Trump administration is closely monitoring Mr. Valizadeh's case. President Trump has been clear that he wants every wrongfully detained American returned home,\" a senior administration official told CBS News.",
      "The State Department and a spokesperson for the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "\"These Americans must come home\"",
      "Valizadeh became a U.S. citizen in 2022 through his work for U.S.-funded broadcaster Radio Farda, the Persian branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.",
      "According to messages relayed to his attorney by his family, Valizadeh believed he had been given assurances by Iranian authorities that it was safe to return to Tehran, where most of his family resides. His brother has said he now believes those guarantees were part of a trap, possibly involving a former colleague who had ties to the IRGC.",
      "Reporting by Persian-language media later cited sources who said Iranian intelligence had hoped to pressure Valizadeh into cooperating against his former employer, Radio Farda, for which he reported on corruption, protests and the influence of the IRGC. He refused.",
      "Days later, IRGC agents detained him on a Tehran street, confiscated his belongings, including his U.S. passport, and took him to Evin Prison, where he spent weeks in isolation and under intense interrogation. Iranian officials did not publicly acknowledge his arrest for nearly two months.",
      "Valizadeh was eventually charged with \"collaborating with a hostile government,\" a vague national security offense that Iranian authorities routinely use against journalists and activists.",
      "In December 2024, after what the petition to the U.N. describes as a sham trial lasting less than an hour, and in which the judge acted as both prosecutor and adjudicator, Valizadeh was sentenced to 10 years in prison. His appeal to the regime was rejected in January 2025.",
      "Since then, his family says Valizadeh's health has steadily deteriorated. He suffers from asthma, which has been worsened by overcrowded cells, poor air quality and exposure to smoke and debris \u2014 conditions that intensified after Israeli airstrikes struck parts of Evin Prison in June 2025 during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran. He has endured frequent coughing fits and has been denied basic medications, dental care and treatment for gastrointestinal problems.",
      "After the June strikes, Valizadeh was among prisoners who were shackled and transferred to another facility without their belongings or medicine, according to the U.N. filing, before being returned to Evin Prison, where his brother says he now shares a small cell with up to 18 other inmates amid severe shortages of food, water, sanitation and medical care.",
      "Attorneys for other American citizens who were wrongfully detained have petitioned the U.N. for help in the recent past. They included\u00a0Baquer Namazi, who was permitted to leave Iran for life-saving surgery in the UAE in 2022, and Ryan Corbett, who was imprisoned by the Taliban in Afghanistan and released in a prisoners swap in January 2025.",
      "\"Family is at the heart of the Iranian culture. This is why so many Iranian Americans travel back to Iran \u2014 to visit elderly parents and connect with extended family. Unfortunately, this respect for family is also what gives the regime a steady influx of dual nationals to feast on,\" Neda Sharghi, the sister of former wrongful detainee Emad Shargi and an advocate for American hostages and their families, told CBS News. (The siblings use slightly different spellings of their last name.)",
      "\"President Trump has witnessed the brutality of the Iranian regime. He also knows that we have innocent Americans, like recently detained Reza Valizadeh and Kamran Hekmati, among others, ensnared in the regime's hostage-taking tentacles. These Americans must come home and President Trump and his team have shown us that, at least when it comes to American hostages and wrongful detainees, they will do whatever they need to attain their freedom,\" Sharghi said.",
      "With help from Sharghi and Valizadeh's family, Fayhee has received since September three pre-recorded voice messages from Valizadeh describing the circumstances of his detention. The last came on Dec. 20.",
      "Neither Valizadeh nor his family have been in contact since Iran's crackdown and nationwide internet blackout began.",

    "story": [
      "London - Despite fears of Chinese spying and hacking, the British government gave the go-ahead Tuesday for China to build a massive new embassy in the heart of London. The mega-embassy's designs will see it occupy an entire city block with a view of The Shard, Britain's tallest building on the banks of the Thames.",
      "It will be China's biggest embassy in Europe.",
      "The U.K. government's decision ended a saga that began in 2018 with Beijing's purchase for nearly $350 million of the former Royal Mint building, which used to produce Britain's money and long served as a symbol of the U.K.'s economic might. After the COVID pandemic, the U.K. government \u2014 amid multiple changes in leadership \u2014 delayed final approval for the project as intelligence experts, members of the Chinese diaspora, and would-be future neighbors of the new embassy raised concerns and protested.",
      "The U.K. has approved plans for Beijing to establish a new embassy in London, which will be China's biggest embassy in all of Europe and take up an entire city block, despite concerns over espionage. CBS News' @RamyInocencio has more. pic.twitter.com/VfFozZY4Q2",
      "Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of the British foreign intelligence service MI6, previously called on the government to reject China's plans to build on the site, which sits on top of buried cables that transmit sensitive financial and commercial data across the U.K. capital.",
      "\"Having a Chinese embassy sitting on top of those cables, which could in extremis be attacked, is a significant problem,\" he told CBS News in early December, when a previous deadline for the government's decision was pushed to this month.",
      "With a larger physical presence, Beijing could also employ more Chinese diplomatic staff, who would have freedom of movement in Britain thanks to diplomatic visas.",
      "\"If it's got a very large embassy, there could be a very large number, and then going off to third countries, ostensibly on holiday or whatever, or to travel, and doing stuff outside the country to which they're accredited,\" said Dearlove.",
      "\"They're purporting to be ordinary diplomats, ordinary attaches, who are actually highly trained intelligence personnel,\" he said.",
      "U.K. officials respond to concerns about Chinese Embassy",
      "In response to intelligence concerns, the heads of the domestic intelligence agency MI5 and GCHQ, the intelligence, cyber and security agency, on Tuesday admitted that British national security risks tied to China's new embassy could not be totally eliminated and implied attempting to do so would be impossible.",
      "\"It would be irrational to drive 'embassy generated risk' down to zero when numerous other threat vectors are so central to the national security risks we face in the present era,\" GCHQ Director Anne Keast-Butler and MI5 Director-General Sir Ken McCallum said in a joint letter to government ministers. They also said that the work to mitigate risks had been \"expert, professional and proportionate.\"",
      "Separately, on political grounds, the 240-page report by the U.K. Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said decisions about embassy approval should not be decided based on a country's style of governance.",
      "\"Planning law and national and development plan policies, and for its signatories, the Vienna Convention which is founded on reciprocity, are nation-neutral,\" the report says. \"It is not possible to discriminate against a use on the basis of the anticipated user. Otherwise that could give rise to an untenable situation of the embassy of one nation being permitted but another nations embassy being refused.\"",
      "\"In this regard, any ethical or similar objection to the provision of an embassy for a specific country cannot be a material planning consideration,\" the report says. \"It would not be lawful to refuse permission simply because it would be for a Chinese Embassy \u2026 The same would hold for any other specific country seeking an embassy use through the planning system.\"",
      "Chinese Embassy's approval sparks criticism",
      "Despite the ministry's report, British opposition parties criticized approval of the embassy as an \"act of cowardice\" and Prime Minister Keir Starmer's \"biggest mistake yet.\"",
      "Anti-Beijing activist and dissident groups reacted with disappointment and anger. As China's government has cracked down on freedoms in Hong Kong, Tibet and China's Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang in its northwest, many sought refuge in the U.K.",
      "\"It is definitely deeply disappointing but not surprising,\" said Carmen Lau, a former Hong Kong politician living in self-exile in London.",
      "She said she believed the U.K. approved the embassy so that Starmer could keep his planned trip to Beijing later this month. The U.K. has also been trying to get approval for a new embassy in Beijing.",
      "\"But to me it is a disproportionate deal,\" said Lau. \"China's economic favour / return to the UK isn't worth giving up on a huge chunk of national security concern.\"",
      "The U.K. has also become home to the world's largest Hong Kong diaspora community with an estimated nearly 200,000 having fled in the past five years after the failed mass democracy protests in 2019.",
      "\"(The) Hong Kong diaspora would definitely be affected,\" said Lau. \"I've heard people planning to relocate (into) secondary exile. The reason is that we have been seeing Chinese agents and the PRC (People's Republic of China) itself becoming bolder in reaching us in the UK.\"",
      "\"This embassy will be a daily reminder of China's increased presence, increased influence, over the UK government,\" said Tenzin Rabga Tashi of Tibetan advocacy group Free Tibet.",
      "\"It will be a reminder for my community members to watch how they behave, to not be as active in advocacy,\" Tashi said. \"You know, many of them have family inside Tibet so they won't be able to as freely be comfortable living in the UK knowing that China has more eyes on them, not just them but their friends, their families. This system of fear, this system of repression has increased in the UK and it will continue to expand as long as China's mega embassy is here.\"",
      "\"I am dismayed \u2026 absolutely furious,\" said Rahima Mahmut, executive director of human rights charity Stop Uyghur Genocide.",
      "Human rights groups say that, starting in 2014, up to a million Muslim Uyghur people were rounded up in Xinjiang and imprisoned. Those who could escaped, and thousands settled in the United States.",

      "Garcia Harfuch said under an agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, prosecutors would not seek the death penalty. He said the 37 individuals were taken to multiple cities, including Washington, Houston, New York, San Antonio and San Diego, aboard seven aircraft.",
      "Garcia Harfuch  posted images and video of the transfer on social media.",
      "The U.S. State Department and Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment",
      "Tuesday's transfer included figures from the Sinaloa Cartel, the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva cartel, Jalisco New Generation Cartel, the Northeast Cartel, a remnant of the infamous Zetas based in the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas, across from Texas. Mexican authorities said that all had pending U.S. cases.",
      "Cartel del Noreste leader Ricardo Gonzalez Sauceda, alias \"El Ricky,\" was among the figures sent to the U.S., local media\u00a0reported.",

      "Turning his attention to Mexico shortly after the Venezuela attack, Mr. Trump said in an interview with Fox News: \"We've knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water and we are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels.\"",
      "Last week, Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke with Mr. Trump, telling him that U.S. intervention in Mexico was \"not necessary,\" but emphasizing that the two governments would continue to collaborate.",
      "Last February, Mexico sent 29 cartel figures to the U.S., including drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was behind the killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985. In August, a second round saw 26 Mexican cartel figures sent to the U.S. None had the profile of Caro Quintero, but spanning multiple cartels, the figures could help U.S. prosecutors build cases.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:21:13 -0500",
    "summary": "Chaos around prisons holding ISIS detainees in Syria is highlighting security risks for U.S. forces in the region.",
    "story": [
      "Erbil, Iraq \u2014\u00a0CBS News found empty cells and abandoned orange jumpsuits on Monday inside a prison in northeast Syria that, until days ago, held suspected ISIS militants. The incident has highlighted lingering security concerns for Washington in the wake of Syria's brutal civil war.",
      "Syria's Interior Ministry accused the U.S.-backed Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) of allowing about 120 ISIS detainees to escape from the Al-Shaddadi prison \u2014 which is less than two miles from an American military base \u2014 during attempts by government forces to seize control of the facility.",
      "The SDF has denied allowing prisoners to flee, and the Syrian government later claimed that most of the escapees had been recaptured.",
      "U.S. concerns, and a changing relationship with the Kurdish SDF",
      "The SDF is an umbrella group of Kurdish forces that have held semiautonomous control over a significant area in northeast Syria for years. It proved to be a vital U.S. ally during the war against ISIS in Syria and neighboring Iraq.",
      "Clashes between Syria's relatively new post-war government \u2014 supported by some local tribes \u2014 and the SDF escalated last week in northeast Syria. The fighting follows two failed mediation attempts, led by U.S. Ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria Thomas Barrack.",
      "The U.S. alliance with the SDF dates to 2014, when ISIS seized nearly a third of Syria and Iraq. Backed by U.S. airstrikes and other assistance from Washington and its partners, SDF fighters played a decisive role in dismantling ISIS' self-declared Islamic State.",
      "Following the collapse of longtime Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2024, the new Syrian government \u2014 led by Ahmad al-Shaara, a former Islamic militant who has since distanced himself from extremist groups \u2014 has managed to significantly improve relations with the U.S. He was even invited to visit the White House last year to meet Mr. Trump and, under his leadership, Syria has formally joined the Global Coalition against ISIS.",
      "Both the SDF and the Syrian government are now U.S. partners, but deep, lingering disagreements between those two entities over Syria's future governance and the SDF's control of territory in the country have boiled over into clashes recently.",
      "Making the complicated situation a potential risk for the U.S., the violence has flared up in Syria's Raqqa and al-Hasakah provinces, where there are multiple prisons holding thousands of ISIS fighters\u00a0\u2014 and also multiple bases used by American forces. A Pentagon official told CBS News in December that the U.S. had about 1,000 forces in Syria to counter ISIS.",
      "A U.S. military source confirmed to CBS News that there's a U.S. combat outpost near the al-Shaddadi prison, used largely for intelligence gathering and surveillance to protect American forces in the region.",
      "In a social media post on Tuesday, Ambassador Barrack said the emergence of the new government in Damascus had shifted \"the rationale for the US-SDF partnership: the original purpose of the SDF as the primary anti-ISIS force on the ground has largely expired, as Damascus is now both willing and positioned to take over security responsibilities, including control of ISIS detention facilities and camps.\"",
      "He urged the SDF to work with the government in Damascus and embrace \"a pathway to full integration into a unified Syrian state with citizenship rights, cultural protections, and political participation \u2014 long denied under Bashar al-Assad's regime, where many Kurds faced statelessness, language restrictions, and systemic discrimination.\"",
      "Barrack said the U.S. government remained focused on \"ensuring the security of prison facilities holding ISIS prisoners, currently guarded by the SDF,\" as well as facilitating talks between the SDF and the Syrian government to ensure \"peaceful integration of the SDF and the political inclusion of Syria's Kurdish population into a historic full Syrian citizenship.\"",
      "Rapidly changing control of thousands of ISIS prisoners and family members",
      "Attacks by pro-government forces on SDF positions near the Al-Aqtan Prison in Raqqa, which holds nearly 1,000 ISIS detainees, have fueled concerns about a potential mass escape in recent days. The SDF claimed in a social media post on Tuesday that government forces were again attacking the prison with exploding drones and heavy gunfire.",
      "SDF spokesperson Farhad Shami told CBS News the situation at al-Qatna was \"extremely dangerous\" and said if the government forces breached the facility, ISIS detainees could escape as they did at al-Shaddadi.",
      "The greatest concern, however, is over the Ghwayran Prison in al-Hasakah, where thousands of hardened ISIS inmates are still being held. Over the past six years, Ghwayran has faced multiple riots and coordinated ISIS attacks aimed at freeing imprisoned members.",
      "Shami said the situation at the prison was secure despite attack attempts by local ISIS sleeper cells on Tuesday. He said, however, that pro-government forces were massing about 15 miles south and east of the city of al-Hasakah, in preparation for a potential assault.",
      "Beyond the prisons, fighting also reached the sprawling al-Hol refugee camp in al-Hasakah. The camp, long guarded by the SDF, has housed over 40,000 displaced people for a decade. Among them are the family members of detained and killed ISIS militants, many of them highly radicalized themselves and still loyal to the group.",
      "Videos posted online showed pro-Syrian government forces entering the facility, and the Syria Interior Ministry said in a social media post that government forces had \"begun securing the situation in Al-Hol camp\" after the the withdrawal of the SDF, which it said had left \"the camp without any guards, in an attempt to create chaos and allow those in the camp to escape.\"",
      "The Syrian presidency, meanwhile, was cited by Turkish and Arab news outlets as saying that a \"mutual understanding\" had been reached with the SDF regarding the future of al-Hasakah province.",
      "In a statement, the SDF announced its agreement to a ceasefire in the province, but Shami said pro-government forces continued attacking the group's positions in al-Hasakah.",

      "Surrounded by bodies after the train accident in southern Spain, one little girl somehow emerged virtually unscathed.",
      "Newspaper La Vanguardia reported that a Civil Guard officer found her barefoot on the tracks after she escaped through a broken window.",
      "The officer said that the girl had managed to escape from one of the train carriages most affected by the crash, La Vanguardia reported, adding that he did not notice her bare feet until about an hour after initially finding her. She told the officer that she had to take off her shoes before climbing through the broken window, because they had gotten caught between pieces of iron debris inside the carriage when it derailed, according to the newspaper.",
      "Relative Juan Barroso told reporters the 6-year-old is in good health after receiving three stitches in her head at a hospital. The mayor of her family's village, located near the ill-fated rail line, said he was finding a measure of solace in the fact this girl was out of harm's way.",
      "\"There are many people who are very sad for the victims of this terrible accident, but there were also many who survived, like the miracle of the girl who is safe,\" Punta Umbria's Mayor Jos\u00e9 Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez told reporters Tuesday after leading a minute of silence for the victims.",

      "Why does the United States want control of Greenland? President Trump has made it clear that he thinks the U.S. needs to control the island to ensure the security of America and its NATO allies, a point those allies \u2014 and Greenland \u2014 vehemently disagree with.",
      "Here's why Mr. Trump insists the U.S. needs to control the semi-autonomous Danish territory, and why NATO allies and Greenland say the U.S. could achieve its aims without a takeover.",

      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes.",
      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Jan. 4, claiming \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "Mikkel Olesen, a Danish foreign policy and diplomacy researcher, told CBS News earlier this month that there aren't Russian and Chinese ships all over the Arctic, but there are Russian planes, and there has historically been a lack of situational awareness in the region.",
      "\"This is something that the U.S. used to do itself. I mean, throughout the Cold War, the U.S. had a line of radar stations across Greenland and the U.S. chose to close down those radar stations because the Cold War ended,\" Olesen said. \"Now, that's not to say that Denmark as an ally isn't obligated to try to help the U.S. handling that problem, not at all. I'm just saying that the status quo before Donald Trump was that the U.S was very happy about being able to just have a free hand in Greenland to handle those issues.\"",
      "The Danish government has made it clear that the U.S. is welcome to expand its military presence in Greenland, and that protecting the island from any potential adversaries should be the joint responsibility of the NATO alliance.",
      "\"Put up warning systems, missile systems, soldiers, etc. Just by asking, you can,\" Danish lawmaker Lars Christian Brask, vice-chair of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, told CBS News earlier this month. \"It's not you [the U.S.] running the country, but you have the options, the possibility, of having troops, material ... equipment in Greenland. You just have to ask.\"",
      "Members of the U.S. Congress have openly questioned Mr. Trump's claim of a Russian or Chinese security threat to Greenland, including Senate Intelligence Committee deputy chair Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, who said \"The only country that is, frankly, benefiting the most from this chaos are both Russia and China.\"",
      "Former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark Rufus Gifford also disputed\u00a0Mr. Trump's claim of a threat to the island from the U.S. adversaries.",
      "When asked earlier this month what specifically the United States would gain in terms of national security by taking control of Greenland, given all that the U.S. is able to do already, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"More control over the Arctic region and ensuring that China and Russia and our adversaries cannot continue their aggression in this very important and strategic region. And there would be many other benefits as well that, again, the president and his national security team are currently talking about.\"",

      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages.",
      "The Northwest Passage, which comes close to Greenland, is not currently viable for the entire year.",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages that enable shippers to save time and millions of dollars in fuel by taking shorter routes between Europe and Asia that were long only passable in warmer months.",
      "There are a couple primary routes through the Arctic becoming more viable. The Northern Sea Route, which follows Russia's long northern border, doesn't bring ships too close to Greenland, and Russia and China agreed to jointly develop that path and have been making greater use of it in recent years.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the Northern Sea Route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "The other route, called the Northwest Passage, comes close to Greenland's coastal waters and is more likely of concern to the Trump administration.",
      "Before those two routes started becoming viable during the winter, the only way to move goods from ports in Russia or the manufacturing powerhouses of East Asia was to go south. But those paths are about 3,000 miles longer, and thus much more expensive.",
      "Greenland's natural resources",

      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for them continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "The U.S. \"can explore, of course if you live up to environmental regulations, etc., all the rare earths and minerals that you want in Greenland on a commercial basis. There won't be any hold back on that,\" Danish lawmaker Brask told CBS News earlier this month.",
      "Olesen, the Danish foreign policy researcher, said these minerals are still very expensive to extract, so it hasn't so far made economic sense for private companies to go after them.",
      "\"The position of the Greenland government has been for a long time that Greenland is open for business, and with few exceptions, the main reason for why not much has happened has been that there hasn't been a business case for American companies,\" Olesen said, adding, \"nothing has prevented U.S. companies from going in for a long time.\"",

      "As Mr. Trump doubled down on his vows to take control of Greenland one way or another, and threatened eight of America's closest allies with tariffs if they refuse to bow to his demand, thousands of residents of the island marched in its capital Nuuk to reject his rhetoric.",

      "\"There are many pieces of the puzzle we must fit together,\" Spain's Transport Minister Oscar Puente told the country's\u00a0Onda Cero radio\u00a0network Tuesday.",
      "Puente called the crash \"extremely strange\" on Monday because it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May, adding that \"all the railway experts are extremely surprised.\"",
      "\"Nothing seems to suggest anything was wrong with it,\" he said Tuesday. \"Three trains passed 20 minutes before ... \"When I say that the accident is strange, it couldn't be stranger.\"",
      "Investigators studying the scene of the accident found a broken joint on the rails, which likely created a gap that widened as trains passed over it, the Reuters news agency said Tuesday, citing a source briefed on the initial investigation. The faulty joint could prove key to determining the cause of the accident, the source said.",
      "Puente, however, warned against drawing any conclusions based on \"mere speculation.\"",
      "\"When the train went off the rails, it produced a ton of fractures in the track, for about 200 meters [yards]. And so for the first fracture in the track, the key is to determine \u2014 and currently no expert can say for certain \u2014 if this fracture was a cause or a consequence,\" he told Onda Cero.",
      "\"That is the crux of this whole thing, or one of them, knowing what came first \u2014 the fracturing of the track and then the derailment, or if the derailment caused the fracture in the track,\" Puente said, adding that if there was an issue with the track before the crash, investigators would still \"have to find out why.\"",
      "Spain's chief high-speed train engineer \u00c1lvaro Aznar told CBS News on Monday that the \"earliest signs point to mechanical failure\" as the cause of the crash, but authorities have stressed that it could take weeks, if not longer, to know for sure.",
      "Officials have ruled out sabotage and human error, saying both trains were travelling under the speed limit for the section of track.",
      "\"The possibility of sabotage was never considered,\" Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told a press conference following a weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday. \"There has never been any element suggesting otherwise.\"",
      "Spain's worst train accident in recent times occurred in 2013 when\u00a080 people died after a train derailed\u00a0in the northwest of the country. Investigators found that the train was traveling 111 mph in a 50 mph zone when it left the tracks.",
      "Death toll could still climb as recovery work continues",
      "Local residents were among the first on the scene of the crash Sunday night.",
      "\"There were people with missing limbs,\" said Gonzalo Sanchez, who shuttled survivors to safety on his four-wheeler. \"They were crying. Nobody was born to see this.\"",
      "\"I think we did all we could,\" another Adamuz resident, who identified himself only as Antonio, told the\u00a0El Pais\u00a0newspaper. \"The sad thing is we couldn't do more.\"",
      "The death toll from the accident climbed to 41 on Monday evening after the body of another passenger was found in one of the Iryo train carriages, according to the the regional government.",
      "More than 120 people were injured and 39, including four children, were still hospitalized on Tuesday as the nation began three days of mourning.",
      "Across the country, public buildings flew flags at half-mast, while television anchors wore black, and cabinet ministers cut back public appearances.",
      "Rescue crews began using heavy machinery to lift some of the worst damaged train coaches off the damaged section of track on Monday, to give better access to the site.",
      "Juan Manuel Moreno, the head of the Andalusia region's government, said Monday that it would take another 24-48 hours \"to know with certainty how many deaths have resulted from this terrible accident.\"",
      "Around 35 families were still desperately waiting for news of missing loved ones on Monday, Fran Vicente, a Red Cross psychologist, told\u00a0El Pais, saying: \"What they're suffering is brutal.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/antarctica-penguin-climate-change-breeding-habits/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:03:25 -0500",
    "summary": "A new study finds that warming temperatures are causing Antarctic penguins to breed earlier, threatening some species with extinction by century's end.",
    "story": [
      "Warming temperatures are forcing Antarctic penguins to breed earlier, posing a big problem for two of the cute tuxedoed species that face extinction by the end of the century, a study says.",
      "Three different penguin species \u2014 the cartoon-eye Adelie, the black-striped chinstrap and the fast-swimming gentoo \u2014 are beginning their reproductive process about two weeks earlier than the decade before, according to a study\u00a0published Tuesday in the Journal of Animal Ecology. The change in habits is setting up potential food problems for young chicks.",
      "Researchers used remote control cameras to photograph penguins breeding in dozens of colonies from 2011 to 2021. Between 2012 and 2022, temperatures in the breeding grounds increased by 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "\"Penguins are changing the time at which they're breeding at a record speed, faster than any other vertebrate,\" said lead study author Ignacio Juarez Martinez, a biologist at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. \"And this is important because the time at which you breed needs to coincide with the time with most resources in the environment and this is mostly food for your chicks so they have enough to grow.\"",
      "The researchers said it was the fastest shift in timing of life cycles for any backboned animals that they have seen. For some perspective, scientists have studied changes in the life cycle of great tits, a European bird. They found a similar two-week change, but that took 75 years as opposed to just 10 years for these three penguin species, said study co-author Fiona Suttle, another Oxford biologist.",
      "Winners and loses in a warming world",
      "Suttle said climate change is creating winners and losers among these three penguin species, at a time in the penguin life cycle where food and the competition for it are critical for survival.",
      "The Adelie and chinstrap penguins are specialists, eating mainly krill. The gentoo have a more varied diet. The birds used to breed at different times, so there were no overlaps. But the gentoos' breeding has moved earlier faster than the other two species, creating competition. That's a problem because gentoos, which don't migrate as far as the other two species, are more aggressive in finding food and establishing nesting areas, Martinez and Suttle said.",
      "Suttle said she has gone back in October and November to the same colony areas where she used to see Adelies in previous years only to find their nests replaced by gentoos. And the data backs up her observations, she said.",
      "\"Chinstraps are declining globally,\" Martinez said. \"Models show that they might get extinct before the end of the century at this rate. Adelies are doing very poorly in the Antarctic Peninsula and it's very likely that they go extinct from the Antarctic Peninsula before the end of the century.\"",
      "Other factors threaten penguin populations",
      "Martinez theorized that the warming western Antarctic \u2014 the second-fasting heating place on Earth behind only the Arctic North Atlantic \u2014 means less sea ice. Less sea ice means more spores coming out earlier in the Antarctic spring and then \"you have this incredible bloom of phytoplankton,\" which is the basis of the food chain that eventually leads to penguins, he said. And it's happening earlier each year.",
      "Not only do the chinstraps and Adelies have more competition for food from gentoos because of the warming and changes in plankton and krill, but the changes have brought more commercial fishing that comes earlier and that further shortens the supply for the penguins, Suttle said.",
      "This shift in breeding timing \"is an interesting signal of change and now it's important to continue observing these penguin populations to see if these changes have negative impacts on their populations,\" said Michelle LaRue, a professor of Antarctic marine science at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. She was not part of the Oxford study.",
      "With millions of photos \u2014 taken every hour by 77 cameras for 10 years \u2014 scientists enlisted everyday people to help tag breeding activity using the Penguin Watch website.",
      "\"We've had over 9 million of our images annotated via Penguin Watch,\" Suttle said. \"A lot of that does come down to the fact that people just love penguins so much. They're very cute. They're on all the Christmas cards. People say, 'Oh, they look like little waiters in tuxedos.'\"",
      "Other penguin species in Antarctica are facing trouble. Researchers from the\u00a0British Antarctic Survey\u00a0and University of Southampton said last June that the continent's emperor penguin population may be declining faster than even the most pessimistic predictions. Images showed the species, recognizable by their height and yellow patches, declined in Antarctica by 22% between 2009 and 2024.",

    "story": [
      "A 2,000-year-old love note and an illustrated gladiator fight scene were among the ancient inscriptions recently uncovered on a wall in Pompeii, the archaeological park announced this week.",
      "Thought of as the graffiti of its time, the inscriptions also included stories about daily life, sporting events, passions and insults, carved into a passageway that connected Pompeii's theater district to one of its main roads. The wall was excavated more than 230 years ago, but some 300 inscriptions etched into it remained hidden until new technologies allowed researchers to identify them.",
      "Efforts to expose the writings were part of a project called Corridor Rumors, headed by Louis Autin and \u00c9lo\u00efse Letellier-Taillefer, of Sorbonne University in Paris, and Marie-Adeline Le Guennec of the University of Quebec in Montreal, who collaborated with the Pompeii Archaeological Park. In two waves conducted in 2022 and, again, in 2025, the researchers used various archaeological and computerized imaging techniques to resurface the lost messages.",
      "\"I'm in a hurry; take care, my Sava, make sure you love me!\" reads one inscription that has resurfaced on the wall, according to the archeological park, which said that the writings \"attest to the vitality, the multiplicity of interactions and forms of sociality, which developed in a public space so frequented by the inhabitants of ancient Pompeii.\"",
      "Once a bustling Roman city in what is now southern Italy,\u00a0Pompeii was buried\u00a0under heaps of volcanic ash and pumice after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The catastrophic incident left the area frozen in time. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Pompeii has become a popular tourist attraction as well as a source of constant archaeological exploration.",
      "\"Technology is the key that opens new rooms of the ancient world, and we must also share those rooms with the public,\" said the archaeological park's director, Gabriel Zuchtriegel, in a statement about the latest discoveries. \"We are working on a project to protect and enhance the writings, which number over 10,000 throughout Pompeii, an immense heritage. Only the use of technology can guarantee a future for all this memory of life lived in Pompeii.\"",

      "Local mayor George Seymour\ufeff told 9News the last fatal dingo attack on the island was 25 years ago and that there had been \"an escalation of aggressive dingo activity\" in recent years.",
      "\"A big part of what (the rangers) do is to try and separate dingoes from humans, but we're continuing to have this situation of dingoes, and in some ways it's inevitable that there will be a fatality, given how many bites and attacks are happening over the years,\" Seymour told 9News.",
      "Three years ago, a pack of dingoes mauled a 23-year-old jogger in an attack police said was almost fatal. The dogs had driven the woman into the surf before a tourist came to her rescue, beating off the dingoes. Police said the man had saved her life.",
      "About 200 dingoes roam free on K'gari and are a protected native species at the World Heritage-listed national park.",
      "The younger animals have become more aggressive and less fearful of humans since tourists returned in large numbers following the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "In 2023, two Australian women were fined about $1,500 for taking selfies and videos of themselves posing with dingoes on the island.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 06:35:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump says the U.K. decision to hand a strategic island to Mauritius, which he previously supported, was stupid, and justification for his attempt to acquire Greenland.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump has called the U.K.'s decision to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius \u2014 a deal his administration previously supported \u2014 an act of \"great stupidity\" that further justified his desire for the U.S. to acquire Greenland. One of the islands, Diego Garcia, is the site of a key U.K.-U.S. military base in the Indian Ocean.",
      "\"Shockingly, our 'brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,\" Mr. Trump said early Tuesday on his own Truth Social platform. \"There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness. These are International Powers who only recognize STRENGTH, which is why the United States of America, under my leadership, is now, after only one year, respected like never before. The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired. Denmark and its European Allies have to DO THE RIGHT THING. Thank you for your attention to this matter. PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.\"",
      "Mr. Trump issued his statement as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Mike Johnson, a Republican, was in the U.K. to address the British parliament, where he told lawmakers the U.S. and U.K. had \"always been able to work through our differences calmly as friends. We will continue to do that. I want to assure you this morning that that is still the case.\"",
      "The Chagos Islands were separated from Mauritius, which was then a British colony, in 1965.",
      "The U.K. purchased the islands for the equivalent of around $4 million, CBS News partner BBC News reported, but Mauritius had long argued that it was forced to give the islands away in order to achieve its independence in 1968. The U.K. invited the U.S. to build a military base on the island of Diego Garcia, and it has become a cornerstone of American defense infrastructure in the vast Indian Ocean region.",
      "In 2019, the International Court of Justice issued a non-binding ruling that called on the U.K. to give up control of the Chagos Islands, saying it had wrongfully forced out the people living on Diego Garcia to make way for the military base.",
      "That ruling, in part, prompted the deal reached in 2024 for the U.K. to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. As part of the agreement, Britain got to maintain control of the military base on Diego Garcia through a 99-year lease, at a cost to the U.K. of about $136 million per year.",
      "The Trump administration previously supported the Chagos Islands deal, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio issuing a statement in May last year saying, \"following a comprehensive interagency review, the Trump Administration determined that this agreement secures the long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint U.S.-UK military facility at Diego Garcia.\"",
      "Rubio said at the time that Mr. Trump had \"expressed his support for this monumental achievement during his meeting with Prime Minister Starmer at the White House,\" calling the base \"a critical asset for regional and global security.\"",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Tuesday, a U.K. government spokesperson said Britain \"will never compromise on our national security,\" noting that the agreement with Mauritius was struck \"because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future.\"",
      "\"This deal secures the operations of the joint U.S.-U.K. base on Diego Garcia for generations, with robust provisions for keeping its unique capabilities intact and our adversaries out,\" the British government said, noting that it had previously been \"publicly welcomed by the U.S., Australia and all other Five Eyes allies, as well as key international partners including India, Japan and South Korea.\"",
      "The Five Eyes refers to the close defense and intelligence partnership between the U.S., Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.",

      "A surfer had minor injuries from being bitten by a shark Tuesday in the fourth attack off the coast of Australia's most populous state in three days. The series of attacks have prompted beach closures and warnings that swimmers should avoid the open water and go to a pool instead.",
      "The shark attacked the man's surfboard at Point Plomer, 290 miles north of the New South Wales state capital, around 9 a.m., police said in a statement.",
      "The man was lucky to survive with minor cuts, Kempsey-Crescent Head Surf Life Saving Club captain Matt Worrall said.",
      "\"The board seemed to take most of the impact,\" Worrall told Australian Broadcasting Corp. \"He made his own way into shore where he was assisted by locals.\"",
      "The bystanders drove the 39-year-old man to a hospital and he was later discharged.",
      "In the earlier attacks, a man and a boy suffered critical leg wounds and the surfboard of another boy was bitten by sharks at Sydney locations Sunday and Monday.",
      "Beaches along New South Wales' northern coast and northern Sydney were closed Tuesday and local authorities said Sydney's northern beaches would remain closed to swimmers and surfers for 48 hours. Electronic drumlines that alert authorities when a large shark has taken bait were deployed off the Sydney coast.",
      "Authorities warned that recent rainfall has left the water off area beaches murky, which increased the risk of bull shark attacks. Bull sharks are responsible for most attacks around Sydney.",
      "\"If anyone's thinking of heading into the surf this morning anywhere along the northern beaches, think again. We have such poor water quality that's really conducive to some bull shark activity,\" Surf Life Saving NSW chief executive Steve Pearce said.",
      "\"If you're thinking about going for a swim, just go to a local pool because at this stage, we're advising that beaches are unsafe,\" Peace added.",
      "Police say boy's friends saved his life",
      "On Sunday, a 12-year-old boy was attacked after jumping from a 20-foot ledge known as Jump Rock near Shark Beach inside Sydney Harbor. Police have credited the boy's friends with saving his life by jumping from the cliff during the attack and dragging him back to shore.",
      "\"Those actions of those young men are brave under the circumstances and very confronting injuries for those boys to see,\" Supt. Joseph McNulty said.",
      "News media have reported that the boy lost both legs in the attack.",
      "Around noon Monday, an 11-year-old boy was on a surfboard that was attacked by a shark at Dee Why Beach, an ocean beach north of Manly. The shark bit off a chunk of the board, but the boy escaped uninjured.",
      "A surfer in his 20s was bitten on a leg by a shark off North Steyne Beach on the Pacific Ocean coast in the northern suburb of Manly at 6:20 p.m. Monday, police said. Bystanders pulled him from the water before an ambulance took him to a hospital in a critical condition.",
      "All three Sydney beaches have some form of shark protection netting. It was not immediately clear where the attacks occurred in relation to that netting.",
      "Pearce said the scene of the latest attack was isolated and did not have shark netting.",
      "Dee Why Beach is close to the beach where 57-year-old surfer Mercury Psillakis\u00a0 was killed by a suspected white shark last September.",
      "In November, a 25-year-old Swiss tourist was killed\u00a0and her partner was seriously injured trying to save her as they swam off a national park north of Sydney.",
      "There have been more than 1,280 shark incidents around Australia since 1791, of which more than 250 resulted in death, according to a database of the predators' encounters with humans.

    "story": [
      "Spanish police said Monday that at least 40 people are confirmed dead in a high-speed train collision the previous night in the south of the country, as efforts to recover the bodies continue with authorities expecting the death toll to rise.",
      "Juanma Moreno, the president of Andalusia, the southern Spanish region where the accident happened, confirmed the new death toll in an afternoon press conference. Efforts to recover the bodies from the two wrecked train cars continued, he added.",
      "The impact tossed the second train's lead carriages off the track, sending them plummeting down a 13-foot slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of meters from the crash site, Moreno said earlier in the day, describing the wreckage as a \"mass of twisted metal\" with bodies likely still to be found inside. Some passengers were catapulted through windows and their bodies were found hundreds of meters from the crash site, Moreno previously said.",
      "The crash occurred Sunday at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails. It slammed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern Spanish city, according to rail operator Adif.",
      "The head of the second train, which was carrying nearly 200 passengers, took the brunt of the impact, Spanish Transport Minister \u00d3scar Puente said, adding that it appeared the largest number of the deaths occurred in those carriages.",
      "Authorities said all the survivors had been rescued in the early morning.",
      "Moreno said Monday morning that emergency services were still searching what he described as a mass of twisted metal where the smashed carriages had derailed.",
      "\"It is likely (that there will be more dead people found) when you look at the mass of metal that is there. The firefighters have done a great job, but unfortunately when they get the heavy machinery to lift the carriages it is probable we will find more victims.\"",
      "\"Here at ground zero, when you look at this mass of twisted iron, you see the violence of the impact.\"",
      "Video and photos showed twisted train cars lying on their sides under floodlights. Passengers reported climbing out of smashed windows, with some using emergency hammers to break the windows, according to Salvador Jim\u00e9nez, a journalist for Spanish broadcaster RTVE, who was on board one of the derailed trains.",
      "He told the network by phone Sunday that \"there was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed.\"",

      "The collision took place near Adamuz, a town in the province of Cordoba, about about 230 miles south of Madrid.",
      "In Adamuz, a sports center was turned into a makeshift hospital and the Spanish Red Cross set up a help center offering assistance to emergency services and people seeking information. Members of Spain's civil guard and civil defense worked on site throughout the night.",
      "Spain's chief high-speed train engineer, \u00c1lvaro Aznar, told CBS News the \"earliest signs point to mechanical failure\" as the cause of the crash.",
      "Puente called the crash \"a truly strange\" incident because it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May. He also said the train that jumped the track was less than 4 years old. That train belonged to the private company Iryo while the second train, which took the brunt of the impact, was part of Spain's public train company Renfe.",
      "When asked by reporters how long an inquiry into the crash's cause could take, he said it could be a month.",
      "Spain has the largest high-speed rail network in Europe for trains moving over 155 mph, with more than 1,900 miles of track, according to the European Union.",
      "The network is a popular, competitively priced and safe mode of transport. Renfe said more than 25 million passengers took one of its high-speed trains in 2024.",

    "summary": "As his standoff with America's closest allies escalates, President Trump says not getting the Nobel Peace Prize means he's no longer obligated \"to think purely of Peace.\"",
    "story": [
      "America's European allies stood united Monday against President Trump's escalating campaign to take control of Greenland,\u00a0accusing him of blackmail with a new threat of tariffs if they continue rejecting his bid for the U.S. to acquire the vast island. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, appeared to hint that he was still willing to use the U.S. military to achieve his objective.",
      "In a message sent to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re and shared with other NATO allies, Mr. Trump said that due to the decision to\u00a0award someone other than himself the Nobel Peace Prize this year, he no longer feels \"an obligation to think purely of Peace,\" and that he \"can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.\"",
      "In the next sentence, Mr. Trump refers to his controversial demand that the U.S. take ownership of Greenland, which has been a territory of American ally Denmark for centuries. He renews his claim that only full U.S. control can prevent the\u00a0strategic Arctic island from falling into the hands of China or Russia.",
      "But speaking to reporters at Palm Beach International Airport late Monday night after attending\u00a0the college football championship game\u00a0in Miami, Mr. Trump said he doesn't care about the Nobel prize, though he continued to say Norway controls who gets it.",
      "\"If anybody thinks that Norway doesn't - doesn't control the Nobel prize, they're just kidding. They (the Peace prize decision makers) have a board, but it's controlled by Norway. And I don't care what Norway says. But I really don't care about that. What I care about is saving lives. And I think I've saved tens of millions of lives.\"",
      "The president also said he thinks European leaders will be conciliatory about Greenland at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week. \"I don't think they're going to push back too much,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Look, we have to have it, they have to have this done. They can't protect it.\"",
      "On his Truth Social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he \"had a very good telephone call with Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO, concerning Greenland. I agreed to a meeting of the various parties in Davos, Switzerland. As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back \u2014 On that, everyone agrees!",
      "He also posted a picture of himself claiming Greenland as a U.S. territory, with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio at his side.",
      "Trump's claims about Greenland and U.S. security",
      "America's closest allies in NATO have rejected Mr. Trump's argument, along with U.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, that the U.S. needs to own Greenland for security reasons.",
      "They note that Greenland already falls under the transatlantic alliance's protection as a Danish territory, that the U.S. has had at least one military base on the island since World War II and Denmark has given an open invitation for Washington to boost that defense presence in partnership with its allies.",
      "Despite those facts, and efforts by Denmark and other European NATO members to show an understanding of and willingness to address rising competition over\u00a0control of vital new shipping lanes around the resource-rich island, Mr. Trump claims again in his message to Norway's leader that \"the World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.\"",
      "He argues that Denmark is incapable of securing the Arctic territory in the face of Russian and Chinese threats \u2014 threats that Senator Mark Warner, the Democratic vice chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee,\u00a0called fictitious over the weekend.",
      "\"Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China,\" Mr. Trump wrote, ignoring the fact that, for almost 80 years, since the U.S. and its European allies committed to the principle of joint security with NATO's founding treaty, Greenland's protection has been a shared responsibility.",
      "Mr. Trump questions in the note, as he's done previously, Denmark's right to any claim over Greenland, arguing that the basis is only that \"a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also.\"",
      "Denmark became the colonial power in Greenland in the early 18th century, about 50 years before the United States became a sovereign nation with its own navy. Greenland remained a Danish colony until 1953, when the island gained its current semi-autonomy.",
      "Though the population is tiny at around 60,000 people, Greenland has its own elected government, and both the island's leaders and the Greenlandic people have made it abundantly clear that they do not want to become part of the U.S.",
      "Norway's leader responds to Trump's message",
      "The Norwegian government\u00a0shared a statement on Monday from Prime Minister St\u00f8re in which he confirms that he received Mr. Trump's message on Sunday afternoon.",
      "He said it came in response to a text message he'd sent along with Finland's President Alexander Stubb.",
      "\"In our message to Trump we conveyed our opposition to his announced tariff increases against Norway, Finland and select other countries. We pointed to the need to de-escalate and proposed a telephone conversation between Trump, Stubb and myself on the same day. The response from Trump came shortly after the message was sent,\" St\u00f8re said in the statement, adding that it was Mr. Trump's \"decision to share his message with other NATO leaders.\"",
      "\"Norway's position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter. We also support that NATO in a responsible way is taking steps to strengthen security and stability in the Arctic,\" said St\u00f8re.",
      "He added, \"As regards the Nobel Peace Prize, I have clearly explained, including to President Trump what is well known, the prize is awarded by an independent Nobel Committee and not the Norwegian Government.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said Monday the president \"believes Greenland is a strategically important location that is critical from the standpoint of national security,\" and is \"confident Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States from modern threats in the Arctic region.\"",
      "U.K. leader doubts Trump will use U.S. military to take Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump stunned America's NATO allies over the weekend by\u00a0threatening to impose new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European nations if they continue to reject his demands to take over Greenland.",
      "After holding talks among themselves on Sunday, the eight countries issued a joint statement saying they were \"committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest,\" while reiterating their support for Denmark and Greenland.",
      "They said they were \"ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" and warned that threats of tariffs undermine \"transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\"",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has maintained good relations with Mr. Trump and spoke with him on the phone Sunday, acknowledged in televised remarks on Monday morning that the Arctic region \"will require greater attention, greater investment and stronger collective defense\" and said the U.S. would \"be central to that effort and the U.K. stands ready to contribute fully alongside our allies, through NATO.\"",
      "\"But there is a principle here that cannot be set aside, because it goes to the heart of how stable and trusted international cooperation works, and so any decision about the future status of Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone,\" said Starmer.",
      "\"Denmark is a close ally of the U.K. and of the U.S. \u2014 a proud NATO member that has stood shoulder to shoulder with us, including at real human cost in recent decades,\" Starmer said, alluding to Danish troops fighting alongside U.S. and British forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, as part of the NATO alliance.",
      "\"Alliances endure because they're built on respect and partnership, not pressure. That is why I said the use of tariffs against allies is completely wrong. It is not the right way to resolve differences within an alliance, nor is it helpful to frame efforts to strengthen Greenland's security as a justification for economic pressure,\" he said. \"A trade war is in no one's interest.\"",
      "As for Mr. Trump not ruling out the use of the American military to seize territory from a NATO ally, Starmer said he didn't believe it would come to that.",
      "\"I don't, actually,\" he said. \"I think this can and should be resolved through calm discussion, but with the application of principles I've set out in terms of who decides the future of Greenland.\"",

    "summary": "Saul Pereira Martinez had finished his shift on guard duty at Fort Tiuna, where Maduro was sheltered. The last time his mother spoke to him was at 2:00 am.",
    "story": [
      "As the first explosions rocked his military base in Caracas, 18-year-old Saul Pereira Martinez sent his mother a simple message: \"I love you. It has begun.\"",
      "It was the night of January 3, and U.S. forces were invading Venezuela to seize the country's then-president, Nicolas Maduro, on the orders of President Donald Trump.",
      "Pereira had finished his shift on guard duty at Fort Tiuna, where Maduro was sheltered that night. Nonetheless, he would not survive the assault.",
      "Natividad Martinez, his mother, visited on Sunday the cemetery where her son's remains are buried, recalling the night it happened, and still in shock.",
      "The last time she spoke to Saul was at 2:00 am. He repeated that he loved her, and told her to take care of his two brothers, aged two and nine.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly touted the success of the stunning operation to seize Maduro, boasting that there were no casualties.",
      "But at least 83 people were killed in the operation, including 47 Venezuelan soldiers and 32 Cuban security personnel, according to the defense ministry in Caracas.",
      "\"You can't come to my country and kill people like that,\" said Martinez. \"Because (they say) 'it was a clean operation.' It wasn't clean. Do you know how many people died?\"",
      "\"A brave man\"",
      "As the attack began, 38-year-old Martinez heard explosions and began to scream, worried for the safety of her son, her husband said.",
      "After she got off the phone with him, she fell to the ground screaming his name, he said.",
      "\"I told her to stay calm, we don't know what's going on,\" said Saul's stepfather, who asked not to be identified because he works as a police officer and government security official.",
      "He believes that Saul was killed because his unit was spending the night within the security perimeter around Maduro, which made them a target for U.S. forces.",
      "On Sunday, Saul's parents were joined by his girlfriend and friends at the cemetery in southern Caracas.",
      "Saul had just completed his initial training with the Honor Guard in December and was studying at the military academy.",
      "They brought flowers, and, to the rhythm of old salsa music, the family cried, recalled anecdotes, and toasted in honor of the young soldier whom they remember as \"a brave man.\"",
      "Saul entered the military following in the footsteps of a childhood friend, who was at La Carlota air base during the U.S. attack and was wounded in the leg.",
      "His mother had applauded the decision, having earlier worried about the trajectory her son's life was on.",
      "Saul, says Natividad, went from \"partying, going here and there, doing nothing at home\" to studying, cleaning the house during his visits, and acquiring discipline.",
      "\"All human beings\"",
      "Despite the massive U.S. military deployment in the Caribbean, Mr. Trump's threats against Maduro, Martinez's family did not expect things to get this bad.",
      "\"The president didn't always stay in the same place,\" his stepfather explained, and the government maneuvered to mislead even the state security forces about Maduro's whereabouts.",
      "U.S. forces found Maduro because of inside informers, the stepfather said.",
      "\"(The death of) my son was a collateral effect of that infiltration,\" he said.",
      "Earlier this month, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said Maduro had no warning the U.S. was closing in until moments before American forces arrived.",
      "\"Nicol\u00e1s Maduro got to meet some great Americans wearing night vision goggles three nights ago,\" Hegseth said. \"He didn't know they were coming until three minutes before they arrived. In fact, his wife said, 'I think I hear aircraft outside.' They didn't know. You know why? Because every single part of that chain did their job.\"",
      "Hours after the attack, Natividad brought food for Saul to Fort Tiuna, as per their weekly schedule.",
      "She found only silence.",
      "Hours later, when the names of the fallen began to circulate, she went to the battalion and stood there, demanding answers.",
      "\"And they had to tell me,\" she said, staring at the cement tomb where mourners had spelled out Saul's name in yellow, blue, and white flower petals.",
      "Her son, like other soldiers, was honored by the government, which promoted him posthumously.",
      "Natividad said that some seemed not to mourn these deaths because of the political polarization that has divided the nation under Maduro's rule, and that of Hugo Chavez before him.",
      "\"Those who died are also human beings. They are all Venezuelans. On one side or the other, they are all human beings, they all have people who mourn them,\" she said.",
      "Shaken but still stoic, Natividad said she felt proud of her son.",
      "\"He died for his country,\" she said. \"Regardless of what they say, to me, my son was a patriot, and that's what matters to me.\"",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. strikes in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific have\u00a0killed more than 100 people\u00a0on boats that Washington claims were ferrying drugs from Venezuela. Legal experts and lawmakers critical of the strikes have argued that the military action targeting the suspected drug smuggling boats are\u00a0legally dubious.",
      "Last month, the family of a\u00a0Colombian man who was killed in a U.S. military strike\u00a0on a boat in the Caribbean lodged a complaint against the United States with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR).",

      "Another so-called \"bad bill\" would extend the absentee ballot acceptance period, prohibit hand-counting of ballots, allow internet-based voting, lower robbery penalties, and enact several Second Amendment-related taxes.",
      "Kilgore said housing affordability also includes energy costs, adding Spanberger indicated she would reenter Virginia into RGGI, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. He noted another Democrat-led energy-industry state \u2013 Pennsylvania \u2013 just took itself out of the pact.",

      "The redacted report, TIDALWAVE, warns that the United States could reach a breaking point within weeks of a high\u2011intensity conflict with China \u2014 conclusions that the authors say prompted senior national security officials to seek redactions over concerns adversaries could exploit the findings or use them to identify U.S. and allied military vulnerabilities.",

The report still details how quickly U.S. forces could reach a breaking point and why the conflict would carry global consequences.",
      "\"Redactions were made at the request of the U.S. government to prevent disclosure of information that could reasonably enable an adversary to (1) re mediate or \u2018close\u2019 critical vulnerabilities that the United States and its allies could otherwise exploit, or (2) identify or exploit U.S. and allied vulnerabilities in ways that could degrade operational endurance, resilience, or deterrence,\" the report said.",

As a general matter, we take seriously the protection of information that, if aggregated or contextualized, could have implications for operational security.\"",

      "According to the report\u2019s redacted findings, the U.S. would culminate in less than half the time required for the People's Republic of China in a high-intensity conflict. Culmination is defined as the point at which a force becomes incapable of continuing operations due to the loss of platforms, ammunition and/or fuel.",
      "The report is explicit that the\u00a0first 30 days to 60 days of a U.S.-China war determine its long-term shape and outcome, as early losses in aircraft, ships, fuel throughput and munitions rapidly compound and cannot be recovered on operationally relevant timelines.",
      "The report concludes that the U.S. is not equipped nor arrayed to protect and sustain the Joint Force in a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific. Rapid platform attrition, brittle logistics, concentrated basing and insufficient industrial surge capacity combine to force an early operational breaking point for American forces.",
      "The report warns that U.S. reliance on a few large, concentrated forward bases \u2014 particularly in Japan and Guam \u2014 leaves American airpower dangerously exposed to Chinese missile forces.",
      "In multiple scenarios, up to 90% of U.S. and allied aircraft positioned at major forward bases are destroyed on the ground during the opening phase of the conflict, as runways, fuel depots, command facilities and parked aircraft are hit simultaneously.",
      "The report finds that critical U.S. precision\u2011guided munitions \u2014 including long\u2011range anti\u2011ship missiles, air\u2011to\u2011air interceptors and missile\u2011defense systems \u2014 begin to be unavailable within five to seven days of major combat operations. Across most scenarios, those critical munitions are completely exhausted within 35 days to 40 days, leaving U.S. forces unable to sustain high\u2011tempo combat.",
      "Fuel emerges as the most decisive vulnerability of all. The report makes a critical distinction: the U.S. does not run out of fuel in most scenarios \u2014 it loses the ability to\u00a0move fuel under fire.",
      "CHINA\u2019S MISSILE SURGE PUTS EVERY US BASE IN THE PACIFIC AT RISK \u2014 AND THE WINDOW TO RESPOND IS CLOSING",
      "Chinese doctrine explicitly prioritizes attacks on logistics vessels, ports, pipelines and replenishment tankers. Even limited tanker losses, port disruptions or pipeline severance are sufficient to drive fuel throughput below survivable levels, forcing commanders to sharply curtail air and naval operations despite fuel remaining in aggregate stockpiles.",
      "The report gamed out how a war with China in defense of Taiwan, whose army is pictured above, would play out. (Daniel Ceng/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "By contrast, China is assessed as capable of sustaining high\u2011intensity combat operations for months longer under the modeled assumptions.",
      "Chinese ammunition stockpiles of critical munitions begin to be depleted after approximately 20 days to 30 days of major combat operations. However, substitution effects extend China\u2019s ability to sustain combat operations out to months \u2014 well beyond the point at which U.S. forces culminate, according to the report.",
      "The consequences extend far beyond the battlefield.",
      "The redacted report concludes the U.S. is highly unlikely to prevent massive global economic fallout once a Taiwan conflict begins.",
      "Disruption of shipping lanes, destruction of critical infrastructure and the collapse of Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor production would trigger a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, with enduring ripple effects across financial markets, manufacturing and global trade.",
      "The report warns that U.S. reliance on large, concentrated forward bases leaves American airpower dangerously exposed. (Seaman Abigail Reyes/U.S. Navy/Handout via Reuters)",
      "The report comes amid years of concern over U.S. military readiness and industrial capacity, as China rapidly expands its naval forces and shipbuilding base.",
      "The U.S. Navy operates a smaller fleet than planned, while American shipyards face workforce shortages, aging infrastructure and chronic delays \u2014 even as China, the world\u2019s largest shipbuilder, continues to outpace the U.S. in producing new naval hulls.",
      "War Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military leaders have vowed to put the Pentagon on a wartime footing for industrial capacity.",
      "Perhaps most alarming, TIDALWAVE warns that the scale of losses in the Indo\u2011Pacific would leave the U.S. unable to deter or respond effectively to a second major conflict elsewhere in the world.",
      "A war over Taiwan could open the door to follow\u2011on aggression by adversaries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, fundamentally destabilizing the global security order.",
      "The report is blunt in its assessment: existing Pentagon programs and congressional funding are too slow, too fragmented and too modest to address the scale of the challenge. In many cases, the timeline required to fix critical vulnerabilities exceeds the likely timeline to conflict.",
      "To avoid what the authors describe as a strategic defeat, the report urges Congress to immediately expand munitions stockpiles, strengthen fuel reserves and distribution infrastructure, harden and disperse forward bases, and accelerate sustainment and logistics reforms. Without rapid action, the authors warn, the U.S. risks entering a conflict it is structurally unprepared to fight or sustain.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Illinois residents are once again being reminded how fragile government data systems can be. The Illinois Department of Human Services has confirmed a data breach that exposed sensitive records belonging to roughly 700,000 people.",
      "The breach is believed to have exposed two distinct sets of records. One is personal and program-related data tied to more than 672,000 Medicaid and Medicare Savings Program recipients, including addresses, case numbers, demographic details and medical assistance plan names, and another 32,000 Division of Rehabilitation Services customers whose names, addresses, case details and referral information were also exposed over multiple years.",

      "The Illinois Department of Human Services confirmed a data breach that exposed sensitive records tied to roughly 700,000 residents, including Medicaid and disability services recipients. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "What happened in the Illinois DHS data breach",
      "As spotted by Bleeping Computer, the Illinois Department of Human Services disclosed that unauthorized access to one of its systems led to the exposure of records tied to approximately 700,000 Illinois residents. The affected data was connected to individuals who interacted with DHS programs, which can include benefits, assistance services and support programs across the state.",
      "According to the agency, the breach involved personally identifiable information. While officials have not publicly released every technical detail, DHS confirmed that sensitive records were accessed, prompting notifications to impacted individuals. As is typical in cases like this, the investigation is ongoing, and the full scope of how the intrusion occurred is still being reviewed.",
      "For residents, the key issue is not just that data was accessed, but the type of data DHS holds. Government agencies like DHS often store names, addresses, dates of birth, case numbers and, in some instances, Social Security numbers or benefits-related information. Once that data escapes, it can be misused in ways that last for years.",
      "Why breaches like this are especially risky",
      "When a private company is breached, you can often change a password or close an account. Government data is different. You can't change your Social Security number easily. You can't erase past interactions with public assistance programs. That makes breaches involving state agencies particularly dangerous.",
      "Exposed records can be used for identity theft, fraudulent benefit claims, phishing scams and long-term impersonation. Criminals often combine government data with information from other breaches to build detailed profiles that make scams far more convincing. Even if there's no immediate misuse, stolen data frequently resurfaces months or years later.",
      "As with many large breaches, DHS has stated that it is taking steps to secure its systems and prevent similar incidents in the future. That's an expected response. But for affected residents, the burden of protection now shifts largely to you.",
      "We reached out to the Illinois Department of Human Services for comment, but did not receive a response before our deadline.",

      "If you received a notification from Illinois DHS, or if you've ever interacted with DHS programs, these steps can help reduce your risk.",
      "If DHS provides free identity monitoring or credit protection, sign up. These services can alert you to suspicious activity involving your Social Security number or credit file before the damage spreads. Beyond basic monitoring, full identity theft services can help with recovery, paperwork and financial reimbursement if fraud occurs. This can be especially useful after large-scale government breaches.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "A password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account. If your personal data is leaked, attackers often try the same credentials across multiple services. Unique passwords stop one breach from turning into many.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Strong antivirus tools do more than scan files. They monitor suspicious behavior, phishing attempts and malicious links that often follow large data breaches. This matters because breach victims are frequently targeted with follow-up scams.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "A fraud alert tells lenders to verify your identity before opening new accounts. A credit freeze goes further by blocking new credit entirely unless you lift it. If Social Security numbers were exposed, a freeze is often the safest option.",
      "Once your information leaks, it often spreads to data broker sites that sell personal details. Personal data removal services work to request takedowns and reduce how much of your information is publicly available. While they can't erase everything, they significantly lower your exposure.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "You're entitled to free credit reports from major credit bureaus. Check them for unfamiliar accounts, inquiries or address changes. Early detection makes identity theft far easier to contain.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Even government agencies are not immune to large-scale security failures. When nearly 700,000 residents are affected, the impact goes far beyond a single system or department. While DHS works through its investigation, protecting your identity now depends largely on the steps you take next. Acting early, layering protections and staying vigilant can make the difference between a breach being an inconvenience or a long-term nightmare.",

      "For the first time, Americans with depression will soon be able to use a prescription brain-stimulation device at home.",
      "The approval comes from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and marks a major shift in how mental health conditions may be treated. The newly approved device is called FL-100, and it comes from Flow Neuroscience.",
      "It is designed for adults 18 and older with moderate to severe major depressive disorder. Clinicians can prescribe it as a stand-alone treatment or alongside antidepressants and therapy. This decision matters because depression affects more than 20 million adults in the U.S. Roughly one-third do not get enough relief from medication or stop taking it due to side effects.",

      "SIMPLE DAILY HABIT MAY HELP EASE DEPRESSION MORE THAN MEDICATION, RESEARCHERS SAY",
      "Flow Neuroscience has gotten approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its FL-100 prescription brain-stimulation device. (Flow Neuroscience)",
      "How the Flow FL-100 works",
      "The FL-100 uses transcranial direct current stimulation, often shortened to tDCS. This technology delivers a gentle electrical current to the prefrontal cortex, a region of the brain tied to mood regulation and stress response. In many people with depression, activity in this area is reduced. By stimulating it, the device aims to restore healthier brain signaling over time. The system looks like a lightweight headset and pairs with a mobile app. Patients use it at home for about 30 minutes per day while clinicians monitor progress remotely.",
      "The clinical results behind the approval",
      "The FDA based its decision on a randomized controlled trial that evaluated home use under remote supervision. Participants who received active stimulation showed meaningful improvement on clinician-rated and self-reported depression scales. After 10 weeks of treatment, patients experienced an average symptom improvement of 58% compared to a control group. Many users reported noticeable changes within the first three weeks. The study was published in the journal Nature Medicine, adding credibility to the findings. Side effects were generally mild and short-term. Reported issues included skin irritation, redness, headaches, and brief stinging sensations at the electrode sites.",
      "The FDA has approved the first prescription brain-stimulation device for at-home treatment of depression in the U.S., marking a major shift in mental healthcare. (hoto by ISSAM AHMED/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "A growing shift toward tech-based mental health care",
      "Flow's device has already been used by more than 55,000 people across Europe, the U.K., Switzerland and Hong Kong. In the U.K., it is prescribed within parts of the public health system. Company leaders say the U.S. approval opens the door for broader access to non-drug treatment options. The momentum is not isolated. In 2025, researchers at UCLA Health developed another experimental brain-stimulation approach, signaling rapid growth in this field. Together, these advances suggest that at-home neuromodulation may soon become a standard part of depression care rather than a fringe option.",
      "When will the device be available",
      "Flow expects the FL-100 to be available to U.S. patients in the second quarter of 2026. A prescription will be required, and the companion app will be available on iOS and Android. The company also plans to explore additional uses for its platform, including sleep disorders, addiction, and traumatic brain injury.",

      "Flow Neuroscience\u2019s FL-100 headset delivers mild electrical stimulation to the brain and can be prescribed for home use under medical supervision. (Flow Neuroscience)",
      "What to know before trying Flow",
      "Flow is FDA approved for adults 18 and older with moderate to severe major depressive disorder, and it requires a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. Doctors can recommend it on its own or alongside medication or therapy. The headset is non-invasive and designed for home use, but it is not meant for emergency situations or people considered treatment resistant. It also does not replace crisis care or immediate mental health support. Most users wear the headset for about 30 minutes per session. Mild tingling, warmth, skin irritation or headaches can happen, especially early on. These effects are usually short-lived and monitored by a clinician through the companion app.",
      "Flow pairs with a mobile app that guides treatment and supports remote clinical oversight. Your provider sets the treatment plan, and the device follows prescribed settings to ensure safe use. Pricing and insurance coverage may vary once the device becomes available in the U.S. Some patients may access Flow through clinics, research programs, or as it becomes more widely adopted in routine depression care. The bottom line is simple. Flow adds another evidence-based option, not a cure and not a one-size-fits-all solution. For people who have struggled to find relief, having another clinically proven choice can matter a lot.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you or someone you care about struggles with depression, this approval expands the range of real treatment options. It offers a non-drug path that can be used at home under medical guidance. For patients who have not responded well to medication or who experience unwanted side effects, this could provide another way forward. It also reflects a broader trend toward personalized, tech-enabled mental healthcare.",

That matters for people who have tried medications, dealt with side effects or felt stuck with limited options. This device will not be the right answer for everyone, but it gives patients and doctors one more proven tool to work with.

      "Apple is warning iPhone users about a serious Safari security flaw that could leave hundreds of millions of devices vulnerable if updates are delayed. (Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "What Apple discovered in Safari and WebKit",
      "Late last month, Apple confirmed two critical vulnerabilities in WebKit. WebKit powers Safari and every browser that runs on iOS. According to Apple, the flaws were used in an extremely sophisticated attack that targeted specific individuals. The problem allowed malicious websites to trick iPhones and iPads into running harmful code. Once that happens, attackers could gain control of the device, steal passwords or access payment information. In simple terms, visiting the wrong website could have been enough.",
      "Why millions of iPhones are still exposed",
      "Apple moved quickly to release a fix. The patch is included in the latest software update. The problem is that many people have not installed it yet. Estimates suggest that about 50 percent of eligible users have not upgraded from iOS 18 to iOS 26. That would leave around 800 million devices vulnerable worldwide. Data from StatCounter paints an even worse picture. It estimates that only 20 percent of users have updated so far. Once security details become public, the risk grows fast.

      "There is no setting to flip and no safe browsing habit that fixes this issue. The vulnerability lives deep inside the browser engine. Security experts say there is no workaround or user behavior that meaningfully reduces the risk. Installing the latest software is the only effective defense. Apple is no longer offering a security-only update for users who want to stay on iOS 18. Unless your device cannot run iOS 26, the fix is only available through iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2.",

      "Alexa.com\u00a0is the browser-based version of Alexa+. You can type questions, explore topics, plan trips, organize tasks, or create content without touching a smart speaker. The biggest difference is continuity. Alexa keeps context across devices, so conversations carry over whether you are on your laptop, phone, Echo, or Fire TV. You do not have to repeat yourself every time you switch screens. That makes Alexa feel less like a command tool and more like an assistant that remembers what you are working on.",

      "Brightspeed, one of the largest fiber broadband providers in the United States, is investigating claims that hackers stole sensitive data tied to more than 1 million customers.",
      "The allegations surfaced when a group calling itself the Crimson Collective posted messages on Telegram warning Brightspeed employees to check their email. The group claims it has access to over 1 million residential customer records and threatened to release sample data if the company does not respond.",

      "In a statement shared with BleepingComputer, the company said it is rigorously monitoring threats and working to understand what happened. Brightspeed added that it will keep customers, employees and authorities informed as more details become available.",
      "So far, there has been no public notice on Brightspeed's website or social media channels confirming customer data exposure.",
      "Who Brightspeed is and why this matters",
      "Brightspeed is a U.S. telecommunications and internet service provider founded in 2022 after Apollo Global Management acquired local exchange assets from Lumen Technologies.",
      "Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, the company serves rural and suburban communities across 20 states. It has rapidly expanded its fiber footprint, passing more than 2 million homes and businesses and aiming to reach over 5 million locations.",
      "Because Brightspeed focuses on underserved areas, many customers rely on it as their primary internet provider. That makes any potential breach especially concerning.",
      "A closer look at Crimson Collective",
      "Crimson Collective is not new to high-profile targets. In October, the group breached a GitLab instance tied to Red Hat, stealing hundreds of gigabytes of internal development data.",
      "That incident later rippled outward. In December, Nissan confirmed that personal data for about 21,000 Japanese customers was exposed through the same breach.",
      "More recently, researchers say Crimson Collective has targeted cloud environments, including Amazon Web Services, by abusing exposed credentials and creating rogue access accounts to escalate privileges.",
      "In other words, the group has a track record that makes its claims hard to ignore.",
      "What this could mean for customers",
      "Even though Brightspeed has not confirmed a breach, the claims alone are enough to raise red flags. If customer data was accessed, it could be used for phishing scams, account takeovers or payment fraud.",
      "Cybercriminals often move fast after breaches. That means customers should stay alert even before an official notice appears.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

    "story": [
      "A aviation company is turning heads with an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle.",
      "Personal electric aircraft have teased us for years. They look futuristic, promise freedom from traffic, and usually come with prices that put them out of reach or timelines that feel uncertain. Recently unveiled at CES 2026, the Rictor X4 entered that conversation with some bold claims.",
      "It is a single-passenger electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft designed to make short-range personal flight more accessible and far more affordable. If those promises hold up, it could change how we think about flying for everyday trips.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "CES 2026 put health tech front and center, with companies showcasing smarter ways to support prevention, mobility and long-term wellness. (CES)",
      "TECH STARTUP, MAJOR AIRLINE PARTNER TO LAUNCH ELECTRIC AIR TAXI SERVICE",
      "What the Rictor X4 actually is",
      "The Rictor X4 uses a multirotor design with eight propellers spread across four carbon fiber arms. Those arms fold inward when the aircraft is not in use, allowing it to fit in the bed of a pickup truck. The aircraft focuses on low-altitude flight and short hops rather than long journeys.",
      "Key specs include:",
      "Top speed of about 50 mphMaximum flight time of 20 minutesPayload capacity of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot",
      "Top speed of about 50 mph",
      "Maximum flight time of 20 minutes",
      "Payload capacity of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot",
      "It can lift off and land vertically like a helicopter, then transition into forward flight once airborne. Rictor describes its mission as light aerial mobility, which essentially means short-distance commuting and professional applications.",
      "Inside the X4's propulsion and power system",
      "According to Rictor, the X4's propulsion system is built around stability and redundancy rather than raw speed. Each axis uses a coaxial dual-motor configuration designed to provide consistent thrust during low-altitude flight.",
      "Key propulsion details include:",
      "Rated thrust of up to 165 pounds per axisPeak thrust exceeding 285 pounds per axisMaximum continuous power output of 10 kW120-volt operating system designed for outdoor conditions",
      "Rated thrust of up to 165 pounds per axis",
      "Peak thrust exceeding 285 pounds per axis",
      "Maximum continuous power output of 10 kW",
      "120-volt operating system designed for outdoor conditions",
      "Together, these systems aim to deliver controlled, predictable flight with built-in safety margins, especially during takeoff, landing and hover.",
      "The Rictor X4 is a single-passenger electric aircraft designed for short-range, low-altitude flight with a folding multirotor layout. (Rictor)",
      "Safety systems and flight control in the Rictor X4",
      "Rictor puts safety at the center of the X4's design. The aircraft uses a semi-solid state battery system with dual battery redundancy, which helps enable a controlled landing if one battery module fails. In addition, an emergency parachute system provides backup protection during critical situations. At the same time, a centralized flight control system actively manages propulsion, attitude and overall system health. This system continuously monitors key flight data to help maintain stability in changing conditions.",
      "Beyond software, the hardware plays an important role. The X4 features 63-inch carbon fiber folding propellers in a 4-axis, 8-propeller configuration. Together, they support a payload of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot. According to Rictor, the aircraft is designed to operate at noise levels below 65 decibels, although independent testing has not yet been published. Finally, Rictor's proprietary Dynamic Balance Algorithm adjusts the output of all eight motors in real time. As a result, the X4 can maintain a stable hover even in side winds rated up to Level 6.",
      "The FAA rule that could make personal flight easier",
      "One of Rictor's most attention-grabbing claims involves regulation. The company says the X4 is designed to comply with FAA Part 103, which governs ultralight vehicles in the U.S. If operated within Part 103 limits, the X4 could be flown legally without airworthiness certification or a pilot's license. Rictor says this is enabled by autonomous pre-programmed flight paths and very low altitude operation, reportedly as low as three meters above ground. It is worth noting that Part 103 still carries operational restrictions, including where and how flight can occur. Final compliance depends on real-world use and FAA interpretation.",
      "Designed to fold, transport, and recharge",
      "Portability is a major focus. Rictor says the X4 folds down to about 42 cubic feet, which makes it compact enough to transport in the bed of a pickup truck. The company also highlights in-vehicle charging support while parked or on the move, positioning the X4 as something that can be transported and recharged alongside ground vehicles rather than stored at an airfield.",
      "AIR TAXI SERVICE PLANS EVTOL RIDES FROM ALL THREE NYC AIRPORTS",
      "The price that resets expectations",
      "The Rictor X4 carries a launch price of $39,900 with a $5,000 deposit. That alone separates it from most personal eVTOLs currently discussed in the market. The aircraft is produced by Kuickwheel Technology, Rictor's parent company. According to the company, first customer deliveries are scheduled for Q2 2026. As with any aircraft launch, timelines remain aspirational until production units reach customers.",
      "Why this matters now",
      "Personal eVTOLs have lived in a narrow space between concept and reality. High costs, regulatory hurdles and safety concerns have slowed adoption. If Rictor delivers an aircraft that performs as described while operating within ultralight rules, it could expand personal flight beyond niche enthusiasts and into practical short-range use. Now it comes down to whether the company can deliver on what it's promising.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Rictor X4 brings together aggressive pricing, compact design and regulatory positioning in a way we have not seen before. Folding propellers, redundant safety systems and Part 103 alignment make it one of the most ambitious personal eVTOL launches to date. The unanswered questions center on real-world performance, regulatory interpretation and production readiness. Until aircraft are flying outside controlled demonstrations, healthy skepticism remains warranted. Still, this is one of the most compelling personal flight announcements to come out of CES in recent years.",

      "BROWSER EXTENSION MALWARE INFECTED 8.8M USERS IN DARKSPECTRE ATTACK",
      "Attackers abuse the WhatsApp Web to spread malware through messages that appear to come from people you trust. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How this WhatsApp Web attack works",
      "The attack starts with a simple message. A contact sends what looks like a routine ZIP file through WhatsApp. The file name appears random and harmless, which lowers suspicion. Once opened, the ZIP contains a Visual Basic script disguised as a normal document. If the user runs it, the script quietly pulls in two more pieces of malware. Then the script downloads the Astaroth banking malware written in Delphi. It also installs a Python-based module designed to control WhatsApp Web. Both components run in the background without obvious warning signs. From there, the infection becomes self-sustaining.",
      "Malware that spreads itself through your contacts",
      "What makes this campaign especially dangerous is how it propagates. The Python module scans the victim's WhatsApp contacts and sends the malicious ZIP file to every conversation automatically. Researchers at Acronis found that the malware adapts its messages based on the time of day. It sends friendly greetings, making the message feel normal and familiar. The text says, \"Here is the requested file. If you have any questions, I'm available!\" Because the message appears to come from someone you know, many people open it without hesitation.",
      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "A single ZIP file sent through chat can quietly install banking malware and begin spreading to every contact. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Built-in tracking keeps the attack efficient",
      "This malware is carefully designed to monitor its own performance in real time. The propagation tool tracks how many messages are successfully delivered, how many fail to send and the overall sending speed measured per minute. After every 50 messages, it generates progress updates that show how many contacts have been reached. This feedback allows attackers to measure success quickly and make adjustments if something stops working.",
      "What happens after infection?",
      "The initial script is heavily obfuscated to avoid detection by antivirus tools. Once it runs, it launches PowerShell commands that download more malware from compromised websites. One known domain used in this campaign is coffe-estilo.com. The malware installs itself inside a folder that mimics a Microsoft Edge cache directory. Inside are executable files and libraries that make up the full Astaroth banking payload. From there, the malware can steal credentials, monitor activity and potentially access financial accounts.",
      "Why WhatsApp Web is being abused",
      "WhatsApp Web is popular because it mirrors your phone conversations on a computer. That convenience makes it easy to send messages, share files and type faster, but it also introduces risk. When you use WhatsApp Web, you link your phone to a browser by scanning a QR code at web.whatsapp.com. Once connected, that browser session becomes a trusted extension of your account. Your chats appear on the screen, messages you send come from your real number and incoming messages sync across both devices.",
      "That setup is exactly what attackers take advantage of. If malware gains access to a computer with WhatsApp Web logged in, it can act as the user. It can read messages, access contact lists and send files or links that look completely legitimate. The messages do not raise alarms because they are coming from a real account, not a fake one.",
      "This is what turns WhatsApp Web into an effective delivery system for malware. Instead of breaking into WhatsApp itself, attackers simply abuse an open browser session to spread malicious files automatically.",
      "Many users do not realize the danger because WhatsApp Web feels harmless. It is often left signed in on work computers, shared devices or systems without strong security. In those situations, malware does not need advanced tricks. It only needs access to an already trusted session. That combination of convenience and trust is why WhatsApp Web has become such an attractive target.",
      "MALICIOUS MAC EXTENSIONS STEAL CRYPTO WALLETS AND PASSWORDS",
      "Once the WhatsApp Web is compromised, malware can act like the user, sending messages and files that look completely legitimate.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to stay safe from WhatsApp Web malware",
      "Attacks like this WhatsApp Web malware are designed to spread fast through trusted conversations. A few smart habits can dramatically lower your risk.",
      "Messaging apps feel casual, which is exactly why attackers use them. Never open ZIP files sent through chat unless you confirm with the sender first. Watch for file names made of random numbers or unfamiliar names.\u00a0Treat messages that create urgency or feel overly familiar as a warning sign. If a file arrives out of nowhere, pause before clicking.",
      "This campaign abuses WhatsApp Web to spread automatically once a device is infected. Check active WhatsApp Web sessions and log out of any you do not recognize. Avoid leaving WhatsApp Web signed in on shared or public computers. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) inside WhatsApp settings. Cutting off Web access helps limit how far malware can travel.",
      "This type of malware takes advantage of systems that fall behind on updates. Install Windows updates as soon as they are available. Also, keep your web browser fully updated. Staying current closes many of the doors attackers try to slip through. In addition, use strong antivirus software that watches for script abuse and PowerShell activity in real time.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Banking malware often pairs with identity theft and financial fraud. One way to reduce the fallout is by shrinking your digital footprint. A data removal service can help remove your personal information from data broker sites that attackers often search. With less information available, criminals have fewer details to exploit if malware reaches your device.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com",
      "Even with strong security habits, financial monitoring adds another layer of protection. An identity theft protection service can watch for suspicious activity tied to your credit and personal data. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "You should also turn on alerts for bank and credit card transactions so you are notified quickly if something looks wrong. The less exposed your data is, the fewer opportunities attackers have to cause damage.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Most malware infections happen because people act too quickly. If a message feels off, trust that instinct. Familiar names and friendly language can lower your guard, but they should never replace caution. Take a moment to verify the message or file before opening anything. Attackers rely on trust and urgency to succeed. Slowing down takes away their advantage.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This WhatsApp Web malware campaign is a reminder that cyberattacks no longer rely on obvious red flags. Instead, they blend into everyday conversations and use familiar tools to spread quietly and quickly. What makes this threat especially concerning is how little effort it takes for it to move from one device to dozens of others.",
      "A single click can turn a trusted chat into a delivery system for banking malware and identity theft. The good news is that small changes make a big difference. Paying attention to attachments, locking down WhatsApp Web access, keeping devices updated and slowing down before clicking can stop these attacks cold. As messaging platforms continue to play a bigger role in daily life, staying alert is no longer optional. Awareness and simple habits remain some of the strongest defenses you have.",

      "Instead of finger pricks, the device analyzes acetone and other compounds in exhaled breath linked to blood sugar levels. (PreEvnt)",
      "How the PreEvnt isaac monitors glucose using breath",
      "One of the most talked-about health devices at CES 2026 came from PreEvnt. Its product, called isaac, takes a nontraditional approach to glucose awareness. Instead of piercing skin or using optical sensors, isaac analyzes your breath.",
      "The device measures volatile organic compounds, especially acetone, which has long been associated with rising blood glucose. That sweet fruity breath is a known marker of diabetes. By detecting changes in those compounds, isaac can alert users to potential glucose events. The device is small, about the size of a quarter, with a loop so it can be worn on a lanyard or clipped to clothing or a bag.",
      "The breath-based design is intended to reduce how often users need finger-prick blood tests, while providing early alerts for glucose-related changes.",
      "The device is named after the inventor's grandson, Isaac, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at just 2 years old. The inventor, Bud Wilcox, wanted to reduce the number of painful finger pricks his grandson faced each day. That personal motivation led to years of collaboration with scientists, designers and engineers. Research and development included work with Indiana University under the direction of Dr. M. Agarwal. The goal was simple but ambitious: Alert families to blood sugar events earlier while reducing the physical and emotional toll of constant testing.",
      "How the isaac device fits into daily life",
      "Isaac is designed to fit into everyday routines. Users breathe into the device, which processes the reading and sends the data to a companion smartphone app. The app, still in its final stages of development, focuses on awareness and safety. Current features include:",

      "Designed for everyday use, the isaac wearable device pairs with a smartphone app to log readings and send alerts when needed. (PreEvnt)",
      "Clinical trials and FDA review for the isaac device",
      "PreEvnt first introduced isaac publicly at CES 2025. Later that year, the device entered active human clinical trials.\u00a0Those studies compare isaac's breath-based alerts with traditional blood glucose monitoring methods.",
      "Trials began with adolescents who have Type 1 diabetes and later expanded to adults with Type 2 diabetes. The company is now working toward regulatory review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Because this technology is new, PreEvnt is pursuing a de novo pathway, which allows devices to be evaluated while standards are still being defined. According to the company, regulators have shown strong interest as the data continues to come in.",
      "Isaac does not claim to replace medical-grade glucose meters. The device is being developed to supplement existing monitoring methods by offering breath-based alerts tied to glucose-related changes.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Noninvasive glucose monitoring has long felt like a future promise that never quite arrives. The attention around isaac at CES 2026 suggests that promise may finally be getting closer. If clinical trials continue to deliver strong results and regulators give approval, breathing into a small device could one day replace at least some finger pricks. For families living with diabetes, that shift could make daily life easier and safer.",

    "summary": "Kodiak AI&apos;s autonomous trucks have driven over 3 million miles with impressive safety scores, proving self-driving technology works on real highways today.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson spoke with Daniel Goff, vice president of external affairs at Kodiak AI, about how attitudes toward autonomous trucks have shifted over time.",
      "Kodiak AI, a leading provider of AI-powered autonomous driving technology, has spent years quietly proving that self-driving trucks can work in the real world. The company's core system, the Kodiak Driver, brings software and hardware together in a practical way. As the company explains, \"The Kodiak Driver combines advanced AI-driven software with modular, vehicle-agnostic hardware into a single, unified platform.\"",
      "That approach matters because trucking is not a closed lab environment. It is highways, weather, fatigue and long hours. Kodiak's strategy focuses on solving those realities first.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "How public views on autonomous trucks are changing",
      "During a recent episode of CyberGuy's \"Beyond Connected\" podcast, Kurt spoke with Daniel Goff, vice president of external affairs at Kodiak AI, about how attitudes toward autonomous trucks have shifted over time.",
      "WILL AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REPLACE DRIVERS BY 2027?",
      "Autonomous trucks are already hauling freight on public highways as companies test how the technology performs in real-world conditions. (Kodiak)",
      "Goff described how different the reaction was when the company first launched. \"Kodiak was founded in 2018, and I joined in 2019. When I first started at the company, I said I worked for a company that was working to build trucks that drive themselves, and people kind of looked at me like I was crazy. Over the last few years, we've really seen autonomous vehicles capture the public's imagination. We've seen them grow in the real world. I think that people are getting more used to this idea.\"",
      "For Goff, that shift has come from seeing the technology operate safely outside of test environments, where performance matters more than hype.",
      "Why autonomous trucks could improve road safety",
      "One of Kodiak AI's central arguments is simple. Machines avoid many of the risks that come with human driving. \"We think there are advantages to this technology that humans, myself included, can't match. You know this technology doesn't get distracted. It doesn't check its phone. It doesn't have a phone. It doesn't have a bad day to take it out on the road. It doesn't speed. It doesn't know how to speed. You know they're pretty boring drivers.\" In trucking, boring is often a good thing.",
      "Where autonomous trucks are already operating today",
      "Kodiak AI is already doing this on real roads. The company has been running active freight routes for years, not just testing in controlled settings. \"Kodiak's headquarters are in Mountainview, California, but since 2019, we've had a command center in Lancaster, Texas, which is just south of Dallas. Since 2019, we've actually been delivering freight from that Lancaster hub to Houston, Oklahoma City and Atlanta with what we call a safety driver behind the wheel.\"",
      "Those real-world miles have helped Kodiak fine-tune its system in everyday traffic, weather and long-haul conditions.",
      "Tractor trailers at the entrance of the Port of Baltimore in Maryland on Oct. 8, 2024. (Nathan Howard/Getty Images)",
      "The trucking problem Kodiak is trying to solve",
      "Long-haul trucking is essential to the U.S. economy, but it is also one of the most demanding and risky jobs on the road. Drivers spend long stretches away from home, work extended hours and operate heavy vehicles in all conditions. As Goff put it, \"Driving a truck is one of the most difficult and dangerous jobs that people do in the United States every day. You know, being a truck driver means, for at least a long-haul truck driver, means you're away from your family for sometimes days, weeks, even months at a time, sleeping in the back of the truck.\"",
      "He also pointed to federal safety rules that limit how long drivers can stay behind the wheel, which are meant to reduce fatigue but also restrict how much freight one person can move in a day. \"If you're driving the 11-hour legal maximum per day and there are people who love being long-haul truckers, but we\u2019re not seeing people stepping up for those roles anymore in this country, and drivers are retiring every year.\"",
      "Those realities have contributed to ongoing driver shortages and growing pressure on the freight system. Kodiak believes autonomous technology is best used where the job is hardest and most repetitive. \"The goal for this technology is really best suited for those really tough jobs. The long lonely highway miles, the trucking and remote locations where people either don't wanna live or don't or can't easily live.\"",
      "Goff also highlighted how much capacity is lost simply because trucks sit idle for most of the day. \"The average truck is driven about seven hours a day in the U.S., and you know there are 24 hours a day, so that's a lot of time just sitting there.\"",
      "Autonomy, he said, could help change that math. \"The goal of the technology is that you can basically run 24/7, just kind of stopping to refuel, to inspect the truck for safety, and you know, other than that, the trucks are moving.\"",
      "Long-haul trucking is one of the most demanding jobs on the road, which is why autonomous systems focus on long, repetitive highway routes. (Kodiak)",
      "How many miles Kodiak AI has driven to prove safety",
      "Kodiak AI emphasizes data over promises. \"We've driven over 3 million miles with a safety driver behind the wheel for most of those miles, meaning somebody ready to take over at any time. So, we got a very good track record.\" To put that into perspective, Goff added, \"The average American drives about 800,000 miles in their lifetime, which seems crazy. That's a lot of driving, but we're at almost four average lifetimes with our system today, and we also use computer simulation, all sorts of things to assess the safety of the system.\"",
      "In addition to its long-haul operations, Kodiak AI works with Atlas Energy Solutions, which does oil logistics in the Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico. As of Q3 2025, the company has delivered 10 driverless trucks to Atlas, which autonomously deliver sand up to 24 hours a day with no human operator in the cab. Goff says, \"We see our work in the Permian as a perfect sandbox for our long-haul operations.\"",
      "The company has also sought third-party validation. \"Additionally, we have done external-facing studies. We did a study with a company called Nauto, which is one of the leaders in AI-enabled dashcams. They actually help vehicle fleets compute safety scores from an outside perspective. Our system scored the highest ever in the Nauto safety score.\"",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Where autonomous truck regulations stand today",
      "Policy is another key factor in adoption. \"From a regulatory perspective. 25 states have passed laws allowing autonomous vehicle deployment.\" Goff believes the danger of everyday driving makes the case clear. \"I think people who think about transportation every day understand how dangerous driving a car is, driving a truck is, and just being on the road see the potential for this technology.\"",
      "What critics say about autonomous trucks",
      "Autonomous trucking still raises concerns among safety advocates and everyday drivers. Critics question whether software can respond fast enough in emergencies, handle unpredictable human behavior or make judgment calls during complex highway situations.",
      "Kodiak AI says those concerns are exactly why safety comes first. As Goff explained, \"In this industry in particular, we really understand how important it is to be safe.\"",
      "The company argues that autonomous systems must earn trust over time through real-world performance, transparent testing and measurable results, not promises or hype.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For everyday drivers, autonomous trucks raise understandable questions. Sharing the road with a vehicle controlled by software can feel unsettling, especially when headlines often focus on what could go wrong. Kodiak's argument is that safety improves when fatigue, distraction and emotional decision-making are removed from long highway driving. If the technology continues to perform as claimed, the impact could show up in quieter ways. That includes fewer tired drivers on overnight routes, more predictable freight movement and potentially safer highways over time. For consumers, it could also mean fewer delivery delays and less strain on a trucking system already short on drivers.",

      "Safety data, real-world miles and third-party reviews now play a central role in building trust in self-driving trucks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Autonomous trucking is not a future concept anymore. Kodiak AI is already moving freight and collecting real safety data on public roads. At the same time, skepticism remains healthy and necessary. Trust in this technology will rise or fall based on transparency, regulation and long-term performance, not promises. The real question is no longer whether self-driving trucks can operate. It is whether they can consistently prove they make roads safer for everyone who shares them.",

      "Unexpected Instagram password reset emails can look completely legitimate, which is why so many users are caught off guard during this surge. (Cyverguy.com)",
      "Why Instagram password reset emails are surging",
      "This surge is happening because the reset emails themselves can be real, even when the intent behind them is not. Instead of building fake phishing pages or using malware, attackers take advantage of Instagram's normal account recovery system.",
      "The process is simple. An attacker enters your username or email into Instagram's real password reset form. Instagram automatically sends a legitimate reset email to you. The attacker then waits to see how you react.",
      "At this point, your account has not been hacked. The risk comes from what happens next. Attackers are counting on common mistakes, such as clicking the reset button and rushing through the process, reusing a weak password, getting redirected to a fake follow-up page or falling for a second scam email that arrives soon after.",
      "That is why this tactic works as a stress test. It creates urgency and pressure, even though nothing has been compromised yet.",
      "Why attackers love this tactic",
      "This is classic social engineering. The attacker does not need to outsmart Instagram. They need to outsmart you in a stressed moment. A reset email creates urgency. It also feels official.

      "If an email pressures you to act immediately, threatens account deletion or asks for extra information, treat it as suspicious.",
      "The BreachForums leak connection",
      "The timing of this surge has raised fresh concerns. Reports point to data tied to roughly 17.5 million Instagram accounts being shared on BreachForums, an underground forum where cybercriminals trade and discuss stolen data. The alleged post appeared in early January 2026, which lines up with when many users began reporting a sudden wave of password reset emails, sometimes receiving several in a short period of time.",
      "This timing alone does not prove a direct connection. However, leaked usernames or email addresses can make it much easier for attackers to target large numbers of accounts at once, which is exactly what this kind of reset spam depends on. We reached out to Meta for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "We reached out to Meta for comment, and a spokesperson for the company told CyberGuy, \"We fixed an issue that allowed an external party to request password reset emails for some Instagram users. We want to reassure everyone there was no breach of our systems and people's Instagram accounts remain secure. People can disregard these emails and we apologize for any confusion this may have caused.\"",
      "How to tell if the reset email is legitimate",
      "A legitimate Instagram reset email can still be part of an attack attempt. So your goal is not \"confirm it is real,\" it is \"avoid reacting in a risky way.\" Instagram's own guidance boils down to this:",
      "A reset email alone does not mean your account is compromisedIf you did not request it, do not use the linkUse Instagram's official paths in the app to review security and report suspicious messages",
      "A reset email alone does not mean your account is compromised",

      "Use Instagram's official paths in the app to review security and report suspicious messages",
      "Also, if you get emails about changing your account email address, Instagram says those messages can include a way to reverse the change, which can help you recover if someone broke in.",
      "These real-looking messages are designed to create urgency and push people to click before slowing down and checking their account security. (Cyverguy.com)",

Instagram has pushed 2FA heavily for higher-risk accounts and urges users to enable it. Use an authenticator app if you can. It is often safer than SMS.",

      "EXCLUSIVE: A top Trump administration Education Department official exposed a pair of blue states that he says are among the worst for federal student aid fraud as officials crack down on scammers who are exploiting the taxpayer-funded programs.",
      "In 2025, the Department of Education said it prevented $1 billion of fraud in the aid programs. Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said these schemes are not only a waste of taxpayer money, but also disproportionately affect low-income students trying to pay for their education.",
      "\"We talked about California being certainly a hub of fraud, waste and abuse, but we also see Minnesota, for example,\" Kent told Fox News Digital. \"You know, one of the things that has been brought to light over the course of the last couple of weeks is the enormous amount of fraud, waste and abuse under the governor's leadership there, and this is something that the federal Department of Education had lifted up and highlighted months ago.\"",
      "Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent speaks with Fox News Digital about student aid fraud in January 2026. (Fox News Digital)",
      "\"And to kind of put that into perspective, that's 1,700 Pell Grants for low-income students that that money could have gone toward,\" Kent continued. \"So when we think about limited resources, we think about taking away these things that low-income and middle-income students really need in order to get in and through their educational journey.\"",

      "During a 12-month period between 2024 and 2025, scammers stole at least $10 million in federal financial aid from community colleges in California. According to one report, 34% of applications to community colleges in the state last year were likely fake.",
      "Kent explained that in many cases, \"ghost students\" are to blame.",
      "\"What we see often in terms of financial aid fraud are what we call ghost students, and these are students who really never intend to enroll in post-secondary education,\" he said. \"They never intend to take classes and to graduate. They enroll for the sole purpose of defrauding the federal student aid program.\"",

      "Kent said that these \"ghost students\" simply sign up for the courses, obtain financial aid, show up to class once or twice, and then pocket the money, never to return to the classroom. This scam, according to Kent, could be proliferated with the use of AI, which can allow swindlers to enroll in many different college programs at once. Some of the thieves are Americans, while others steal from abroad.",
      "In order to combat the fraud, Kent said that the Trump administration is employing a very simple strategy, for starters: checking identification.",
      "\"And so, over the summer, we implemented very strict fraud controls on the FAFSA, the form that students use to apply for federal student aid, including mandatory identification checks for first-time student aid applicants, to ensure that every applicant is a real student and not a ghost student or an AI bot.\"",

      "Kent also noted that sometimes, colleges will turn a blind eye to federal student aid fraud, saying they benefit from the funding too.",
      "\"So, we're also holding institutions accountable for understanding that if fraud is on your campus, you should know about it and you should be putting your own fraud detection efforts in place,\" he said. \"Affordability is a critical component of the Trump administration's agenda, and one part of that is making sure that taxpayer resources are going to individuals, to families that deserve them. And criminals do not deserve this money.\"",
      "\"So we're going to do everything that we can under the secretary's leadership to ensure that we're going after bad guys, and we're going to capture them, and we're going to prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "Keith Hovis is a spokesperson for the Minnesota Office of Higher Education (OHE).",
      "He explained that FAFSA verification \u2014 that is, checking to make sure accurate information is provided on the federal student aid form \u2014 is done at the federal level and by colleges. His office has nothing to do with such oversight.",
      "\"Financial aid staff at each college \u2014 be it a Minnesota college or other state college \u2014 review the FAFSA, verify following US DOE procedure, and then put together a financial aid package,\" he said. \"If the student receives Federal funds, the school submits that to the Feds who then distribute/release funds if all requirements are met.\"",

      "A long and growing list of world leaders, including those of India, Pakistan and the European Union\u2019s executive arm, say they\u2019ve been offered the chance to join President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d to supervise the next phase of his plan for the Gaza Strip.",
      "But the board\u2019s charter makes no direct mention of Gaza and instead proposes a broad mandate for a new international organization that \u201cseeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe just created the Board of Peace, which I think is going to be amazing,\u201d Trump said Tuesday at a White House news briefing. \u201cI wish the United Nations could do more. I wish we didn\u2019t need a Board of Peace, but the United Nations, and, you know, with all the wars I settled, United Nations never helped me on one war.\u201d",
      "While a few leaders have publicly accepted, it is not known whether any have agreed to donate $1 billion to avoid renewing their membership after three years, according to the charter, the text of which was confirmed to NBC News by two sources whose countries received invitations.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Many appear to have been taken aback by the board\u2019s expanding ambitions. Key U.S. allies in Europe have already expressed reservations that the plan could undermine the U.N.'s primacy in conflict resolution, even as Trump has repeatedly threatened to use American military force to take over Greenland.",
      "In letters sent Friday to various world leaders, Trump said the body would \u201cembark on a bold new approach to resolving global conflict,\u201d according to a copy of the letter posted to the website of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Other media outlets quoted from the same letter received by other leaders.",
      "A source close to French President Emmanuel Macron told NBC News that at this stage, he \u201cdoes not intend to give a favorable response\u201d to the invitation, citing major questions over respect for the U.N. and whether the board might specifically act as a rival to the Security Council, the U.N.\u2019s most powerful body, created in the wake of World War II.",
      "In a separate statement, Macron\u2019s office said the board\u2019s charter \u201cgoes beyond the sole framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.\u201d",
      "Trump responded by threatening late Monday to hit French wines and Champagnes with 200% tariff, apparently in an effort to pressure Macron to change his stance and join his board.",
      "The Kremlin also demurred about Putin\u2019s invitation. \u201cWe are currently studying all the details of this proposal, including hoping to contact the American side to clarify all the nuances,\u201d spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists Monday.",

Orb\u00e1n said he \u201caccepted this honorable invitation,\u201d and Lukashenko formalized his country\u2019s ascension to the board Tuesday, Belarus\u2019 Foreign Affairs Ministry said on X.",
      "The list of those invited to participate runs to nearly two dozen, including countries as diverse as Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Canada and Australia, and it helps shine a light on the structure and remit of Trump\u2019s plan for Gaza\u2019s postwar governance, bringing the next phase of the U.S.-negotiated ceasefire into sharper focus.",
      "But in Israel, the plan has already been criticized by ultranationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who said Monday that it was time to explain to Trump that \u201chis plan is bad for the State of Israel and to cancel it,\u201d according to The Associated Press.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took a more diplomatic line, telling lawmakers that there were differences with the U.S. about the composition of the advisory committee accompanying the next phase in Gaza but that it would not harm his relationship with Trump, according to the AP.",
      "Netanyahu said early Wednesday that he had agreed to join the board.",
      "Israeli politicians have been highly critical of Trump\u2019s inclusion of diplomats from Qatar and Turkey on a separate advisory committee that will play a strong role in Gaza\u2019s administration. Both, which have also been invited to the Board of Peace, have strained relationships with Israel after its two-year war in Gaza. Netanyahu said Monday that no soldiers from those countries would be allowed into the Palestinian enclave.",
      "Another neighbor, the United Arab Emirates, said it had accepted the invitation Tuesday.",
      "In a statement Saturday, Netanyahu\u2019s office said that the Gaza executive committee was \u201cnot coordinated with Israel and is contrary to its policy\u201d and that he had instructed Foreign Minister Gideon Saar to contact Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "In the months since the U.N. Security Council approved Trump\u2019s ceasefire plan for Gaza, the White House\u2019s original concept appears to have broadened, and the board\u2019s new charter does not mention the enclave.",
      "Asked about the omission, a White House spokesperson said that board members would work \u201cto secure enduring peace in Gaza and around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is an issue of on-the-ground diplomacy and leverage, not creating some global cosmic superstructure,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based think tank. Trump\u2019s plan, he said, is \u201ctethered to a galaxy far, far away, not to the realities here on planet Earth.\u201d",
      "The charter also says Trump will serve as the inaugural chairman of the executive board who will vote on proposals put before it. \u201cSuch decisions shall go into effect immediately, subject to veto by the Chairman at any time thereafter,\u201d it says.",
      "The price tag, along with the board\u2019s guaranteed American dominance, might make membership a tough sell, Miller said.",
      "\u201cIf you sign up for the \u2018Board of Peace,\u2019 you will be aligning yourself with Trump\u2019s vision,\u201d said Miller, who worked closely on Middle East peace negotiations during his decades as an American diplomat. \u201cAdding a billion-dollar entry fee as if this is getting a seasonal membership at Mar-a-Lago has created the sense that this is not serious.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Tackling an issue with huge ramifications for both the economy and the structure of government, the Supreme Court on Wednesday considers President Donald Trump's attempt to oust Federal Reserve board member Lisa Cook.",
      "With Trump seeking to exert control over the central bank, which, among other things, sets interest rates, the case has taken on even greater importance after it emerged that the Justice Department is investigating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.",
      "Congress set up the Federal Reserve to be independent, so it would not be influenced by immediate political concerns in fulfilling its mandate to maintain price stability and low unemployment.",
      "Under the Federal Reserve Act, presidents are restricted from removing governors unless it is \u201cfor cause,\u201d meaning there is evidence of wrongdoing.",
      "Trump has said he wants to fire Cook for cause, over allegations of mortgage fraud made by one of his political appointees, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. Cook has denied the allegations, and bank documents obtained by NBC News appear to contradict the fraud claim.",
      "The Supreme Court in October refused to allow Trump to fire Cook immediately, instead scheduling oral arguments in the case, suggesting the administration may face an uphill battle over his claim that the decision to remove her cannot be challenged in court.",
      "Cook's lawyers argue she should have notice and a chance to rebut Trump's stated reasons for firing her before she can be removed. They say Trump's rationale does not meet the threshold for \"for cause\" removal.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer, representing the Trump administration, says in court papers that Cook has no right to any kind of hearing challenging her firing. It is up to the president alone to decide whether the \"for cause\" hurdle is met under the powers allocated to him under Section 2 of the Constitution, he said.",
      "Powell is expected to attend Wednesday\u2019s argument.",
      "Trump has long been critical of the Fed, and Powell in particular, for not doing more to lower interest rates, though he originally appointed Powell to the position in 2017.",
      "Trump has not moved to fire Powell, though the Justice Department investigation, related to testimony Powell gave to Congress about refurbishments at the Fed's headquarters in Washington, could similarly give him a reason. Although Powell's term as chair ends in May, he could stay as a board member until 2028.",
      "President Joe Biden appointed Cook to a term that ends in 2038.",
      "The Trump administration's handling of Cook and Powell has raised alarm among former Fed officials and Trump critics who say the Federal Reserve must maintain its independence to be effective and fear it could be directly controlled by the White House.",
      "\"We are in an unprecedented moment right now. President Donald Trump is doing everything he can to take over America\u2019s central bank so that it works for him, along with his billionaire friends,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., told reporters last week.",
      "While Warren has been a critic of Fed policies that she sees as favoring Wall Street and big banks, she added, \"I think we can all agree that the Fed works best when its decisions are based on data.\"",
      "Economists warn that lower rates in the short term to achieve Trump's political goals could have negative long-term consequences.",
      "\"This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly,\" former Fed chairs and other former senior officials said in a joint statement issued in light of the Powell investigation.",
      "Since he started his second term a year ago, Trump has waged war on what have previously been known as independent agencies set up by Congress to be protected from political influence by firing various members despite \"for cause\" protections, including the Federal Trade Commission and the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "The Supreme Court has allowed those firings, but in a May decision, it suggested that the Federal Reserve might be treated differently. The court noted then that the Federal Reserve is a \u201cuniquely structured, quasi-private entity\u201d that has its own historical tradition."

At the same time, U.S. District Judge David Novak said he would allow Halligan to avoid attorney disciplinary proceedings for now \"in light of her inexperience.\"",
      "Novak issued an order that bars \"Ms. Halligan from representing herself as the United States Attorney in any pleading or otherwise before this Court until such time as she may lawfully hold the office either by Senate confirmation or appointment by this Court ... should either occur.\"",
      "Halligan told NBC News in a statement Tuesday evening that she faced \"baseless accusations of lying,\" as well as accusations of making \"false or misleading\" statements.",
      "\"The court\u2019s remedy did not match its rhetoric. It treated me as though I had been removed from office \u2014 declaring my appointment unlawful and striking my name from filings \u2014 while never taking the single step Judge Currie identified as the consequence of that conclusion: appointing a replacement U.S. Attorney,\" she wrote. \"In short, the court took no action to fill the vacancy it said already existed.\"",

      "Currie ruled in November that Halligan was unlawfully serving in the role and dismissed cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. After President Donald Trump urged Bondi to prosecute James and Comey, frequent targets of his ire, Halligan\u2014 who had no prosecutorial experience \u2014 presented the cases against them to federal grand jurors.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration tried and failed to indict James on mortgage-related charges after the Halligan-led case was dismissed. Then it failed yet again, a remarkable rebuke from federal grand jurors, who typically side with prosecutors who need only show probable cause, a much lower threshold than the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard needed to secure a conviction at trial.",
      "Last week, a top attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia was fired in a dispute over whether he would head up an effort to re-indict Comey. Any attempt to re-indict Comey in connection with congressional testimony in September 2020 would face further litigation over whether the prosecution is lawful, given that the five-year statute of limitations has passed.",

Ramirez said the timing of the bill\u2019s introduction sends a signal now to angry constituents who are asking their elected leaders in Congress whether they are pushing back against the administration.",
      "\u201cYou hear the desperation of our people over and over. What do they say: \u2018What the hell is Congress doing? Why won\u2019t they stand up for us? Who is fighting for us? Who will defend us? How could this be legal?\u2019\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s really important for us to demonstrate a sense of urgency, especially right now. Waiting until January of next year to begin introducing, building support, building a case for this is too damn late for us.\u201d",
      "She said it is a tactic similar to one that Republicans tapped with their own initiatives in the past. In 2023, Republicans set the stage for their own push on an overhaul of immigration enforcement \u2014 including building a case to eventually impeach then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in 2024.",
      "If Democrats regain a majority in 2027, she said, they\u2019ll be positioned to \u201cmove this as quickly as we possibly can.\u201d",
      "The move is the latest iteration of the left\u2019s pushback against a prominent agency within the Department of Homeland Security that is carrying out President Donald Trump\u2019s massive deportation initiative. Congressional Democrats have warned Republicans against fully funding DHS in an upcoming budget fight, with many insisting they would reject any funding bill without policies to restrain immigration officials.",
      "It comes as the nation\u2019s eyes are on Minnesota in the wake of the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an immigration officer. Protests have broken out throughout the Twin Cities since Good\u2019s death on Jan. 7. Videos have since proliferated in Minneapolis showing aggressive confrontations between immigration agents and protesters. Before that, similar confrontations played out in the Chicago area, including in Ramirez\u2019s district.",
      "There is growing public support for restraining ICE, and recently, one poll, in a shift from 2018, showed more people supported abolishing ICE than keeping it.",
      "But groups like the Democratic think tank Third Way warned that Democrats should avoid using \"Abolish ICE\" language, which it cast as inflammatory, and instead focus on reforming the agency while maintaining enforcement of immigration laws. In a memo released last week, Third Way argued that using the \u201cabolish ICE\u201d slogan would allow Republicans to shift the conversation away from agency abuses and cast the left as feckless on illegal immigration.",
      "Ramirez disagreed, saying that the proposal wouldn\u2019t suspend security on the country\u2019s southern border and that nothing in the bill would preclude law enforcement from arresting and prosecuting criminals.",
      "\"There is already systems in place to do a criminal enforcement,\" she said. \"We're not saying that that system would go away. ICE would go away.\""

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Prince Harry entered the witness box on Wednesday in his final legal showdown with Britain's tabloid media.",
      "It is the estranged royal's second time testifying in court, and comes as he leads a group of seven high-profile claimants, including Elton John and actors Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost in a privacy lawsuit against one of Britain's biggest news organizations, Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL).",
      "They have accused the publisher of the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday newspapers, of using unlawful methods to snoop on them for sensational headlines, including the tapping and hacking of phones and obtaining private medical and financial records through deception, chiefly between 1993 and 2011.",
      "ANL has strenuously denied the allegations and called them \u201cpreposterous smears.\u201d",
      "After a minor technical glitch delayed proceedings, Harry was questioned by ANL\u2019s lawyer Antony White, who asked him if information in the articles could have come from friends or social circles.",
      "\u201cThe kind of info that ends up in articles is not the kind of stuff that I would be talking about openly,\u201d Harry replied.",
      "Harry broke with tradition in 2023, when he became the first senior royal in 130 years to give evidence in court during a lawsuit against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), the publisher of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People tabloids.",
      "King Edward VII had been the last to do so when he testified as a witness in part of a divorce case in 1870 and 20 years later in a slander trial over a card game, both while he was Prince of Wales and before he became king.",
      "Speculation has been rife about whether the end of the case could lead to a reconciliation with his father, King Charles III, after years of mounting royal tensions.",
      "Prince William and Princess Kate are in Scotland this week. Their spokesperson declined to comment on whether the trio would meet up, as did a spokesperson for Harry. Charles was in London, but it was unclear whether he would meet up with his youngest son.",
      "Harry, who is fifth-in-line to the throne, has blamed the tabloid press for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, and has been critical about their treatment of his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "He won a payout from MGN and in January 2025 he was awarded substantial damages and an apology from News Group Newspapers, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s British newspaper arm, which settled ahead of a trial.",
      "ANL has denied the allegations.",
      "In a submission to the court on Monday, White said ANL's editors and journalists were \u201clining up\u201d to reject the claimants' \u201callegations of habitual and widespread phone hacking, phone tapping and blagging within the organization.\u201d",
      "It added that the claimants had \u201dfailed to establish that the most serious categories of alleged unlawful information gathering \u2013 phone hacking and phone tapping \u2013 took place at Associated at all, and their allegation of burglary to order was struck out by the Court. The allegation that these practices were \u2018habitual and widespread\u2019 at Associated\u2019s titles was simply untrue.\""

      "The messages were unsealed as part of Lively\u2019s lawsuit against Baldoni, her co-star in the 2024 film \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Wayfarer Studios and others, litigation that has been going on for over a year.",
      "According to the court document, which Lively\u2019s lawyers filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Swift wrote, \u201cI think this bitch knows something is coming because he\u2019s gotten out his tiny violin.\u201d",
      "In the motion, Lively\u2019s lawyers confirmed the quoted language but disputed the defense\u2019s assertion that it was said while Swift and Lively were discussing \u2014 on Dec. 4 and 5, 2024 \u2014 a forthcoming New York Times article that reported that Baldoni and the CEO of Wayfarer had launched a \u201cretaliatory \u2018smear campaign\u2019\u201d against Lively.",

      "A spokesperson for Wayfarer declined to comment.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s motion deals with the re-filing of public versions of exhibits that were part of an earlier motion by Lively\u2019s attorneys opposing a summary judgment in the case.",
      "An attorney for Baldoni previously called the allegations in the lawsuit \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively first filed a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department on Dec. 20, 2024, that accused Baldoni of sexual harassment during filming of \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d as well as retaliation against Lively after she raised issues about his on-set behavior.",
      "She filed a federal civil lawsuit against Baldoni, who is also a co-founder and co-owner of Wayfarer Studios and who directed \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d on Dec. 31, 2024. In February, she filed an amended complaint against Baldoni, the company, the company\u2019s CEO and others.",
      "Baldoni filed a countersuit against Lively seeking $400 million, but a federal judge dismissed it in June and formally ended it in November after an amended complaint was not filed by a court-set deadline.",
      "Lively\u2019s amended complaint, which does not name a dollar amount, seeks compensatory and punitive damages. It alleges that there was a \u201cmulti-tiered plan\u201d by Baldoni and his team to destroy her reputation.",
      "In \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Lively plays Lily Bloom, a woman who moves to Boston with a dream of opening a flower shop and marries neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid, played by Baldoni. The film explores Bloom\u2019s decision to break a cycle of domestic abuse and divorce him.",

    "summary": "What happened to Elizabeth Smart? Where is she now? This is the true story of her abduction.",
    "story": [
      "It was an abduction so brazen that local law enforcement officials said they had never seen anything like it in their careers.",
      "A 14-year-old Utah girl named Elizabeth Smart had been taken at knifepoint out of the bedroom of her family home in June 2002 with her 9-year-old sister in the room.",
      "An intensive manhunt ensued, while the search for her abductor put members of her family under stressful scrutiny. Meanwhile, Smart was in captivity in the mountains outside Salt Lake City under the control of a violent kidnapper.",
      "The saga of Smart's abduction, her terrifying ordeal and her rescue are the subject of the new Netflix documentary, \"Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart,\" which began streaming on Jan. 21.",
      "Here is what to know about her story.",
      "What Happened to Elizabeth Smart?",
      "Smart was a 14-year-old girl living in Salt Lake City with her parents, four brothers and younger sister when she was abducted by a man at knifepoint from her bedroom on June 5, 2002. Her family describes her in the documentary as a normal teenager who enjoyed playing the harp and hanging out with her friends and siblings.",
      "Her younger sister, Mary Katherine, who was 9 years old at the time, was in the room during the abduction. Mary Katherine says in the documentary, and elsewhere like in the investigative book \"In Plain Sight: The Startling Truth Behind the Elizabeth Smart Investigation,\" the man told her he would kill her if she alerted their parents.",
      "She recognized his voice, but couldn't pinpoint who it exactly was, and her parents were unaware of the intruder. Mary Katherine ultimately alerted them to Elizabeth being taken at 3:58 a.m., and they discovered a screen had been cut in the kitchen and a window was open.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t keep her from harm\u2019s way,\" their father, Ed Smart, says in the documentary. \"That just repeats over in your mind, over and over and over again.\"",
      "A bloodhound brought by police tracked Elizabeth's scent up a hill in the backyard, but lost the scent when the dog reached the street.",
      "Who Was Investigated for Elizabeth Smart's Abduction?",
      "As police began searching for leads, they looked into Ed Smart and his two brothers, David and Tom Smart, who are Elizabeth's uncles.",
      "Ed Smart recalled his reaction after his now-ex-wife, Lois Smart, told him that law enforcement did not believe he had nothing to do with their daughter's disappearance.",
      "\"I was overwhelmed to the point that I was shaking and couldn\u2019t stop shaking,\" he says in the documentary.",
      "Ed Smart added that the scrutiny on him and his brothers also had the negative effect of fewer people wanting to help the effort to find Elizabeth.",
      "After the police found nothing suspicious among the family, the spotlight turned to Richard Ricci, a contractor who had been in a dispute with Ed Smart after doing work on the family's home. Ricci had a criminal past and was brought in for questioning.",
      "He vehemently denied having anything to do with Smart's abduction in interrogation footage seen in the film.",
      "On July 24, 2002, police said someone tried to break into the home of Smart's cousin, using a similar method to the break-in at the Smarts' home. Ricci was in jail at the time, and Mary Katherine Smart says in the documentary that she knew Ricci was not the man in the room that night.",
      "Ricci died from an aneurysm in his prison cell while Elizabeth was still missing.",
      "How Did Police Identify Elizabeth Smart's Abductor?",
      "Weeks after Smart's abduction, Mary Katherine Smart said she remembered a name associated with the man's voice she heard that night: Immanuel.",
      "The girls had met the man while he was preaching on the street in Salt Lake City months earlier, and he had done work on the Smarts' home. According to the book \"In Plain Sight: The Startling Truth Behind the Elizabeth Smart Investigation\" by Lee Benson and Tom Smart, Lois Smart saw Mitchell begging for money on the street and handed him money and her husband's phone number, in case he was willing to work. He worked for five hours at the Smarts' home.",
      "The family ultimately released the sketch to the crime show \"America's Most Wanted,\" which led a man to call Ed Smart's brother, Tom Smart, and say the man in the sketch might be his brother-in-law, Brian David Mitchell.",
      "What Happened to Elizabeth Smart After She Was Abducted?",
      "In the documentary, Smart describes her horrific treatment at the hands of Mitchell after being taken into the mountains into a tent by him and his wife, Wanda Barzee.",
      "\"I remember feeling like my doom was approaching,\" Smart said in the documentary. \"He said, 'I hereby seal you to me as my wife before God and his angels as my witnesses.'\"",
      "Smart screamed and was told if she screamed again, he would kill her. She said Mitchell then raped her in the tent, which continued throughout her captivity.",
      "\"I had gone from never even holding a boy\u2019s hand to being raped every day, multiple times a day,\" she said in the film.",
      "She remembered not even knowing the difference between consensual sex and rape at the time.",
      "\"I felt a lot of shame, and I felt like I was filthy. I felt like if my family knew what happened to me, would they still want me back?\" she said. \"Maybe it would be better if nobody ever found me.\"",
      "Smart said in the film that Mitchell also walked her around like a dog and forced her to drink alcohol until she vomited.",
      "\"More than anything, he loved power,\" she said. \"He loved feeling like he was in control.\"",
      "She also reflects on questions on why she didn't try to escape or alert others when Mitchell and Barzee took her to Salt Lake City for excursions.",
      "\"The thought of crying out did cross my mind, but I was 14, (and) I had been extremely abused for months,\" she said. \"When I disobeyed, I was raped. I did have food withheld from me. So when I made my bid for freedom, I wanted it to be a sure thing.\"",
      "How Was Elizabeth Smart Rescued?",
      "Smart had a few close calls before she was ultimately found. She said in the documentary that at one point she, Mitchell and Barzee were looking at maps in a Salt Lake City library when a homicide detective approached them and wanted to ask some question.",
      "Smart was in a long, white robe with a face covering, and Mitchell refused to let the detective pull it down, saying it was against their religion. The detective accepted the explanation and walked away.",
      "A nightclub patron described seeing the trio at a Salt Lake City establishment, where Barzee and Smart were dressed in the same white robes with face coverings.",
      "Smart also recalled another moment in which she could faintly hear her name being called in the woods, when searchers were presumably yelling out for her. She said Mitchell threatened to kill her if she tried to answer them.",
      "After being taken to a location outside San Diego, Smart said she convinced Mitchell to return them to Salt Lake City, so they took a bus to Sandy, Utah.",
      "On March 12, 2003, a person called local police saying they believed they had just seen Elizabeth Smart walking on the street after recognizing Barzee and Mitchell from the \"America's Most Wanted\" episode.",
      "Police cars pulled up alongside Smart, Barzee and Mitchell. After separating Smart from her captors, they asked if she was Elizabeth Smart.",
      "\"My captors were just right there,\" she said. \"I was terrified. I needed the safest answer I could possibly give.\"",
      "When the officers asked if she was Elizabeth Smart, she responded, \"If thou sayeth,\" confirming it was her.",
      "She was now 15 years old and had been missing for nearly 300 days.",
      "What Happened to Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Barzee?",
      "Smart's rescue was not the end of her ordeal, as the court case involving Mitchell and Barzee dragged out until 2010.",
      "Mitchell was sentenced to life in prison on kidnapping and sexual assault charges, NBC News reported at the time, while Barzee received a 15-year sentence after pleading guilty to assisting the kidnapping and was given credit for seven years she had already served.",
      "Barzee was released from prison in 2018. Smart begged prison officials to reconsider.",
      "Barzee, 79, was arrested in May 2025 for visiting two parks in Salt Lake City, which she cannot do because of her status as a sex offender.",
      "Where Is Elizabeth Smart Today?",
      "Smart, 38, has become an advocate for survivors of sexual violence and a child safety activist through her work with the Elizabeth Smart Foundation.",
      "She also wrote a book about her harrowing experience, \u201cMy Story,\u201d which was released in 2013. Smart marked 20 years since being rescued in 2023.",
      "She also is a married mother of three children with husband Matthew Gilmour.",
      "\"I have good days, I have bad days, but I developed a better relationship with myself,\" she says in the documentary. \"My inner voice has changed from, 'You should\u2019ve done this,' or, 'You could\u2019ve done that,' to, 'You'll make it through this, you can finish this, you\u2019re strong, keep going. You can survive anything that comes your way.'\""

      "For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family. The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into. Recently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they\u2019ll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade. But I believe the truth always comes out.",
      "My parents have been trying endlessly to ruin my relationship since before my wedding, and it hasn\u2019t stopped. My mum cancelled making Nicola\u2019s dress in the eleventh hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress. Weeks before our big day, my parents repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe me into signing away the rights to my name, which would have affected me, my wife, and our future children.

Both of our parents had their own tables equally adjacent to ours.",
      "The night before our wedding, members of my family told me that Nicola was \u2018not blood\u2019 and \u2018not family.\u2019 Since the moment I started standing up for myself with my family, I\u2019ve received endless attacks from my parents, both publicly and privately, that were sent to the press on their orders. Even my brothers were sent to attack me on social media, before they ultimately blocked me out of nowhere this last Summer. My mum hijacked my first dance with my wife, which had been planned weeks in advance to a romantic love song. In front of our 500 wedding guests, Marc Anthony called me to the stage where the schedule was planned to be my romantic dance with my wife but instead my mum was waiting to dance with me instead. She danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone. I\u2019ve never felt more uncomfortable humiliated in my entire life. We wanted to renew our vows so we could create new memories of our wedding day that bring us joy and happiness, not anxiety and embarrassment.",
      "My wife has been consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we\u2019ve tried to come together as one. My mum has repeatedly invited women from my past into our lives in ways that were clearly intended to make us both uncomfortable.",
      "Despite this, we still travelled to London for my dad\u2019s birthday and were rejected for a week as we waited in our hotel room trying to plan quality time with him. He refused all of our attempts, unless it was at his big birthday party with a hundred guests and cameras at every corner. When he finally agreed to see me, it was under the condition that Nicola wasn\u2019t invited. It was a slap in the face. Later, when my family travelled to LA, they refused to see me at all.",
      "My family values public promotion and endorsement above all else. Brand Beckham comes first. Family \u2018love\u2019 is decided by how much you post on social media, or how quickly you drop everything to show up and pose for a family photo opp, even if it\u2019s at the expense of our professional obligations. We\u2019ve gone out of our way for years to show up and support at every fashion show, every party and every press activity to show \u2018our perfect family.\u2019 But the one time my wife asked for my mum\u2019s support to save displaced dogs during the LA fires, my mum refused.",
      "The narrative that my wife controls me is completely backwards. I have been controlled by my parents for most of my life. I grew up with overwhelming anxiety. For the first time in my life, since stepping away from my family, that anxiety has disappeared. I wake up every morning grateful for the life I chose, and have found peace and relief.",
      "My wife and I do not want a life shaped by image, press, or manipulation. All we want peace, privacy and happiness for us and our future family."

      "This week marks a new era as Sheinelle Jones and Jenna Bush Hager debut the new fourth hour: TODAY with Jenna & Sheinelle.",
      "Though it's only just begun, a steady stream of well-wishers and guests have already dropped by Studio 1A to congratulate the new duo, including Kathie Lee Gifford, Hoda Kotb and legendary talk show host, Oprah Winfrey.",
      "Winfrey joined Jenna and Sheinelle to talk about \u201cEnough: Your Health, Your Weight and What It\u2019s Like to Be Free,\u201d a new book co-written with Ania M. Jastreboff, MD, about the science and myths behind obesity.",
      "Before getting underway, however, Winfrey first gave Sheinelle a congratulatory hug saying, \"Love, love, love\" before sitting in on the morning chat.",
      "In addition to those encouraging words, Winfrey tells TODAY.com that she has another affirmation to pass along to Sheinelle as she embarks on the latest chapter of her life.",
      "\u201cLive the dream. You have to allow yourself to move, to lean into living the dream,\u201d the OWN founder said in a one-on-one interview with TODAY.com. \u201cMy affirmation is, \u2018Live the dream.\u201d",
      "And does Winfrey think that\u2019s what Sheinelle is doing?",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s doing.\u201d",
      "The sit-down was full circle for Sheinelle who told TODAY.com ahead of Winfrey's appearance that the aptly dubbed \"Queen of All Media\" has long been on the \"Mount Rushmore\" of journalists she deeply admires.",
      "\"On my Mount Rushmore of Oprah and Maria Shriver, there are names that you may not know. Allison Payne, Carole Simpson, who was the first one woman of color I ever saw on television,\" Sheinelle said.",
      "When told that she's now on the \"Mount Rushmore\" of other aspiring journalists, Sheinelle said that the idea \"blows her mind.\"",
      "\"I haven't pictured myself on a Mount Rushmore. I feel that is earned,\" she said. And while she may not necessarily be ready to join the ranks of her heroes, she does feel that with everything she's been through, she's earned her \"stripes.\"",
      "\"When you think of a veteran or someone in the military, and they come in a room and they have their stripes, there's an aura to them, there's a wisdom to some of them, especially some of the great generals. And the stripes that they have, you can't take that away from them. You can't take their journey away from them,\" Sheinelle said.",
      "\"What I will give myself now is with everything I've been through and everything I've done to earn this spot in my career, I do believe that I have stripes. You can't see them, but I know they can't be taken away.\"",
      "While some of those stripes have been earned along her career path, they've also come from tremendous personal loss.",
      "In May of this past year, Sheinelle's husband of 18 years, Uche Ojeh, died from an aggressive form of brain cancer, followed by the passing of her beloved \"Grandmama,\" Josephine Vonceal Pace Brown in December.",
      "\"I'm not a general in the military, but I am a general in life at this point,\" she said of what she's been through.",
      "Even so, she's also ready to embrace this pivotal moment in her career. A moment Sheinelle said she's been pursuing since elementary school and cites one of her favorite quotes, which, unsurprisingly, comes from Winfrey.",
      "\"God has bigger dreams for you than you can dream for yourself,\" said Sheinelle. \"Well, I've hit that mark now where I feel like the dream for me if bigger than I dream for myself.\"",
      "As for what lies ahead, Sheinelle said for perhaps the first time in her life, she's not entirely sure.",
      "\"I don't think think it's by accident that this is happening to me right now. I really don't. It makes me a little anxious and I still don't know why things happen the way they do,\" Sheinelle said.",
      "\"But I feel so clear in this moment that this is where I need to be right here, right now.\""

      "\u201cHe\u2019s a big fan. He slid into my DMs,\u201d Pratt joked Jan. 15 on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d",

      "\u201cWe go in, and I\u2019m with the filmmakers, the writer and some of the producers, as we meet the pope, his holiness,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re speaking in Italian and Latin, and it\u2019s all so ornate, and beautiful. And we sit down. And then he even said, \u2018Do you want to have a moment to speak privately?\u2019\" Pratt recalled.",
      "\u201cIt was unreal,\u201d he added.",
      "Pratt said the other filmmakers had already met the pope \u2014 a Chicago native born Robert Prevost who is the first American-born pontiff \u2014 so he was hoping for some quality time of his own with Leo.",
      "\u201cI felt a little bad about saying like, \u2018Beat it, nerds. I want the pope for myself\u2019\u201d he joked.",
      "\u201cBut he said, \u2018You don\u2019t have to feel bad. If you want to have this private moment, we can.\u2019 ... I was like, \u2018I only get one chance. Yes, that would be, that\u2019d terrific.\u2019 So these guys speaking Italian, I can\u2019t speak Italian ... and they leave.\"",
      "The pope's next words surprised Pratt.",
      "\"They left, and he goes, \u2018Alright, enough with the Italian,'\" Pratt recalled. \"And he just sits down. And I was like, \u2018Whoa, you became an American all of a sudden!' It was awesome!\u201d",
      "Kimmel then asked about what Pratt would be willing to divulge about one of his upcoming films.",
      "\u201cIf the pope asked you if Star Lord was going to be in the next \u2018Avengers: Doomsday\u2019 movie, would you tell him?\u201d Kimmel asked.",
      "\u201cI would have to tell him,\u201d Pratt said.",
      "\u201cBut you won\u2019t tell me,\u201d Kimmel responded.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not quite the pope, Jimmy,\u201d Pratt quipped.",
      "Pratt's time in the Vatican overlapped with TODAY's own Carson Daly. Carson went to Rome in December 2025 when friend Michael Bubl\u00e9 performed at the Vatican\u2019s \u201cConcert with the Poor.\" Amid the visit, during which Carson and wife Siri asked Pope Leo to bless their children, the TODAY co-host ran into Pratt.",
      "\"Coincidentally, Chris and I have attended the same Catholic parish in California: St. Monica\u2019s, where I was baptized, went to elementary school, was confirmed and served Mass,\" Carson wrote in an essay for TODAY.com about the experience. \"We chatted with Chris and the crew and can\u2019t wait for the film to come out in 2026, coinciding with the 400th anniversary of the inauguration and dedication of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica.

      "This chapter is a dream realized for Sheinelle, who grew up in Wichita, Kansas, and imagined herself sitting behind an anchor desk as far back as elementary school. She created a vision board on her childhood bedroom wall made up of photos of local newscasters, which she hung beside affirmations her mother jotted down on Post-Its, long before vision boards were even a thing.",
      "By the time she reached high school, Sheinelle was interning at a local news station and continued to pursue broadcasting as a student at Northwestern University. It was there she had a chance meeting with Uche Ojeh, a high school senior who was visiting campus with his father.",
      "Though Sheinelle wasn\u2019t a tour guide, she became one that day, offering to show the \u201ccute\u201d student around. She didn\u2019t know at the time that she\u2019d go on to marry him and raise together three children, Kayin, 16, and twins Clara and Uche, 13.",
      "What she also couldn\u2019t have known was that the unusual stutter Ojeh developed in October of 2023 was the result of an aggressive form of brain cancer that ultimately took his life in May of last year.",

But considering what I\u2019ve been through, it\u2019s more than a reality show. You wouldn\u2019t even believe it.\u201d",

Those who know me best know that I don\u2019t share much if anything publicly on social media, but lately, something has sparked in me (ok \u2014 yes credit to #HeatedRivalry). I realized it is finally time to share a journey I have kept close to the vest for a long time.\u201d",
      "Kortuem said he grew up in Minnesota as the youngest of four boys.",
      "\u201cAs a young teenager, I carried a weight that did not seem to fit into that world, and I lived in a constant state of dichotomy. I loved the game, but I lived with a persistent fear,\u201d he shared. \u201cI wondered how I could be gay and still play such a tough and masculine sport.\u201d",
      "He said his younger self never thought that coming out was possible as a professional hockey player. \u201cComing out in the 2000s did not feel like an option, especially with so little positive representation in the media at the time and it would have been a social disaster at such a large high school. At 17, I walked away from the high school team and the brotherhood of hockey friendships I had developed from a young age for a myriad of reasons,\u201d he explained.",
      "After stepping away, he returned to hockey and played \u201cat a high level\u201d in New York and Atlanta. He said people in his life knew he was gay, but he didn\u2019t speak about his sexuality with his teammates.",
      "\u201cOn the outside, I was still a top-tier player. On the inside, I was still that kid in Minnesota hiding,\u201d he recalled. \u201cLike many closeted athletes, revealing who I truly was to my team would change everything in an instant, their opinion of me, could bring negative attention to the team with the \u2018gay player\u2019, so I never took the chance.\u201d",
      "He remembered changing the subject if the other players mentioned their wives, and he always told them he was single. But he \u201creached a breaking point in 2017\u201d after he signed up to play in a gay sporting event.",
      "\u201cThis tournament would prove to be a paradigm shift. I met a group of guys from across the US and Canada (Las Vegas Boyz) who were hockey players like me and were also gay,\u201d Kortuem said. \u201cFrom that moment forward, my life has never been the same. It has been a long, vulnerable road to move past the closeted athlete persona (something I\u2019m still working on today) and find actual peace through the friendships I have developed through hockey in Vancouver (Cutting Edges), Toronto (Misfits), and across the US.\u201d",

For this reason, the theater didn\u2019t sell popcorn, either.",
      "And in case you\u2019re wondering, no, that theater no longer exists \u2014 it went out of business in the 1970s and was demolished in 2014.",

      "\u201cToday years old when I realized others didn\u2019t have pickles at the movies,\u201d commented one person.",
      "Why Do Some Movie Theaters Sell Pickles?",
      "We can add movie theater pickles to Germany\u2019s innovation list alongside BMW, gummy bears and aspirin.",
      "Per Garden and Gun, a 1957 article in The Dallas Morning News traced pickles in theaters back to Germany, noting that Germans eat \u201cnot only during intermissions,\u201d but chowed down on \u201clarge hunks of bread, knackwurst, pickles, mustard, and other tidbits\u201d during the show, too.",

      "In letters sent Friday to various world leaders, Trump said the body would \u201cembark on a bold new approach to resolving global conflict,\u201d according to a copy of the letter posted to the website of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Other media outlets quoted from the same letter received by other leaders.",
      "A source close to French President Emmanuel Macron told NBC News that at this stage, he \u201cdoes not intend to give a favorable response\u201d to the invitation, citing major questions over respect for the U.N. and whether the board might specifically act as a rival to the Security Council, the U.N.\u2019s most powerful body, created in the wake of World War II.",
      "In a separate statement, Macron\u2019s office said the board\u2019s charter \u201cgoes beyond the sole framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.\u201d",
      "Trump responded by threatening late Monday to hit French wines and Champagnes with 200% tariff, apparently in an effort to pressure Macron to change his stance and join his board.",
      "The Kremlin also demurred about Putin\u2019s invitation. \u201cWe are currently studying all the details of this proposal, including hoping to contact the American side to clarify all the nuances,\u201d spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists Monday.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he had been invited and that his diplomats were working on it.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Orb\u00e1n and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, labeled \u201cEurope\u2019s last dictator,\u201d have also said they received the letter from Trump. Orb\u00e1n said he \u201caccepted this honorable invitation,\u201d and Lukashenko formalized his country\u2019s ascension to the board Tuesday, Belarus\u2019 Foreign Affairs Ministry said on X.",
      "The list of those invited to participate runs to nearly two dozen, including countries as diverse as Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Canada and Australia, and it helps shine a light on the structure and remit of Trump\u2019s plan for Gaza\u2019s postwar governance, bringing the next phase of the U.S.-negotiated ceasefire into sharper focus.",
      "But in Israel, the plan has already been criticized by ultranationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who said Monday that it was time to explain to Trump that \u201chis plan is bad for the State of Israel and to cancel it,\u201d according to The Associated Press.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took a more diplomatic line, telling lawmakers that there were differences with the U.S. about the composition of the advisory committee accompanying the next phase in Gaza but that it would not harm his relationship with Trump, according to the AP.",
      "Netanyahu said early Wednesday that he had agreed to join the board.",
      "Israeli politicians have been highly critical of Trump\u2019s inclusion of diplomats from Qatar and Turkey on a separate advisory committee that will play a strong role in Gaza\u2019s administration. Both, which have also been invited to the Board of Peace, have strained relationships with Israel after its two-year war in Gaza. Netanyahu said Monday that no soldiers from those countries would be allowed into the Palestinian enclave.",
      "Another neighbor, the United Arab Emirates, said it had accepted the invitation Tuesday.",
      "In a statement Saturday, Netanyahu\u2019s office said that the Gaza executive committee was \u201cnot coordinated with Israel and is contrary to its policy\u201d and that he had instructed Foreign Minister Gideon Saar to contact Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "In the months since the U.N. Security Council approved Trump\u2019s ceasefire plan for Gaza, the White House\u2019s original concept appears to have broadened, and the board\u2019s new charter does not mention the enclave.",
      "Asked about the omission, a White House spokesperson said that board members would work \u201cto secure enduring peace in Gaza and around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is an issue of on-the-ground diplomacy and leverage, not creating some global cosmic superstructure,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based think tank. Trump\u2019s plan, he said, is \u201ctethered to a galaxy far, far away, not to the realities here on planet Earth.\u201d",
      "The charter also says Trump will serve as the inaugural chairman of the executive board who will vote on proposals put before it. \u201cSuch decisions shall go into effect immediately, subject to veto by the Chairman at any time thereafter,\u201d it says.",
      "The price tag, along with the board\u2019s guaranteed American dominance, might make membership a tough sell, Miller said.",
      "\u201cIf you sign up for the \u2018Board of Peace,\u2019 you will be aligning yourself with Trump\u2019s vision,\u201d said Miller, who worked closely on Middle East peace negotiations during his decades as an American diplomat. \u201cAdding a billion-dollar entry fee as if this is getting a seasonal membership at Mar-a-Lago has created the sense that this is not serious.\u201d"

      "Whether by overthrow or old age, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, will soon need a replacement, and this latest nationwide eruption has only drawn the question of his successor into sharper focus.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to look for new leadership in Iran,\u201d President Donald Trump told Politico in an interview Saturday.",
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian forcefully rejected any suggestion of Khamenei's removal Sunday, warning on X: \u201cAn attack on our country\u2019s Supreme Leader is equivalent to a full-scale war with the Iranian people.\u201d",
      "But the unrest has highlighted the complex divisions within Iran's ruling clerical regime and security forces, as well as within its opposition.",

      "Leaderless unrest",

      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark \u2014 On a cold, foggy afternoon in downtown Copenhagen, military veteran Flemming Almind joined thousands of his fellow Danes in what he said was the first protest he\u2019s ever participated in, opposing the Trump administration\u2019s push to acquire Greenland.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve actually never done this before, demonstrating, but this is very important to me,\u201d Almind, 57, told NBC News. He said he had been following developments and felt \u201cI need to do something.\u201d",
      "An estimated 10,000 Danes gathered in the city hall square Saturday afternoon to express their frustration with President Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric.",
      "The crowd, which included parents with small children as well as older Danes, wore hats in the style of Trump\u2019s MAGA caps but scrawled with \u201cMake America Go Away,\u201d and waved Greenlandic flags and signs saying, \u201cHands off Greenland.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to support Greenland,\u201d said protester Susanne Kristensen. \u201cWe are Danes, Greenland are Danes, even though they\u2019re Greenlanders, and we just have to stick together.\u201d",
      "Some protesters expressed fears that if they spoke out about Trump in the press or on social media, his administration could bar them from visiting the United States while he was in office. \u201cI won\u2019t go there until he\u2019s out,\u201d Kristensen said.",
      "The protest came just before Trump announced fresh tariffs on Denmark and its allies, a step that has infuriated European leaders and threatens to reignite a trade war that was meant to have been settled with a deal signed by Trump months ago.",
      "A bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation, intending to express solidarity with the country in the face of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, was meanwhile wrapping up a visit to the Danish capital, where it met with the Danish prime minister and key Danish and Greenlandic officials.",
      "The visit by the group of 10 American lawmakers from both the House and Senate has not gone unnoticed, with the protesters saying they were closely following the developments. \u201cIt makes a huge difference that Congress members come here and listen,\u201d Kristime Due, who was attending the protest in Copenhagen, told NBC News.",
      "The delegation\u2019s visit was arranged on short notice and has played an almost counterprogramming role to the statements the Trump administration has been making. Trump\u2019s desire to own a part of the Danish kingdom is all over the airwaves in Danish news broadcasts, and Danes say it\u2019s a constant conversation.",
      "\u201cThis is a respectful and constructive delegation that came more to listen than to talk,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters on Saturday.",
      "\u201cOne thing that\u2019s been made clear to us is that the people of Denmark are very anxious, are quite concerned, and the people of Greenland even more so,\u201d Coons said, adding that the current tone of statements from the White House is \u201cnot constructive.\u201d",
      "Coons said the delegation is \u201chaving active conversations amongst ourselves about what is the wisest course of action\u201d to de-escalate the rhetoric when they return to Washington, but some members of the delegation do not want to rush into a hasty symbolic vote that could fall along party lines.",
      "\u201cI worry that going to a specific legislative vehicle right now today is premature,\u201d Coons said.",
      "\u201cWe cannot allow this to become a partisan matter. We simply cannot,\u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said. \u201cI think the way that we keep it from being partisan is by full education, dismissing some of the assumptions that some may have and then acting together,\u201d she added.",
      "The members of Congress met with members of the Danish Parliament on Friday, with the Social Democrats\u2019 foreign affairs spokesman, Flemming M\u00f8ller Mortensen, describing the discussion as \u201cfruitful\u201d and \u201cintense.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe feel frightened,\u201d Mortensen said. \u201cEspecially the people living in Greenland, both adults but also youngsters and kids, and that was also a part of what their Greenlandic colleagues [were] expressing today.\u201d",
      "Aaja Chemnitz, who is one of two Greenlandic representatives in the Danish Parliament, said that the \u201cuncertainty is really taking a toll\u201d on her people.",
      "\u201cGreenland is not for sale,\u201d Chemnitz said. \u201cSo what is on the table for the U.S. side right now is not interesting for us, and you can\u2019t buy a country.\u201d",
      "Pipaluk Lynge, a member of the Greenlandic Parliament, traveled to Copenhagen to participate in the meeting.",
      "\u201cIt was really important for us to tell them from our own voice, because we know how it is back home,\u201d Lynge said. \u201cThe children are worried; the adults are not sleeping.\u201d",
      "Both sides stressed Denmark\u2019s willingness for more U.S. military presence in Greenland.",
      "The U.S. has one military base in the Arctic territory, which has formed a core part of missile early-warning systems dating back to the Cold War. The base, which houses a small number of troops compared to thousands at its peak, was transferred to the U.S. Space Force in 2019, during the first Trump administration.",
      "While the Trump administration\u2019s push to take Greenland has started to fray the decades-old alliance between the U.S. and Denmark, some are concerned about the broader impact on NATO if it moves to seize an ally\u2019s territory.",
      "\u201cIf the United States were to carry out any of the current threats against Greenland, it would sever NATO,\u201d Coons told NBC News in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d",
      "The Danes are keenly aware of how the alliance between the two countries has seen sacrifices in the past.",
      "\u201cIn Afghanistan and Iraq, Danes were actually serving alongside the American soldiers, and Denmark lost, per capita, a lot of soldiers,\u201d Almind, the military veteran, said at the protest in Copenhagen. \u201cLooking back, you have to ask yourself, was it all worth it?\u201d",
      "While Danes are hopeful that the U.S. delegation\u2019s support will resonate once they return to Washington, some are skeptical they can convince the president to change his mind when he seems determined to acquire Greenland at any cost.",
      "Danish protester Else Hatmann said the delegation contained \u201conly two [Republicans] who Trump don\u2019t even listen to.\u201d",
      "Murkowski, a frequent holdout who Trump earlier this month said \u201cshould never be elected to office again,\u201d pushed back against that sentiment, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think that the absence of Republicans is because they don\u2019t care about this issue.\u201d",
      "The other Republican on the trip, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., has become an outspoken critic of Trump since he announced he would not run for re-election, but avoided interacting with reporters during the press events the delegation held."

      "BEIJING \u2014 One of the most popular new apps in China poses an awkward question: \u201cAre you dead?\u201d",
      "An app by that name has gone viral as a digital \u201ccheck-in\u201d aimed mainly at the growing number of young people living alone in China\u2019s sprawling cities. The idea is to designate an emergency contact person, who will be alerted if a user goes a few days without confirming their well-being on the app.",
      "The app, which was free when it launched last May but now costs 8 yuan ($1.14), was the most downloaded paid app in Apple\u2019s App Store for China in recent days \u2014 though after its viral popularity, it appears to have since disappeared from the Chinese App Store under unclear circumstances.",
      "The app describes itself as a personal safety assistant, \u201cwhether you are a professional living solo, a student studying far from home, or anyone choosing an independent lifestyle.\u201d",
      "Ian Guo, one of the founders, told NBC News he was surprised by the success of the app, which cost less than $150 to make and is now valued at around $15 million.",
      "He said he and his two co-founders, who like him are members of China\u2019s \u201cpost-95 generation,\u201d were inspired by social media commenters who said this was something they needed.",
      "\u201cWe saw this opportunity and asked ourselves if we could quickly launch a product,\u201d Guo said. But they also believed the app \u201ccould truly provide people with more security and protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cI personally lived alone in Shenzhen for a long time, so I understand the various problems one faces when living solo,\u201d he said, adding that the sense of loneliness and insecurity \u201cis constant.\u201d",
      "Though the concept may sound morbid, the app\u2019s popularity is a reflection of demographic changes in China, where urbanization, falling marriage rates and long work hours have left many feeling isolated.",
      "By 2030, China \u2014 a nation of 1.4 billion people \u2014 could have 200 million one-person households, according to the state-backed Global Times newspaper, which cited real estate research institutions.",
      "The app\u2019s name in Mandarin, \u201cSi Le Ma,\u201d appeared to be a play on the name of one of China\u2019s most popular food delivery apps, \u201cE Le Ma,\u201d which means \u201cAre You Hungry?\u201d Some found its emphasis on death too dark, and the app has now been renamed Demumu, which Guo said was \u201ccuter.\u201d",
      "\"\u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 sounds more like a joke,\" says Lisa Li, a 23-year-old English teacher. \"But Are You Alive? sounds like you\u2019re rising from the dead, and that would be even weirder.\"",
      "Li, 23, said she found the app \u201ca bit absurd.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be afraid that if I were forgetful and missed a check-in, people would actually think I\u2019m dead,\u201d she said.",
      "She said she thought most people were downloading the app out of curiosity. \u201cSome people really do worry that if they die, no one will find them,\u201d she added, pointing to a recent string of highly publicized cases of young Chinese professionals, particularly at tech companies, dying suddenly after long periods of intense work.",
      "Cui Xiyue, an exhibition planner in Beijing, said she downloaded the app when she was \u201cgoing through a period of depression and mental health issues.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust getting through a single day back then wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Cui, 23.",
      "\u201cWhen I first got it, I checked in every day, but I didn\u2019t stick with it for very long,\u201d she said. \u201cI probably don\u2019t need it anymore, because I\u2019ve stopped thinking about those dark things.\u201d",
      "Loneliness has long been a concern for older people in China, where more than one-fifth of the population is over 60. When younger family members migrate from rural areas to cities, they are often left behind.",
      "But social isolation is also a problem for young Chinese, who are increasingly reluctant to get married and have children amid the rising cost of living and competition for jobs.",
      "Yuying Tong, a sociology professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said she thought the app would be helpful for young people living alone.",
      "\u201cOf course, to some extent they are joking, it\u2019s more sarcastic,\u201d said Tong, co-director of the university\u2019s Centre for Chinese Family Studies. On the other hand, she said, the app could lead people to reflect on their single life.",
      "Some commenters on Chinese social media were skeptical of the app\u2019s usefulness.",
      "\u201cDo people really use apps like this? If I get busy and forget to check in, wouldn\u2019t I end up \u2018dying\u2019 every other day?\u201d read one comment on Weibo.",

      "Iran has a grim history of crushing dissent, but the latest crackdown dwarfs anything seen during the repressive Islamic theocracy\u2019s 47 years in power, evidence trickling out of Iran suggests.",
      "Human rights activists say at least 2,500 people have been killed since protesters took to the streets last month, initially in a show of anger against rising prices and a faltering economy.",
      "\u201cThis crackdown is more intense because the scope of the protests is more widespread, playing out at the same time in big cities but also remote areas in central and western Iran,\u201d said Cl\u00e9ment Therme, a nonresident fellow at the International Institute for Iranian Studies, a nongovernmental organization based in Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s major geopolitical rival in the region.",
      "Since widespread demonstrations in 2022, the regime's goal \u201chas been to diffuse fear,\u201d both through killing protesters and executing prisoners, he said.",
      "Even the partial picture of what\u2019s happening inside Iran suggests something on a different level than past repression. The Human Rights Activists News Agency, a nonpartisan Virginia-based organization that relies on supporters inside Iran to track the protests and monitor deaths, says that demonstrations spread to all of the country\u2019s 31 provinces.",
      "The bloody reprisals against protesters are the culmination of decades in which the regime\u2019s \u201cpropensity and ability to use violence\u201d have only increased, said Rouzbeh Parsi, an adjunct lecturer at Sweden\u2019s Lund University. The reason for that is the twin fear of \u201cexternal pressure\u201d and \u201cdomestic hatred\u201d converging, he said.",
      "Some 19,000 people have been arrested, according to HRANA, which says its data comes from on-the-ground sources and goes through multiple internal checks. Iran\u2019s top judge has suggested that there needs to be rapid trials and executions to restore order.",
      "Eyewitness accounts are scant, and those who do report on the situation usually do so anonymously for fear of reprisals.",
      "A video geolocated by NBC News was posted online last weekend showing scores of bodies piled outside a makeshift morgue near Tehran. The scene is punctuated by screams and wails as people converge at the site in search of missing loved ones amid the chaos of the demonstrations. Another video verified by NBC News appears to show security forces firing automatic weapons at demonstrators, the shots echoing through the streets.",
      "Though the internet has now been down for more than a week, Iranians have been able to make some international calls. In calls to The Associated Press earlier this week, Iranians described a heavy security presence on the streets and light foot traffic despite shops reopening.",
      "The diaspora news outlet Tehran Bureau, founded by  journalist Kelly Golnoush Niknejad, who was born in Iran and went to college in America, said witnesses described \u201cwar-like conditions across multiple neighborhoods,\u201d with  \u201cactive battlefields\u201d including \u201cfirearms, military weapons, and sustained clashes.\u201dThe regime uses drones to \u201cidentify gatherings, followed by rapid deployment of forces,\u201d it said.",
      "That surveillance tallies with what Samira Mohyeddin, an Iranian-Canadian journalist, said she was told by a friend\u2019s daughter from the southern Mazandaran province.",
      "Posting a video on X of the conversation in Persian, Mohyeddin recounted that there was \u201cblood on the streets\u201d with drones and riot police maintaining order, and shops forced to close at 4 p.m. She said there had been no clashes in the past two days.",
      "The Iranian regime has decades of precedent for using violence to suppress its opponents, dating back to its foundation.",
      "In 1979, a popular revolution involving students and oil workers toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, an autocratic ruler bolstered by a CIA-backed coup in 1953, and whose SAVAK secret police imprisoned and tortured opponents.",
      "But into that vacuum stepped not a democratic government, but a hard-line Shia theocracy headed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.",
      "Throughout the 1980s, Khomeini\u2019s regime began what\u2019s now referred to as a reign of terror against his opponents. In 1988, at least 5,000 political prisoners were forcibly disappeared, executed and dumped in mass graves, according to Amnesty International and other human rights groups.",

      "Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested on the spot in July 2022 after fatally firing at Abe with a homemade gun while he was delivering a campaign speech in the western city of Nara. Abe, the country\u2019s longest-serving premier, was 67.",
      "A guilty verdict was all but certain after Yamagami admitted to killing Abe in the first court hearing at the Nara District Court in October, and attention had been on the severity of the sentence.",
      "Prosecutors sought a life sentence last month, calling the act an \u201cextremely grave incident that is unprecedented in post-war history.\u201d",
      "Although he was no longer Japan\u2019s leader at the time, Abe remained a powerful and binding force within the governing Liberal Democratic Party.

      "Abe\u2018s killing also brought to light a deep link between his party and the Unification Church, an organization many consider a cult. An in-party investigation found that more than a hundred lawmakers had dealings with the group, leading many voters to shun the LDP, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-war period.",
      "Media have quoted Yamagami as telling the court that he held a grudge against the Unification Church after his mother\u2019s large donation to it caused financial hardship for their family, and that he took out his anger on Abe because the former prime minister had once sent a video message to an event held by a group affiliated with the church.",
      "Founded in South Korea in 1954, the Unification Church is famous for its mass weddings and counts Japanese followers as a key source of income.",
      "Yamagami\u2019s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that the family\u2019s misfortune caused by the donation to the Unification Church should be taken into consideration and that his prison term should be limited to 20 years at most.",
      "While Abe was a divisive figure domestically, he was among the few global leaders to have a strong rapport with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Abe was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after his 2016 election victory, and the two went on to forge a close bond over rounds of golf in the United States and Japan. Prime Minister Takaichi has repeatedly referenced their friendship in her own dealings with Trump."

    "story": [
      "Going into this week\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the White House\u2019s top science and technology adviser, Michael Kratsios, signaled some chilly conversations with European leaders may lie ahead on the topic of artificial intelligence and the way it is regulated.",
      "\u201cI will continue to point out to my tech minister counterparts the ways they can create a regulatory environment to allow AI to thrive,\u201d Kratsios told NBC News, \u201cto make sure they\u2019re not getting ahead of themselves with overburdening regulations, like the EU AI Act, which are an absolute disaster.\u201d For Kratsios, the Trump administration\u2019s light-touch approach to AI regulation is the winning formula.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been an A-B test for decades on how you lead in technology, and it\u2019s very obvious what the recipe is,\u201d said Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and one of the nation\u2019s leading artificial intelligence advisers.",
      "\u201cWe put out probably the most robust, most substantive vision of a pro-innovation AI strategy in the world,\u201d Kratsios said, referencing the White House\u2019s AI Action Plan released in July. \u201cEverywhere we travel, when I meet my fellow tech ministers, they\u2019re all using our language and are all talking about their own AI action plan.\u201d",
      "The administration\u2019s roadmap to American AI dominance, the AI Action Plan is divided into three main sections \u2014 innovation, infrastructure and international diplomacy and security. The blueprint emphasizes the reduction of \u201cred tape and onerous regulation\u201d that \u201cunnecessarily hinder AI development or deployment\u201d by rolling back rules and guidance at various federal agencies, many of which were initiated by President Joe Biden\u2019s 2023 executive order on AI.",
      "Though Kratsios might not be a household name, he wields significant influence over the nation\u2019s technological and economic future. Kratsios is a D.C. policy veteran, having overseen all research and development efforts at the Pentagon as undersecretary of defense before moving to the White House to serve as the nation\u2019s chief technology officer during the first Trump administration. A key figure in America\u2019s ongoing AI infrastructure buildout and efforts at the intersection of AI and education, Kratsios spoke to NBC News to reflect on the country\u2019s AI progress at the administration\u2019s one-year mark, and outline his designs for the months ahead.",
      "Kratsios, 39, cut his teeth in the world of private industry, spending much of his early career at Thiel Capital, a venture capital firm founded by Silicon Valley stalwart Peter Thiel. White House AI czar David Sacks and senior policy adviser on AI Sriram Krishnan, also longtime Silicon Valley venture capital magnates, work closely with Kratsios to shape America\u2019s AI agenda.",
      "Eager to encourage the adoption of American AI technology at home and abroad, Kratsios does not mince words about what he sees as bungled approaches to AI policy and stifling overreaches by international bodies.",
      "\u201cThe Action Plan very definitively turned the page on AI doomerism and hostility towards AI innovation that had been the hallmark of the Biden administration,\u201d Kratsios said. \u201cThe president was very clear during the first couple days of the administration that we had to turn that page and create a plan that would ensure the U.S. leads the world in AI.\u201d",
      "Kratsios is clear that the Trump administration\u2019s vision clashes with regulatory structures that have become increasingly visible in the European Union.",
      "The European Union\u2019s AI Act, which Kratsios criticized, imposes varying requirements on AI companies based on the risk posed by their products. The broadest risk evaluation and reporting requirements affect companies like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, whose powerful foundational models are most likely to present severe or \u201csystemic risks\u201d to society.",
      "\u201cThere are so many countries out there that consistently speak about the importance of having an AI economy and an AI ecosystem and making sure that their citizens can actually enjoy the benefits of AI,\u201d Kratsios told NBC News. \u201cWe want to be the enabler for that.\u201d",
      "Following an executive order in late July, the Department of Commerce in October unveiled a core element of this agenda with a new program to turbocharge American AI exports. Kratsios views this American AI Export Program as one of his focuses for the coming months and outlined key components of the new push.",
      "Kratsios said the program will seek to offer a tailored approach to exporting hardware and software based on a specific country\u2019s AI needs. \u201cWe want to make it as easy as possible for countries around the world to buy our stack and import our stack,\u201d Kratsios said, revealing the Development Finance Corporation and Export Import Bank will provide financing mechanisms for countries to buy a piece of America\u2019s AI ecosystem.",
      "\u201cWe have the very best chips, we have the very best models, we have the very best AI applications. And we want to deliver those solutions to countries around the world so that they can actually benefit from them,\u201d said Kratsios.",
      "In a growing rivalry over global AI dominance, some observers see China as having an edge in diffusing its AI products to other countries. Kratsios sees the Export Program as a key mechanism to entice other countries to use American technology in their pursuit of sovereign AI systems. Kratsios said more details about the program will be announced at February\u2019s AI Impact Summit in India.",
      "Kratsios has long been interested in AI, having led the establishment of the American AI Initiative during Trump\u2019s first administration. Between the two Trump administrations, Kratsios worked in a leadership position at Scale AI, a top data annotation company that received a $14.3 billion investment from Meta.",
      "Kratsios places the federal government\u2019s \u201cGenesis Mission\u201d effort to apply AI to critical scientific problems, announced in November, at the heart of the administration\u2019s push for AI-enabled innovation.",
      "\u201cGenesis Mission is the largest marshaling of federal scientific resources since the Apollo mission towards a scientific endeavor,\u201d Kratsios said, noting the effort\u2019s goal of harnessing the federal government\u2019s vast resources and stores of scientific data for AI. \u201cWe\u2019ve also seen an incredible amount of demand and enthusiasm from a lot of our partners and allies around the world.\u201d",
      "Over the coming year, Kratsios said Americans can expect to see the creation of a separate \u201cclosed AI platform\u201d for the initiative, as Department of Energy official Dar\u00edo Gil builds out the Genesis Mission\u2019s physical infrastructure.",
      "Beyond the crown jewel of the Genesis Mission, Kratsios says he champions the role of the federal government in encouraging scientific discovery, rejecting any perceived incongruity between the administration\u2019s approach to America\u2019s scientific funding and its embrace of AI.",
      "\u201cWe as a scientific enterprise today spend almost a trillion dollars per year in research and development, and the vast majority of that, around 70%, is done by the private sector,\u201d Kratsios said. \u201cIf one myopically looks singularly at federal research and development dollars and doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re part of a larger ecosystem, then they\u2019re obviously not going to reap the benefits the American people deserve.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2019I\u2019m very proud, and this was even in the president\u2019s funding request to Congress, that the areas that are most important to the national agenda, like AI and quantum, were preserved and even plussed up in the budget,\u201d Kratsios said.",
      "Some computing research advocates worry that cuts to the larger scientific R&D ecosystem could harm AI innovation, even if AI research funding is held steady. Last week, a Senate committee working on upcoming federal spending bills pushed back on President Trump\u2019s proposed 22% cut to scientific funding and instead floated a 4% reduction in science financing compared to 2025 spending levels.",
      "The Senate\u2019s counterproposal includes a small increase in funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which houses critical federal efforts to evaluate and assess how leading AI models function, an effort Kratsios said \u201ccan be a tremendous unlock to private sector adoption of AI.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s budget requests a $325 million reduction from NIST\u2019s $1.5 billion spending in 2025, citing NIST\u2019s support for \u201ca radical climate agenda,\u201d though it is unclear if these budget cuts would impact NIST\u2019s work on AI.",
      "Kratsios highlighted a recent push to create a new federal framework for AI policy as another key AI win for the private sector and smaller American AI companies, though many advocates of AI oversight remain skeptical that a federal law will sufficiently replace existing state laws.",
      "\u201cCreating a patchwork of AI laws where 50 different states all have different goals is ultimately going to hurt little tech and startups more than anyone else,\u201d Kratsios said, echoing a refrain from Silicon Valley venture capitalists like Marc Andreesen.",
      "President Trump\u2019s executive order from December charged Kratsios, alongside AI czar David Sacks, with preparing legislative recommendations for \u201ca uniform Federal policy framework\u201d that overrides state laws going against the administration\u2019s AI goals. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be working very hard over the next year on that framework,\u201d Kratsios said."

      "The body was discovered by two men who spotted a pack of about 10 dingoes surrounding it, Police Inspector Paul Algie told reporters.",
      "\u201cI can confirm there was markings on her body consistent with having been touched and interfered with by the dingoes,\u201d he said.",
      "Algie said that it was too early to confirm how the woman died and that it was also possible she had drowned while swimming off K\u2019gari, the world\u2019s largest sand island. Her body was found near the Maheno shipwreck, a popular tourist attraction.",
      "There was no suggestion that the woman, who had been working at a tourist accommodation on the island for about six weeks, was unwell at the time of her death, Algie said. The cause of death should be determined by Wednesday.",

      "He warned the public to avoid approaching dingoes, a protected native species at K\u2019gari, a World Heritage-listed national park. Though it is rare for them to attack humans, a group of dingoes almost killed a 23-year-old jogger in the same area in 2023.",

      "\u201cWe know that Harry\u2019s various legal issues and trials have been the primary cause of the breakdown in the relationship between Charles and Harry,\u201d NBC News\u2019 royal contributor Daisy McAndrew said in an interview on Monday. \u201cI think a lot of people within the royal family and outside will be hoping that once these court battles are over, Harry can turn his attention to reconciling with his family,\u201d she added.",
      "This time around, Harry will be joined by Elton John and his husband, David Furnish, actors Sadie Frost and Elizabeth Hurley and former lawmaker Simon Hughes in his case against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), the publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday newspapers.",
      "Baroness Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen Lawrence was murdered in a racist attack in 1993, will also join the claimants. Her inclusion has been seen by some as significant because the Daily Mail campaigned for a long time to bring her son\u2019s killers to justice, famously naming five people as his murderers on its front page. When two of the men, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were eventually convicted, the paper was praised for its coverage.",
      "The group\u2019s lawyers have accused ANL of \u201cgrave breaches of privacy\u201d and alleged that the newspaper group commissioned private investigators to unlawfully target their clients, tapped and hacked their phones, and obtained private medical and financial records through deception, chiefly between 1993 and 2011.",
      "Associated Newspapers Limited has strenuously denied the allegations. Asked for comment ahead of the trial on Thursday, the company referred NBC News to a previous statement issued in 2024 that called the claims \u201cpreposterous and without foundation.\u201d It added that its defense submission said \u201cthe case brought by the Prince and others is \u2018an affront to the hard-working journalists whose reputations and integrity, as well as those of Associated itself, are wrongly traduced.\u2019\u201d",
      "Unlike Lawrence, Harry is no stranger to this kind of litigation, having successfully sued Mirror Group Newspapers in 2023 and last year received \u201csubstantial damages\u201d and an apology after settling a claim against News Group Newspapers, the publisher of The Sun.",
      "Both companies have paid out tens of millions of dollars to multiple claimants including celebrities, politicians and ordinary people after it emerged that some of their journalists and private investigators employed by their newspapers were hacking into phones and intercepting voicemails in the early 2000s.",
      "Until now, however, Associated Newspapers Limited has not been sued for phone hacking, which, if proved, \u201cwill reshape the story of modern British journalism,\u201d according to media lawyer Mark Stephens.",
      "\u201cHarry and his team characterize this as the last major test of the untouchable corner of the British press,\u201d Stephens, who works at the London-based law firm Howard Kennedy LLP, said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cIt asks whether a major U.K. publisher has been operating in the shadows or is genuinely clean,\u201d he added, referring to the fact that allegations of this nature have not been made against the Daily Mail or Mail on Sunday before.",
      "The claimants, he said, will be relying on a \u201cmosaic of inferences\u201d that, in their totality, will need to demonstrate that \u201cmore probably than not\u201d phone hacking and unlawful information gathering did occur.",
      "It is unlikely that a settlement will be reached before the start of the trial, he said. \u201cI think if it was going to settle, it would have done so by now,\u201d he added. \u201cNo newspaper will want to have the scrutiny of this and would have settled if they thought they didn\u2019t have a decent case.\u201d",
      "Whatever the outcome, NBC News\u2019 royal contributor Emily Nash said that once he ends his legal battles, Harry might be able to patch up relations with his family, which became strained after he quit front-line royal duties in 2020, along with his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, before they moved to California.",
      "\u201cMembers of the royal family traditionally use the maxim \u2018Never complain, never explain,\u2019 but they do pursue legal action if they feel they\u2019ve been wronged,\u201d she said in a video call Monday. \u201cWhat they tend to do, though, is do it in a far more low-key manner,\u201d she added. \u201cThey will settle out of court rather than have their personal information brought up in a public domain.\u201d",
      "Another source of contention has been Harry\u2019s legal battle to have his police protection reinstated when he visits the U.K. The decision to strip him of publicly funded protection was made by the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures, known by the acronym RAVEC, which approves security for the royals and VIPs, such as the prime minister.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "After he lost a legal challenge to that ruling in May, Harry told the BBC that it was not safe to bring his family back to the U.K. because he could not guarantee their protection.",
      "His father would not speak to him \u201cbecause of this security stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI would love reconciliation with my family. There\u2019s no point in continuing to fight anymore,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer my father has.\u201d",
      "Harry, who is expected to testify on Thursday, met with Charles for the first time in 19 months in September, and if he does come to London for the case, it is unlikely they will reconcile, as Charles will be in Scotland for his traditional post-Christmas stay, which typically lasts for most of January.",
      "Either way, it is unclear what will be required for the pair to patch things up, according to McAndrew, NBC News\u2019 royal contributor.",
      "Harry\u2019s brother, Prince William, and Charles \u201cwill want some sort of guarantees that Harry will stop talking, ironically, to the press or writing books or doing documentaries and putting his side of the story out there in a way that impacts and sometimes detrimentally harms the rest of the royal family,\u201d she said."

      "A 12-year-old boy is in critical condition after being bitten by a shark in Sydney Harbour, officials said Monday.",
      "The boy was jumping off rocks with friends near what is known as Shark Beach in the eastern Sydney suburb of Vaucluse when he was attacked Sunday afternoon by what officials believe was a bull shark, leaving him with severe injuries to both legs.",
      "\u201cHe is in for the fight of his life now, and the actions of emergency services yesterday gave him that chance,\u201d Joseph McNulty, commander of the New South Wales Police Marine Area Command, told reporters.",
      "The attack comes after days of heavy rain that filled the Australian city\u2019s iconic saltwater harbor with the freshwater that bull sharks favor.",
      "\u201cWe believe the combination of the brackish water, the freshwater, the actions of the splashing may have made that perfect storm environment for that shark attack yesterday,\u201d McNulty said.",

    "story": [
      "Has Europe had enough?",
      "After more than a year of cautious diplomacy, high-stakes flattery and efforts to keep trans-Atlantic cooperation intact, European leaders now find themselves confronting perhaps the sharpest challenge yet from the White House.",
      "President Donald Trump said Saturday he will impose sweeping new tariffs on eight key European allies that will ratchet up unless Denmark agrees to hand over Greenland, resurrecting one of his most provocative foreign policy obsessions as he threatens the territory of a NATO ally.",
      "The ultimatum marks the latest escalation in a pattern that has seen Europe repeatedly forced onto the back foot during Trump\u2019s second administration, weighing economic and security ties with the U.S. against a White House increasingly willing to weaponize trade against its closest partners.",
      "But this time the response has been sharper.",
      "European leaders moved quickly to convene an emergency meeting on Sunday, condemning the tariff threats as unacceptable and warning of serious consequences for trans-Atlantic relations.",
      "The episode has raised fresh questions about how much longer Europe is willing to absorb pressure from Washington in the name of a NATO alliance that appears to be bursting at the seams.",
      "Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland are facing new 10% tariffs until \u201ca Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,\u201d the U.S. leader said Saturday, with duties increasing to 25% if a deal is not reached by June 1.",
      "It is a familiar position for European leaders, who spent much of last spring negotiating with Washington as Trump sought to reshape global trade through tariffs. The U.S. already has a framework agreement with the European Union capping tariffs at 15%, alongside a separate deal with the U.K. limiting duties to 10%.",
      "Trump did not say whether the newly threatened tariffs would override those agreements or be imposed on top of them.",
      "But the latest threats have drawn signs of fatigue and impatience with the U.S., as European leaders, long reluctant to confront Trump directly, appear newly united in defending Denmark\u2019s territory and pushing back against what they see as an unacceptable escalation.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has often acted as an intermediary between Washington and Europe in the effort to bring an end to the war in Ukraine, while the U.K. was the first nation to strike a deal to reverse or cut some of Trump\u2019s earlier tariffs.",
      "But Starmer said Saturday that Trump\u2019s plans to impose tariffs on European allies were \u201ccompletely wrong,\u201d a rare departure from what had appeared to be a policy of U.S. appeasement that has drawn criticism from lawmakers in his own country.",
      "\u201cApplying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will of course be pursuing this directly with the U.S. administration.\u201d",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, who has recently issued dire warnings about the collapse of U.S.-Europe relations, said \u201cno amount of intimidation\u201d will persuade European nations to change their course on Greenland. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson warned the E.U. would not be \u201cblackmailed\u201d by Trump, while Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said \u201cthreats have no place among allies.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement, the eight nations threatened with tariffs said Sunday that \u201ctariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response,\u201d the statement said, ahead of an emergency E.U. meeting.",
      "Trump has stood firm in his belief that the U.S. requires Greenland for its national security, and has repeated assertions that Russia and China will try to seize Greenland otherwise.",
      "\u201cThere is not a thing that Denmark can do about it,\u201d Trump wrote, referring to Danish defense capabilities as \u201ctwo dogsleds as protection.\u201d",
      "European allies, for their part, argue that any security threats to Greenland should be handled together. Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen will visit Norway, the U.K. and Sweden over the next five days, the ministry said Sunday, noting that the main topic will be the security situation in the Arctic.",
      "\u201cWhat our countries have in common is that we all agree that NATO\u2019s role in the Arctic must be strengthened, and I look forward to discussing how,\u201d a statement said.",
      "The president\u2019s latest threat has called into question the European strategy of \u201cbuttering up Mr. Trump,\u201d Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, told NBC News on Sunday, noting Trump\u2019s latest threats had escalated the situation from \u201cslingshot to bazooka.\u201d",
      "Even if European nations were able to come to some kind of agreement with Trump, he told NBC News, \u201che\u2019s well known for changing his mind or unleveling the playing field, and this is what they have to understand.\u201d",
      "Bociurkiw said Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who announced lower tariffs with China last week after meeting with its leader Xi Jinping, had done the \u201csmart thing\u201d by going to Beijing and \u201crisking the ire of Mr. Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt shows that he\u2019s acting unilaterally,\u201d he added. \u201cI think that\u2019s the way Europe needs to go.\u201d",
      "While Europe has trodden carefully with Trump in part to avoid upsetting negotiations over the war in Ukraine, his ultimatum over Greenland \u201cmakes no difference at all\u201d to that calculation, one analyst told NBC News, because \u201cnobody had any faith in the United States\u201d to deliver.",
      "\u201cThe confirmation that the U.S. does not have a common security vision with Europe doesn\u2019t change the position of Ukraine,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cThe threats and promises that we hear from Europeans warning the U.S. that this could mean the end of NATO are ineffective because this is not something which the current U.S. leadership group values,\u201d he added.",
      "The defense of Ukraine, he said, \u201crelies on Europe recognizing its responsibility, rather than any role the U.S. might previously have had.\u201d",
      "In a sign that the two disputes could end up entangled, however, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez warned Sunday that a U.S. invasion of Greenland \u201cwould make Vladimir Putin the happiest man in the world.\u201d"
