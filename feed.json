      "Hollywood megastar Tom Hardy has reunited with director Guy Ritchie 17 years after \u201cRocknRolla\u201d for a new TV series, \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tom Hardy has collected troves of knowledge and skill throughout his journey as an actor, forming a megastar career. But any education he received from director Guy Ritchie during their time on the 2008 \u201cRocknRolla\u201d film was gained from afar.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have very much to do with him ... the first time I worked with him. Gerard (Butler) was leading that film and in many elements, we were support staff,\u201d said Hardy. \"So, I got to experience being on the Guy Ritchie set, and it was a bit from a position of not being a lead, and that\u2019s a different responsibility.\u201d",
      "But time can bring people and experiences back around, especially in Hollywood. Since that film 17 years ago, Ritchie has transitioned into esteemed directorial status. And Hardy has morphed into a box office superstar with films like \u201cThe Dark Night\u201d as the imposing villain Bane, and the titular role for Marvel\u2019s \u201cVenom\u201d franchise. Now, the two have reunited for Ritchie\u2019s gritty, yet sophisticated series \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really keen to go back and work with him because he\u2019s a fellow Brit and he\u2019s done quite incredible work,\u201d explained Hardy. \u201cI wanted to go and play with him, actually, and see what that was like now I\u2019m older, and it was good fun.\u201d",
      "The Paramount+ original series follows Harry Da Souza (Hardy), an intimidating, yet calm fixer for a London-based crime family hoping to find the missing son of a rival faction to prevent a catastrophic gang war.",
      "How did Hardy prepare to play such a menacing, yet even-keeled character?",
      "\u201cNo acting required\u201d he said with a big laugh. \u201cJust turn up and, \u2018Oh, yeah, that makes sense\u2019 and say the lines. Don\u2019t bump into the furniture.\u201d",
      "The second episode of the 10-part \u201cMobLand\u201d series airs Sunday on Paramount+.",
      "The series was created by Ronan Bennett, known for popular crime shows like \u201cThe Day of the Jackal\u201d and \u201cTop Boy,\u201d and written with playwright Jez Butterworth. Ritchie serves as executive producer and directed the first two episodes. The \u201cMobLand\u201d idea began as a spinoff from Showtime\u2019s popular \u201cRay Donovan\u201d series, before becoming a stand-alone show.",
      "Two-time Oscar-winner Helen Mirren stars as the devious Maeve, matriarch and manipulator of the crime family, while Pierce Brosnan plays her husband and mob leader, marking a reunion for the pair who worked on the 1980 film \u201cThe Long Good Friday.\u201d",
      "It may be hard to think of a role that Dame Mirren hasn\u2019t played, but she found one with \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are always characters out there that are going to take you by surprise and \u2026 I think, \u2019Oh my god, I\u2019ve never done anything like that before,\u201d said the \u201c1923\u201d star who believes the line between shooting film and TV is now nearly nonexistent. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the sort of beauties of my job, actually, is to constantly be entering into such very, very different worlds.\u201d",
      "Mirren said the opportunity to work with Hardy was intriguing.",
      "\u201cTom\u2019s involvement in it was one of the reasons I signed up because I\u2019ve admired his work over many years,\u201d Mirren said. \u201cDifferent actors, you can see, \u2019Oh, they\u2019re a great actor' \u2026 they can perform. But certain actors like Tom, it\u2019s an interior power that just communicates with the camera. And Tom\u2019s got that. You know what? It\u2019s called star power.\u201d",
      "The \u201cMobLand\u201d cast features Paddy Considine of \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d fame, Joanne Froggatt, Lara Pulver, Anson Boon and Mandeep Dhillon. While this show technically reunites Mirren and Brosnan, they also shot the upcoming \u201cThe Thursday Murder Club\u201d film prior to this project.",
      "While much was unknown when Brosnan signed on, \u201cMobLand\u201d had all the right ingredients for the former James Bond to dive in, starting with Ritchie, who released his Netflix series \u201cThe Gentlemen\u201d last year.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s naughty. He\u2019s cheeky. He\u2019s bold,\u201d said Brosnan. \u201cI love his work. His movies. The way he\u2019s acquitted himself on the landscape of cinema. He\u2019s a unique talent all his own \u2026 so I said yes. I wanted to go back to London. I wanted to work.\"",
      "Next for Hardy is the crime drama film \u201cHavoc\u201d premiering later this month, and there's chatter of a potential sequel to his 2015 \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d A second season of \u201cTaboo\u201d is on the way \u2014 nearly a decade after its debut. What about a \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cVenom\u201d crossover? Hardy addressed the rumors that an alleged project fell apart, clarifying it was never in the works.",
      "\u201cPeople embellish a story. I just said I would have loved to work with \u2018Spider-Man,\u2019 but it never happened, which is a fact. It hasn\u2019t happened. And I\u2019m no longer working with \u2018Venom\u2019 \u2026 it is a shame because my kids would love to watch Venom and Spider-Man together,\u201d said Hardy. \u201cI would have liked that.\u201d",

      "A young actor\u2019s suicide in South Korea",
      "SEOUL -- A young actor\u2019s suicide in South Korea. Allegations of an underage relationship. They are part of a growing drama in the Asian entertainment world that raises questions about society\u2019s treatment of celebrities in crisis, with harsh media and online commentary amplifying their lowest moments.",
      "This week, South Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun publicly denied allegations that he dated the late actor Kim Sae-ron when she was under the age of sexual consent. His emotional press conference followed Kim Sae-ron\u2019s suicide in February, which reignited allegations that they were romantically involved.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the case.",
      "Kim Sae-ron was once one of South Korea's most promising film stars. She began acting at age 9 in the 2009 film \u201cA Brand New Life,\u201d which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. She gained further recognition with \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d (2010) and \u201cA Girl at My Door\u201d (2014), also invited to Cannes.",
      "Her career halted in May 2022 after she crashed her car in Seoul while driving under the influence. Despite offering a public apology and reportedly paying compensation to shops that lost power because of the crash, she faced relentless negative attention.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: In South Korea, callers can receive 24-hour counseling through the suicide prevention hotline 1577-0199, the \u201cLife Line\u201d service at 1588-9191, the \u201cHope Phone\u201d at 129 and the \u201cYouth Phone\u201d at 1388.",
      "___",
      "Media and online commentators scrutinized her personal life. YouTube gossip channels accused her of exaggerating financial difficulties and questioned her sincerity. Critics, and her family, say it contributed to her declining mental health.",
      "She killed herself on Feb. 16, Kim Soo-hyun's birthday.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun, 37, also has been one of South Korea\u2019s most recognized actors, known for dramas such as \u201cMy Love from the Star\u201d (2013) and \u201cQueen of Tears\u201d (2024) as well as films like \u201cThe Thieves\u201d (2012) and \u201cSecretly, Greatly\u201d (2013).",
      "Speculation about a relationship with Kim Sae-ron began last year when she posted a photo of them together, quickly deleted. Gold Medalist, the agency co-founded by Kim Soo-hyun, denied the relationship, according to South Korean media.",
      "Days after Kim Sae-ron\u2019s death, a YouTube channel known for its politically charged content, HoverLab, alleged that she and Kim Soo-hyun had been in a six-year romantic relationship beginning in 2015, when she was 15 and he was in his late 20s. The channel released what it called evidence including photos, videos and letters. Kim Soo-hyun has called them fabricated.",
      "Kim Sae-ron\u2019s family had approached HoverLab to release the materials, calling it an attempt to restore Kim Sae-ron\u2019s image.",
      "On March 27, a lawyer representing Kim Sae-ron\u2019s family presented to journalists what the family claimed was a photo of an undelivered letter written in 2024 in which Kim Sae-ron described Kim Soo-hyun as her \u201cfirst and last love\u201d and referenced a five-to-six-year relationship.",
      "The letter was written after she failed to reach Kim Soo-hyun to discuss a debt she owed his agency, according to the lawyer. After Kim Sae-ron's contract ended and wasn't renewed, the agency asked her to pay back 700 million won (about $520,000) in damages related to her drunk-driving case. Her family says the demand placed severe pressure on her.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun has acknowledged that he dated Kim Sae-ron but insisted their relationship began after she became an adult. He called claims of an underage relationship false and damaging.",
      "\u201cIt is also not true that the deceased made a tragic choice because of my avoidance (of her), or because my agency pressured her about debt,\" an emotional Kim told Monday\u2019s press conference.",
      "He refused to answer a question from the AP about when he first met Kim Sae-ron.",
      "Whether any laws were broken depends largely on timing. South Korea raised its age of sexual consent from 13 to 16 in 2020. Kim Sae-ron was born in 2000, and the family alleges the relationship began in 2015, when she was 15 and Kim Soo-hyun was 27.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun maintains that their relationship lasted from summer 2019 to fall 2020, when Kim Sae-ron was a legal adult.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun's agency has taken legal action against the family of Kim Sae-ron and HoverLab, which first aired the underage relationship claims, for distributing private photos and videos of the actor, including images of Kim Soo-hyun kissing the late actor. Kim\u2019s agency said Kim Sae-ron had visited his apartment and his family was present. The agency said they were not dating at the time.",
      "On Monday, Kim Soo-hyun's lawyer announced a civil lawsuit seeking 12 billion won (approximately $8.15 million) in damages against the YouTube channel and Kim Sae-ron's family, along with criminal complaints alleging defamation and violation of privacy laws. Kim Soo-hyun and his agency also sued the YouTube channel operator for stalking.",
      "The family\u2019s legal representative and HoverLab both told the AP on Wednesday that they plan to sue Kim Soo-hyun and his agency for making false claims about his relationship with the late actor.",
      "Kim\u2019s death reignited criticism of South Korea\u2019s relentless tabloid and digital media culture. Her family has singled out videos with speculative, unverified content portraying her as emotionally unstable and morally questionable.",
      "Suing for defamation is often a lengthy, costly battle for South Korean celebrities, as many platforms, like YouTube, are based overseas. Punishments are typically light, with fines or suspended sentences.",
      "Other high-profile cases following negative online attention have included the deaths of K-pop singers Sulli and Goo Hara in 2019 and \u201cParasite\u201d actor Lee Sun-kyun in 2023.",
      "Fashion brand Prada has ended its collaboration with Kim Soo-hyun. South Korean cosmetics company Dinto terminated its one-year contract with him, citing the seriousness of the controversy. 7-Eleven Taiwan canceled a Kim Soo-hyun fan event last month, citing schedule changes.",
      "An online petition this week calling for the age of consent to be raised from 16 to 19 has gathered nearly 40,000 signatures on the National Assembly\u2019s website.",
      "Suggested reforms in South Korea meant to discourage harsh online comments have not been passed.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- The U.S. State Department revoked the visas of members of a Mexican band after they projected the face of a drug cartel boss onto a large screen during a performance in the western state of Jalisco over the weekend.",
      "U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who was U.S. ambassador to Mexico during the first Trump administration, said late Tuesday on X that the work and tourism visas of members of Los Alegres del Barranco were revoked.",
      "The visa revocations follow widespread outrage in Mexico over the concert as prosecutors in two states have launched investigations into the projected images, and a larger national reckoning over how to address the rise of a popular musical genre criticized for romanticizing drug cartels.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in freedom of expression, but that doesn\u2019t mean that expression should be free of consequences,\u201d Landau wrote on X. \u201cThe last thing we need is a welcome mat for people who extol criminals and terrorists.\u201d",
      "The controversy broke out over the weekend when the face of Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \"El Mencho\" Oseguera layered over flames was projected behind the band, originally hailing from Sinaloa, during the concert. Finger pointing ensued among the band, concert producers and the venue.",
      "Oseguera is the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has been connected to a ranch authorities say was used to train cartel recruits and possibly dispose of bodies in Jalisco, where searchers found human bone fragments, heaps of clothing and shoes.",
      "The Jalisco cartel is among other criminal groups in Mexico that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "While the image was met by applause during the concert, Jalisco prosecutors quickly announced they were summoning the band to testify in an investigation into whether they were promoting violence, a crime which could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison. The state of Michoacan also announced an investigation into the Los Alegres del Barranco for projecting the same images during a concert in the city of Uruapan.",
      "Jalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus said that the state would ban musical performances that glorify violence, adding that violators would \u201cface monetary and criminal sanctions.\u201d",

      "Since, a number of the band's future shows have been cancelled, one town's government saying that the show \u201cdidn't have the municipal permissions needed\u201d to carry out the performance.",
      "Pavel Moreno, the band's accordion player and back-up singer, didn't respond to questions by fans asking if his visa had been revoked, simply thanking them for support and saying that \"everything is fine.\u201d",
      "The band was scheduled to play in Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 4. While the event hasn't been publicly cancelled, ticket sales websites read: \u201cNo tickets available for now on our site\" for that date.",
      "The dispute coincides with a larger cultural debate in Mexico as artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano usher in a global renaissance of Mexican regional music, by mixing classic ballads with trap music. In 2023, Peso Pluma beat Taylor Swift out as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "Many of the artists now topping the charts have come under fierce criticism because their lyrics often paint cartel leaders as Robin Hood-esque figures. Others say that the genre, known as \u201cnarco corridos\u201d, expresses the harsh realities of many youths across Mexico.",
      "A number of Mexican states have banned public performances of the music in recent years, the most recent being the state of Nayarit in February. Some of the bans have come as famed artists have received death threats from cartels, forcing a number of them to cancel their performances.",
      "Others, including Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, have sought a less aggressive approach to addressing the genre. Sheinbaum, who has come out against censoring the music, has suggested instead that the Mexican government push forward initiatives that promote Mexican regional music with more socially acceptable lyrics.",
      "The Mexican leader did harden her language on the topic following the Los Alegres del Barranco concert. In her morning news briefing this week, Sheinbaum demanded an investigation into the concert, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t justify violence or criminal groups.\u201d",

      "Star lived in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house on a busy street at the edge of downtown. But starting in early January, someone began tampering with the friendly reindeer and his pen.",
      "A person got inside the pen in January, and Star began losing weight. In February, someone cut the locks off the pen's gates and Star wandered downtown streets. The following night, someone sprayed some type of substance into Star's pen.",
      "Earlier, Whitehead shied away from thinking that person might have poisoned Star, but now he doesn\u2019t know.",
      "Star had a persistent cough after the February incidents and then developed pneumonia. It was believed that contents from his stomach were coming up through his nose, and Star breathing that matter back into his lungs caused the pneumonia.",
      "It\u2019s possible Star ate a plastic bag when he was wandering downtown Anchorage, which could cause indigestion problems and chronic weight loss.",
      "He was cured of pneumonia but developed a second bout.",
      "\u201cHe started to recover and then all of a sudden reversed himself, and we decided it was not possible to save him,\u201d Whitehead said. Star was euthanized Tuesday, the same day the necropsy was conducted.",
      "Results won\u2019t be known for a few weeks as to the possible cause of death or contributing factors, Whitehead said.",
      "There has been a pet reindeer housed in downtown Anchorage since the 1950s. This particular Star was the seventh in the line to live with either Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart or Whitehead after he took over for the Stewarts in 2002.",
      "Star, which had his own Facebook page, constantly got visitors to his pen, attracting tourists and locals alike. He got daily walks in downtown Anchorage, was featured in parades, was visited by schoolchildren and even appeared on reality TV shows.",

      "The jokesters' custom has been around for hundreds of years, although its exact birth is difficult to pinpoint. These days, depending on your location, it could be marked with a fish secretly pinned to someone's back or a whoopee cushion or even news reports of flying penguins (yes, that actually happened ).",

      "There are plenty of theories about where this day of pranks and hoaxes came from. It's not clear exactly which one might be true. But what is clear is that April Fools\u2019 Day has roots stretching back hundreds of years.",
      "One idea is that it dates back to France in 1564, when King Charles IX moved the New Year celebration from its weeklong observance beginning March 25 to a celebration on Jan. 1, according to the Library of Congress. Those who forgot or were never told about the change were mocked. Although the library notes that the true history of the New Year is more complicated, as different parts of the country observed it on different days.",
      "A similar theory ties April Fools\u2019 Day to the 1582 change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, according to the library. But it explains that this type of origin story has been used to explain several holidays and may be more of a \u201cmigratory legend.\u201d",
      "And then there's the theory that it could be connected to the March 21 vernal equinox, which is known as a day when people are tricked by unexpected weather changes, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.",
      "Whatever its origin, the first time there was clear documented reference to the day was in 1561 when the Flemish writer Eduard De Dene wrote in his poem about a nobleman sending his servant on pointless tasks, according to the Library of Congress. The servant soon realizes that he has been \u201csent on \u2018fool\u2019s errands\u2019 because it\u2019s April 1,\u201d the library states.",
      "In 2021, then-first lady Jill Biden pretended to be a flight attendant on an airplane traveling from California to Washington. She wore a \u201cJasmine\u201d nametag and passed out Dove ice cream bars while wearing a black mask, black pantsuit and wig. A few minutes later, \u201cJasmine\u201d reemerged without the wig \u2014 revealing herself to be Jill Biden, laughing and proclaiming, \u201cApril Fools!\u201d",
      "Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin became known for announcing outlandish ideas every April Fools\u2019 Day soon after starting their company more than a quarter century ago. One year, Google posted a job opening for a Copernicus research center on the moon. Another year, the company said it planned to roll out a \u201cscratch and sniff\u201d feature on its search engine.",
      "In 1992, NPR 's \u201cTalk of the Nation\u201d program announced that former-President Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974, would be running for president, according to the Museum of Hoaxes. A comedian had impersonated Nixon to say, \u201cI never did anything wrong, and I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d",
      "Outside of the U.S., one of the most notable pranks involved the BBC World Service in 1980 declaring that Big Ben would become a digital clock and renamed Digital Dave, according to the UK Parliament.",
      "From Scotland to Iceland to the U.S., the day is honored in a wide array of ways.",
      "In France, the day is known as poisson d\u2019avril, or \u201cApril Fish,\u201d and has long had a fish-themed pranking tradition. In modern times, it\u2019s become more of a day for children to relish in attaching paper fish to their friends\u2019 backs, Atlas Obscura says.",
      "In Scotland, April Fools' has a history of being a two-day event. April 1 is known as \u201cGowkie Day\u201d or \u201cHunt the Gowk,\u201d explained Encyclopedia Britannica. Gowk is a term used to describe a fool. On April 2, the celebration may become more physical, with children attaching \u201ckick me\u201d signs to people\u2019s backs.",
      "The day is also celebrated in Iceland, with the aim being to get people to \u201chlaupa apr\u00edl,\u201d or \u201cmake an April run.\u201d In other words, to trick someone in a way that makes them travel to a different location. News agencies have also been known to participate in pranking people.

      "For once, things are working out for Wile E",
      "NEW YORK -- For once, things are working out for Wile E. Coyote.",
      "After being shelved by Warner Bros. in 2023, the Looney Tunes film \u201cCoyote vs. Acme\u201d has found a new home. Ketchup Entertainment announced Monday that it acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film for an undisclosed sum.",
      "The deal gives new life to one of the three fully completed films that Warner Bros. elected to take a tax write-off on rather than release. The tactic, which followed a change in leadership at Warner Bros. coming out of the pandemic, was widely disparaged by creatives and fans, alike. The other two shelved movies \u2014 the $90 million DC Studios production \u201cBatgirl\u201d and the animated \u201cScoob! Holiday Haunt\u201d \u2014 remain unreleased.",
      "But \u201cCoyote vs. Acme\u201d will be salvaged from the dustbin. Ketchup Entertainment plans a theatrical release at an unspecified future date.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to have made a deal with Warner Bros. Pictures to bring this film to audiences worldwide,\u201d Gareth West, chief executive of Ketchup Entertainment, said in a statement. \u201c\u2018Coyote vs Acme\u2019 is a perfect blend of nostalgia and modern storytelling, capturing the essence of the beloved Looney Tunes characters while introducing them to a new generation.\u201d",
      "Directed by Dave Green and based on a New Yorker article by Ian Frazier, \u201cCoyote vs. Acme\u201d follows Wile E. Coyote in a lawsuit against Acme Corporation for the many faulty products that failed to catch him the Road Runner. The live-action animated hybrid stars John Cena and Will Forte.",
      "Deadline earlier reported that Ketchup paid about $50 million for the film, which cost $70 million to produce. Ketchup, a distribution company launched in 2012, also recently released another Looney Tunes film jettisoned by Warner Bros.: \u201cThe Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie.\u201d In three weeks of release, it's grossed $8.2 million in domestic ticket sales.",

      "The makers of hit Netflix show \u201cAdolescence\u201d have sparked a conversation on how to protect children from violent misogyny and other harmful content on social media",
      "LONDON -- The makers of hit Netflix show \u201cAdolescence \u201d have sparked a conversation on how to protect children from violent misogyny and other harmful content on social media.",
      "Now they have the ear of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who welcomed the filmmakers to Downing Street on Monday for talks on child protection. Starmer's office said he backed an initiative by Netflix to stream the drama series for free to secondary schools across the country, so that as many children as possible can watch it.",
      "The show, filmed in England, explores the difficult questions that arise when a 13-year-old boy is accused of stabbing a girl in his school to death. It has been watched by more than 66 million people worldwide since it launched earlier in March.",
      "Starmer said it was difficult watching the series with his 14-year-old daughter and 16-year-old son. But showing it widely in schools will \u201chelp students better understand the impact of misogyny, dangers of online radicalization and the importance of healthy relationships,\u201d his office said.",
      "Starmer added in a statement: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a challenge politicians can simply legislate for. Believe me, if I could pull a lever to solve it, I would.\"",
      "Jack Thorne, a co-writer of the show, said the team behind \u201cAdolescence\u201d made it to provoke a conversation.",
      "\u201cSo to have the opportunity to take this into schools is beyond our expectations,\u201d he said. \"We hope it\u2019ll lead to teachers talking to the students, but what we really hope is it\u2019ll lead to students talking amongst themselves.\u201d",
      "Stephen Graham, a co-creator of the drama who stars as the boy's father, has told The Associated Press he wanted the narrative to focus on the seemingly ordinary life of the accused.",
      "He said that when a knife crime among young people takes place, the first reaction may be to question the background of the murder suspect and how they were raised.",
      "\u201cBut what if it's not the family?\u201d he asked, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re all maybe accountable. School. Society. Parents. Community.\u201d",
      "The success of \u201cAdolescence\u201d has come during growing concern over children's use of smartphones and the easy availability of pornography and extreme misogynistic content on social media pushed by influencers like Andrew Tate. Tate and his brother, Tristan, who are dual U.S. and British citizens, face charges of human trafficking and forming an organized criminal group to sexually exploit women.",
      "Gavin Stephens, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, warned last week that \u201cthe harmful effect of Tate is plain to see.\u201d",
      "Police in the U.K. are now dealing with more than a million crimes related to violence against women and girls each year, or a fifth of all recorded crime.",

      "A New Mexico court has cleared the way for the release of investigative records from the deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, as long as depictions of the deceased couple are blocked from view",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- A court on Monday cleared the way for the release of investigative records from the deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, as long as depictions of the deceased couple are blocked from view.",
      "The ruling from a New Mexico judge allows the possible release of redacted police body camera video and other investigative materials, including images of the couple's dead dog. All photos, video and documents from the investigation had been restricted from release by an earlier, temporary court order.",
      "\u201cThere shall be no depiction of either body in any video production\u201d or photographic image of the bodies, Santa Fe-based Judge Matthew Wilson said in response to questions from attorneys on his ruling.",
      "A representative for the Hackman family estate had urged a New Mexico judge to keep the records sealed to protect the family\u2019s constitutional right to privacy.",
      "The partially mummified remains of Hackman and Arakawa were found in their Santa Fe home on Feb. 26, when maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police.",
      "Authorities have said Hackman, 95, died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease about a week after his wife died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is a rare, rodent-borne disease. Hackman may have been unaware Arakawa, 65, was dead.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs, a kelpie mix named Zinna, also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs were found alive. A state veterinary lab tied the dog's death to dehydration and starvation.",
      "Authorities unraveled the mysterious circumstances of the couple\u2019s deaths and described their conclusions at a March 7 news conference without releasing most related written and photographic records.",
      "New Mexico\u2019s open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of dead bodies. Experts also say some medical information is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.",
      "In seeking to block the release of records, estate representative Julia Peters had emphasized the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media. The Hackman family estate also sought to block the eventual release of autopsy reports by the Office of the Medical Investigator and death investigation reports by the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "An attorney for the estate, Kurt Sommer, argued during Monday's hearing that the couple took great pains to stay out of the public light during their lifetimes and that the right to control the use of their names and likenesses should extend to their estate in death.",
      "The bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability.",
      "The Associated Press, CBS News and CBS Studios intervened in the matter. Gregory P. Williams, an attorney for the news outlets, told the judge that they had previously said in court filings that they would not disseminate images of the couple's bodies and would blur images to obscure them from other records.",
      "\u201cThere is certainly a public interest in knowing how their deaths were investigated and knowing how that was handled,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Susan Madore, a publicist who had worked with the Hackmans for years, testified that the couple relished living in Santa Fe because it afforded them anonymity. Hackman retired in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa had no children, while Hackman is survived by three children from a previous marriage.",
      "At Monday's hearing, an attorney for Hackman's son and daughters highlighted the possible traumatic effects of releasing conversations about the deaths within police body camera videos.",
      "Scot Sauder, an attorney for the state medical investigator, told the judge that autopsy reports for Hackman and his wife do not yet exist and won\u2019t include past health care information once completed. It can take months for autopsy reports to be completed.",
      "Privacy likely also will play a role as the couple\u2019s estate is settled. According to probate court documents, Hackman signed an updated will in 2005 leaving his estate to his wife while the will she signed that year directed her estate to him. With both dying, management of the estate is in Peters' hands.",
      "Without trust documents being made public, it\u2019s unclear who the beneficiaries are and how the assets will be divided.",

      "NEW YORK -- In an unexpected upset, the Jason Statham thriller \u201cA Working Man\u201d took No. 1 at the box office, besting the rapidly declining \u201cSnow White,\u201d according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Even after a lackluster debut, the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action remake was predicted to remain the top film in U.S. and Canadian theaters over the weekend. Instead, \u201cSnow White,\u201d plagued by bad buzz and backlash, nosedived in its second weekend and dropped 66%.",
      "At the same time, Amazon MGM Studios\u2019 \u201cA Working Man,\u201d directed by David Ayer, beat expectations with a $15.2 million debut.

      "The bigger headline, though, might have been the fast erosion of ticket buyers' appetite for \u201cSnow White.\u201d The film, directed by Marc Webb and starring Rachel Zegler, had been hoped to lift movie theaters after a painful start to 2025. Produced for more $250 million, the film has turned into a poisoned apple, with a two-week global haul of $143.1 million.",

      "\u201cDeath of a Unicorn,\u201d a horror comedy starring Jenna Ortega and Paul Rudd, portrays a father and daughter who hit a unicorn on the road while they're driving. The movie collected a modest $5.8 million from 3,050 theaters.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Richard Chamberlain, the handsome hero of the 1960s television series \"Dr. Kildare\" who found a second career as an award-winning \"king of the miniseries,\" has died. He was 90.",
      "Chamberlain died Saturday night in Waimanalo, Hawaii, of complications following a stroke, according to his publicist, Harlan Boll.",
      "\u201cOur beloved Richard is with the angels now. He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us,\" Martin Rabbett, his lifelong partner, said in a statement. \"How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul. Love never dies. And our love is under his wings lifting him to his next great adventure.\u201d",
      "Tall, with classic good looks and romantic style, Chamberlain became an instant favorite with teenage girls as the compassionate physician on the TV series that aired from 1961 to 1966. Photoplay magazine named him most popular male star for three years in a row, from 1963-65.",
      "Not until 2003 did he acknowledge publicly what Hollywood insiders had long known, that he was gay. He made the revelation in his autobiography, \"Shattered Love.\"",
      "The actor became known as \"king of the TV miniseries\" in 1978 when he landed the starring role in \"Centennial,\" an epic production 24 hours long and based on James Michener's sprawling novel. He followed that in 1980 with \"Shogun,\" another costly, epic miniseries based on James Clavell's period piece about an American visitor to Japan.",
      "He scored his greatest miniseries success in 1983 with another long-form drama, \"The Thorn Birds,\" based on Colleen McCullough's best-seller. He played Father Ralph de Bricassart, a Roman Catholic priest in Australia who falls in love with beautiful Meggie Cleary (Rachel Ward). The ABC production, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck, reportedly attracted 100 million viewers.",
      "Chamberlain won Golden Globes for his work in \u201cShogun\" and \u201cThe Thorn Birds.\u201d Years earlier, he received one for \u201cDr. Kildare.\u201d",
      "When the public began to lose interest in miniseries, Chamberlain turned to the theater, where he displayed a fine singing voice. He appeared as Henry Higgins in a 1994 Broadway revival of \"My Fair Lady\" and as Captain von Trapp in a 1999 revival of \"The Sound of Music.\"",
      "He reprised his role of de Bricassart in the 1996 TV movie \"The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years.\"",
      "He also appeared in numerous films, including \"The Music Lovers\" (as Tchaikovsky), \"The Madwoman of Chaillot,\" \"The Towering Inferno\" and \"The Three Musketeers\" and its sequels.",
      "The \"Kildare\" series was based on a string of successful 1930s and '40s films that had starred Lew Ayres in the title role.",
      "Chamberlain's hunky, all-American appearance made him an overnight star. Another medical show that debuted the same season, \"Ben Casey,\" also was a smash and made its leading man, the darkly handsome Vince Edwards, a star, too.",
      "The \"Ben Casey shirt\" became a fashion item, both shows' theme songs made the pop Top 40 (the Kildare song performed by Chamberlain himself) and there was even a pop song called \"Dr. Kildare! Dr. Casey! You Are Wanted for Consultation.\"",
      "But in his book, Chamberlain recounted how he was forced to hide his sexuality. He would escort glamorous actresses to movie premieres and other public events at the request of studio executives and dodge reporters' questions about why he had never married with a stock reply: \"Getting married would be great, but I'm awfully busy now.\"",
      "\"When I grew up, being gay, being a sissy or anything like that was verboten,\" he said in an NBC interview. \"I disliked myself intensely and feared this part of myself intensely and had to hide it.\"",
      "The book also described a troubled childhood and an alcoholic father, and Chamberlain said that writing it finally lifted a heavy emotional burden. He also expressed relief that he was no longer hiding his sexuality.",
      "\"I played a cat-and-mouse game with the press. Game over,\" said Chamberlain.",
      "Born George Richard Chamberlain in Beverly Hills on March 31, 1934, the actor originally studied at Pomona College to be a painter. But after returning from the Army, where he had served as an infantry clerk in the Korean War, Chamberlain decided to try acting.",
      "He studied voice and drama, and after appearing in guest roles in a handful of TV shows and in the 1960 film \"The Secret of the Purple Reef,\" he won the Dr. Kildare role.",
      "When \u201cDr. Kildare\u201d was canceled he initially found it difficult to shake the image of the handsome young physician.",
      "He moved to England for a time to find work and hone his acting skills. While there, he appeared in three of director Richard Lester\u2019s films, \u201cPetulia\u201d (1968), \u201cThe Three Musketeers\u201d (1973) and \u201cThe Four Musketeers\u201d (1974). He reunited with Lester in 1989 for \u201cThe Return of the Musketeers,\u201d once more playing Aramis.",
      "In 1969, Chamberlain played the title role in \u201cHamlet\u201d at England\u2019s Birmingham Repertory Company and repeated it in a TV adaptation that appeared on NBC in the United States. He also appeared as Octavius in a film version of \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d which co-starred Charlton Heston and Jason Robards.",

      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments in a South Carolina case over whether states can cut off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood",
      "WASHINGTON -- There are just two Planned Parenthood clinics in South Carolina, but every year they take hundreds of low-income patients who need things like contraception, cancer screenings and pregnancy testing.",
      "The organization has long been at the center of the debate over abortion, but its clinics across the U.S. also provide a range of other services. In South Carolina, Medicaid patients often seek out Planned Parenthood because they often have difficulty finding a doctor who accepts the publicly funded insurance.",
      "A case coming before the Supreme Court from South Carolina on Wednesday could upend that option. That's because the state's Republican governor, Henry McMaster, is pushing to block any public health care dollars from going to Planned Parenthood.",
      "Federal law already prohibits Medicaid money from going to pay for abortions, with very limited exceptions, and South Carolina now bans almost all abortions around six weeks after conception.",
      "\u201cThis case is not about abortion. This case is about general health care,\u201d said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.",
      "Still, Republican leaders in conservative-led states have long said that no public health care dollars should go to an organization that provides abortions, and states should instead be able to direct that money as they choose. A few states already have cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood and more could follow if South Carolina prevails.",
      "\u201cThe people in this state do not want their tax money to go to that organization,\u201d McMaster said.",
      "The Trump administration is joining South Carolina for the arguments on Wednesday, which are playing out against the backdrop of a wider push by abortion opponents to defund Planned Parenthood.",
      "Health care advocates, meanwhile, say the effects of the case transcend abortion. The legal question at its center is whether Medicaid patients can sue over their legal right to choose their own qualified provider.",
      "The American Cancer Society and other public-health groups say in court papers that lawsuits are the only real way that patients can assert those rights. Losing the ability to go to court would hurt their access to care, especially in rural areas.",
      "\u201cIf no one is able to enforce the statute or no one\u2019s willing to enforce the statute at the federal level, then it\u2019s a right on paper only,\u201d said Julian Polaris, a lawyer who regularly advises state Medicaid programs and health care providers. States could also move to restrict access to treatments like gender-affirming care if the court sides with South Carolina, he said.",
      "One in five American women of reproductive age is now enrolled in the Medicaid program, said Heidi Allen, an associate professor at Columbia University. This means that finding providers who can offer quality family planning services \u2014 a requirement for Medicaid \u2014 is crucial for meeting the needs of those patients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that states would eliminate a site of care for politically motivated reasons, \u201cAllen said.",
      "The case stretches back to 2018, before the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to abortion, when McMaster first moved to cut Planned Parenthood funding in a fulfillment of a campaign promise. He signed an executive order removing Planned Parenthood from a list of providers for things like birth control, and sexually transmitted disease testing.",
      "\u201cThere are plenty of good organizations that provide maternal health advice, counseling and care and we need more of those,\u201d McMaster said last week.",
      "His order was blocked in court, but since then judges have ruled in favor of similar moves in Texas and Missouri, said John Bursch, an attorney for the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level, this case is about whether states have the flexibility to direct Medicaid moneys to best benefit low-income women and families,\u201d he said.",
      "He acknowledged that a win for South Carolina could curtail other Medicaid lawsuits, but suggested that could be good for the program overall because it would mean less money going to legal fees. There is also an administrative appeals process available, he said.",
      "\u201cNo one is losing their access to health care clinics,\u201d Busch said. If the state is allowed to cut off Planned Parenthood, Medicaid patients could go to one of 200 other publicly funded health care clinics in the state, he said.",
      "In South Carolina, $90,000 in Medicaid funding goes to Planned Parenthood every year \u2014 a tiny fraction of a percentage point of the state\u2019s total Medicaid spending.",
      "Most counties in the state have already been federally designated as having too few primary care providers, said Amalia Luxardo, CEO of the South Carolina-based Women\u2019s Rights and Empowerment Network. Fourteen of the state\u2019s counties have no practicing OB-GYN physicians and five other counties have just one, she said, meaning many women already have to travel longer distances to find the right provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood has flexible hours and can get appointments scheduled quickly, factors that bring in patients from around the state, she said.",
      "\u201cWe are already in a health care crisis,\u201d said Luxardo, whose group has filed court briefs supporting Planned Parenthood. \u201cAnd when decisions like these negatively impact our constituents, the crisis is going to only increase.\u201d",

      "Mexico says a government-sponsored junk food ban in schools has taken effect as the country tries to tackle one of the world\u2019s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics",
      "MEXICO CITY -- A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world\u2019s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics.",
      "The health guidelines, first published last fall, take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavored peanuts.",
      "Announcing that the ban had become law, Mexico's Education Ministry posted on X: \u201cFarewell, junk food!\u201d It encouraged parents to support the government's crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.",
      "\u201cOne of the core principles of the new Mexican school system is healthy living,\" said Mario Delgado, the public health secretary. \u201cThere's a high level of acceptance of this policy among parents.\u201d",
      "Mexico's ambitious attempt to remake its food culture and reprogram the next generation of consumers is being watched closely around the world as governments struggle to turn the tide on a global obesity epidemic.",
      "In the United States, for instance, the Trump administration\u2019s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has vowed to upend the nation's food system and \u201c Make America Healthy Again \" by targeting ultra-processed foods to curb surging obesity and disease.",
      "Under Mexico's new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying even one black warning logo marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that compulsory front-of-package labeling system in 2020.",
      "Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips,\u201d said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has championed the ban.",
      "Mexico\u2019s children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to UNICEF, which classifies the nation\u2019s childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40% of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports.",
      "\u201cAt my daughter's school, they told us that future activities wouldn't have candy, it would be completely different, with fruit, vegetables and other food that's healthy for kids,\u201d said Aurora Mart\u00ednez, a mother of two. \u201cIt will help us a lot.\u201d",
      "One-third of Mexican children are already considered overweight or obese, according to government statistics.",
      "School administrators found in violation of the order face stiff fines, ranging from $545 to $5,450.",
      "But enforcement poses a challenge in a country where previous junk food bans have struggled to gain traction and monitoring has been lax across Mexico\u2019s 255,000 schools, many of which lack water fountains \u2014 even reliable internet and electricity.",
      "It also wasn't immediately clear how the government would forbid the sale of junk food on sidewalks outside school campuses, where street vendors typically hawk candy, chips, nachos and ice cream to kids during recess and after the school day ends.",
      "\u201cIt will be difficult,\u201d said Abril Geraldine Rose de Le\u00f3n, a child therapist. \u201cBut it will be achieved in the long run.\u201d",

      "A year ago, Sierra Leone's government declared a public health emergency over the cheap synthetic drug called kush",
      "FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- At a vast landfill in Sierra Leone 's capital of Freetown, smoke billows over decades of decomposing waste. Zainab sits there, squinting through the soot. It is her usual spot for buying kush, a cheap synthetic drug ravaging young people in the country.",
      "\u201cThis kush is so addictive,\" she said. \"If I don\u2019t smoke, I feel sick.\u201d",
      "Her current home, a shack of corrugated iron, contains only a tattered mattress where she brings her clients as a sex worker. She uses her income to sustain her drug addiction.",
      "She is one of many women in Sierra Leone who, as a result of social factors that include living conditions and stigma, have not benefited from intervention efforts after the government a year ago declared a public health emergency over rampant kush abuse. The declaration was meant to enforce criminal, public health and prevention measures to reverse the trend in Sierra Leone, as kush spreads to other parts of West Africa. The drug has been seized in Gambia, Senegal and Guinea.",
      "While officials say kush has become scarcer on the streets in Sierra Leone, critics say programs are still underfunded and inadequate.",
      "Despite new criminal, public health and prevention measures, only about 300 people have gone through the country\u2019s official rehab program, according to available data. Most have been men.",
      "Women have been less visible in the crisis. Rights groups say they are historically left out.",
      "Only one in 18 women with drug use disorders receive treatment compared to one in seven men, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The agency said women are usually more vulnerable to gender-based violence, economic discrimination and human rights violations.",
      "The situation is not so different in Sierra Leone where various advocacy groups spoke about how women are not as visible as men in coming forward to receive support and often do not get adequate help. Far more men, though, use drugs compared to women, experts say.",
      "Zainab said five years of smoking Kush has brought shame and isolation. She said no one has helped her, and spoke about days she gets so high that \u201cI did not know what was happening around me.\u201d",
      "But she wants to stop for her children. One night while at work, flames engulfed their home with the two infants inside. They survived, but she entrusted them to an orphanage, haunted by the fire.",
      "\u201cI would love to hear my children call me mummy again,\u201d she said, her scarred face breaking into a smile.",
      "Kush is a depressant. Its short, intense effect often leaves users senseless. Symptoms of addiction range from sores to psychosis. Liver, kidney and respiratory problems are common.",
      "The drug's evolving composition, low cost and widespread availability make it difficult to combat in Sierra Leone, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries. A recent report from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime earlier this year found that nearly half of kush samples tested contained opioids up to 25 times stronger than fentanyl. The drug's content were largely unknown before now, hindering response efforts, experts noted.",
      "Kadiatu Koroma with the local Women for Women Foundation nonprofit said her organization has seen a rise in drug use among women and girls in recent years.",
      "\u201cWhen they are very drowsy \u2026 men will just come and take advantage,\u201d she said. Left vulnerable after using the drug, the women \u201care impregnated and they don\u2019t even know the men who did it.\u201d",
      "At Sierra Leone's Kissy Psychiatric Hospital, health workers described encountering 25 different strains of the drug in the wider Freetown area.",
      "In one of two female wards, nurse Kadiatu Dumbuya said 90% of kush addicts she has attended to during her six years in the hospital have \"sold their body\u201d to feed the habit.",
      "And yet, among the 50 people \u2014 majority of whom are kush users \u2014 who filed into one of Sierra Leone\u2019s two government-run rehab centers on a recent day, only three were women.",
      "Only 300 people have accessed the seven-week program at the Hasting Military Center since it opened in February 2024, guarded by the military and surrounded by barbed wire. Just 40 of the beneficiaries are women.",
      "Officials say the program is gender-sensitive, with men and women separated by a fence. However, staff said stigma and family pressure mean women often deny their addictions and refrain from seeking support.",
      "\u201cIn most cases, we have 10% of girls that come to our attention. That doesn\u2019t mean the girls aren\u2019t addicts \u2026 they feel shy in their communities,\u201d said Ansu Konneh, who works with the Sierra Leone's Ministry of Social Welfare.",
      "\u201cIt is a drop in the ocean,\u201d he says.",
      "Due to funding challenges, an \u2018ambassador\u2019 program for recovered addicts from the center has stalled, and admissions were halted for five months. When it resumed, some of the parents on the 2,000 person-long waiting list said their children had died.",
      "Among those desperate for help was Melda Lansana, who said she visited the ministry several times to secure a rehab spot for her 18-year-old daughter, Khadija.",
      "\u201cWhen I was taking it, I couldn\u2019t wash, I couldn\u2019t take care of myself,\u201d Khadija said, recalling the relief of the days spent in the center last August.",
      "Without money for school, she struggles to get her life on track. Due to family tensions, she has chosen to live \u201con the streets\u201d with her boyfriend.",
      "She vows she\u2019s clean. Her mother suspects she\u2019s still using.",
      "Progress against kush is slow, much like other parts of the world where the fight against synthetic drugs is often difficult.",
      "Officials acknowledge the government has struggled to provide livelihood or business support to ease reintegration, particularly for beneficiaries without formal education - a step advocates say would help women.",
      "Last year's emergency declaration, lauded by civil society, has helped shift the approach from punishment to care but the response is only \"65% of what it should be,\u201d said Habib Kamara, director of the Social Linkages For Youth Development And Child Link, a local nonprofit involved in the fight against drug use.",
      "The organization is one of the few that have offered targeted support to female users, especially to vulnerable populations like sex workers, through community peer support, free family planning and beauty sessions to help build confidence.",
      "\u201cWe have to meet the women where they are,\u201d Kamara said.",
      "Marie Kamara, 19, rejected kush for another drug - Tramadol, which experts have warned is also dangerous. She saw kush as too risky and was put off by her friends' stench and oozing sores.",
      "One night, she said, she and her friend Yabu were chased by a kush dealer. Marie escaped. Yabu didn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cThey raped her \u2026 just because of kush,\u201d Marie said.",
      "Months later, Yabu died from the effects of the drug, Marie said \u2014 her second friend lost to kush.",
      "\u201cLet me not die like them,\" Marie said. \"I pray.\u201d",

      "With the upcoming canonization of its first millennial saint, the Catholic Church has turned to police in Italy to investigate the online sale of some purported relics of Carlo Acutis",
      "ASSISI, Italy -- With the upcoming canonization of its first millennial saint, the Catholic Church has turned to police in Italy to investigate the online sale of some purported relics of Carlo Acutis, who already has been drawing hundreds of thousands of pilgrims to his shrine.",
      "Since the early days of the faith, many Catholics have prayed for intercession to saints\u2019 relics \u2014 usually small parts of their body or clothing that are authenticated by ecclesiastical authorities and preserved in churches. But their sale is strictly forbidden.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just despicable, but it\u2019s also a sin,\u201d said the Rev. Enzo Fortunato, who leads the Vatican\u2019s World Children\u2019s Day committee and has a tiny fragment of Acutis\u2019 hair in a chapel by his office for veneration by visiting youth. \u201cEvery kind of commerce over faith is a sin.\u201d",
      "An anonymous seller had put up for online auction some supposedly authenticated locks of Acutis' hair that were fetching upward of 2,000 euros ($2,200 US), according to the Diocese of Assisi, before being taken down. Last month, Bishop Domenico Sorrentino asked authorities to confiscate the items and added that if fraudulent, the sale would constitute a \u201cgreat offense to religious belief.\u201d",
      "Acutis died of leukemia in 2006, when he was only 15 but had already developed a precocious faith life centered on devotion to the Eucharist \u2014 which for Catholics holds the real presence of Christ. Savvy with technology, he had created an online exhibit about eucharistic miracles through the centuries.",
      "He will formally be declared a saint at a Mass in front of the Vatican\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Basilica on April 27. Over the past year, about 1 million pilgrims have flocked to the central Italian town of Assisi, where his body \u2014 wearing sneakers, jeans, and a sweatshirt \u2014 lies in a shrine in a church dedicated to a key moment in the life of medieval hometown saint, St. Francis.",
      "Acutis\u2019 body was exhumed during the more-than-decade-long canonization process and treated so it could be preserved for public showing, including by removing certain organs. His face, which looks as if he were asleep, was reconstructed with a silicone mask, Sorrentino said.",
      "Acutis\u2019 heart has been preserved at a dedicated altar in another Assisi church; it will be taken to Rome for the canonization Mass.",
      "\u201cThe relics are little, little fragments of the body, to say that that body is blessed, and it explains to us the closeness of God,\u201d Sorrentino said.",
      "There are different \u201cclasses\u201d of relics \u2014 the most important are major body parts, such as the heart. Sorrentino gave Acutis' pericardium \u2014 the membrane enclosing the heart \u2014 to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in 2022 for the duration of its multi-year Eucharistic Revival.",
      "The bishop in charge of the saint\u2019s body works with requests from other bishops around the world to give or lend relics \u2014 always for free \u2014 to be exhibited for veneration at parishes and other churches.",
      "\u201cWe give this to communities, to parishes, to priests using the relics for the cult in their parish,\u201d Sorrentino said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something magic. It\u2019s not something that works automatically, it works through faith.\u201d",
      "The practice of gathering relics dates to the earliest days of the church, when many faithful Christians died as martyrs in religious persecutions. Witnesses to the killings would collect blood or fragments of clothing to memorialize their sacrifice and to pray for the saints\u2019 intercession, Fortunato said.",
      "In Acutis\u2019 case, the first miracle in his canonization process was the healing of a boy in Brazil after a prayer service invoking his intercession with the presence of a relic, he added.",
      "For clergy and pilgrims who have been visiting Acutis\u2019 shrine in Assisi this week, the relics take second place to the example of faith and the power of assisting with prayer that saints provide.",
      "\u201cI would never buy one,\u201d said Amelia Simone, an 18-year-old from Chicago who has been studying in Rome and credits Acutis for help smoothing out tricky visa paperwork. \u201cI think the intercession aspect is very cool, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever want to own a first-class relic. It just would feel a bit weird to me.\u201d",
      "Two clergy leading a Holy Year pilgrimage to Italy from the Diocese of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, said it was \u201ca great tragedy\u201d that online relic sales were happening.",
      "\u201cWe continue to pray for people\u2019s conversion,\u201d said the Rev. Christopher Pujol.",
      "Bishop Larry Kulick added that relics \u201care very reverent and very solemn for us as Catholics. And they are not only inspirational for us, but they are really ... opportunities to help us to pray.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so it\u2019s unfortunate that such a thing would happen, because that\u2019s really a misuse of the relics and actually a disrespect to him and to his memory,\u201d he added.",
      "Already, the uncommon devotion and attention that Acutis' canonization process has generated has been met with some skepticism. In hundreds of social media comments to a recent Associated Press article about the phenomenon, some called his sainthood a marketing ploy by the church to lure more young people back into the pews.",
      "Many others \u2014 and those making pilgrimage to Assisi \u2014 praised Acutis for his devotion and were glad he\u2019s become a role model for members of his generation.",
      "\u201cIt's a joy for me to have encountered Carlo Acutis' body, and especially to ask for his intercession for the transformation and the conversion of many youth,\u201d said Juana de Dios Euceda, a missionary nun from Honduras.",

      "Libya plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. The country split, with rival administrations in the east and west backed by rogue militias and foreign governments.",
      "Libya, which shares borders with six nations and has a long coastline along the Mediterranean, is a main transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East to seek better lives in Europe. The International Organization for Migration estimates around 787,000 migrants and refugees from various nationalities live in Libya as of 2024.",
      "The list of aid groups the agency announced includes Doctors Without Borders, Norwegian Refugee Council, Danish Refugee Council, Terre des Hommes, Care, Acted, Inter SOS and the Italian organization Cesvi. Many of those organizations provided crucial immediate relief during the devastating floods in the country that killed thousands in 2023.",
      "The ISA said the organizations were suspected of money laundering because they avoided transparency in how financial transfers are made for their projects and how they can exchange foreign currency for local currency.",
      "Salem Ghaith, ISA spokesperson, said during a news conference that strict legal action will be taken against the non-governmental organizations in addition to the closure of their offices. He said they illegally provided aid ranging from cash vouchers, clothing, food, housing and medical assistance, which helped settle migrants initially en route to Europe.",
      "\u201cAs a result, there is no longer a need for them to risk crossing the seas and migrating to Europe, turning Libya into a destination country rather than a transit one,\u201d said Ghaith.",

      "Reaction to a court verdict ousting South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol from office was a vivid window into the nation\u2019s deep political divisions",
      "SEOUL -- Dancing and consoling hugs. Wild whoops and anguished screams. Tears, both of joy and rage. Reaction to the court verdict ousting South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol from office Friday was a vivid window into the nation's deep political divisions, as tens of thousands of Yoon opponents and supporters aired their feelings in downtown Seoul.",
      "As South Korea now turns to elect a new president, that divide is only likely to harden. It will be particularly on display as both sides try to answer one question about the night of Dec. 3, when the conservative leader decreed martial law, setting himself on the road to impeachment and the loss of the presidency:",
      "What was he thinking?",
      "Yoon was confronting North Korea-sympathizing politicians intent on destroying South Korea's democracy, his supporters say. No, no, liberals maintain: He was trying to deflect attention from corruption investigations of him and his wife. Or maybe he was in the sway of right-wing YouTubers who claim liberals have subverted the election process?",
      "This national attempt to pick through the wreckage of Yoon's decision to send heavily armed soldiers to encircle the National Assembly will be front and center as a violently fractured South Korea begins a fierce campaign to elect a new president within two months.",
      "Deploying troops to the streets of any democracy is serious. But it is especially sensitive in South Korea, where memories of military rule from the 1960s to 1980s are fresh.",
      "And the move has further exposed the country's fault lines, along politics, national security, social standing, economics, gender and age.",
      "Division is intrinsic to South Korea\u2019s origin story. The Korean Peninsula was split into northern and southern halves in 1945 by Soviet and U.S. troops, formally broken up in 1948 when both Koreas became independent countries, and then militarily separated at the Demilitarized Zone at the end of the Korean War in 1953.",
      "The fractures will likely get worse as presidential election campaigning gains force.",
      "Yoon's supporters tend to frame the martial law decree as a crucial tool for a president stymied at every turn by the liberal opposition Democratic Party, which controls parliament.",
      "Kim Min-seon, a Yoon supporter, said it was the only way to deal with liberals blocking Yoon's efforts to fight Pyongyang's and Beijing\u2019s alleged campaigns to threaten South Korea\u2019s democracy through cyberattacks, disinformation and technology theft. The Democratic Party has denied these accusations.",
      "\u201cI strongly condemn Lee Jae-myung\u2019s Democratic Party, which is an axis of evil,\u201d Kim said during a recent rally. Lee, the opposition leader, is Yoon's archrival and seen as the presidential front-runner.",
      "Yoon supporters' fears are further fueled by false claims about election fraud.",
      "On Dec. 3, Yoon sent troops to National Election Commission offices to investigate alleged vulnerabilities to its computer systems that he insisted could affect the credibility of election results.",
      "Such claims are unsubstantiated and there is no evidence of electoral fraud, but there's a worry that the specter could undermine confidence in future elections.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that we had election fraud, and the president made a crucial decision to expose such massive wrongdoing,\u201d Kwon Kyung-hee, another Yoon supporter, said during a rally this week.",
      "Many Yoon critics see something strikingly different: a leader increasingly in the sway of conspiracy theories that portray him as a victim of a North Korea-sympathizing opposition.",
      "Instead, they say, he was merely an inept politician, unable to work with rivals to get things done.",
      "\u201cThe president\u2019s imposition of martial law was a terrible political decision made by a foolish former prosecutor who mistook compromise for surrender and dialogue for interrogation,\u201d said Choi Hyun-seok, a Seoul office worker.",
      "But others see a reason closer to home, accusing Yoon of being desperate to protect himself from corruption investigations.",
      "Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the Democratic Party, said Yoon\u2019s martial law decree was likely an attempt to cover up \u201cdisgraceful\u201d allegations about Yoon and his wife that had caused the president's approval ratings to plummet.",
      "The scandal revolves around allegations that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee unlawfully influenced the conservative People Power Party to select a specific candidate for a parliamentary by-election in 2022 at the request of election broker Myung Tae-kyun. Yoon has denied any wrongdoing by him or his wife.",
      "Park noted that it was Dec. 2 when Myung, facing the threat of criminal prosecution and increasing scrutiny, revealed he would hand over a phone that contains communications with Yoon and Kim.",
      "\u201cProsecutors indicted Myung Tae-kyun a day later, and Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law on the same day,\u201d Park said during a January party meeting. \u201cIsn\u2019t this too coincidental to be dismissed as mere chance?\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not immediately clear how much of a role the Myung scandal played in influencing Yoon\u2019s decree, which investigators say had been brewing for months.",
      "Prosecutors\u2019 indictments, instead, say Yoon was driven to martial law by disputes with the opposition over budget cuts, impeachment attempts against his allies, and baseless election fraud conspiracy theories. Though they did also briefly mention that Yoon discussed the scandal with his defense minister.",
      "Both Yoon's party \u2014 which is in disarray following the court ruling \u2014 and the opposition \u2014 whose leader also faces several corruption investigations \u2014 have big challenges ahead.",
      "And the stakes couldn't be higher for South Korea: How the political standoff plays out will determine its democratic future, but also its relations with the nuclear-armed North, a newly protectionist United States, and its major trading partner but uneasy neighbor China.",

      "France\u2019s wine producers are deeply concerned that the 20% tariff slapped by President Donald Trump will deal a severe blow to the sector that relies on the U.S. as its top market",
      "CHABLIS, France -- France\u2019s wine producers are deeply concerned that the 20% tariff slapped by President Donald Trump will deal a severe blow to the sector that relies on the U.S. as its top market.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday warned of \u201cmassive\u201d impact as he met with representatives of the most affected industries, including wine and spirits.",
      "Vincent Dampt, owner of a wine domain in Chablis, in the Burgundy region, called the tariffs \u201cbad news.\"",
      "\u201cBut it could be worse,\u201d Dampt added. \u201cI was really stressed with the possibility of having this 200% tariff.\u201d",
      "Trump had threatened last month a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the EU went forward with a planned tariff on American whiskey.",
      "Dampt suggested he preferred a negotiated outcome between the EU and the U.S., saying a full on trade war is bad for business.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not at school,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you answer too quickly with the same violence, it\u2019s not constructive.\u201d",
      "A third generation winemaker, Dampt ships about 30% of his production to the U.S. \u2014 roughly 25,000 bottles. A drop in sales there would severely impact his business.",
      "Chablis white wine was also the target of tariffs under the first Trump administration at the height of the spat between aviation giants Boeing and Airbus.",
      "There's only one way for Dampt to fight back and maintain a presence in the U.S.: bring down his prices and cut his profit. But he said \"it's not an easy thing to do\" especially now when he had already lost about 50% of his crop last year, mostly due to hail storms and killer frost.",
      "The Bourgogne Wine Board said in a statement it expects the industry to be \u201cheavily affected\u201d because the U.S. is the leading export market of wines from Burgundy.",
      "\u201cWhile this new measure will affect exports, potentially costing Bourgogne wines up to 100 million euros, it will not bring trade to a sudden halt, as would have been the case with higher tariffs,\" the trade association noted.",
      "The U.S. remained last year the largest export market for wines produced in the EU, with 4.88 billion euros ($5.36 billion), the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en des Entreprises Vins (European Committee of Wine Businesses), or CEEV, said in a statement. Exports to the U.S. accounted for 28% of the EU\u2019s total wine export value, it said.",
      "The new tariff would create \"economic uncertainty and result in layoffs, deferred investments and price increases,\u201d said Marzia Varvaglione, CEEV president. \u201cThere is no alternative wine market that could compensate the loss of the U.S. market.\"",
      "Macron denounced the tariffs as \"brutal and unfounded.\u201d In addition to the wine industry, the meeting at the Elysee palace gathered representatives from aeronautics, chemical and metal sectors, electronics, health, luxury, cosmetics and food industry.",
      "Macron said France is likely to be slightly less impacted than some of its neighbours, because exports to the U.S. represent 1.5% of France's GDP, while they represent over 3% for Italy and 4% for Germany. Yet, \u201cit\u2019s not a small thing,\u201d Macron said.",
      "He emphasized that the U.S. economy will first experience the negative impact of the tariffs.",
      "\u201cOne thing is certain, with that decision, the U.S. economy and Americans, businesses and citizens, will emerge weaker and poorer than yesterday,\u201d Macron said.",

      "BRUSSELS -- Britain and France on Friday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of dragging his feet in ceasefire talks aimed at halting his country's invasion of Ukraine and demanded a swift response from Moscow after weeks of U.S. efforts to secure a truce.",
      "A Russian drone attack late Thursday on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, killed five civilians and dramatized the diplomatic insistence on a ceasefire. Emergency crews carried black body bags from a burning apartment building as onlookers wept and hugged in the dark. Some of the 32 injured, bloodied and in shock, limped out into the street or were carried on stretchers as flames shot from the windows of their homes.",
      "\u201cNow, I think it is obvious who wants peace and who wants war,\u201d Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said at a NATO meeting in Brussels, referring to the Kharkiv strike. \u201cWe must get Russia serious about peace. We must pressure Russia into peace.\u201d",

      "The two foreign ministers pledged to continue helping to build up Ukraine\u2019s armed forces \u2013 the country\u2019s best security guarantee since the U.S. took any prospect of NATO membership off the table.",

      "\u201cBoil it down to the basics, it\u2019s good versus evil,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I became Christian, I started seeing the wrestling world through a Christian lens. I started seeing David and Goliath. I started seeing Cain and Abel. I started seeing Esau having his heritage stolen from him. And I\u2019m like, \u2018We could tell these stories.\u2019\u201d",
      "Church attendance in the U.K. has been declining for decades, and the 2021 census found that less than half of people in England and Wales now consider themselves Christian. Those who say they have no religion rose from 25% to 37% in a decade.",
      "That has led churches to get creative in order to survive.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take a few risks,\" said the Rev. Natasha Thomas, the priest in charge at St. Peter\u2019s. She acknowledged that she \u201cwasn\u2019t entirely sure what it was I was letting myself in for\u201d when she agreed to host wrestling events.",

      "At a recent Wrestling Church evening, almost 200 people \u2014 older couples, teenagers, pierced and tattooed wrestling fans, parents with excited young children \u2014 packed into chairs around a ring erected under the vaulted ceiling of the century-old church.",
      "After a short homily and prayer from Thomas, it was time for two hours of smackdowns, body slams and flying headbutts. The atmosphere grew cheerfully raucous, as fans waved giant foam fingers and hollered \u201cknock him out!\u201d at participants.",
      "Some longtime churchgoers have welcomed the infusion of energy.",

      "Thompson, whose wrestling moniker is Gareth Angel, both wrestles and presides over the organized mayhem. He\u2019s a mix of preacher and ringmaster, wearing a T-shirt that says \u201cPray, eat, wrestle, repeat.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s loved wrestling since it provided solace and release during a troubled upbringing that saw him survive childhood sexual abuse and a period of homelessness as a teenager.",

But then God has obviously turned that around now and it\u2019s become this passion.\u201d",
      "He found Christianity in 2011, ran his first Wrestling Church event in a former nightclub-turned-church in 2022, and moved to St. Peter\u2019s last year.",
      "As well as the monthly Saturday night shows, his charity Kingdom Wrestling runs training sessions for adults and children in a back room of the church, along with women\u2019s self-defense classes, a men\u2019s mental health group and coaching for children who have been expelled from school.",
      "For many in the close-knit community of U.K. wrestlers and fans, religion is a new ingredient, but not an unwelcome one.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m mainly here for the wrestling,\u201d said 33-year-old Liam Ledger, who wrestles as Flamin\u2019 Daemon Crowe.

      "Only a handful of people have gone from watching the wrestling to attending Sunday-morning services at St. Peter\u2019s, but Wrestling Church baptized 30 people in its first year. Thompson, whose brand of born-again Christianity is more muscular than many traditional Anglicans', plans to expand to other British cities. One day, he says, he may start his own church.",
      "There has long been overlap between Christianity and wrestling in the U.S., where figures like Thompson's hero Shawn Michaels proudly proclaim their faith. But Britain is a less religious place, and Shipley, a former mill town 175 miles (280 kilometers) north of London, is a long way from the Bible Belt.",
      "Thompson, though, is unfazed by doubters.",
      "\u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh, wrestling and Christianity, they\u2019re two fake things in a fake world of their own existence,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in it, of course you will think that of it. But my own personal experience of my Christian faith is that it is alive and living, and it is true. The wrestling world, if you really believe in it, you believe that it\u2019s true and you can suspend your disbelief.",

      "Three years after winning South Korea\u2019s closest presidential race, President Yoon Suk Yeol was formally removed from office as the Constitutional Court upheld his impeachment over a stunning December martial law imposition \u2014 a self-inflicted downfall t...",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Three years after becoming president of South Korea, Yoon Suk Yeol was formally removed from office on Friday as the Constitutional Court upheld his impeachment over an ill-fated December decision to impose martial law. Yoon's self-inflicted downfall continues a trend of troubled presidencies.",
      "Yoon\u2019s ouster comes eight years after the same court dismissed another conservative president, Park Geun-hye over an explosive scandal involving bribery, extortion, leaking state secrets and abuse of power. Several former presidents, their family members, or top aides have been embroiled in corruption scandals near the end of their terms or after leaving office. There have been coups, an assassination and a suicide.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the country\u2019s history of troubled presidencies.",
      "Syngman Rhee, an American-educated Christian leader and independence activist, became South Korea\u2019s first president in 1948 with U.S. support, three years after the Korean Peninsula was liberated from Japanese colonial rule at the end of World War II. His government grew increasingly authoritarian, especially after the 1950-53 Korean War, and critics accused him of corruption and nepotism as he sought to extend his grip on power. He secured a fourth presidential term in 1960 amid widespread allegations of vote-rigging, triggering nationwide protests that forced him to flee to Hawaii, where he died in 1965.",
      "Park Chung-hee, an army general, seized power in a 1961 coup, toppling the government that had replaced Rhee. Park is credited with industrial policies that fueled the country\u2019s rapid economic growth in the 1960-70s, but critics remember him as a ruthless dictator who jailed, tortured, and executed dissidents. Park, also the father of future President Park Geun-hye, was assassinated by his own spy chief during a late-night drinking session in 1979.",
      "Park was replaced by an interim government, but within months another army general and his military allies seized power in a coup in December 1979, deploying tanks and troops into Seoul. President Chun Doo-hwan ruled as a military dictator but massive pro-democracy protests forced his government to accept a constitutional revision allowing direct presidential elections in 1987. After leaving office, Chun spent two years in exile at a remote Buddhist temple amid public demands for accountability for corruption and human rights abuses, and in 1995 he was arrested for crimes including the coup that brought him to power and received a death sentence that was later commuted to life imprisoned before he was pardoned. Chun died in 2021.",
      "Roh Tae-woo, a close associate of Chun, won the country\u2019s first democratic, direct presidential election in decades in 1987, largely due to a split opposition vote among liberal candidates. Two years after Roh left office, both he and Chun were arrested in late 1995 on charges of accepting bribes from businessmen during their presidencies. They were also indicted for mutiny and treason over the 1979 coup that put Chun in power and the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Gwangju in 1980, which killed hundreds. In 1996, Chun was initially sentenced to death, while Roh received 22\u00bd years in prison. In April 1997, South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court reduced Chun\u2019s sentence to life imprisonment and Roh\u2019s to 12 years, before both were pardoned later that year. Roh died in 2021.",
      "Kim Young-sam, a longtime opposition leader who fought for democratization, initially enjoyed strong public support for ambitious anti-corruption reforms and the arrests of Chun and Roh. But Kim's popularity nosedived as the late-1990s Asian financial crisis wreaked havoc on South Korea\u2019s economy, toppling some of the country\u2019s debt-ridden conglomerates and forcing the government to accept a $58 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund. He pardoned Chun and Roh in December 1997, accepting a proposal from president-elect Kim Dae-jung, as a gesture for national unity. Kim Young-sam left office amid a corruption scandal that saw his son arrested and jailed. He died in 2015.",
      "Another longtime opposition leader and democracy activist, Kim Dae-jung rose to the presidency in 1998. In 2000, he held an unprecedented summit with then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, ushering in an era of rapprochement between the war-divided rivals. That same year, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. However, his presidency was also marred by corruption scandals involving his aides and sons. He was also accused of arranging for the Hyundai business group to pay North Korea more than $400 million ahead of the summit. Kim died in 2009.",
      "Roh Moo-hyun, a self-taught lawyer who rose to political prominence as a reformist, won the 2002 election as a liberal candidate with vows to fight corruption. However, his direct and outspoken style contributed to constant clashes with conservatives who held the legislative majority during the early part of his presidency. In 2004, lawmakers impeached Roh over election law violations and other allegations, but the Constitutional Court reinstated him two months later, concluding that the accusations were not serious enough to justify his removal. Roh died by suicide in 2009, a year after his term ended, amid allegations that some of his family members took bribes during his presidency. His older brother received a prison term for influence-peddling in 2009 and was later pardoned.",
      "Elected in 2008 on a promise to boost the economy, ex-Hyundai CEO Lee Myung-bak saw his popularity decline quickly due to unmet economic goals and media policies criticized as attacks on free speech, and left office with rock-bottom approval ratings amid corruption scandals involving himself, his family and key government officials. In 2018, Lee was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison for a range of crimes before and during his presidency, including accepting millions of dollars in bribes from major corporations, embezzling funds from his own company, and taking bribes from his ex-spy chief in exchange for favors. He was released on bail months later but was imprisoned again in 2020 after the Supreme Court upheld a 17-year sentence from an appellate court. Lee was pardoned by Yoon Suk Yeol in December 2022.",
      "Park Geun-hye was elected as the country\u2019s first female president in 2012, defeating her liberal rival Moon Jae-in by a million votes after securing support from conservative voters who see her father as an industrial hero who lifted the country from postwar poverty. But her popularity declined following a 2014 ferry disaster that claimed more than 300 lives, while an uncompromising leadership style led to impasses with the liberal opposition. Her presidency collapsed after allegations emerged that she had colluded with a friend to extort and accept millions of dollars in bribes from the country\u2019s biggest business groups and allowed her friend to manipulate state affairs. Park was formally ousted from office and arrested in March 2017. She called her trial political revenge and refused to attend hearings before being convicted and sentenced. Park served less than a quarter of her 22-year sentence before Moon, who won a presidential by-election following her ouster, pardoned her in December 2021 in what he called an effort to promote political unity.",
      "Yoon, a staunch conservative and longtime prosecutor, went from political novice to president in 2022, ending five years of liberal rule characterized by failed efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis and ongoing economic trouble. He clashed continuously with the liberal opposition, which retained its majority in the National Assembly and hindered his agenda. Aiming to quash a legislature he portrayed as a \u201cden of criminals,\" Yoon declared martial law on Dec. 3, 2024 and sent hundreds of troops to the legislature and election offices. Despite troop blockades, lawmakers gathered a quorum and unanimously voted to lift martial law just hours later. The assembly impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, suspending his powers as prosecutors opened criminal investigations into the events. Yoon and his allies denied that he intended to shut down the legislature or arrest opponents, but the eight-member Constitutional Court unanimously rejected their arguments, describing his actions as unconstitutional and ordering his removal. The former president still faces a criminal trial for rebellion, and could be charged with additional crimes now that he has been stripped of presidential immunity.",

      "South Korea's Constitutional Court has upheld parliament's impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol and removed him from office",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s political rise was fast: the former star prosecutor clinched South Korea\u2019s presidency only a year after he entered politics.",
      "But his downfall was even faster: The Constitutional Court removed him from office on Friday, about four months after he made a deeply baffling decision to declare martial law and send troops to Seoul's streets.",
      "Yoon's style \u2014 highly assertive and strong-willed, but often uncompromising and inflexible \u2014 worked for a prosecutor standing up to higher-ups, but not for a president forced to work with an opposition-dominated legislature on an array of contentious issues.",
      "Yoon, 64, a conservative, said his martial law decree was a desperate attempt to call on public support for his fight against \u201canti-state\u201d liberal rivals who used their parliamentary majority to obstruct his agenda and impeach top officials. But many observers say the stunt was political suicide, as the liberal opposition-controlled parliament quickly struck down Yoon's decree before impeaching him and sending his case to the Constitutional Court. '",
      "Yoon was separately indicted by prosecutors for rebellion, a charge that can carry the death penalty or life imprisonment.",
      "Here's what you need to know about Yoon\u2019s life to understand the sudden end of his presidency.",
      "Before becoming president in 2022, Yoon worked as prosecutor for about 26 years, establishing an image as a strong-minded, uncompromising prosecutor who didn\u2019t yield to pressure from powerful figures.",
      "Yoon rose to stardom in 2013, when he publicly accused his boss of pressuring him to drop a high-stakes investigations into allegations that the state intelligence agency had carried out an illegal online campaign to help conservative Park Geun-hye win the previous year\u2019s presidential election.",
      "During a hearing at parliament, Yoon famously said, \u201cI\u2019m not loyal to (high-level) people.\u201d",
      "He was demoted, but after Park\u2019s government was toppled over a separate corruption scandal in 2017, liberal President Moon Jae-in made Yoon head of a Seoul prosecutors\u2019 office that investigated Park and other conservative leaders. Yoon was later appointed as Moon\u2019s prosecutor general.",
      "In 2021, Yoon left the Moon administration and entered politics following disputes over probes of Moon allies. Moon\u2019s supporters accused Yoon of attempting to frustrate Moon\u2019s push to reform the Korean prosecution service and boost his political standing. Yoon, for his part, called the Moon government \u201ccorrupt,\u201d \u201cincompetent\u201d and \u201carrogant.\u201d",
      "Yoon joined then the opposition People Power Party, the country\u2019s biggest conservative party, whose leaders he previously investigated, as it was looking to embrace a popular outside figure to lead its fight to regain power in the following year's presidential election.",
      "In 2022, in his first national election campaign, Yoon defeated Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung in the country\u2019s most closely fought presidential election.",
      "The election race got nasty, with Yoon describing Lee\u2019s party as \u201cHitler\u201d and \u201cMussolini\u201d while an associate called Lee\u2019s purported aides \u201cparasites.\u201d Lee\u2019s allies called Yoon \u201ca beast,\u201d \u201cdictator\u201d and \u201can empty can\u201d and derided his wife over claims she had had plastic surgery.",
      "On foreign policy, Yoon was credited with working hard to reinforce South Korea\u2019s military alliance with the U.S. and repairing disputes with Japan over historical traumas to build a stronger trilateral security partnership to cope with North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program.",
      "In April 2023, Yoon charmed a White House state dinner by singing \u201cAmerican Pie\" at the request of then-President Joe Biden. In August 2023, Yoon, Biden and Japan's then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida met at Camp David in their countries\u2019 first stand-alone trilateral summit, where they agreed to bolster defense cooperation. Yoon and Kishida revived stalled high-level talks and withdrew reciprocal economic restrictions imposed under their predecessors.",
      "But domestically, Yoon\u2019s time in office was marred by near-constant political strife with Lee\u2019s party, unprecedented even in South Korea\u2019s deeply polarized political world.",
      "With control of the National Assembly, the Democratic Party filed a total of 30 impeachment motions against senior officials. None has yet been upheld by the Constitutional Court, except that of Yoon. The Yoon administration vetoed opposition-led bills about 40 times.",
      "Eventually, Yoon tried to break through the gridlock by declaring martial law. He says that it was an attempt to appeal for the public's help to overcome the \u201cwickedness\u201d of the Democratic Party. Critics say he was simply aiming to use force to impose his will on the legislature.",
      "In his martial law announcement, Yoon called the Democratic Party-led assembly \u201ca den of criminals,\u201d \u201ca monster\u201d and \u201canti-state forces.\u201d Democratic Party leaders lambasted Yoon's martial law, calling him \u201can alcoholic,\u201d \u201ca madman\u201d and \u201cringleader of a rebellion.\u201d",
      "Some observers say the martial law decree was more likely driven by Yoon's hopes to frustrate an opposition-led bid to open a special investigation into allegations involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee.",
      "Kim's allegations include spy camera footage showing the first lady accepting a luxury bags as a gift from a pastor; speculation she was involved in a stock price manipulation scheme; and revelations that she, along with Yoon, exerted inappropriate influence on the People Power Party to pick a candidate to run for a parliamentary by-election in 2022.",
      "Kim's scandals and Yoon's refusal to apologize and accept investigations provided the Democratic Party political ammunition throughout his term.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A lack of training, qualifications and experience among the crew on board a New Zealand navy ship that ran aground, caught fire and sank off the coast of Samoa have been identified by a military Court of Inquiry in a final report released Friday as contributing to the disaster.",
      "The deficiencies were among a dozen failings of the crew, ship and New Zealand's Navy that contributed to the loss of the HMNZS Manawanui in October 2024, the 120-page report said. An interim report last November had already divulged that the ship\u2019s crew didn\u2019t realize the vessel was on autopilot and believed something else had gone wrong as it plowed toward a reef.",
      "All 75 people on board evacuated to safety as the boat foundered about 1.6 kilometers (a mile) off the coast of Upolu, Samoa's second largest island. The ship was one of only nine in New Zealand\u2019s navy and was the first the country lost at sea since World War II.",
      "Officials did not immediately know the cause of the sinking and the Court of Inquiry was ordered to find out. Insufficient training, lack of qualified personnel on board and inadequate risk management, were among a raft of problems uncovered in its findings released Friday.",
      "The report also underlined the so-called hollowness of New Zealand's navy \u2014 which prompted the organization to \u201ctake risks\u201d to meet demands \u201cwith a lean and inexperienced workforce,\u201d its authors wrote.",
      "\u201cIt's an indictment on the fact that our navy was left in quite a perilous state,\u201d Defense Minister Judith Collins told reporters in Auckland Friday. The whole of the country's military needed a \u201cserious uplift,\u201d she added.",
      "The state of New Zealand\u2019s aging military hardware has prompted several warnings from the defense agency, which in a March 2024 report described the navy as \u201cextremely fragile,\u201d with ships idle due to problems retaining the staff needed to service and maintain them.",
      "The Court of Inquiry could not make findings of guilt, it said, and suggested a separate disciplinary investigation for individual members of the crew who were not named in the report. Their suggested offenses were redacted.",
      "The report included a dramatic transcript of what unfolded on the bridge, with one crew member saying to another that the ship was \u201cnot really doing what I want it to do\" as they tried to change the vessel's course.",
      "\u201cIt's a bad day for the navy,\u201d said Rear Admiral Garin Golding, the leader of the navy. \u201cOur reputation has taken a hit.\u201d",
      "The navy would \u201clearn from\u201d the episode and ensure it wasn't repeated, he added. Friday\u2019s findings, however, also urged recognition for those involved in the decision to abandon ship, who the report found saved lives during the evacuation.",
      "The specialist dive and hydrographic vessel had been in service for New Zealand since 2019 and was surveying the reef that it ran aground on. Its sinking provoked alarm, demands for compensation and fear of environmental catastrophe for Samoan villagers living on the coast where it capsized, who say they fear permanent damage to the fragile reef ecosystem.",
      "A no-fishing zone around the vessel was lifted by Samoa's government in February.",
      "New Zealand's military said this month that it had completed months of work to remove diesel fuel and other pollutants from the ship, which remains where it sank. Salvage work to retrieve equipment and weapons continues.",
      "Seawater and marine life in the area are \u201cuncontaminated\u201d, the military said, citing Samoa's scientific research agency. A decision about whether the ship will eventually be removed has not been made.",

      "Argentina\u2019s senate has rejected the two Supreme Court candidates that President Javier Milei nominated by decree earlier this year, dealing a major blow to the libertarian leader",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentina\u2019s senate on Thursday rejected the two Supreme Court candidates that President Javier Milei nominated by decree earlier this year, dealing a major blow to the libertarian leader.",
      "The congressional defeat could complicate the implementation of Milei's radical state overhaul of Argentina, as analysts say the president had hoped to fill the Supreme Court vacancies with appointees who would rule favorably on challenges to his economic reforms.",
      "Milei in February bypassed Congress to appoint two controversial Supreme Court candidates, invoking a clause in Argentina\u2019s constitution that he said empowered him to fill the vacant seats during the legislature's summer recess.",
      "Politicians sharply criticized the move as an overreach of executive power, saying that a president has extremely limited authority to make judicial appointments during a congressional break.",
      "\u201cIt's a serious institutional conflict that the executive branch has initiated against the legislative and judicial branches,\u201d said Sen. Anabel Fern\u00e1ndez Sagasti from Uni\u00f3n por la Patria party, the hardline opposition bloc. \u201cWhat we are discussing is an institutional assault.\u201d",
      "Both of Milei's candidates \u2014 federal judge Ariel Lijo and conservative law professor Manuel Garc\u00eda-Mansilla \u2014 had failed last year to secure the two-thirds majority required to confirm the candidates in the senate, where the president's libertarian coalition holds just seven of the 72 seats.",
      "Milei resorted to presidential decree to fill the two vacant seats on the five-judge court, testing the boundaries of his executive power as he has repeatedly done over the past year to overcome his minority in Congress.",
      "His nominees have provoked fierce debate across the political spectrum. Lijo has drawn criticism from anti-corruption watchdogs and opposition from centrist parties scandalized by allegations that he laundered money, abused judicial authority and stalled graft cases assigned to him in federal court. Lijo has denied the accusations.",
      "During the heated hours-long debate over the candidates on the senate floor Thursday, centrist lawmaker Luis Juez referred to Lijo by the name of a famous Argentine hypnotist, saying, \u201cI call him that because he'll put your judicial case to sleep if it suits political powers.\"",
      "Garc\u00eda-Mansilla has faced resistance from the left-leaning Peronist opposition movement, which holds 45% of seats in the senate, for his conservative stance on social issues like abortion.",
      "The vote was not close. Lijo failed to pass with 43 \u201cno\u201d votes and 27 for, while Garc\u00eda-Mansilla received 51 votes against and just 21 in favor.",
      "Milei has fiercely defended his candidates as worthy of serving on the nation's highest court and accused lawmakers of unfairly politicizing his nominations.",
      "In a statement late Thursday, Milei's office said it \u201crepudiated\u201d the senate vote.",
      "\u201cThe senate has rejected nominations proposed by the president for purely political reasons and not for reasons of suitability,\u201d it said, arguing that leaving the two seats empty on the court constituted an effort to obstruct justice.",
      "It said Milei would seek to \u201crestore people's confidence in the institutions using all the tools that the constitution and popular vote have placed in his hands.\u201d",
      "Others breathed a sigh of relief at what they saw as a sign of Argentina's democracy working.",
      "\u201cToday the Argentine Senate put a stop to one of the most serious attacks on judicial independence since the country\u2019s return to democracy,\" said Juan Pappier, deputy director of the Americas at Human Rights Watch. \u201cPresident Milei risked undermining some the very basic checks and balances of Argentina\u2019s democratic system.\u201d",

      "SORATA, Bolivia -- A powerful explosion killed at least five people, including a pregnant woman and 1-year-old baby, during a standoff between rival groups of gold miners early Thursday in northwestern Bolivia, police said, a rare instance of territorial disputes between the nation's mining cooperatives turning fatal.",
      "The blast thundered through the Yani mining camp as two rival mining groups dispute access to the gold mine near the mountain town of Sorata, some 150 kilometers (about 90 miles) northwest of the country's administrative capital of La Paz, said Col. Gunther Agudo, a local police officer. Several gold deposits straddle the remote area.",
      "Agudo had initially reported six people killed but revised the toll to five after firefighters finished recovering the bodies from under the rubble. The dead included three men, a pregnant woman and an infant, he said.",
      "Bolivia's deputy interior minister, Jhonny Aguilera, said the suspected perpetrator of the attack was killed by the explosion, which was detonated by remote control.",
      "The predawn explosion at the mine struck a three-story house and set cars and tractors alight. The fires wrecked several other structures and cut electricity.",
      "Bolivia\u2019s mining industry stands out for its huge sector of cooperatives \u2014 legal groups of artisanal miners \u2014 which drive 58% of mining production, according to the latest government figures. The thousands of groups also wield political clout in the resource-rich country where they have representation in Parliament.",
      "Cooperatives historically emerged in Bolivia as more established mining operations dismissed legions of workers in the risky, boom-and-bust business, compelling miners to organize themselves when commodity prices slumped and lay-offs loomed.",
      "Over the decades, cooperatives have increasingly fought over the chance to extract minerals \u2014 hurling rocks and dynamite sticks at each other and against unionized, salaried workers from Bolivia\u2019s state-run mining company, Comibol.",
      "Comibol came to dominate the crucial industry under former President Evo Morales, a socialist leader who governed the landlocked Andean nation from 2006 to 2019 and barred foreign companies from having a controlling stake in mineral extraction.",
      "In Thursday\u2019s clash, the struggle for control of certain veins of the gold reserve between two rival cooperatives had simmered for years, said Jhony Silva, a legal adviser to one of them. Gold remains one of Bolivia's main mineral exports, with almost $2.87 billion worth of the mineral shipped out of the country in 2023.",

      "The leader of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council says it is taking measures to crack down on a surge in gang violence as he acknowledged that the country has \u201cbecome hell for everyone.\u201d",
      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- The leader of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council announced Thursday that it was taking measures to crack down on a surge in gang violence, acknowledging that the country has \u201cbecome hell for everyone.\u201d",
      "Fritz Alphonse Jean spoke a day after gunfire erupted in the Port-au-Prince capital as thousands of protesters demanding an end to gang violence clashed with police outside the offices of the council and the prime minister.",
      "It was the biggest protest held since the council was installed a year ago.",
      "\u201cHaitian people, you\u2019ve spoken, and we\u2019ve heard you,\u201d Jean said. \u201cWe understand your misery. We know your pain and your suffering.\u201d",
      "More than 4,200 people have been reported killed across Haiti from July to February, and another 1,356 were injured, according to the U.N.",
      "Recent gang violence also left more than 60,000 people homeless in one month alone, according to the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration.",
      "\u201cThis national address comes at a decisive moment for the transitional government,\u201d said Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. \u201cProtesters from various parts of the capital deliberately marched toward key government buildings to express their frustration.\u201d",
      "He noted that Jean\u2019s address marked the first anniversary of the political agreement that established the new transitional government\u2019s structure and objectives. Since then, cohesion between political parties involved in creating that government \u201chas now largely collapsed,\u201d Da Rin said.",
      "\u201cThe groups that originally supported this government are now calling for a change in leadership,\u201d he noted.",
      "The council has not addressed those concerns, which also have been voiced by the international community.",
      "During his public address, Jean rattled off a list of neighborhoods that gangs have recently attacked.",
      "\u201cYou lost your homes, you lost your businesses, you lost your jobs, they raped you, they raped your kids. The criminal gangs killed a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fight against the darkness is not insignificant. But we are not insignificant ourselves\u2026 It\u2019s nothing compared with the battle we fought to get out of slavery.\u201d",
      "Jean referenced how Haiti became the world\u2019s first free Black republic in a bid to rally support from Haitians, asking them to help law enforcement officials and eschew efforts by gangs to recruit people, especially children.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let people profit from your distress and drag you in bad directions,\u201d he said.",
      "Jean said the council would take \u201cimportant measures\u201d to help quell the persistent violence, including setting aside a special budget and incorporating agents from an armed state environmental group known as BSAP.",
      "\u201cThe council asks the prime minister and the police to take these measures without delay,\u201d Jean said. \u201cWe are telling everyone in this government that we are at war.\u201d",
      "Jean did not provide further details, including how much money would be set aside for the budget and how many BSAP agents would join the fight against gangs.",
      "Jean also said that the electoral council is working so that Haiti can have new leadership once the transitional presidential council\u2019s term ends on Feb. 7 next year. He added that officials are taking steps so that the diaspora can vote in what would be the first general elections held in almost a decade.",
      "Haiti has not had a president since former President Jovenel Mo\u00efse was killed in July 2021, with gangs becoming increasingly powerful in the aftermath.",
      "Last year, a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police arrived in Haiti to help local authorities quell gang violence, but the mission remains understaffed and underfunded, with only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel originally envisioned.",
      "Da Rin noted that throughout his speech, Jean emphasized the transnational dimension of Haiti\u2019s security crisis, stressing that the gang issue is part of a broader problem involving money laundering and arms and drugs trafficking that spans several countries.",
      "\u201cBy framing Haiti\u2019s gang problem as a matter of transnational crime that goes beyond Haiti\u2019s borders, the president seems to be seeking to rally international support for further security assistance that matches the escalating threats,\u201d he said.",

      "The protest began as Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman was presenting product updates and a long-term vision for the company's AI assistant product, Copilot, to an audience that included Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and former CEO Steve Ballmer.",
      "\u201cMustafa, shame on you,\u201d shouted Microsoft employee Ibtihal Aboussad as she walked toward the stage and Suleyman paused his speech. \u201cYou claim that you care about using AI for good but Microsoft sells AI weapons to the Israeli military. Fifty-thousand people have died and Microsoft powers this genocide in our region.\u201d",
      "\u201cThank you for your protest, I hear you,\u201d Suleyman said. Aboussad continued, shouting that Suleyman and \u201call of Microsoft\u201d had blood on their hands. She also threw onto the stage a keffiyeh scarf, which has become a symbol of support for Palestinian people, before being escorted out of the event.",
      "A second protester, Microsoft employee Vaniya Agrawal, interrupted another part of the celebration during which Gates, Ballmer and current CEO Satya Nadella were on stage \u2014 the first public gathering since 2014 of the three men who have been Microsoft's CEO.",
      "An investigation by The Associated Press revealed earlier this year that AI models from Microsoft and OpenAI had been used as part of an Israeli military program to select bombing targets during the recent wars in Gaza and Lebanon. The story also contained details of an errant Israeli airstrike in 2023 that struck a vehicle carrying members of a Lebanese family, killing three young girls and their grandmother.",
      "In February, five Microsoft employees were ejected from a meeting with Nadella for protesting the contracts. While the February event was an internal meeting, Friday's protest was far more public \u2014 a livestreamed showcase of the company's past and future. Some employees also rallied outside the event Friday.",
      "\u201cWe provide many avenues for all voices to be heard,\" said a statement from the company Friday. \u201cImportantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not cause a business disruption. If that happens, we ask participants to relocate. We are committed to ensuring our business practices uphold the highest standards.\u201d",
      "Microsoft declined to say whether it was taking further action. Aboussad told the AP she hasn't yet heard anything from the company but she and Agrawal both lost access to their work accounts after the protest and have not been able to log back in, a possible indication that they were being fired.",

      "Industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers are seeking blanket exemptions from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene",
      "WASHINGTON -- Industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers are seeking blanket exemptions from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene.",
      "The request by the American Chemistry Council and the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers comes as the Trump administration offers industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from rules imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA has set up an electronic mailbox to allow regulated companies to request a two-year presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act to a host of Biden-era rules.",
      "The chemistry council and the petrochemical group said in a letter Monday to the EPA that regulation of the chemical industry is supposed to be based on sound science and \u201creflect a reasonable assessment of the risks and benefits involved.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d the groups wrote, an EPA rule on air pollution from stationary sources \u201cundermines those important objectives and advances improper and significantly costly requirements on an unworkable timeline.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press obtained a copy of the letter on Friday.",
      "Costs for the rule\u2019s risk-related requirements alone could exceed $50 billion, the groups said, \u201csignificantly more than the $1.8 billion for the full rule that EPA estimated at final publication\u201d last year.",
      "Environmental groups have denounced the administration\u2019s offer to grant industry exemptions, calling the new email address a \u201cpolluters\u2019 portal\u201d that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. Exemptions would be allowed for nine EPA rules issued under former President Joe Biden, including limits on mercury, ethylene oxide and other hazardous air pollutants. Mercury exposure can cause brain damage, especially in children. Fetuses are vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother\u2019s womb.",
      "The Environmental Defense Fund accused the chemical and petrochemical companies \u2014 which include giants such as ExxonMobil, Marathon Petroleum, Chevron, Dow and DuPont \u2014 of \u201chiding behind their associations to get a presidential exemption from pollution safeguards that keep our kids healthy and safe.\u201d",
      "New EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin \u201chas opened a back door for hundreds of companies to avoid complying with reasonable limits on the most toxic forms of air pollution, and they\u2019re rushing through it with no regard for the communities around them,'' said Vickie Patton, the group's general counsel.",
      "Granting the exemption would be \u201ca huge blow to American families who now must worry about their loved ones breathing dirtier air, their kids missing more school days because of asthma attacks and more cancer in their families,\u201d Patton said. \"There is no basis in U.S. clean air laws \u2014 and in decency \u2014 for this absolute free pass to pollute.\u201d",
      "EDF has filed a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act for all records related to the EPA portal \u2014 including the names of those seeking exemptions \u2014 and pledged to go to court to obtain the records if necessary and make them public.",
      "The EPA's offer to grant exemptions marks at least the third time Zeldin has moved to weaken enforcement of environmental laws since he took office less than two months ago. He previously announced a series of actions to roll back landmark environmental regulations, including rules on pollution from coal-fired power plants, climate change and electric vehicles.",
      "Zeldin also said he would push for a 65% spending cut at the agency, and has moved to drastically reduce EPA staffing. The agency is considering a plan to eliminate its scientific research office and has sought to claw back $20 billion in \u201cgreen bank\u201d grants approved by the Biden administration to promote clean energy.",
      "Use of presidential exemptions to EPA rule is rare, although Biden offered some last year after tightening emission standards for ethylene oxide from commercial facilities that sterilize medical equipment.",
      "The EPA directed questions about the possible exemptions to the White House, noting that authority for any exemption rests with the president. White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said no decisions have been made, but said, \u201cwe can confirm President Trump\u2019s commitment to unleashing American energy, protecting our national security interests and ensuring environmental stewardship.\u201d",
      "The chemistry council said in a statement Friday that its members \u201cgreatly appreciate the current administration\u2019s willingness to offer a pathway for relief from the unrealistic timelines\u201d set by the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to working expeditiously with EPA throughout this process to develop appropriate, science-based requirements that help protect public health and safety without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens on domestic manufacturers that would undermine our national security and American competitiveness,\u201d the statement said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Senators dived into a contentious late night \u2014 or all-night \u2014 debate Friday over a Republican budget plan that's central to President Donald Trump's agenda for trillions of dollars in tax breaks and boosts to border security and defense spending, all while slashing other government spending.",
      "It could not have come at a more difficult political moment. The U.S. economy is churning over Trump's vast tariff scheme sent stocks plummeting, and experts are warning of soaring costs for consumers at home and threats of a potential recession. Even some Republicans have expressed concerns.",
      "But GOP leaders with a nod from Trump are determined to march ahead, pushing past a hardened line of opposition from Democrats, who are unified as they decry tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of federal programs Americans rely on. Approval, expected by Saturday morning, would give Republicans the chance in coming months to muscle a tax cut bill through both chambers of Congress, just as they did in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "\u201cLet the voting begin,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.",
      "The evening kicked off what's called vote-a-rama as Democrats are intent on making the effort as politically painful as possible, with all-night votes on dozens of amendments to the package that GOP senators will have to defend before next year\u2019s midterm elections. Among them are proposals to ban tax breaks for the super-wealthy and to halt Trump\u2019s tariff policies and efforts to shrink the federal government.",
      "Democrats accused Republicans of laying the groundwork for increasing deficits and cutting key safety net programs such as Medicaid and nutritional assistance to help pay for tax cuts they say disproportionately benefit the rich.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said, \u201cTrump's policies are a disaster,\" as is Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. \u201cRepublicans could snuff it out tonight, if they wanted.\u201d",
      "None of the many proposals from Democrats are expected to pass as Republicans use their majority to swat them back. The Republicans are framing their work as preventing a tax increase for most American families, arguing that unless Congress acts, the individual and estate tax cuts that Republicans passed in 2017 will expire at the end of this year.",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, the No.-2 ranking GOP senator, said voters gave Republicans a mission and a mandate in November, and the Senate budget plan delivers.",
      "\u201cIt fulfills our promises to secure the border, to rebuild our economy and to restore peace through strength,\u201d Barrasso said.",
      "Throughout the day, the debate was generally one-sided, as Democrats were taking full advantage of 25 hours of their available debate time, while Republicans yielded much of theirs in order to get to the all-night voting frenzy.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif, warned that Trump and Musk \u201cdo not care about you. They care about their billionaire buddies.\u201d",
      "One Republican, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, expressed his own misgivings about tax breaks adding to the federal deficits and said he has assurances that Trump officials would seek the cuts elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThis vote isn\u2019t taking place in a vacuum,\u201d he said, a nod to the turmoil over Trump's tariffs.",
      "And Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the lone vote of opposition to the plan so far, questioned the math being used by his colleagues that he said would pile on the debt load. \u201cSomething's fishy,\u201d he said.",
      "If the Senate is able to to approve the measure, as expected, it next goes to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson has already approved his chamber's version and will need to hold his slim majority together to merge the two plans.",
      "The House budget plan provided for $4.5 trillion in tax breaks over 10 years, though the amount for tax breaks would shrink if the spending cut totals don\u2019t get to $2 trillion in savings.",
      "The Senate\u2019s budget plan allows for extending the tax cuts under a scoring method that treats them as not adding to future deficits, even though a new estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation projects they will add $5.5 trillion over the next decade when including interest, and $4.6 trillion not including interest.",
      "On top of that, the budget plan allows an additional $1.5 trillion to include some of Trump\u2019s campaign promises, such as no taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and overtime. Republicans are also looking to increase the $10,000 deduction for state and local taxes, something that lawmakers from states such as New York, California and New Jersey say is necessary to get their support.",
      "Committees are also given authority to pursue as much as $521 billion to boost border security, defense and the Coast Guard, though Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has said the final spending total will be closer to $345 billion.",
      "The budget plan also allows the Senate to increase the debt ceiling by up to $5 trillion. Final approval of such an increase would allow the federal government to continue to finance its debts and push any further votes on the matter until after next year\u2019s midterm elections. Trump is wary of giving Democrats the chance to extract concessions on a debt ceiling vote.",
      "The plan also instructs four Senate committees to find at least $1 billion each in budget reductions. That's just a small fraction of the potential tax relief. But the leadership is emphasizing that the instructions purposefully set a low floor for spending cuts to provide maximum flexibility and that committees will be on the hunt for far more.",
      "Already, the GOP leaders are confronting concerns from fiscal hawks in deep red states and congressional districts who want trillions of dollars in spending cuts to help pay for the tax breaks. At the same time, dozens of lawmakers in swing districts and states are worried about what those cuts will mean for their constituents, and for their reelection chances.",
      "The GOP leadership has encouraged members to just get a budget plan over the finish line, saying they have time to work out the tough questions of which tax breaks and spending cuts to include.",
      "Throughout the debate, Democrats focused on framing the tax cuts as helping out the wealthiest at the expense of average Americans. Sen. Jeff Merkley, the lead Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, spoke with a sign behind him that read \u201cRepublican Plan: Families Lose, Billionaires Win.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat's a terrible plan,\u201d Merkley said.",
      "Extending the the 2017 breaks would cut taxes for about three-quarters of households but raise them for about 10%. In 2027, about 45% of the benefit of all the tax cuts would go to those making roughly $450,000 or more, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, which analyzes tax issues.",

      "Tariffs add on to the costs of an EV transition that was already volatile and uncertain, said Vanessa Miller, a litigation partner focused on automotive manufacturing at law firm Foley & Lardner.",
      "Biden\u2019s tax credits essentially required automakers to get more and more of their EV content from the U.S. or trade allies over the coming years in order for their vehicles to qualify. Automakers have worked to build an EV supply chain across the country and significant investment has gone toward these efforts.",
      "EVs assembled here include Tesla models, the Ford F-150 Lightning and more. Tesla actually might be least vulnerable given how much of its vehicles come from the U.S.",
      "Though the industry is growing, tariffs mean costs for automakers and their buyers will stay high and might go higher, as well as hike up the prices of the many parts of EVs still coming from China and elsewhere. From the critical minerals used in battery production to the vehicles themselves, China laps the U.S. industry.",
      "Automakers were already pulling back on ambitious electrification plans amid shrinking federal support and are strapped for cash on what is the less lucrative side of their businesses.",
      "Higher prices might push car buyers to the used car market, but they aren't likely to find much respite there.",
      "If consumers don't buy as many vehicles, automakers will have to prioritize their investments and manufacturing. That means the cars that buyers want and that are most profitable. Automakers still lose thousands of dollars on each EV they make and sell, but they make money from big, popular gas-guzzling pickup trucks and SUVs.",
      "These manufacturers \u201chave put a certain amount of investment into EVs, and it would probably be even more wasteful to completely walk away from them than it is to find the new level at which it makes sense to maintain production of them,\" said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at auto research site iSeeCars.com. That level \u201cwill assuredly be lower than what it was,\u201d he added.",
      "Making fewer EVs won\u2019t help bring their cost down further anytime soon.",
      "Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said in a statement the EV and battery sector is working to ensure that the American auto industry grows and that his group will work with the administration on productive trade policy.",
      "\u201cTariffs on our longstanding trade partners, many of whom have committed billions in direct investment into U.S. factories, introduces uncertainty and risk into an industry that is creating jobs and bringing new economic opportunities to communities across the country,\u201d Gore said.",
      "Trump has already taken a hatchet to federal EV policy. He campaigned on a vow to end what he called former President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cEV mandate.\u201d",
      "Biden\u2019s EV policies did not require automakers to sell EVs or consumers to buy them, but they did incentivize manufacturers to increase their electric offerings in the coming years. Trump put an end to Biden\u2019s target for 50% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2035 in his first days in office.",
      "Also under Biden, Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rules on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy were to get increasingly tougher, but could be met by automakers selling a growing number of EVs alongside more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles. Trump's administrators are already reevaluating emissions standards.",
      "He's also likely to seek to repeal the tax credits.",

      "There's only one way for Dampt to fight back and maintain a presence in the U.S.: bring down his prices and cut his profit. But he said \"it's not an easy thing to do\" especially now when he had already lost about 50% of his crop last year, mostly due to hail storms and killer frost.",

      "\u201cWhile this new measure will affect exports, potentially costing Bourgogne wines up to 100 million euros, it will not bring trade to a sudden halt, as would have been the case with higher tariffs,\" the trade association noted.",
      "The U.S. remained last year the largest export market for wines produced in the EU, with 4.88 billion euros ($5.36 billion), the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en des Entreprises Vins (European Committee of Wine Businesses), or CEEV, said in a statement. Exports to the U.S. accounted for 28% of the EU\u2019s total wine export value, it said.",
      "The new tariff would create \"economic uncertainty and result in layoffs, deferred investments and price increases,\u201d said Marzia Varvaglione, CEEV president. \u201cThere is no alternative wine market that could compensate the loss of the U.S. market.\"",
      "Macron denounced the tariffs as \"brutal and unfounded.\u201d In addition to the wine industry, the meeting at the Elysee palace gathered representatives from aeronautics, chemical and metal sectors, electronics, health, luxury, cosmetics and food industry.",
      "Macron said France is likely to be slightly less impacted than some of its neighbours, because exports to the U.S. represent 1.5% of France's GDP, while they represent over 3% for Italy and 4% for Germany. Yet, \u201cit\u2019s not a small thing,\u201d Macron said.",
      "He emphasized that the U.S. economy will first experience the negative impact of the tariffs.",
      "\u201cOne thing is certain, with that decision, the U.S. economy and Americans, businesses and citizens, will emerge weaker and poorer than yesterday,\u201d Macron said.",

      "Karim Souaid, who was speaking after officially taking office in Beirut, added that he will work on restructuring the banking sector, public debt and returning money to depositors.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s economy has been witnessing its worst crisis in its modern history since 2019 and the state must implement reforms demanded by the international community. Such reforms are needed to unlock international aid, and on top of that, Israel\u2019s 14-month war with Hezbollah that caused what the World Bank estimates was $11 billion in damages and economic losses.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s crisis is rooted in decades of corruption by the country\u2019s political and financial leaders that drained state resources and eventually led to a run on the banks in 2019 afterwhich people have lost access to their deposits. The situation has since been made worse with Covid-19, the massive Beirut port blast in August 2020 and the Israel-Hezbollah war.",
      "Since the historic meltdown began Lebanon has been running on a cash economy and in October, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, an international anti-money laundering watchdog, placed Lebanon on its \u201cgrey list.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will work on implementing international laws on top of them combating money laundering and supporting terrorism,\u201d Souaid said. The former asset manager added that banks in Lebanon should recapitalize by pumping new money and those that cannot and don\u2019t want to can merge with other lenders. He said that the priority will be to return deposits starting with people who have small accounts.

      "Lawmakers in Oregon and Washington are considering whether striking workers should receive unemployment benefits",
      "SEATTLE -- Lawmakers in Oregon and Washington are considering whether striking workers should receive unemployment benefits, following recent walkouts by Boeing factory workers, hospital nurses and teachers in the Pacific Northwest that highlighted a new era of American labor activism.",
      "Oregon's measure would make it the first state to provide pay for picketing public employees \u2014 who aren't allowed to strike in most states, let alone receive benefits for it. Washington's would pay striking private sector workers for up to 12 weeks, starting after at least two weeks on the line.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is this helps level the playing field,\u201d said Democratic state Sen. Marcus Riccelli, who sponsored Washington's bill. \u201cWithout a social safety net during a strike, workers are faced with tremendous pressure to end the strike quickly or never go on strike in the first place.\u201d",
      "But the bills are raising questions about how they would affect employers, especially amid economic uncertainties tied to federal funding cuts and tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate to unbalance the bargaining table in a way that forces employers to pay for the costs of a striking worker,\u201d Lindsey Hueer, government affairs director with the Association of Washington Business, told senators during a committee hearing in February. \u201cUnemployment insurance should be a safety net for workers who have no job to return to.\"",
      "So far only two states, New York and New Jersey, give striking workers unemployment benefits. Senate Democrats in Connecticut have revived legislation that would provide financial help for striking workers after the governor vetoed a similar measure last year.",
      "The measures in Washington and Oregon have been passed by the state Senate of each and are now in the House. The Washington bill faces its final committee hearings on Friday and Monday.",
      "The Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit, pro-labor think tank in Washington, D.C., has studied the effects of giving unemployment benefits to striking workers and found it to be good for workers and employers alike, said Daniel Perez, state economic analyst for the organization.",
      "First, he said, lengthy strikes are extremely rare. More than half of U.S. labor strikes end within two days \u2014 workers wouldn't receive pay in those cases \u2014 and just 14% last more than two weeks. Second, the policy costs very little \u2014 less than 1% of unemployment insurance expenditures in every state that has considered legislation.",
      "Bryan Corliss, spokesperson for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace union, told The Associated Press that the big winners would be low-wage workers.",
      "\u201cIf low-wage workers had the financial stability to actually go on strike for more than a day or two without risking eviction, we believe that would incentivize companies to actually come to the table and make a deal,\" he said.",
      "During a hearing in the Washington House labor committee last week, several Republican lawmakers tried to amend the bill to require striking workers to look for other jobs or to shorten the time covered from 12 weeks to four. The Democratic majority shot those ideas down.",
      "Republican Rep. Suzanne Schmidt said the bill might be good for workers, but it would hurt employers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen instances of this with the Boeing strike last year for the machinists,\" she said. \"We had 32,000 people on strike at the same time and if this had been in play it would have cost millions of dollars to cover those workers. Boeing did actually lose billions having the workers on strike for several months.\u201d",
      "The Oregon bill, which also would make striking workers eligible for unemployment benefits after two weeks, sparked a similar debate, both among Democratic and Republican lawmakers as well as constituents, with hundreds of people submitting written testimony.",
      "The state has seen two large strikes in recent years: Thousands of nurses and dozens of doctors at Providence's eight Oregon hospitals were on strike for six weeks earlier this year, while a 2023 walkout of Portland Public Schools teachers shuttered schools for over three weeks in the state's largest district.",
      "The Oregon Senate passed the measure largely along party lines, with two Democrats voting against it.",
      "On the Senate floor, Democratic Sen. Janeen Sollman said she worried about the effect on public employers such as school districts, which \u201cdo not have access to extra pots of money.\u201d Private employers pay into the state's unemployment trust fund through a payroll tax, but few public employers do, meaning that they would have to reimburse the fund for any payments made to their workers.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Gorsek, who supported the bill, argued it wouldn't cost public employers more than what they've already budgeted for salaries, as workers aren't paid when they're on strike. Also, those receiving unemployment benefits get at most 65% of their weekly pay, and benefit amounts are capped, according to a document presented to lawmakers by employment department officials.",
      "\u201cUnemployment insurance is partial wage replacement, so unemployment insurance in and of itself is not an additional cost to the employer,\" Gorsek said. \u201cIn fact, the only way Senate Bill 916 would yield additional cost for what was already budgeted by the employer is if the employer decided to hire replacement workers.\u201d",

      "After a long wait, the Senate is launching action on President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201d\u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d of tax breaks and spending cuts",
      "WASHINGTON -- After a long wait, the Senate is launching action on President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\u201d of tax breaks and spending cuts at a risky moment for the U.S. and global economy.",
      "More than a month after House Republicans surprised Washington by advancing their framework for Trump's $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $2 trillion in spending cuts, Senate Republicans voted Thursday to start working on their version. The largely party-line vote, 52-48, sets the stage for a potential Senate all-nighter Friday spilling into the weekend.",
      "But work on the multitrillion-dollar package is coming as markets at home and abroad are on edge in the aftermath Trump's vast tariffs scheme, complicating an already difficult political and procedural undertaking on what Republicans hope will become their signature domestic policy package.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., opened the chamber Thursday saying they expected to be ready to begin.",
      "Trump says he's on board with the plan and Republicans, in control of Congress, are eager to show the party is making progress toward delivering on their campaign promises. By nightfall, as voting began, one Republican, the libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against, as did all Democrats.",
      "Democrats, as the minority party, don't have the votes to stop the GOP plan. But they intend to use the procedural tools available to prolong the process. Democrats argue that Republicans are focusing on tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of the programs and services millions of Americans rely on for help with health care, child care, school lunches and other everyday needs.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re mean, they\u2019re nasty, they\u2019re uncaring,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said about the Republicans. \u201cWe, tonight and tomorrow, are going to show just who they are.\"",
      "Senate Democrats started consuming up to 25 hours of their available debate time, holding the floor into the night and railing against potential GOP cuts to Medicaid, veterans programs, DOGE cuts and the impact of Trump's tariffs.",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Budget committee, repeated a slogan he has been sharing: \u201cFamilies lose and billionaires win.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat,\" he said, \u201cis the Republican plan.\u201d",
      "Fundamental to the Senate package is making sure Trump\u2019s first-term tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of the year, are continued and made a permanent fixture of the tax code. The senators also will consider adding Trump's proposed tax cuts on tipped wages, Social Security income and others.",
      "The Senate package also would bolster border security funds by some $175 billion to carry out Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign, which is running short of cash, and it would add national security funds for the Pentagon \u2014 all priorities the Senate GOP tucked into an earlier version that was panned by House Republicans.",
      "Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the party whip, said that without action tax cuts would expire, becoming a $4 trillion tax hike on Americans. \u201cRepublicans are focused on getting America back on track,\u201d he said.",
      "What's unclear is how it will all be paid for, since Republican deficit hawks typically require spending offsets to help defray the lost tax revenue and avoid piling onto the nation's $36 trillion debt load.",
      "While House Republicans approved their package with $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and up to $2 trillion in spending cuts, the Senate Republicans are taking a different tack.",
      "Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham is making the case that since the existing Trump tax breaks are the current policy, they are not considered new, and do not need to be offset with reductions in spending \u2014 an approach Democrats compare to \u201cgoing nuclear\u201d with the normal rules, particularly if the strategy is put to the test with an unfavorable ruling before the Senate parliamentarian.",
      "Instead, Senate Republicans are considering offsets mostly for any new Trump tax breaks. Raising alarms from the most conservative budget hawks, the senators have set a floor of about $4 billion in budget reductions to health and other programs \u2014 a fraction of the package's expected $4 trillion-plus price tag for tax breaks.",
      "GOP leaders are assuring the deficit hawks within their own ranks that the legislation says the cuts can rise to as much as $2 trillion.",
      "After an expected Friday night vote-a-rama, with dozens of amendments being offered to the package, the senators are planning to stay into Saturday if needed to take a final vote to approve it, sending it to the House for action.",
      "The House and Senate will ultimately need to merge their frameworks into a final product, expected in May, but House Speaker Mike Johnson's intention to have it all wrapped up by Memorial Day could prove optimistic.",
      "The political environment is uncertain, and the public's appetite for steep budget cuts is being tested in real time, with Trump's Department of Government Efficiency headed by billionaire Elon Musk blazing through federal offices, firing thousands of workers and shuttering long-running government mainstays \u2014 from scientific research projects on diseases to educational services for schoolchildren to offices that help with Social Security, tax filing and the weather.",
      "At the same time, the staunchest fiscal conservatives in both the House and Senate, many aligned with the Freedom Caucus, are pushing for even more cuts.",
      "Trump told senators publicly and privately this week he would have their backs, particularly when it comes to standing up for the spending reductions. At a White House announcing the tariffs Wednesday, Trump said the Senate plan had his \u201ccomplete and total support.\u201d",
      "The president's steep tariffs threw the global economy into a tailspin Thursday, with stocks down around the world, the U.S. markets leading the way.",

      "An executive order the president signed Wednesday will eliminate the \u201cde minimis provision\u201d for goods from China and Hong Kong on May 2. The tax exemption, which applies to packages valued at $800 or less, has helped China-founded e-commerce companies like Shein and Temu to thrive while cutting into the U.S. retail market.",
      "\u201cShoppers had a full array of product and options of timing,\u201d Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor at market research firm Circana, said. \u201cNow, they\u2019re going to have a limited array of options and timing: so you can still buy this product, but you may have to wait three or four weeks.\u201d",
      "U.S. politicians, law enforcement agencies and business groups have described the long-standing policy as a trade loophole that gave inexpensive Chinese goods an advantage and served as a portal for illicit drugs and counterfeits to enter the country.",
      "The sweeping tariffs Trump announced on Wednesday also aim to end the duty-free exception for all imported goods worth less than $800, but only when the U.S. government has the personnel in place to process parcels from every country.",
      "A White House fact sheet said small packages of Chinese products sent through the international postal network will be subject to a duty rate of either 30% of their value or $25 per item, an amount that will increase to $50 per item after June 1.",
      "Commercial carriers such as FedEx and UPS will be required to report shipment details and remit the appropriate duties to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, according to the White House. After Trump's latest round of tariffs, the tariff rate for Chinese products will be at least 54%.",
      "Supporters of the de minimis exception have argued that its elimination would drive up costs and hurt low-income consumers and small businesses.",
      "The tariff costs threaten to deal a blow to the U.S. operations of companies like Shein and Temu, which rapidly expanded in the U.S. using the de minimis provision to deliver ultra-cheap fast fashion items from China.",
      "However, it's unclear what impact the loss of the tax exemption will have on the two online retailers, as well as on American companies like Amazon and Walmart, whose platforms include virtual marketplaces where international sellers offer products.",
      "Shein and Temu already have been building warehouses in the U.S. so they could get orders to U.S. shoppers more quickly. Shein recently opened a fulfillment and logistics hub in the Seattle area. Neither company could be reached for comment Thursday.",
      "Ram Ben Tzion, chief executive officer of the digital vetting platform Publican, said he expected the companies to \u201cbe forced to rethink their business strategy and possibly explore opting out of the U.S. market.\u201d",
      "In an emailed statement to AP, FedEx said it would support its customers to adapt to the new regulatory requirements and said it would be important for shippers to have \u201cpaperwork completed correctly ahead of pick-up\u201d for shipments to move smoothly.",
      "Hilton Beckham, an assistant commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the federal agency was ready to implement the latest tariffs.",
      "\u201cOur automated systems are fully updated to capture, assess, and administer all new duties, and clear guidance will be provided to support uniform enforcement across the nation,\u201d Beckham said.",
      "Ben Tzion, of Publican, said he would \u201chighly doubt\u201d the U.S. government was ready to process the huge number of low-value shipments to be taxed starting next month.",
      "The Hong Kong government said the HongKong Post would \u201ctemporarily maintain\u201d postal services to the U.S through May 2 but \u201cwill not collect any so-called tariffs on behalf of the U.S. authorities.\u201d",
      "Introduced in 1938, the de minimis exception was intended to facilitate the flow of small packages valued at no more than $5, the equivalent of about $109 today. The threshold increased to $200 in 1994 and $800 in 2016. But the rapid rise of cross-border e-commerce, driven by China, has challenged the intent of the decades-old customs exception rule.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service. And the U.S. market has been a major destination.",
      "The Chinese government, which sees cross-border e-commerce as a critical part of its foreign trade, has introduced favorable policies, including financial support and infrastructure building, to foster its growth.",
      "Former President Joe Biden proposed a rule last year that said foreign companies can\u2019t avoid tariffs simply by shipping goods that they claim to be worth $800 or less. Trump tried in February to end the exception but his initial order was called off within days when it appeared the U.S. was not prepared to process and collect tariffs on the millions of parcels.",
      "U.S. Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, said she was pleased Trump acted a second time to eliminate the rule.",
      "\u201cFor too long, this customs loophole has let foreign exporters flood our market with cheap goods and helped drug traffickers move fentanyl past our borders \u2014 resulting in factory closures, job losses, and deaths,\u201d DeLauro said.",
      "In 2023, for the first time, more than 1 billion such packages came through U.S. customs, up from 134 million in 2015. By the end of last year, Customs and Border Protection said it was processing about 4 million small shipments a day.",
      "The cheap prices and increasing popularity of Shein and Temu squeezed fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M. Forever 21 blamed the tax exemption in part for its decision to file for bankruptcy last month  and close its U.S. stores,",
      "\u201cWe have been unable to find a sustainable path forward, given competition from foreign fast-fashion companies, which have been able to take advantage of the de minimis exemption to undercut our brand on pricing and margin,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brad Sell said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon launched late last year a low- cost online storefront featuring electronics, apparel and other products priced under $20, in an apparent effort to compete with Temu and Shein. Amazon shipped the products to U.S. customers from a warehouse it operates in China, according to documentation the company provided to sellers.",

      "Mexico is celebrating having dodged the latest round of tariffs from the White House taking aim at dozens of U.S. trading partners around the world",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico celebrated Thursday having dodged the latest round of tariffs from the White House taking aim at dozens of U.S. trading partners around the world, but was also quickly reminded that in a global economy the effects of uncertainty can\u2019t be entirely avoided.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum said the free-trade agreement signed by Mexico, Canada and the U.S. during Trump\u2019s first administration had shielded Mexico.",
      "Now her government will focus on the existing 25% U.S. tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum, while accelerating domestic production to safeguard jobs and reduce imports.",
      "\u201cDuring my last call with President Trump, I said that, in the case of reciprocal tariffs, my understanding was that there wouldn\u2019t be tariffs (on Mexico), because Mexico doesn\u2019t place tariffs on the United States,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard noted that despite having free-trade agreements with the U.S., many countries were targeted by the tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump announced Wednesday on what he dubbed \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d Trump framed the tariffs as a way to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.",
      "Noting that Mexico escaped the latest round of tariffs, Ebrard said swaths of Mexican exports including agricultural products like avocados, clothing and electronics will continue to enter the U.S. without import duties.",
      "Ebrard said it wasn't a given that the free-trade agreement would be preserved, \u201cbecause in a new commercial order based on tariffs it's very hard for a free-trade agreement to survive.\u201d The fact that it did, puts Mexico at a competitive advantage, because \u201cit's going to be cheaper to produce in Mexico than in any other part of the world.\u201d",
      "Oscar Ocampo, a specialist in foreign trade at the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, a think tank, said \u201cthe United States is closing off to the rest of the world and in relative terms closing off less with Mexico and that is an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum is seeking to use that opportunity to encourage companies producing in Mexico who had not been exporting under the free-trade agreement for various reasons to take the necessary steps to qualify. She cited major German auto producers as an example.",
      "Qualifying for the free-trade agreement could involve anything from doing paperwork to making adjustments to the sourcing of a product.",
      "Despite Trump's latest tariffs not being imposed on Mexico, the uncertainty they created and the interconnectedness of the North American auto supply chains meant it didn\u2019t take long for the effects to touch Mexico.",
      "Stellantis, maker of auto brands including Dodge and Jeep, announced that it would pause production at its assembly plant in Toluca west of Mexico City for the month of April while it assesses the tariffs' impact on its operations. The company has more than 15,000 employees in Mexico. A similar temporary production halt was scheduled for an assembly plant in Canada and some 900 workers were to be temporarily laid off across several plants in the United States.",
      "That uncertainty is part of the reasons why Sheinbaum is pushing Plan Mexico, an initiative to promote and cultivate more domestic production.",
      "As an example, she cited a collaboration between her government, local universities and Mexican companies Megaflux and Dina to produce electric buses for public transportation.",
      "Ebrard said recently that the buses represent not only a technological advance in Mexico, but also a \u201cstrategic decision\u201d in favor of Mexico\u2019s industrial sovereignty.",
      "At a factory in Mexico City, the electric buses called Taruk \u2014 trail-runner in the Indigenous Yaqui language \u2013 are already in production. Megaflux Director General Roberto Gottfried said the company hopes to deliver some 200 by year's end.",
      "He noted that some 70% of the Taruk's components are produced in Mexico, including its motor, but the lithium batteries that power them come from China.",
      "In a country where one out of every three people use public transportation every day, developing this sector domestically is critical, Gottfried said.",
      "Despite the global economic challenges presented by the uncertainty caused by tariffs, he said, Mexico\u2019s large internal market gives the initiative a competitive advantage to develop and weather the storm.",

      "Eastern Congo has been in conflict for decades with more than 100 armed groups, most of which are vying for territory in the mineral-rich region near the border with Rwanda. The conflict has created one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises with more than 7 million people displaced, including 100,000 who fled homes this year.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's expansive new tariffs reverse a decades-long global trend of lower trade barriers and are likely, economists say, to raise prices for Americans by thousands of dollars each year while sharply slowing the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House is gambling that other countries will also suffer enough pain that they will open up their economies to more American exports, leading to negotiations that would reduce the tariffs imposed Wednesday.",
      "Or, the White House hopes, companies will reverse their moves toward global supply chains and bring more production to the United States to avoid higher import taxes.",
      "But a key question for the Trump administration will be how Americans react to the tariffs. If prices rise noticeably and jobs are lost, voters could turn against the duties and make it harder to keep them in place for the time needed to encourage companies to return to the U.S.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab estimates the Trump administration's tariffs would cost the average household $3,800 in higher prices this year. That includes the 10% universal tariff plus much higher tariffs on about 60 countries announced Wednesday, as well as previous import taxes on steel, aluminum and cars. Inflation could top 4% this year, from 2.8% currently, while the economy may barely grow, according to estimates by Nationwide Financial.",

      "\u201cI think it\u2019s going very well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an operation, like when a patient gets operated on and it\u2019s a big thing. I said this would exactly be the way it is.\"",
      "The average U.S. tariff could rise to nearly 25% when the tariffs are fully implemented April 9, economists estimate, higher than in more than a century, and higher than the 1930 Smoot-Hawley tariffs that are widely blamed for worsening the Great Depression.",
      "\u201cThe president just announced the de facto separation of the U.S. economy from the global economy,\u201d said Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Relations. \u201cThe stage is set for higher prices and slower growth over the long term.\"",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick argued the policies will help open markets overseas for U.S. exports.",
      "\u201cI expect most countries to start to really examine their trade policy towards the United States of America, and stop picking on us,\u201d he said on CNBC Thursday. \u201dThis is the reordering of fair trade.\u201d",
      "Bob Lehmann, 73, who stopped by a Best Buy in Portland, Oregon, Wednesday opposed the tariffs. \u201cThey\u2019re going to raise prices and cause people to pay more for daily living,\u201d he said.",
      "Mathew Hall, a 64-year-old paint contractor, called the tariffs a \u201cgreat idea\u201d and said potential price increases in the short term were worth it.",
      "\u201cI believe in the long term, it\u2019s going to be good,\u201d he said, adding that he felt the U.S. had been taken advantage of.",
      "But a former trade official from Trump\u2019s first term, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the impact, suggested that Americans, including those who voted for Trump, may have difficulty accepting the stiff duties.",
      "Americans \u201chave never faced tariffs like this,\u201d the former official said Thursday. \u201cThe downstream impact on clothing and shoe stores, it\u2019s going to be pretty significant. So we\u2019ll have to see how the Trump voters view this ... and how long their support for these policies goes.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, automaker Stellantis, which owns the Jeep, Citroen and Ram brands, said it would temporarily halt production at plants in Canada and Mexico in response to Trump's 25% tax on imported cars. The reduced output means the company is temporarily laying off 900 workers at plants in Michigan and Indiana.",
      "Some exporters overseas may cut their prices to offset some of the tariffs, and U.S. retailers could eat some of the cost as well. But most economists expect much of the tariffs to bring higher prices.",
      "The tariffs will hit many Asian countries hard, with duties on Vietnamese imports rising to 46% and on Indonesia to 32%. Tariffs on some Chinese imports will be as high as 79%. Those three countries are the top sources of U.S. shoe imports, with Nike making about half its shoes last year and one-third of its clothes in Vietnam.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab estimates all Trump\u2019s tariffs this year will push clothing prices 17% higher.",
      "On Thursday, the Home Furnishings Association, which represents more than 13,000 U.S. furniture stores, predicted the tariffs will increase prices between 10% and 46%. Vietnam and China are the top furniture exporters to the U.S.",
      "It said manufacturers in Asia are offsetting some of the costs by discounting their products and lowering ocean freight rates, but that won't be enough to avoid price hikes. Even domestically made furniture often relies on imported components.",
      "\u201cWhile many in the industry support the long-term goal of reshoring manufacturing, the reality is that it will take at least a decade to scale domestic production,\u201d Home Furnishings Association CEO Shannon Williams said in a statement. \u201cPermitting, training a skilled workforce and managing the higher costs of U.S. manufacturing are significant hurdles.\u201d",
      "At Gethsemane Garden Center in Chicago, there are Canadian-grown tulip, daffodil and hyacinth bulbs, though only about 5% of center plants are imported. Thousands of lemon cypress trees from Canada are sold year-round and Canadian mums are sold in the fall.",
      "Regas Chefas, whose family has owned Gethsemane for decades, says all the tariffs won't be passed onto customers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to absorb some of the increase. The growers will absorb some of the increases and then the customers will pay a little bit higher price,\u201d he said.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, which represents Coca-Cola, General Mills, Nestle, Tyson and Del Monte as well as Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, said its companies already make the majority of their goods in the U.S.",
      "But there are critical ingredients and inputs \u2014 like wood pulp for toilet paper \u2014 that are imported because of scarce domestic availability. Cinnamon is harvested from trees that can\u2019t survive in the U.S.. Domestic production of coffee and cocoa is also limited.",
      "\u201cWe encourage President Trump and his trade advisers to fine-tune their approach and exempt key ingredients and inputs in order to protect manufacturing jobs and prevent unnecessary inflation at the grocery store,\u201d said Tom Madrecki, the association\u2019s vice president of supply chain resiliency.",
      "Outside a Tractor Supply south of Denver, two family members on opposite sides of the political spectrum debated the tariffs.",
      "Chris Theisen, a 62-year-old Republican, said: \u201cI feel a good change coming on, I feel it\u2019s going to be hard, but you don\u2019t go to the gym and walk away and say, \u2019God, I feel great.\u201d",
      "Nayen Shakya, a Democrat and Theisen\u2019s great nephew, said higher prices are already a hardship. At the restaurant where he works, menu prices have been raised to account for higher ingredient costs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really easy sometimes to say some things in a vague way that everyone can agree with that is definitely more complex under the surface,\u201d said Shakya. \"The burden of the increased prices is already going to the consumer.\u201d",

      "The yield slid to 4.06% Thursday as a sharp sell-off on Wall Street following the White House\u2019s latest and most severe volley of tariffs fueled expectations among bond investors that the Fed may have to cut its main interest rate if the economy sours.",

      "Easing mortgage rates and more homes on the market nationally helped drive sales higher in February from the previous month, though they were down year-over-year.",
      "Even with mortgage rates easing this year, rising home prices are helping to drive up the cost of homeownership. The typical monthly payment made by U.S. homebuyers climbed to a record-high $2,802 in the four weeks that ended March 20, according to Redfin.",

      "Nearly a century after its opening, Studio One underwent a six-month, multimillion-pound refurbishment, with the main priority being the preservation of one very important thing: the sound.",
      "\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to do is change the acoustics, so every minute detail in the room has been conserved and preserved, so the sound doesn't shift,\u201d said Sally Davies, managing director of Abbey Road Studios.",
      "The reverb of the 4,844-square-foot (450-square-meter) room has been maintained at 2.3 seconds, the same as it was in the 1970s. There\u2019s been no redecorating or style makeover, leaving the original Art Deco wall panels untouched.",
      "\u201cWe have simply washed down the walls to preserve that sound,\u201d said Davies, adding that the floor was re-sanded and oiled, but not varnished. Most of the upgrades, she explained, are technological upgrades in the control room. \u201cThis room is just about preserving that magic.\u201d",
      "Opened in 1931, this hallowed hall \u2014 once a nine-bedroom house on a grand suburban street in London\u2019s St. John\u2019s Wood neighborhood \u2014 became the world\u2019s first recording studio. It\u2019s where stereo was invented and it\u2019s visited every day by music fans from around the world, who are happy just to stand on the street outside.",
      "Davies says that more than a million people a year make a pilgrimage to the crossing outside, many to recreate the cover of The Beatles' \u201cAbbey Road\u201d album \u2014 and that number could increase after Sam Mendes\u2019 upcoming biopics starring Paul Mescal, Barry Keoghan, Harris Dickinson and Joseph Quinn as the Fab Four.",
      "And while John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr are famously known for using Studio Two, they also made history in the larger Studio One, which they used for the world\u2019s first global live performance, a rendition of \u201cAll You Need Is Love\u201d beamed to television sets around the world in 1967.",
      "Before The Beatles, Studio One had already cemented its place in music history, when it was opened by British composer Sir Edward Elgar, who recorded his \u201cLand of Hope and Glory\u201d with the London Symphony Orchestra. It\u2019s also hosted other music greats like Maria Callas, Igor Stravinsky, Daniel Barenboim, Fats Waller and Glenn Miller.",
      "Due to its huge size, more than double Studio Two, it can fit a 100-piece orchestra and 100-member choir at the same time \u2014 which is perfect for recording film soundtracks, and explains why six to seven out of every 10 Hollywood films are scored at Abbey Road, according to the studio.",
      "Standing on the balcony, overlooking the 40-foot-high (12-meter-high) room, Davies points out the original screen that was used to show \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d (1981) while musicians played along to record the soundtrack.",
      "Since then, everything from \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d trilogy to Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d to \u201cBarbie\u201d were scored in Studio One. For the last, all the musicians came in with something pink, whether a pink instrument or piece of clothing.",
      "Oscar-nominated composer Daniel Pemberton has been recording in Studio One since 2009 and calls his \u201ccreative home\u201d a \u201cspectacular space.\u201d",
      "\u201cOutside, it just looks like a normal house. And then you come in and you find this space in it that\u2019s like almost the size of a football pitch. In fact, I have played football in there once,\u201d he laughs.",
      "Pemberton is known for scoring \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider Verse,\u201d \u201cFerrari,\u201d \u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7\u201d and creating the \u201cSlow Horses\u201d theme song and \u201cStrange Game,\u201d with Mick Jagger.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s so exciting about a room like Studio One is what happens on the day is what happens for the rest of time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like history is being made, whether it\u2019s good history or bad history or whatever, you\u2019re making a moment then.\u201d",
      "Pemberton notes the stories, whether personal or musical, that have unfolded within the walls of Studio One.",
      "\u201cThe ghosts are insane in there,\u201d he said.",
      "Davies agrees that the history adds to the enchantment.",
      "\u201cYou walk into this room and you can feel it. \u2026 There is a magic in the sound. It sounds phenomenal. There is a spirituality in who has been here, who has performed here,\u201d she says. \u201cSo when we see artists come through, you know that immediate reaction of, \u2018Oh my gosh. I\u2019m in Studio One.\u2019\u201d",
      "To celebrate the reopening this week, Abbey Road Studios showcased an unusual art form for the space: dance, which incorporated Pemberton\u2019s scores, remixed by resident artist Jordan Rakei and choreographed by Joseph Toonga.",
      "\u201cIt kind of like threw me back a bit like, wow, it really is big,\u201d said Toonga of the first time he saw the studio. He then incorporated that feeling into a dance which spanned hip-hop, krumping and ballet.",
      "Up next, the first client to record in Studio One since the refurbishment is a hush-hush Hollywood franchise.",
      "But there are lots of secrets at Abbey Road. One of them is Pemberton\u2019s plan to record the unique rattling sound of the new railings for a movie soundtrack.",
      "There was concern that the hollow, Art Deco-style bars would upset the acoustics of the room, and a backup plan was made to fill them with sand if they messed with the reverb.",
      "Luckily, the empty bars were allowed to stay because Pemberton is delighted by the noise they make when you run past them with keys \u2014 it\u2019s another dramatic sound that can only be created in Studio One and will make its way into theaters around the world, via a film score.",

      "Lula\u2019s approval rating has dropped to 24%, according to the country\u2019s most prominent pollster Datafolha in its latest February poll, which interviewed 2,007 people across Brazil with a margin of error of 2 percentage points. That is an all-time low across his time in office from 2003 to 2010, and since he took office again in 2023. The previous record was 28% in 2005.

      "For many observers, the increase in the cost of food is a top reason for Lula\u2019s fall in popularity. Food and drinks were nearly 8% more expensive in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to Brazil's national statistics agency.",
      "\u201cFood inflation has a direct impact on people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Carla Beni, a professor of economics at Getulio Vargas Foundation, pointing especially to the rise of the cost of meat, a staple of Brazilians' diet.",

In six months, the percentage of respondents who disapprove of Lula's administration in the northeast jumped from 26% to 46%.

      "But the measure does not appear to have turned the public\u2019s perception of the government.

      "A blow to Lula came in January, when his government said it would increase oversight of financial transactions, including Brazil\u2019s popular instant payment system PIX.",
      "That sparked a flurry of fake news pushed by far-right politicians close to Bolsonaro, who said the government planned to impose a new tax on PIX payments. The administration denied the accusation, but ended up backtracking on the step.",
      "\u201cThat was the first point that really damaged Lula\u2019s image,\u201d said Paulo Feldmann, an economist at the University of Sao Paulo.",

      "An executive order President Donald Trump signed with the goal of ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government and beyond has created additional uncertainty around the future of ERGs. Here is some information about starting, participating in or evaluating the groups at your company:",
      "The Equal Employment Opportunities Commission released guidance in March which said that limiting membership in ERGs to workers covered by anti-discrimination laws, such as only women or people of a particular race, can be considered unlawful segregation.",
      "To comply with the EEOC's interpretation, employers should ensure workplace groups are open to all employees.",
      "\u201cThey want to make sure these programs are not offering some tangible benefit to one group of employees at the expense of another,\u201d said Infinito Associates CEO Kevin England, whose consulting group helps organizations start ERGs.",
      "If an ERG offers mentorship or opportunities only to people who identify as a member of a legally protected class, \"you absolutely do need to open that up,\u201d said David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law.",
      "Some employee resource groups organized around an identity create separate email lists for members who share the identity and members who describe themselves as allies. Glasgow advises against doing that. \u201cIt raises the question of what you're excluding people from,\u201d he said.",
      "The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, a conservative public interest law firm and policy organization, has received dozens of complaints from employees who felt excluded from their workplace ERGs, according to Deputy Counsel Dan Lennington. Opening employee groups to everyone will not necessarily satisfy those concerns, he said.",
      "\u201cThe question is, are you treating employees differently based on race?\u201d Lennington said. \u201cAre you making employees feel uncomfortable about their race or gender or sexual identity?\u201d",
      "Proponents of ERGs list numerous benefits for employees and management. For participants, the groups are places to find community, develop leadership skills and create a channel for sharing their views with higher-ups. Companies often sponsor affinity groups as a tool for recruiting and retaining diverse employees.",
      "\u201cEmployee engagement is great because it creates, typically, higher effort and retention,\u201d said Helena Pagano, chief people and culture officer at insurance and financial services firm Sun Life. \u201cOne way that you drive engagement is making people feel like they had a voice. They had a place to express opinions and drive policies and outcomes that matter in the company.\u201d",
      "England, the consultant, was working at a bank call center when he joined and then took on a leadership role in an ERG for people who identify as LGBTQIA+.",
      "\u201cI was terrified to speak publicly, and because of that role, I had to do a lot of that,\u201d England said. \u201cI was able to develop skills that were completely unrelated to my day job.\"",
      "Anna Ettin co-founded Bank of America\u2019s intergenerational employee network about a decade ago, and worked on bridging gaps between millennials and baby boomers. Now, as co-founder of Tapestry Partner Solutions, a consulting group that specializes in intergenerational dynamics and skills development, she's doing the same work with Generation Z.",
      "\u201cThere are some real differences in the way they\u2019re coming into the workplace and what their needs are, their expectations,\" Ettin said. \u201cWe\u2019re really helping companies think through, how do you retain the incredibly talented staff you have and also be appetizing to Gen Z?\u201d",
      "When Ettin worked in a call center about 20 years ago, she noticed few women in management roles. \u201cThere was a clear gap in the leadership pipeline for women,\u201d she said. She gathered 20 highly engaged women and they started by planning events on interviewing skills, resume writing and talks with senior female leaders about their career paths and obstacles they'd overcome.",
      "Experts recommend finding a senior leader to act as a sponsor. In Ettin's case, that meant convincing the call center manager to approve and participate in the group.",
      "Groups typically begin when 10 or 20 people find each other organically and get together for happy hours or lunches, England said. \u201cYou get some momentum going, and sometimes that group of 20 people becomes 50 or 100 people,\u201d he added.",
      "Then you can tell leaders, \u201cwe already have an informal collection of employees with this shared experience, and we would love to do something more with this,\" England said. \"We think that this group of friends and colleagues could help the organization.\u201d",
      "Some ERGs are given company funds for meals, events or travel to conferences. A new group should be prepared to make a business case for a budget request. Experts also advise collecting data to show the group\u2019s impact in areas such as employee retention.",
      "It's easier to start a new ERG when an organization already has one in place because there's a road map of what worked and who supported the initial group. But if none exist at your workplace, you can start with one and build from there, Jang said. \u201cThere is no perfect recipe,\u201d she said. \u201cStart small.\u201d",
      "As organizations absorb various federal directives, they're deciding which direction to take. Some have adjusted to make it clear that all are welcome. Others have shuttered their ERGs altogether, wiping out years of work, Ettin said.",
      "\u201cThe underrepresented, underserved communities still need the programs, support, connectivity and advocacy that they\u2019ve needed for the last decades,\" Ettin added. \"That hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d",

      "Journalists in Haiti are under attack like never before",
      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- Jean-Jacques Asperges once relished returning home after a long day working at a radio station in one of the world\u2019s most dangerous places for journalists.",
      "He had a roof and four walls for protection, but gang violence forced him and his family to flee their home twice.",
      "Now, Asperges, 58, his wife and their two children are forced to sleep on the floor of a soiled and overcrowded makeshift shelter with thousands of other Haitians also left homeless by gang violence.",
      "\u201cBullets fall here all the time,\u201d he said.",
      "Having lost all his work equipment, Asperges relies solely on his phone, but he remains undeterred like dozens of other journalists in Haiti who are under attack like never before. They are dodging bullets, defying censorship and setting personal struggles aside as they document the downfall of Haiti\u2019s capital and the surge in violence blamed on powerful gangs that control 85% of Port-au-Prince.",
      "Heavily armed gangs attacked at least three TV and radio stations in March. Two of the buildings were already abandoned because of previous violence, but gunmen stole equipment that had been left behind.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a message: You don\u2019t operate without our permission, and you don\u2019t operate at all in our turf,\u201d said David C. Adams, an expert on press freedom issues in Haiti.",
      "Gangs sent an even deadlier message on Christmas Eve, when they opened fire on journalists covering the failed reopening of Haiti\u2019s largest public hospital, saying they had not authorized its reopening.",
      "Two journalists were killed and at least seven others were injured, including Asperges, who was shot in the stomach. It was the worst attack on reporters in Haiti in recent history.",
      "\u201cEveryone is threatened. Everyone is under pressure,\u201d said Max Chauvet, director of operations at Le Nouvelliste, Haiti\u2019s oldest independent newspaper.",
      "Donning a bulletproof vest emblazoned with \u201cPRESS\u201d on it is now a dangerous move in Haiti. What used to serve as a symbolic and physical shield has become a target.",
      "At least 10 journalists covering a major March protest were attacked, including Jephte Bazil, a videographer who runs his own media company, Machann Zen Ha\u00efti.",
      "He was threading his way through a protest in the Canap\u00e9-Vert neighborhood of Port-au-Prince when three men dressed in black and with their faces covered called him over.",
      "\u201cWhat the hell are you doing around here?\u201d Bazil recalled them asking.",
      "They searched his bag, took away his cellphone and demanded multiple forms of ID. Bazil handed over only his passport, keeping his ID card hidden because it stated he was from Martissant, a community that gangs seized several years ago. He was too scared to show it and possibly be accused of being a gang member or a sympathizer.",
      "\u201cI believe I could have been killed,\u201d Bazil said.",
      "After an interrogation that lasted at least half an hour, Bazil said the men released him. As he walked away, one followed him with a machete to see if he was headed where he said he was going.",
      "Once he reached his destination, Bazil said the man told him: \u201cIf you had made any other turn, I would have\u2026cut your head off.\u201d",
      "It was not the first time Bazil feared for his life. He was injured in December\u2019s hospital attack and, in February, while covering a confrontation between police and gangs, his motorcycle was shot but he was spared.",
      "\u201cJournalists are targets now, whether police or gangs,\u201d he said.",
      "Haitians increasingly distrust the media, accusing local journalists of working for gangs. Meanwhile, gang members have taken to social media to threaten journalists. One gang leader said he would kidnap radio reporters and ensure they won\u2019t ever talk into a microphone again, while another threatened a talk show host based outside of Haiti, saying that if he ever set foot in the country, it would be the last time he would do so.",
      "As a result, Haiti\u2019s Online Media Collective has advised that journalists not cover incidents involving armed groups.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just journalists who are the victims, it\u2019s press freedom itself,\u201d said Obest Dimanche, the collective\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "But given the persistent attacks by heavily armed gangs in the capital and beyond, most journalists disregard that advice.",
      "They travel in packs and zoom around on motorcycles through Port-au-Prince\u2019s hilly neighborhoods, ducking in unison when shots are fired. At the end of the day, they check in on each other to ensure everyone returned safely home. Those who lost their homes to gang violence like Asperges go back to a shelter while others sleep on the floor of their media company.",
      "\u201cYou feel in danger doing your job nowadays,\u201d said Jean Daniel S\u00e9nat, a journalist at Le Nouvelliste and Magik9 radio station.",
      "He lamented how journalists no longer have access to many neighborhoods in the capital because of gang violence: \u201cIf you can\u2019t talk to the people\u2026you won\u2019t be able to report.\u201d",
      "The violence also has forced media companies to close, lay off reporters or stop printing, as was the case for Le Nouvelliste when gunmen attacked and occupied its offices last year. Since then, the newspaper has operated solely online.",
      "On March 13, Haiti\u2019s prime minister condemned the attack on the building that once housed Radio et T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Cara\u00efbes, the country\u2019s oldest radio station, and pledged to protect media institutions.",
      "Located on Rue Chavannes, the station\u2019s former headquarters were considered a \u201cheritage monument,\u201d said journalist Richecarde C\u00e9lestin, who works for the station.",
      "Founded in 1949, the station has reported on Haiti\u2019s tumultuous history: its coups, dictatorships and first democratic elections.",
      "Considered one of Haiti\u2019s most influential radio stations, it was a blow to many to see smoke and flames rising from the building.",
      "\u201cEvery employee has a story with the space,\u201d said journalist D\u00e9nel Sainton, who described the former headquarters as the \u201csoul\u201d of Radio et T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Cara\u00efbes, which has been forced to move twice because of gang violence.",
      "Also attacked that week was radio station M\u00e9lodie FM and TV station T\u00e9l\u00e9 Pluriel.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now, kind of the wholesale targeting of the media, is different,\u201d said Adams, the expert on press freedom issues in Haiti. \u201cIn the old days, individual journalists were targeted.\u201d",
      "According to UNESCO, at least 21 journalists were reported killed from 2000 to 2022 in Haiti, with nine killed in 2022, the deadliest year for Haitian journalism in recent history.",
      "The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists reported one journalist killed in 2023 and two more in 2024.",
      "Investigative journalist Gardy Saint-Louis recently told T\u00e9l\u00e9gramme360, an online news site, that he planned to go into hiding. Saint-Louis was quoted as saying that he began receiving anonymous calls in September 2024, and that death threats escalated into an attack in February, when armed men opened fire on his house.",
      "Other journalists have fled Haiti, where attacks and killings are rarely solved.",
      "Haiti ranks first globally as the country most likely to let journalists\u2019 murders go unpunished, according to a 2024 CPJ report. Since 2019, seven killings remain unsolved, including that of Garry Tesse, a radio host whose mutilated body appeared six days after he vanished in 2022. Shortly before his death, Tesse accused a powerful prosecutor of plotting to kill him.",

    "story": [
      "North Carolina enacted a rare energy law in the South in 2021 that directed power plant emissions be sharply reduced",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republican lawmakers and the Democratic governor worked together in 2021 to enact a rare energy law in the South that sought to sharply reduce power plant emissions by 2030 and ultimately reach carbon neutrality.",
      "\u201cToday, North Carolina moves strongly into a reliable and affordable clean energy future,\u201d then-Gov. Roy Cooper said at the October 2021 bill signing ceremony. \u201cThis is a new beginning.\u201d",
      "But now, amid changing priorities at the federal level, the state's Republican-controlled legislature is seeking to repeal the law's requirement of taking \u201call reasonable steps to achieve\u201d reducing carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005 levels by 2030. The legislation wouldn't end meeting the carbon neutrality standard by 2050 as the 2021 law still requires.",
      "Senate bill supporters contend getting rid of the 70% target deadline would help Duke Energy \u2014 the state\u2019s dominant electric utility \u2014 assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate the electricity rate increases necessary to reach the 2050 standard. Besides, they say, state regulators already recently pushed back the interim deadline, as the law allows.",
      "The effort comes as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has proposed rolling back federal environmental and climate change policies, which critics say could boost pollution and threaten human health. Republicans in Washington, D.C., and Raleigh are touting them as ways to reduce the cost of living and boost the economy.",
      "Trump \u201cis taking bold action to make America energy-dominant!\u201d state Senate leader Phil Berger, a bill sponsor, wrote on the social platform X. \u201cTo bolster his efforts here in NC, we\u2019re cutting costs for families, removing arbitrary benchmarks, and encouraging new nuclear facilities.\u201d",
      "At least 17 other states \u2014 most controlled by Democrats \u2014 have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, the Natural Resources Defense Council says. North Carolina and Virginia are the only ones from the Southeast.",
      "Some North Carolina environmental groups didn't embrace the 2021 law, saying it lacked low-income customer assistance and contained loopholes to delay the 2030 mandate. Now they're criticizing the bill passed by the Senate in March as stalling climate action and benefiting Duke Energy financially. The 2021 law also lets the utility seek multiyear rate increases and performance-based incentives.",
      "\u201cDuke Energy agreed four years ago to carbon-reduction goals in exchange for an easier path to rate increases. It\u2019s taken full advantage of the smoother rate-setting process, but now wants to renege on its end of the deal,\u201d North Carolina Sierra Club director Chris Herndon said.",
      "Last fall, the state Utilities Commission, which regulates rates and services for public utilities, accepted that it was \u201cno longer reasonable or executable\u201d for Duke Energy to seek the 70% reduction by 2030, pushing that deadline back by at least four years. Eliminating the interim standard likely would mean scaling back or delaying solar and wind energy production now and relying more on natural gas over the next decade, according to modeling from Duke Energy and a state agency that represents consumers before the Utilities Commission.",
      "\u201cThe interim goal is not allowing our commission to make least-cost decisions, because the interim goal is driving fast, expensive behavior selecting generation types,\u201d said outgoing Sen. Paul Newton, a retired Duke Energy executive and bill sponsor. The bill also would open the door to the long-term construction of a large nuclear power plant, Newton added.",
      "Senate Republicans cite the models to estimate that removing the interim goal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend \u2014 and pass on to customers \u2014 in the next 25 years. Democrats voting against the measure questioned the $13 billion figure and supported an interim goal.",
      "\u201cNot having any target, even an aspirational target, could mean that we don\u2019t stay on track to get to our 2050 goal,\u201d Democratic Sen. Julie Mayfield said.",
      "The bill, now in the House, also would allow Duke Energy to seek higher electric rates to cover incremental construction costs of a nuclear or gas-powered plant, rather than wait until the project's end. Newton said the option would avoid one massive rate increase at the project\u2019s conclusion, reining in customer costs. Critics say it would boost Duke Energy\u2019s profits on expensive projects even if never completed.",
      "In supporting the bill, Duke Energy said the \u201clegislation allows modern, efficient and always-on generation to be deployed faster and cheaper\u201d and pointed to the commission's order last fall. While the North Carolina Chamber backs the bill, some companies oppose it.",
      "Any approved final bill would head to Cooper\u2019s successor, Gov. Josh Stein. The Democrat contends the bill would hurt electricity users and threaten the state\u2019s clean-energy economy.",
      "\u201cWe should be looking for solutions that create jobs and lower costs for hardworking North Carolinians, not increasing their financial burden,\u201d Stein spokesperson Morgan Hopkins said.",
      "While Democrats have enough legislative seats to uphold Stein\u2019s vetoes if they remain united, Duke Energy often finds allies in both parties. Three Democrats voted for the Senate bill with Republicans.",
      "Uncertainty over the bill's future could grow after Newton resigned from the Senate last week to take a university job.",

      "The Dow industrials added 0.6% to 42,225.32, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.9% to 17,601.05.",
      "Financial markets around the world have broadly been shaky lately because of uncertainty about Trump\u2019s trade war. He has said he wants tariffs to make the global system more fair and to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States from other countries. But tariffs also threaten to grind down growth for the U.S. and other economies, while worsening inflation when it may be stuck above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target.",
      "After the U.S. market closed, Trump declared a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the United States. The president held up a chart while speaking at the White House, showing the United States would charge a 34% tax on imports from China, a 20% tax on imports from the European Union, and 32% on Taiwan.",
      "Trump earlier announced 25% tariffs on auto imports; levies against China, Canada and Mexico; and expanded tariffs on steel and aluminum. Trump has also put tariffs against  countries that import oil from Venezuela and plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.",

It was also the second three-homer game of Ram\u00edrez\u2019s career, which has been spent entirely with Cleveland.",
      "\u201cI appreciate these types of days,\u201d Ram\u00edrez said through an interpreter. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard to hit one, and then when you hit three, you just thank God for these type of games, and most importantly because we won.\u201d",

      "\u201cBest player in the world,\u201d Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said with a grin. \u201cMan, he\u2019s some kind of impressive. What a great night. Really picked us up on a night where we needed a lot of offense, and our best player came through the way those guys do. They step up. They know when we need that. They just have a knack for finding ways to do that. A three-homer game, those are so rare in itself, but to be able to witness it and to have him do it the way he did was really impressive.\u201d",
      "Ram\u00edrez did it six days after spraining his right wrist while sliding in Kansas City, a mishap that forced him to miss one game and has left him still missing a large chunk of skin on his hand.",
      "The Guardians expect such feats from Ram\u00edrez, the six-time All-Star who made the All-MLB first team last season while leading Cleveland to 92 victories, the AL Central crown and the AL Championship Series. He led the Guardians in homers (39), RBIs (118) and stolen bases (41), barely missing the 40-40 club.",
      "He hasn't stolen a base yet in 2025, but he's off to a strong start in the quest for his first 40-homer season.",
      "\u201cYou always want good outcomes every time you hit,\u201d Ram\u00edrez said. \u201cSometimes you hit the first homer, and then you don\u2019t hit anything after that. We got good results.\u201d",
      "Ram\u00edrez's evening wasn't all good: He botched Luis Rengifo's two-out grounder to third in the third inning for his third error in three games. Jo Adell followed with a two-run single that put the Angels up 4-2.",
      "Vogt said he isn't worried about Ram\u00edrez\u2019s rough defensive stretch, calling it \u201ca blip\u201d for the third baseman who finished second in Gold Glove voting last year. The manager also knew Ram\u00edrez\u2019s next at-bats would be important to him after an error.",
      "\u201cYou always find with the top players in the league, when they happen to make a mistake like that, they seem to make up for it right away,\u201d Vogt said. \u201cIt happens all the time. But we\u2019re going to continue working on defense.\u201d",

She extended the streak to five two weeks later at The Chevron Championship to tie the tour record.",
      "Thitikul rolled into the elimination format, defeating Hye-Jin Choi 5 and 3. Thitikul, who is from Thailand, won all three round-robin matches. She will play Guseva, who advanced out of the same group with Rose Zhang, who has been battling a neck injury.",

      "The Chinese-born Wang, now a citizen of Malta, invited Norwegian filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge and Australian polar guide Eric Philips, all of whom shared stunning vistas during their voyage.",

      "Mikkelsen packed the capsule with camera equipment and spent much of her time behind the lens.",
      "All four suffered from space motion sickness after reaching orbit, according to Wang. But by the time they woke up on day two, they felt fine and cranked open the window cover right above the South Pole, he said via X.",
      "Besides documenting the poles from 270 miles (430 kilometers) up, Wang and his crew took the first medical X-rays in space as part of a test and conducted two dozen other science experiments. They named their trip Fram2 after the Norwegian sailing ship that carried explorers to the poles more than a century ago. A bit of the original ship\u2019s wooden deck accompanied the crew to space.",
      "SpaceX said its decision to switch splashdown sites from Florida beginning with this flight was based on safety. The company said Pacific splashdowns will ensure that any surviving pieces of the trunk \u2014 jettisoned near flight\u2019s end \u2014 falls into the ocean.",
      "The last people to return from space to the Pacific were the three NASA astronauts assigned to the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission.",

      "Even as he grows older, Microsoft founder Bill Gates still fondly remembers the catalytic computer code he wrote 50 years ago that opened up a new frontier in technology.",
      "Although the code that Gates printed out on a teletype machine may look crude compared to what's powering today's artificial intelligence platforms, it played a critical role in creating Microsoft in April 1975 \u2014 a golden anniversary that the Redmond, Washington, company will celebrate on Friday.",
      "Gates, 69, set the stage for that jubilee with a blog post reminiscing on how he and his old high school friend \u2014 the late Paul Allen \u2014 scrambled to create the world's first \u201csoftware factory\u201d after reading an article in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics magazine about the Altair 8800, a minicomputer that would be powered by a tiny chip made by the then-obscure technology company, Intel.",
      "The article inspired Gates, who was just a freshman at Harvard University, and Allen to call Altair's maker, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, and promise the company's CEO Ed Roberts they had developed software that would enable consumers to control the hardware. There was just one hitch: Gates and Allen hadn't yet come up with the code they promised Roberts.",
      "Gates and Allen tackled the challenge by latching onto the BASIC computer language that had been developed in 1964 at Dartmouth College, but they still had to figure out a way to make the technology compatible with the forthcoming Altair computer, even though they didn't even have a prototype of the machine.",
      "After spending two months working on the program with little sleep, Gates finished the code that became the basis for the Altair's first operating system. \u201cThat code remains the coolest I\u2019ve ever written,\u201d Gates wrote in his blog post, which includes an option to download the original program.",
      "The code would go on to provide the foundation for a business that would make personal computers a household staple, with a suite of software that include the Word, Excel and PowerPoint programs, as well as the Windows operating system that still powers most PCs today.",
      "\u201cThat was the revolution,\u201d Gates said of the code in a video accompanying his post. \u201cThat was the thing that ushered in personal computing.\u201d",
      "Gates' recollection of the code is part of a nostalgic kick that he has been on this year as he prepares to turn 70 in October.",
      "The trip down memory lane included the February release of a memoir exploring his early years as an often-misunderstood child with few friends, and a hailing of the 25th anniversary of the philanthropic foundation he created after stepping down as Microsoft's CEO in 2000. The tech giant initially stumbled after Gates' departure but has been thriving under CEO Satya Nadella, and has amassed a market value of about $2.8 trillion.",
      "In his memoir, Gates also reflected on his tempestuous relationship with fellow PC pioneer, the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, whose company will be celebrating its golden anniversary next year.",
      "\u201cFifty years is a long time,\u201d said Gates, whose personal fortune is estimated at $108 billion. \u201cIt's crazy that the dream came true.\u201d",

      "On Wednesday, after archaeological analysis, experts at the Vienna Museum gave a first public presentation of the grave \u2014 linked to \u201ca catastrophic event in a military context\" and evidence of the first known fighting ever in that region.",
      "The bodies of 129 people have been confirmed at the site in the Vienna neighborhood of Simmering. The excavation teams also found many dislocated bones and believe the total number of victims tops 150 \u2014 a discovery never seen before in Central Europe.",
      "\u201cWithin the context of Roman acts of war, there are no comparable finds of fighters,\" said Michaela Binder, who led the archaeological dig. \"There are huge battlefields in Germany where weapons were found. But finding the dead, that is unique for the entire Roman history.\u201d",
      "Soldiers in the Roman Empire were typically cremated until the 3rd century.",

      "The most indicative clue came from a rusty dagger of a type in use specifically between the middle of the 1st century and the start of the second.",

      "That amount of electricity is enough to power about 3 million homes.",
      "Construction is expected to begin this year and power could start flowing by 2027, the group said in a statement. The cost to prepare the site and build the data centers could exceed the initial $10 billion investment by billions more, the group said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- After TikTok was banned in the United States earlier this year, President Donald Trump gave the platform a reprieve, barreling past a law that was passed in Congress and upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court that said the ban was necessary for national security.",
      "The Republican president's executive orders have spurred more than 130 lawsuits in the little more than two months he has been in office, but this one barely generated a peep. None of those suits challenges his temporary block of the 2024 law that banned the popular social video app after the deadline passed for it to be sold by ByteDance, its China-based parent company.",
      "Few of the 431 members of the House of Representatives and the Senate who voted for the law have complained.",

      "Trump declared he was suspending the law for 75 days, though no provision of the rule would appear to allow for that, to give ByteDance a fresh chance to find a U.S. buyer. The president has suggested he could extend the pause, but he has since said he expects a deal by Saturday, when the reprieve expires. He is meeting Wednesday with aides about possible suitors for TikTok. Oracle and the investment firm Blackstone are among the potential investors.",
      "Trump's action followed a fast-tracked free-speech challenge by TikTok and its users that ended with a unanimous Supreme Court ruling days before Trump's inauguration, in which the justices held that national security concerns overcame their usual receptivity to First Amendment claims.",

      "TikTok, which has headquarters in Singapore and Los Angeles, has said it prioritizes user safety, and China's Foreign Ministry has said China\u2019s government has never and will not ask companies to \u201ccollect or provide data, information or intelligence\u201d held in foreign countries.",
      "The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users, but it came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "The president's position has evolved over time. During his first term, he used an executive order to try to ban TikTok on national security grounds. But federal courts blocked it. His administration then tried to negotiate a sale of the platform, but it failed.",
      "Trump changed his tune during his 2024 campaign and said he would \u201csave TikTok,\u201d then credited the platform with helping him win more young voters. He issued the 75-day pause on the first day of his second term.",
      "The law allows for one 90-day reprieve, but only if there's a deal on the table and a formal notification to Congress.",
      "Trump's actions so far violate the law, said Alan Rozenshtein, an associate law professor at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe law does not permit the sort of \u2018extension\u2019 that Donald Trump has announced,\" Rozenshtein said.",
      "But both he and Kreps acknowledged a court challenge or other pushback is unlikely.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s the constituency? You have 170 million Americans using the app, and they\u2019re pretty happy to see this continue to be available to them,\u201d Kreps said.",
      "It also might be hard for someone to establish the legal right, or standing, to sue, Rozenshtein said. A plaintiff would have to be able to show harm from the delay in enforcing the law, he said.",
      "More importantly, he said, the TikTok executive order was an early \"example of the Trump administration not caring about the rule of law.\u201d",
      "While Trump has directed the Justice Department not to seek fines from the tech companies, they still are taking a legal gamble, according to Democratic lawmakers who oppose the TikTok ban but also criticize Trump for his actions. A future administration might have its own reasons to pursue legal claims against Apple, Google and Oracle, they wrote Trump in a letter last week.",
      "Companies could face hundreds of billions of dollars in legal liability for facilitating TikTok's operations since the law's effective date of Jan. 19, Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Ed Markey of Massachusetts wrote.",
      "The companies themselves acknowledged their legally uncertain situation in their initial response to Trump's order. Oracle continued to provide cloud services to TikTok, the senators said, but \u201cApple and Google, however, initially came to a different decision and refused to reinstate TikTok in their app stores.\"",
      "The companies changed course only after receiving written assurance from the Justice Department.",
      "The Democrats have called for amending the law to extend the deadline for a sale to October. Other opponents of the TikTok ban support a full repeal.",
      "Among the few supporters of the ban to speak out is Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "But rather than take on Trump, Moolenaar has focused his criticism on ByteDance and its ties the Chinese Communist Party. \u201cIf ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal \u2014 plain and simple,\u201d Moolenaar said in remarks to a TikTok event on Capitol Hill last week.",
      "Several potential bidders have stepped forward.",
      "Perplexity AI presented ByteDance in January with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "Another possibility is a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic adviser. Investors in the consortium previously said they offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. They had planned to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they said would provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, had also organized a consortium, which included the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and offered ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",

      "The utility announced that its board picked Moul as president and chief executive to replace Jeff Lyash, who said in January that he would retire no later than September. The move comes less than a week after Trump removed one of the utility's board members without indicating why. With the firing of Michelle Moore, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, the board currently has five members and four vacancies.",

In a news release announcing his selection, TVA focused in part on Moul's leadership in the advancement of nuclear energy technologies and his experience as a licensed senior reactor operator. He starts in the new role on April 9.",

      "If fire, smoke or hazardous chemicals were released as a result of the building collapse, they may decrease a person's survival odds, said emergency response expert Dr. Joseph Barbera, an associate professor at George Washington University.",
      "Beyond that, having air to breathe and water to drink are crucial as the days go on.",

      "It can be important for survivors to receive vital medical care before they are removed from the rubble, Barbera said. If not, the buildup of toxins from crushed muscles could make them go into shock after they are rescued.",

      "The best practices for survival during an earthquake depend on where you are in the world. Building codes in regions with active fault lines are often designed to withstand earthquakes, but that doesn't hold true everywhere.",
      "In many countries, including the United States, the best practices are to drop, seek cover and hang on unless you are close to a building exit. Seek shelter under a heavy table or near sturdy furniture that may yield a survivable pocket if the roof collapses. Cover your face with cloth or a mask to protect from dust and debris.",
      "If you are trapped in the rubble after and earthquake, save your energy and don't overexert. Ration food and water, listen for rescue calls and search for something near you to make noise. If you have a phone with you, conserve its battery and try for help in short spurts each day.",

By then it was already about 11 p.m. Friday at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. A group of Microsoft workers was ready and waiting for the data.",

But rather than rely on a standard AI computer vision model that could run any visual data, they had to build a customized version specific to Mandalay.",
      "\u201cThe Earth is too different, the natural disasters are too different and the imagery we get from satellites is just too different to work in every situation,\u201d Lavista Ferres said. For instance, he said, while fires spread in fairly predictable ways, \u201can earthquake touches the whole city\u201d and it can be harder to know in the immediate aftermath where help is needed.",
      "Once the AI analysis was complete, it showed 515 buildings in Mandalay with 80% to 100% damage and another 1,524 with between 20% and 80% damage. That showed the widespread gravity of the disaster, but, just as important, it helps pinpoint specific locations of damage.",
      "\u201cThis is critical information for teams on the ground,\u201d Lavista Ferres said.",

      "\u201cWe stopped and took some photos and neither one of us had any idea,\u201d Manley said. \u201cI could get it to family but I couldn\u2019t figure out any more than that. So we took photos and moved on, not realizing we had found a new genus.\u201d",
      "When Manley got back from the hike, she started researching what the flower could be. She soon found that not only was she stumped, but others were too. Her post about the flower on iNaturalist, an online platform for nature enthusiasts \u201ccaused a stir,\u201d said Isaac Lichter Marck, a researcher at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.",
      "A. Michael Powell, curator and director of the herbarium at Sul Russ State University in Alpine, said when Manley contacted him about the flower, he immediately thought it was something new.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything I\u2019d seen before,\u201d said Powell, who has extensively studied the region.",
      "By the time a team went to collect samples of the flower a few weeks after the discovery, they had already begun to wither away.",
      "\u201cWe really got out there just in the nick of time before the specimens would have been completely dried up,\u201d Whiting said.",
      "The discovery of the flower was announced last month.",
      "Lichter Marck said they were able to extract DNA from the flower but that there's still a lot to learn. He said they don\u2019t know yet how it reproduces, or what potential uses it might have. They also need to determine if it\u2019s endangered.",
      "The wooly devil's official name \u2014 Ovicula biradiata \u2014 takes inspiration from its appearance: Ovicula, which means tiny sheep, is a nod to the hairs that cover its leaves; while biradiata, or bi-radial, refers to its two striped petals.",
      "Kelsey Wogan, environmental lab manager at Sul Ross State University, said she\u2019s excited to see if the wooly devil can be found in other places as well and what its range is.",
      "Whiting said the park is so well-studied that finding a new species was a surprise.",
      "\u201cThe fact that there\u2019s still species out there that had slipped under the radar is pretty remarkable,\u201d she said.",
      "Wogan said part of the excitement about the flower's discovery is that it shows \u201cthere\u2019s still new and undescribed things out there.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the great reminder to keep your eyes open,\" she said, \"and if you don\u2019t know what something is, it might be completely new.\u201d",

      "Although it\u2019s still experimental, they hope the brain-computer interface could someday help give voice to those unable to speak.",
      "A new study described testing the device on a 47-year-old woman with quadriplegia who couldn\u2019t speak for 18 years after a stroke. Doctors implanted it in her brain during surgery as part of a clinical trial.",
      "It \u201cconverts her intent to speak into fluent sentences,\u201d said Gopala Anumanchipalli, a co-author of the study published Monday in the journal Nature Neuroscience.",
      "Other brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, for speech typically have a slight delay between thoughts of sentences and computerized verbalization. Such delays can disrupt the natural flow of conversation, potentially leading to miscommunication and frustration, researchers said.",
      "This is \"a pretty big advance in our field,\u201d said Jonathan Brumberg of the Speech and Applied Neuroscience Lab at the University of Kansas, who was not part of the study.",
      "A team in California recorded the woman\u2019s brain activity using electrodes while she spoke sentences silently in her brain. The scientists used a synthesizer they built using her voice before her injury to create a speech sound that she would have spoken. They trained an AI model that translates neural activity into units of sound.",
      "It works similar to existing systems used to transcribe meetings or phone calls in real time, said Anumanchipalli, of the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The implant itself sits on the speech center of the brain so that it\u2019s listening in, and those signals are translated to pieces of speech that make up sentences. It\u2019s a \u201cstreaming approach,\u201d Anumanchipalli said, with each 80-millisecond chunk of speech \u2013 about half a syllable \u2013 sent into a recorder.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not waiting for a sentence to finish,\u201d Anumanchipalli said. \u201cIt\u2019s processing it on the fly.\u201d",
      "Decoding speech that quickly has the potential to keep up with the fast pace of natural speech, said Brumberg. The use of voice samples, he added, \u201cwould be a significant advance in the naturalness of speech.\"",
      "Though the work was partially funded by the National Institutes of Health, Anumanchipalli said it wasn't affected by recent NIH research cuts. More research is needed before the technology is ready for wide use, but with \u201csustained investments,\" it could be available to patients within a decade, he said.",

      "BANGKOK -- Chinese telecoms gear giant Huawei said Monday its net profit fell 28% in 2024 while its revenue surged, as the company invested heavily in advanced technologies.",
      "Huawei Technologies reported 62.6 billion yuan ($8.6 billion) in net profit last year, down from 87 billion yuan the year before. Its revenue jumped 22% to $118.2 billion, with the strongest growth in its consumer goods and automotive-related sales.",
      "The company, based in the southern city of Shenzhen, said the decline in profit was mainly due to two factors, \u201cWe continued to increase our future-oriented investment and there were no gains from the sale of businesses.\u201d",
      "One of China's first global tech brands, Huawei said its spending on research and development amounted to more than a fifth of its revenues, and more than half its workforce, or 113,000 people, are employed in R&D.",
      "Spending on R&D was 179.7 billion yuan (nearly $25 billion).",

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s antitrust watchdog fined Apple 150 million euros ($162 million) on Monday over a privacy feature protecting users from apps snooping on them because its introduction resulted in abuse of competition law.",
      "The French Competition Authority said the aim of Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) requiring iPhone and iPad apps to ask users for permission before tracking them was not in itself open to criticism.",
      "But it ruled that the \u201cway in which it was implemented was neither necessary nor proportionate to Apple\u2019s stated objective of protecting personal data.\u201d",
      "Apple rolled out ATT starting in April 2021 as part of an update to the operating system powering the iPhone and iPad. The feature forces apps to obtain permission before collecting data to target users with personalized ads. While the feature was designed to tighten up privacy, it faced criticism from Big Tech rivals that it would make it harder for smaller apps to survive without charging consumers.",
      "The fine, punishing Apple for abuse of its dominant position in mobile app distribution, covers the period from April 2021 to July 2023. But the amount is a pittance for the iPhone maker, which earned $124 billion in revenue in the final three months of last year.",
      "The watchdog said the feature's rollout resulted in users being barraged by pop-ups from third-party apps requesting their consent. It bemoaned how the proliferation of these consent windows made it \"excessively complex\" for app users to navigate the iOS environment.",
      "It also questioned the system\u2019s neutrality, saying it penalized the smallest publishers, which depend to a large extent on the collection of third-party data to finance their activity.",
      "Apple said in a statement that ATT gives users more privacy control \u201cthrough a required, clear, and easy-to-understand prompt about one thing: tracking.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat prompt is consistent for all developers, including Apple, and we have received strong support for this feature from consumers, privacy advocates, and data protection authorities around the world,\u201d the company said. \"While we are disappointed with today\u2019s decision, the French Competition Authority (FCA) has not required any specific changes to ATT.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "There is plenty of nostalgia at Black Mountain, New Hampshire's oldest ski area",
      "Jackson, N.H. -- A skier since age 4, Thomas Brennick now enjoys regular trips to New Hampshire\u2019s Black Mountain with his two grandchildren.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s back to the old days,\u201d he said from the Summit Double chairlift on a recent sunny Friday. \u201cIt's just good, old-time skiing at its best.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the experience is now propelled by a high-tech system designed to increase efficiency at the state\u2019s oldest ski area. And while small, independent resorts can\u2019t compete on infrastructure or buying power with conglomerates like Vail, which owns nearby Attitash Mountain Resort and seven others in the Northeast alone, at least one entrepreneur is betting technology will be \u201ca really great equalizer.\u201d",
      "That businessman is Erik Mogensen, who bought Black Mountain last year and turned it into a lab for his ski mountain consultancy, Entabeni Systems. The company builds systems that put lift tickets sales, lesson reservations and equipment rentals online while collecting detailed data to inform decisions such as where to make more snow and how much.",
      "\u201cA lot of general managers will go out and look at how many rows of cars are parked, and that\u2019s kind of how they tell how busy they are,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe really want to look at that transactional data down to the deepest level.\u201d",
      "That includes analyzing everything from the most popular time to sell hot dogs in the lodge to how many runs a season pass holder makes per visit.",
      "\u201cThe large operators, they can do a lot of things at scale that we can\u2019t. They can buy 20 snow cats at a time, 10 chairlifts, those types of things. We can\u2019t do that, but we\u2019re really nimble,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe can decide to change the way we groom very quickly, or change the way we open trails, or change our (food and beverage) menu in the middle of a day.\u201d",
      "Mogensen, who says his happiest moments are tied to skiing, started Entabeni Systems in 2015, driven by the desire to keep the sport accessible. In 2023, he bought the company Indy Pass, which allows buyers to ski for two days each at 230 independent ski areas, including Black Mountain. It's an alternative to the Epic and Ikon multi-resort passes offered by the Vail and Alterra conglomerates.",
      "Black Mountain was an early participant in Indy Pass. When Mogensen learned it was in danger of closing, he was reminded of his hometown's long-gone ski area. He bought Black Mountain aiming to ultimately transform it into a cooperative.",
      "Many Indy Pass resorts also are clients of Entabeni Systems, including Utah's Beaver Mountain, which bills itself as the longest continuously-run family owned mountain resort in the U.S.",
      "Kristy Seeholzer, whose husband\u2019s grandfather founded Beaver Mountain, said Entabeni streamlined its ticketing and season pass system. That led to new, lower-priced passes for those willing to forgo skiing during holiday weeks or weekends, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of our season pass holders were self-limiting anyway. They only want to ski weekdays because they don\u2019t want to deal with weekends,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could never have kept track of that manually.\"",
      "Though she is pleased overall, Seeholzer said the software can be challenging and slow.",
      "\u201cThere are some really great programs out there, like on the retail side of things or the sales side of things. And one of the things that was a little frustrating was it felt like we were reinventing the wheel,\u201d she said.",
      "Sam Shirley, 25, grew up skiing in New Hampshire and worked as a ski instructor and ski school director in Maine while attending college. But he said increasing technology has drastically changed the way he skis, pushing him to switch mostly to cross-country.",
      "\u201cAs a customer, it\u2019s made things more complicated,\u201d he said. \"It just becomes an extra hassle.\u201d",
      "Shirley used to enjoy spur-of-the-moment trips around New England, but has been put off by ski areas reserving lower rates for those who buy tickets ahead. He doesn\u2019t like having to provide detailed contact information, sometimes even a photograph, just to get a lift ticket.",
      "It's not just independent ski areas that are focused on technology and data. Many others are using lift tickets and passes embedded with radio frequency identification chips that track skiers' movements.",
      "Vail resorts pings cell phones to better understand how lift lines are forming, which informs staffing decisions, said John Plack, director of communications. Lift wait times have decreased each year for the past three years, with 97% under 10 minutes this year, he said.",
      "\u201cOur company is a wildly data-driven company. We know a lot about our guest set. We know their tastes. We know what they like to ski, we know when they like to ski. And we\u2019re able to use that data to really improve the guest experience,\u201d he said.",
      "That improvement comes at a cost. A one-day lift ticket at Vail's Keystone Resort in Colorado sold for $292 last week. A season pass cost $418, a potentially good deal for diehard skiers, but also a reliable revenue stream guaranteeing Vail a certain amount of income even as ski areas face less snow and shorter winters.",
      "The revenue from such passes, especially the multi-resort Epic Pass, allowed the company to invest $100 million in snowmaking, Plack said.",
      "\u201cBy committing to the season ahead of time, that gives us certainty and allows us to reinvest in our resorts,\" he said.",
      "Mogensen insists bigger isn\u2019t always better, however. Lift tickets at Black Mountain cost $59 to $99 per day and a season's pass is about $450.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t just come skiing to turn left and right. You come skiing because of the way the hot chocolate tastes and the way the fire pit smells and what spring skiing is and what the beer tastes like and who you\u2019re around,\u201d he said. \u201cSkiing doesn\u2019t have to be a luxury good. It can be a community center.\u201d",
      "Brennick, the Black Mountain lift rider who was skiing with his grandchildren, said he has noticed a difference since the ski area was sold.",
      "\u201cI can see the change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're making a lot of snow and it shows.\u201d",

      "It follows about a month of demonstrations taking place at the department.",
      "Crowds of college and high school students representing student governments from some of the largest schools in the Washington, D.C., area rallied outside the U.S. Department of Education on Friday to oppose the administration's gutting of the agency.",
      "Chanting \"hands off our schools\" and \"give us back our DOE,\" demonstrators attended the rally outside department headquarters as education advocates and student organizers discussed the department's importance to U.S. students.",
      "Julia Comino, student body vice president at American University, said shuttering the agency would harm the rights of America's most vulnerable.",
      "\"The Department of Education is the government agency that ensures that our universities have equal access, that people of all gender identities, of all racial, ethnic and protected classes,\" Comino told ABC News. \"And we know that when you go after the Department of Education, you're actually going after the marginalized communities. So this is just an ongoing history of the attacks on those marginalized and vulnerable groups,\" she said.",
      "Last month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take all necessary steps to shrink the department and return education control to the states. The department has already let go of nearly half its workforce.",
      "\"I think what we're really trying to get across is that the Trump administration has just exceeded its authority,\" said Asher Maxwell, a student press coordinator for the Georgetown University Student Association. \"That's really going to harm our education and our futures.\"",
      "The demonstration was organized by the student governments representing over 130,000 students at several colleges in the region, including Georgetown University, American University and Howard University, as well as Temple University in Philadelphia, according to the organizers.",
      "The coalition is a \"historic alliance\" standing against the \"assault on education,\" including campus free speech and student financial aid programs, according to a release by organizers.",
      "Critics say college students will especially be affected if the president follows through with transferring the responsibilities of the Office of Federal Student Aid \u2014 with its $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio -- to another agency and terminating the federal workers who administer funds for higher education.",
      "Ethan Henshaw, a Pell Grant recipient and Georgetown's student body president, called the agency a \"lifeline\" for students to attain an equitable and quality education.",
      "\"This is threatening the livelihoods, the education access, the economic mobility of low- and middle-income Americans from every background all across the country,\" Henshaw said. \"I know, without access to the programs that come from this building, you know, education may not have been possible for me, so it's incredibly important to come out here and demand that this institution stays strong, and that the Trump administration does not take away what's so important to us.\"",
      "At an impromptu appearance at a news conference held by Democrats outside the department's headquarters earlier this week, McMahon defended the administration's moves, saying she believes the best education is \"closest to the child where teachers and parents, local superintendents, working together and local school boards to develop the curriculum for those students is the best way that it can happen.\"",
      "McMahon has also vowed\u00a0to continue funding statutorily mandated functions and responsibilities of the department.",
      "The rally Friday followed about a month's worth of Friday demonstrations at the department, including an \"ED Matters\" rally, \"study-ins\" and \"clap-outs\" for terminated federal workers.",
      "More recently, Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill have condemned the changes at the department. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., launched a \"Save Our Schools\" campaign this week against the administration's attempt to dismantle the department. Her campaign includes investigations, oversight, community engagement and lawsuits, according to the senator.",
      "\"The federal government has invested in our public schools,\" Warren said in an exclusive interview with ABC News. \"Taking that away from our kids so that a handful of billionaires can be even richer is just plain ugly, and I will fight it with everything I've got.\"",
      "Completely abolishing the department can't be done without congressional approval.",
      "Still, the students at Friday's demonstration said the threats to close the department have already had a chilling effect on their campuses, according to Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Darius Wagner.",
      "\"We're seeing them directly influence what we're able to discuss in our spaces, teach in our classrooms and also through K through 12 schools, because they're threatening to cut their funding if they do not comply with the views of the president,\" Wagner told ABC News.",
      "\"That's what's happening here and it's not hard to see that that is the road to breaking our institutions and limiting our ability to freely speak,\" he said.",
      "\"This is only the beginning,\" Wagner said, \"This is why we started here at the DOE.\"",

      "But Trump's claim is misleading not only because some of the nations hit with tariffs haven't levied any  against the U.S., but also because the math apparently used by the administration to come up the tariffs doesn't hold up, according to several economic experts.",
      "The White House's list of tariffs issued against each location includes different tariff rates. In announcing the tariffs at the Rose Garden on Wednesday, Trump claimed the numbers were calculated based on \"the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating.\" Trump added that he was being \"kind,\" and divided that number in half and called it a \"discount.\"",
      "The calculations for almost all of the tariffs was determined by dividing trade deficit of each nation with the value of its imports, according to economic experts' analysis. That number was then divided in half for Trump's \"discount\" for the final tariff percentage, experts said.",

      "\"When economists study trade deficiency, they don't find any evidence for this rationale,\" he said.",

      "While Kennedy is correct in his statement that some chronic disease and cancer rates have risen, public health experts said -- and data shows -- that the country has made great progress tackling illnesses, including driving down cancer mortality rates, and that life expectancy is on the rise.",
      "\"Gutting the public health system while claiming to fight disease is a dangerous contradiction,\" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital, as well as a contributor for ABC News.",
      "\"We should be focusing on strengthening \u2013 not stripping \u2013 the public health system if we're serious about tackling chronic disease,\" Brownstein continued. \"Dismantling key infrastructure will only set us back in the fight to keep Americans healthy.\"",
      "American life expectancy increasing",
      "In a post on X, Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator from 2022 to 2023, said Kennedy was incorrect in his statement about Americans getting sicker.",
      "\"So much of what is in here is incorrect,\" he wrote. \"Americans are NOT getting sicker every year. After a devastating pandemic, life expectancy is beginning to rise again.\"",
      "Between 2022 and 2023, age-adjusted death rates decreased for nine of the leading causes of death in the U.S., according to a December 2024 report from the CDC.",
      "This includes decreasing death rates from heart disease, unintentional injuries, stroke, chronic lower respiratory diseases, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, kidney disease, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, and COVID-19.",
      "Additionally, age-specific death rates dropped from 2022 to 2023 for all age groups ages 5 and older, the CDC report found.",
      "The report also found life expectancy in the U.S. is beginning to rise again after it dropped in every U.S. state during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Life expectancy in 2023 hit its highest level since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the CDC report. Data showed life expectancy for the U.S. population was 78.4 years in 2023, an increase of 0.9 years from 2022.",
      "The drop in age-adjusted death rates was largely attributed to decreases in mortality from COVID-19, heart disease, unintentional injuries and diabetes.",
      "\"Claims that Americans are getting sicker every year simply don't hold up,\" Brownstein told ABC News. \"Life expectancy is rising again post-pandemic, and we've seen declines in cancer, cardiovascular and overdose mortality.\"",
      "Obesity rising in children, decreasing in adults",
      "Kennedy has said he wants to tackle the obesity epidemic, including childhood obesity.",
      "Research does show that obesity is rising in children in the U.S. and is occurring at younger ages, with approximately one in five children and teens in the U.S. having obesity, according to the CDC.",
      "A 2022 study from Emory University that studied data from 1998 through 2016 found that childhood obesity among kindergarten through fifth-grade students has become more severe, putting more children at risk of health consequences.",
      "However, Jha pointed out in his post on X that \"even obesity rates have plateaued and are beginning to turn down\" in adults.",
      "For the first time in over a decade, adult obesity rates in the U.S. may be trending downward, with numbers dropping slightly from 46% in 2022 to 45.6% in 2023, according to a study published in JAMA Health Forum in December 2024.",
      "The study reviewed the body mass index, a generally accepted method of estimating obesity, of 16.7 million U.S. adults over a 10-year period. The average BMI rose annually during that period to 30.24, which is considered obese, until it plateaued in 2022, then dropped marginally to 30.21 in 2023.",
      "\"Recent research I co-authored in JAMA shows that obesity rates in adults have plateaued and are even starting to trend downward,\" said Brownstein, a co-author of the study. \"That progress reflects the very kind of long-term public health investment this reorg puts at risk.\"",
      "Chronic disease on the rise",
      "Kennedy has made tackling chronic diseases a cornerstone of his \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform.",
      "Over the past two decades, the prevalence of chronic conditions has been steadily increasing, according to a 2024 study conducted by researchers in Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Texas.",
      "\"An increasing proportion of people in America are dealing with multiple chronic conditions; 42% have [two] or more, and 12% have at least [five],\" the authors wrote.",
      "However, the study also found that the prevalence of chronic disease varies by geographic location and socioeconomic status. Residents who live in areas with the highest prevalence of chronic disease also face a number of contributing social, economic and environmental barriers, the study found.",
      "A 2022 study from the CDC found chronic diseases linked to cigarette smoking include respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as cancers and diabetes.",
      "Rates of cancer have 'increased dramatically'",
      "Kennedy is correct in stating that cancer rates in the U.S. have increased, with incidence rates rising for 17 cancer types in younger generations, according to a 2024 joint study from the American Cancer Society, Cancer Care Alberta and the University of Calgary.",
      "There has been a notable increase in incidence rates for many cancer types among women and younger adults, research shows.",
      "Incidence rates among women between ages 50 and 64 have surpassed those among men, according to a 2025 report published in the journal of the American Cancer Society.",
      "Additionally, cancer rates among women under age 50 are 82% higher than among men under age 50, which is up from 51% in 2002, the report found.",
      "However, while cancer incidence has increased, cancer mortality has decreased.",
      "A 2025 report from the American Cancer Society found that age-adjusted cancer death rates have dropped from a peak in 1991 by 34% as of 2022, largely due to reductions in smoking, advances in treatment and early detection for some cancers.",
      "However, there is more work to be done and disparities still persist. For example, Native Americans have the highest cancer death rates of any racial or ethnic group in the U.S.",
      "Additionally, Black Americans have a two-fold higher mortality rate than white Americans for prostate, stomach and uterine corpus cancers, the latter of which is a cancer of the lining of the uterus.",

    "summary": "Researchers who had millions of dollars' worth of grants terminated by the National Institutes of Health are suing the federal government.",
    "story": [
      "At least 900 grants have been terminated, according to one NIH source.",
      "Researchers who had millions of dollars' worth of grants terminated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are suing the federal government in the hopes of stopping any further research cancellations.",
      "The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday evening against the NIH and its director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, as well as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.",
      "Among the plaintiffs are Dr. Brittany Charlton, an associate professor in the department of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who said all of her grants were terminated because they allegedly \"no longer [effectuate] agency priorities,\" according to termination letters.",
      "\"Why am I standing up? I am a scientist, and therefore not a lawyer, but I appreciate that contract law is complex, and yet NIH's contract cancellations set off my alarm bell,\" she told ABC News in a statement.",
      "Co-plaintiffs include the American Public Health Association; Ibis Reproductive Health; and United Auto Workers as well as three other researchers.",
      "Both the NIH and the HHS told ABC News that they don't comment on ongoing litigation.",
      "Over the past several weeks, active research grants related to studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) have been canceled at the NIH because they allegedly do not serve the \"priorities\" of President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "As of late March, more than 900 grants have been terminated, an NIH official with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named, told ABC News.",
      "The terminations come after Trump passed a flurry of executive orders including vowing to \"defend women from gender ideology extremism,\" which has led to new guidance, like that from HHS, which now only recognizes two sexes.",
      "The administration has also issued several executive orders aiming to dismantle DEI initiatives.",
      "In previous termination letters, viewed by ABC News, they state that, \"Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans. Many such studies ignore, rather than seriously examine, biological realities. It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize these research programs.\"",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the grant terminations are a \"reckless and illegal purge to stamp out NIH-funded research that addresses topics and populations that they disfavor.\"",
      "Charlton said she was alarmed by Project 2025 -- a nearly 1,000-page document of policy proposals unveiled by the Heritage Foundation during the 2024 campaign intended to guide the next conservative administration -- which allegedly attacked fields like hers, centering on LGBTQ+ health research, as \"junk gender science,\" she said.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump tried to distance himself from Project 2025, saying he didn't know anything about the proposals.",
      "Five of Charlton's grants were terminated, including a five-year grant, of which Charlton said she and her colleagues were in their fourth year, focused on documenting obstetrical outcomes for lesbian, gay and bisexual women, she said.",
      "Another grant was focused on how to improve the experience of lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals who are trying to form their families, she said.",
      "A third was research looking to understand how laws identified by the team as discriminatory affect mental health among LGBTQ+ teens and potentially lead to depression and suicide, according to Charlton.",
      "Charlton said the cancellations are not only affecting her ability to conduct research but the ability to keep open the LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence -- based at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health -- of which she is the founding director.",
      "\"My current NIH research contracts are worth $15.9 million, of which $5.9 million still needs to be spent to finish our research,\" Charlton said. \"I have essentially no salary now, and I may need to shutter our newly launched LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence, which was a career goal of mine that I finally met when we launched less than a year ago.\"",
      "She went on, \"These grant terminations may end my academic career, and I've already been forced to make really tough decisions like terminating staff, including our newly appointed center's executive director.\"",
      "According to the lawsuit, Dr. Katie Edwards, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Social Work, has had at least six grants terminated worth about $11.9 million, including one studying sexual violence among men who fall under sexual minorities. She can no longer pay several of the roughly 50 staff members who are funded through the research grants, the lawsuit states.",
      "Dr. Peter Lurie, president and CEO of the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest, was a paid consultant and adviser on a grant evaluating the impacts of over-the-counter access to pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce HIV transmission, according to the lawsuit. The grantee institution, Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare, received a termination letter from the NIH in late March, the lawsuit states.",
      "Meanwhile Dr. Nicole Maphis -- a postdoctoral fellow at the University of New Mexico's School of Medicine -- who was studying the link between alcohol use disorder and Alzheimer's disease, applied for a MOSAIC grant, \"intended to help diversify the profession,\" according to the lawsuit. Her proposal was pulled and her current funding ends September 2025.",
      "\"Without additional funding, which the MOSAIC award would have provided, she will lose her job,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "Charlton said she is hopeful the lawsuit results in a preliminary injunction and therefore halts further NIH terminations.",
      "\"I believe these contracts are binding agreements and are constitutionally grounded,\" she said. \"It's been less than 100 days since inauguration, and I'm concerned. Concerned about signs of growing authoritarianism, and yet there is absolutely hope executive orders can't rewrite laws, and I pray courts ensure justice, pursuing truth, including via science, unites us, and it's the only way to ensure a healthier future for all.\"",

    "story": [
      "NSA's Gen. Timothy Haugh was among those Trump removed.",
      "The director of the National Security Agency, Gen. Timothy Haugh, was among the numerous officials far-right activist Laura Loomer urged President Donald Trump to remove during her official Oval Office meeting earlier this week, citing evidence of disloyalties, multiple sources tell ABC News.",
      "In her Oval Office meeting, Loomer presented the president with printed files of research she compiled on various government officials -- not only from the NSA and National Security Council, but also from other federal agencies, including the State Department, sources said. She urged the president to take action against those she claimed were disloyal or were appointed during former President Joe Biden's administration, the sources added.",
      "Haugh, who is the director of the NSA and also heads U.S. Cyber Command, and his civilian deputy Wendy Noble, were both removed from their positions, according to a U.S. official. Their firings came after Loomer's meeting with the president on Wednesday.",
      "Loomer appeared to confirm her involvement in a post on X, writing, \"NSA Director Tim Haugh and his deputy Wendy Noble have been disloyal to President Trump. That is why they have been fired ... Thank you President Trump for being receptive to the vetting materials provided to you and thank you for firing these Biden holdovers.\"",
      "Trump on Thursday acknowledged that Loomer has made recommendations to him and that he sometimes listens, but claimed that she was not involved in the NSC firings following their meeting on Wednesday.",
      "\"So Laura Loomer is a very good patriot. She is a very strong person, and I saw her yesterday for a little while. She makes recommendations of things and people, and sometimes I listen to those recommendations, like I do with everybody. I listen to everybody, and then I make a decision,\" Trump said.",
      "In a separate post Thursday night, Loomer said she reported names of \"disloyal people\" in the NSC to Trump. On Friday, she wrote on X that she planned to release \"more names of individuals who should not be in the Trump administration due to their questionable loyalty & past attacks on President Trump.\"",
      "Asked about these recent X posts from Loomer, the White House referred ABC News to Trump's previous comments about her making recommendations.",
      "Loomer's involvement comes after weeks of both public and private pressure, sources said, as she raised concerns about the administration's vetting process and the inclusion of officials she perceives as disloyal to the president.",
      "Loomer has frequently spread misinformation. In July, she claimed in a social media post, without citing evidence, that President Joe Biden had a medical emergency after landing at Joint Base Andrews.",
      "She had also started unsubstantiated claims about family members of Judge Juan Merchan in Trump's New York hush money case, including that his daughter posted a fake photo of Trump in jail on social media, which the court has denied. It prompted Trump to share Loomer's posts and spread the rumors.",
      "Loomer accompanied Trump to several campaign events last fall -- a move that prompted criticism from some Republicans at the time.",

      "Round after round of heavy rains have pounded the central U.S., leading to rapidly rising waterways and prompting a series of flash flood emergencies Friday night in Missouri, Texas and Arkansas. Meanwhile, many communities were still reeling from tornadoes that destroyed entire neighborhoods and killed at least seven people earlier this week.",
      "In Frankfort, Kentucky, floodwaters swept a 9-year-old boy away while he was walking to a school bus stop Friday morning, Gov. Andy Beshear said on social media. Officials said Gabriel Andrews' body was found about a half-mile from where he went missing.",
      "The downtown area of Hopkinsville, Kentucky \u2014 a city of 31,000 residents 72 miles (116 kilometers) northwest of Nashville \u2014 was submerged Friday. A dozen people were rescued from homes, and dozens of pets were moved away from rising water, a fire official said.",

      "One was in Van Buren, Missouri, where there were at least 15 water rescues amid heavy rainfall and a rapidly rising Current River, said Justin Gibbs, weather service meteorologist.

      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have darn good reason for being out (like one that involves a visit to the emergency room), please stay home and off the roads!!\u201d the police department said on social media.",
      "Heavy rains were expected to continue in parts of Missouri, Texas, Arkansas, Kentucky and elsewhere Saturday and could produce dangerous flash floods. The weather service said 45 river locations in multiple states were expected to reach major flood stage, with extensive flooding of structures, roads and other critical infrastructure possible.",
      "In Christian County, Kentucky, which includes Hopkinsville, 6 to 10 inches (15.2 to 25.4 centimeters) fell since Wednesday evening, the NWS said Friday afternoon. The rain caused the Little River to surge over its banks, and 4 to 8 inches (10.2 to 20.3 centimeters) more could fall by Sunday, it said.",
      "Hundreds of Kentucky roads were impassable Friday because of floodwaters, downed trees or mud and rock slides, and the number of closures were likely to increase with more rain Saturday, Beshear said.",
      "Flash flooding is particularly worrisome in rural Kentucky where water can rush off the mountains into the hollows. Less than four years ago, dozens died in flooding in the eastern part of the state.",
      "Extreme flooding across a corridor that includes Louisville, Kentucky and Memphis \u2014 which have major cargo hubs \u2014 could also lead to shipping and supply chain delays, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.",
      "Swollen rivers and tributaries also swamped some parts in Ohio on Friday, and Gov. Mike DeWine said about 70 roads were closed. The southern half of the state was expected to see moderate flooding, which has not happened in four years, he added.",
      "Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf. At least 318 tornado warnings have been issued by the NWS since this week\u2019s outbreak began Wednesday.",
      "The outburst comes at a time when nearly half of NWS forecast offices have 20% vacancy rates after Trump administration job cuts \u2014 twice that of just a decade ago.",
      "At least two reports of observed tornadoes were noted Friday evening in Missouri and Arkansas, according to the NWS.",

      "MSHA was created by Congress within the Labor Department in 1978, in part because state inspectors were seen as too close to the industry to force coal companies to take the sometimes costly steps necessary to protect miners. MSHA is required to inspect each underground mine quarterly and each surface mine twice a year.",
      "Agency inspectors are supposed to check every working section of a mine. They examine electrical and ventilation systems that protect miners from deadly black lung disease, inspect impoundment dams and new roof bolts, and make sure mining equipment is safe, said Jack Spadaro, a longtime mine safety investigator and environmental specialist who worked for MSHA.",
      "Mining fatalities over the past four decades have dropped significantly, in large part because of the dramatic decline in coal production. But the proposed DOGE cuts would require MSHA inspectors to travel farther to get to a mine, and Spadaro said that could lead to less thorough inspections.",
      "A review last month of publicly available data by the Appalachian Citizens\u2019 Law Center indicates that nearly 17,000 health and safety inspections were conducted from the beginning of 2024 through February 2025 by staff at MSHA offices in the facilities on the chopping block. MSHA, which also oversees metal and nonmetal mines, already is understaffed. Over the past decade, it has seen a 27% reduction in total staff, including 30% of enforcement staff in general and 50% of enforcement staff for coal mines, the law center said.",
      "The coal industry has been in decline as utilities have installed more renewable energy and converted coal-fired plants to be fueled by cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas.",
      "U.S. coal production was at 1 billion tons (907,000 metric tons) in 2014 and fell to 578 million tons (524 million metric tons) by 2023, the latest year available, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. It has been in a long, steep decline for decades.",
      "Coal industry deaths were in the hundreds throughout the 1950s and 1960s. After MSHA was created, deaths steadily decreased, then dropped even further in the last decade as a growing number of mining companies shut down and thousands of jobs were eliminated. There have been 11 or fewer deaths in each of the past five years, according to MSHA.",
      "Coal employment rebounded from 2022 to 2023, rising 4.2% to 45,476. West Virginia employed the most miners at 14,000, followed by Kentucky at 5,000. About half of the nation\u2019s 560 coal mines are located in West Virginia (165) and Kentucky (112). Despite having just 15 mines, Wyoming was the highest-producing coal state due to mechanization.",

      "John Gutierrez had been thinking about buying a new laptop for the past year. The Austin, Texas, resident needed a computer with faster processing and increased storage for his photography work and had his sights set on a product from a Taiwanese brand.",
      "Then President Donald Trump announced expansive new import tariffs Wednesday, including a 32% tax on imports from Taiwan. That same day, Gutierrez ordered the laptop, with a base price of $2,400, from a retailer in New York specializing in photo and video gear.",
      "\u201cI thought I\u2019d bite the bullet, buy it now, and then that way I\u2019ll have the latest technology on my laptop and don\u2019t have to worry about the tariffs,\u201d he said.",
      "Gutierrez was among the U.S. consumers rushing to buy big-ticket items before the tariffs take effect. Economists say the tariffs are expected to increase prices for everyday items, warning of potentially weakened U.S. economic growth.",
      "The White House hopes the tariffs prod countries to open their economies to more American exports, leading to negotiations that could reduce tariffs, or that companies increase their production in the U.S. to avoid higher import taxes.",
      "Rob Blackwell and his wife needed a new car that could handle long drives from Arlington, Virginia, to their son's college. Their current electric vehicle is older with a limited range, and it will soon be used by his daughter, who is on the verge of getting her driver's license.",
      "\u201cI have been telling my wife that for some time we were going to need to do it,\u201d he said, \u201cand I was watching to see what the president did with tariffs.\u201d",
      "Blackwell wanted another EV, but said leasing made more economic sense because the technology is ever-changing. He had his eye on the new General Motors Optiq; it's an American car but made in Mexico, which could be subject to tariffs on supply chains that might increase the cost.",
      "After hearing that tariffs would be announced, they made plans the weekend before to lease the car. He said the dealership honored the agreement they worked out before the tariffs were finalized. And although he said the salespeople were a pleasure to deal with, Blackwell sensed a shift in their stance.",
      "\u201cThey know what we know, which is suddenly it flips from a buyer\u2019s market to a seller\u2019s market very quickly,\u201d Blackwell said, adding that he is happy with his choice.",
      "\u201cIt was just a simple rational decision,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this is what the government\u2019s going to do, I need to get my act together.\u201d",
      "Lee Wochner, CEO of the Burbank, California-based Counterintuity marketing and strategy firm, also needed a new vehicle. He wanted a more presentable car for business meetings, but kept putting it off because of his busy work schedule.",
      "On March 27, a Thursday, he told his firm\u2019s car broker: \u201cEd, I need a car pronto and it\u2019s got to happen by Sunday.\u201d",
      "The broker gave him some car and pricing options and he leased an Audi Q3, which was delivered Sunday to his house by a nearby dealership.",
      "A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation showed how much he saved by leasing before the tariffs were implemented. If he had waited, Wochner said, it would have cost about another $4,300.",
      "\u201cOne of the things my car broker said was that deals that were already written, some of the dealerships were ripping them up already and renegotiating them because they were afraid that they weren\u2019t going to be able to get enough new inventory at a price anybody would buy,\u201d he said.",
      "He believes prices will continue to increase because the U.S. has lost the trust of the international trade market.",
      "\u201cIf you need a new car, if you can get that pre-tariff deal still, you should go get it,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause who knows what next Wednesday might be like.\u201d",

      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Retired coal miner Stanley \u201cGoose\u201d Stewart questions whether it's safe for anyone to work in the industry right now.",
      "The Department of Government Efficiency, created by President Donald Trump and run by Elon Musk, has been targeting federal agencies for spending cuts. That includes terminating leases for three dozen offices in the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the agency responsible for enforcing mine safety laws.",
      "The proposals for MSHA are \u201cidiotic,\u201d Stewart said, and would give coal companies \u201cthe green light to do as they please.\u201d",
      "Safety laws and their enforcement played a significant role before and after the Upper Big Branch mine in southern West Virginia blew up 15 years ago Saturday, killing 29 of Stewart's co-workers.",
      "Stewart was there that day but soon stepped away for good, focusing on his love for hunting, fishing and tending to his chickens and his garden when the weather warms.",
      "Coal mining in West Virginia, meanwhile, spent the ensuing years in a political fight that Republicans largely won. As a 2016 presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton was slammed for saying that her plans to shift away from carbon-based fuels like coal would put miners out of business. Trump vowed to save the industry, and while mining jobs have not made a comeback, coal states like West Virginia have become reliable Republican strongholds.",
      "Advocates for the mining industry argue that state government is up to the task of keeping mines safe, although some lawmakers in West Virginia's Republican majority have used the existence of federal inspectors as justification for curtailing the state inspectors' enforcement power. They also point to the dwindling number of mining fatalities \u2014 and mines in general.",
      "Republican Tom Clark, a West Virginia state lawmaker and a former MSHA inspector and supervisor who worked in one West Virginia office slated for closure, said he expected it to shutter years ago. Eight MSHA employees currently work in the Summersville office, Clark said, less than a third of the workforce that existed there about 10 years ago.",
      "Clark said he doesn\u2019t have any concerns for miners, as long as those inspectors are transferred to other coalfield-based offices. Clark, who worked on MSHA's Upper Big Branch investigation, said he supports the Trump administration's efforts to streamline government and stimulate the economy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to take time and there\u2019s going to be some pain for all the American people, I think,\" he said. \u201cBut if we can hang in there and battle through, we all may be better off. I hope so.\u201d",
      "Clark said the federal government should not cut down on inspectors and said black lung benefits need to be funded. He said the government should use money they\u2019re saving to make sure those programs have what they need.",
      "\u201cFunding shouldn\u2019t be a consideration for keeping people healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really shouldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "But Stewart, the former miner, said the MSHA office closures will impact safety.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend anybody get in the mining industry right now because of what\u2019s going on with Trump and Musk,\u201d he said.",
      "Stewart said he's never supported Trump and never would, but he struggles to explain the loyalty of many West Virginians, including coal miners, to the president. He said Trump had never done anything to help them.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t wrap my brain around why they can\u2019t see what a con man he is. I just hope someday they\u2019ll wake up. It may already be too late.\u201d",

      "Investigations determined that worn and broken cutting equipment created a spark that ignited coal dust and methane gas.",
      "After the disaster, MSHA sent inspection teams to conduct impact inspections at mines with a history of repeated problems, many of them underground operations in West Virginia and Kentucky, which have nearly half of the nation\u2019s coal mines. Under the second Trump administration, the impact inspections have stopped.",
      "Joe Main, MSHA\u2019s chief during the Obama administration, said on Musk\u2019s social media site X that weakened MSHA enforcement staffing contributed to the Upper Big Branch disaster and that the proposed DOGE cuts \u201ccan risk miners' lives in an agency already short staffed.\u201d",
      "Some 34 MSHA offices in 19 states have been targeted for closure. Hundreds of federal occupational health employees doing mining-related work and research were laid off this past week as part of cuts to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "\u201cIf you take away all those protections, you're kind of making the workers disposable,\u201d said Dr. Carl Werntz, a West Virginia physician who conducts black lung examinations. \u201cThat's terribly concerning.\u201d",

      "At least 15 Asian and Western government rescue teams have landed crews reaching hundreds of workers in size, alongside initial pledges of financial aid reaching tens of millions of dollars, as the death toll of the March 28 quake tops 3,000, Myanmar's government says. Cameras showed Vietnam's team on arrival, marching square-shouldered to the rescue behind their country's flag.",
      "While Myanmar\u2019s military junta and civil war have posed challenges, the U.S. government has worked with local partners there previously to successfully provide aid for decades, including after deadly storms in 2008 and 2023, aid officials say.",
      "The American government dwarfs other nations' rescue capacity in experience, capacity and heavy machinery able to pull people alive from rubble. But in Myanmar after the most recent quake, the U.S. has distinguished itself for having no known presence on the ground beyond a three-member assessment team sent days after the quake.",
      "\u201cWe all worried what would be the human impact\u201d of President Donald Trump\u2019s dismantling of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development, said Lia Lindsey, a senior humanitarian policy adviser for Oxfam, which scrambled to provide tents, blankets and other aid to quake survivors.",
      "Now, Lindsey said, \"we're seeing it in real time. We\u2019re seeing it in increased suffering and increased death.\u201d'",
      "The United States, the world\u2019s largest economy, long saw its strategic interests and alliances served by its standing as the world\u2019s top humanitarian donor. Myanmar's quake is as close to a no-show as the nation has had in recent memory at a major, accessible natural disaster.",
      "Current and former senior private and government officials say the Myanmar disaster points to some of the results \u2014 for people in need on the ground, and for U.S. standing in the world \u2014 of the Trump administration's retreat from decades of U.S. policy. That approach held that Washington needs both the hard power of a strong military and the soft power of a robust aid and development program to deter enemies, win and keep friends and steer events.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in Europe for a NATO gathering, rejected a suggestion that the administration was ceding influence abroad by canceling thousands of its aid and development contracts, including for disasters. He told reporters that those complaining were the aid groups, which he accused of profiting off past U.S. aid.",
      "\u201cWe will do the best we can,\" Rubio said Friday. \u201cBut we also have other needs we have to balance that against. We\u2019re not walking away.\"",

      "Leading Senate Democrats wrote Rubio this week, urging him to scale up U.S. disaster aid to Myanmar \u2014 and fast. Separately, Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke of watching a news broadcast of the disaster showing Chinese government teams at work.",
      "\u201cIt hurt my heart to see where, instead of a USAID ... team leading the response, there was a team from the PRC that was being celebrated for having saved some people in the rubble,\u201d Coons said.",
      "The 2 1/2-month-old Trump administration, through Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency teams, has frozen USAID funding, terminated thousands of contracts and is firing all but a handful of its staff globally. It accuses the agency of waste and of advancing liberal causes. The Myanmar quake is the first major natural disaster since that work started.",
      "The Trump administration and some Republican lawmakers say they will reassemble a reduced slate of aid and development programs under the State Department, fitting their narrower interpretation of work that serves U.S. strategic and economic interests.",
      "Days after the Myanmar quake, the U.S. made its first announcement of help: It was sending a three-member assessment team of non-specialist advisers from a regional USAID office in Bangkok, Thailand. Coincidentally, like hundreds of other USAID staffers around the world, the three had received layoff notices from the Trump administration on March 28 within hours of the quake, current and former USAID officials confirmed.",
      "The administration also promised $2 million in aid, and announced another $7 million Friday. But there's a much larger number at play.",
      "That $9 million total is dwarfed by the roughly $2 billion in payments for previously rendered services and goods that the Trump administration has owed nonprofit humanitarian groups and other contractors and government and nongovernment foreign partners, aid officials say. The Trump administration abruptly shut down USAID and State foreign assistance payments \u2014 including for work already done \u2014 on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day.",
      "Combined with abruptly terminated aid contracts and the freeze on the USAID and State aid and development payments, the U.S. back debt is forcing larger aid operations and businesses to scale back their services to people in need and to slash staff. Some smaller organizations were driven out of business. That was even before the Myanmar quake.",
      "Under court order, the administration is slowly making good on those back payments.",
      "In the meantime, nonprofit groups are having to draw on reserve funds they would normally use for sudden unplanned disasters like the Myanmar quake to pay the bills that the U.S. should have paid, said Lindsey, the Oxfam official.",
      "Asked about the burden that the non-government organizations \u2014 another name for aid groups \u2014 say USAID's unpaid back bills are placing on their work, the State Department said in an email, \u201cThe U.S. government cannot comment on how NGOs manage their financing.\"",
      "Typically, the United States itself would have provided $10 million to $20 million in the initial phase of response to a disaster like the Myanmar quake, with more later for long-term aid and rebuilding, said Sarah Charles, who ran disaster response and overall humanitarian affairs at USAID in the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cWe have a long history in Burma,\u201d Charles said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s an environment that the U.S. government has been operating in over the last many decades.\"",
      "Normally, the United States also would have had 20 to 25 specialized disaster workers on the ground in as few as 24 hours, Charles said. That number would have jumped to 200 or more if USAID had flown in urban rescue teams from California and Virginia. They deploy as self-contained units, with dog handlers and the capacity to feed and provide clean water to the teams, Charles said.",
      "The Trump administration preserved contracts for the California and Virginia rescue teams under pressure from lawmakers. But the contracts for their transport are believed among the thousands of USAID contracts that the administration canceled. That left the U.S. no quick way to move search-and-rescue crews when disaster struck, Charles said.",
      "Britain has pledged $13 million in aid and said it will match up to $5 million in private donations, and China and others have promised financial aid. At least 15 countries sent in dozens or hundreds of rescuers or aid workers, including Russia, China, India and the United Arab Emirates, according to Myanmar officials.",
      "China shares a border and close ties with Myanmar. Chinese rescuers had their first success Sunday, fewer than 48 hours after the quake, when they joined hands with local people to pull an elderly man from a badly damaged hospital in the capital city of Naypyitaw.",

      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors are seeking more than seven years in prison for disgraced former U.S. Rep. George Santos after he pleaded guilty to federal fraud and identity theft charges.",
      "The U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York argued in a court filing Friday that a significant sentence was warranted because the New York Republican\u2019s \u201cunparalleled crimes\u201d had \u201cmade a mockery\u201d of the country\u2019s election system.",
      "\u201cFrom his creation of a wholly fictitious biography to his callous theft of money from elderly and impaired donors, Santos\u2019s unrestrained greed and voracious appetite for fame enabled him to exploit the very system by which we select our representatives,\" the office wrote.",
      "Prosecutors also argued that Santos had been \u201cunrepentant and defiant\u201d for years, dismissing the prosecution as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and refusing to resign from Congress as his web of lies was debunked.",
      "They said his claims of remorse after pleading guilty \u201cring hollow\" and suggested he has a \u201chigh likelihood of reoffending\" given he has not forfeited any of his ill-gotten gains or repaid any of his victims.",
      "Santos\u2019 lawyers, in an email to The Associated Press, dismissed the seven-year proposal as \u201cabsurd and unfounded,\u201d saying it appears \u201cdesigned to beat up on a man that already took full responsibility for his actions.\u201d",
      "In their own sentencing memo Friday, they rejected the notion that Santos will fall back into criminal behavior, noting he has no prior criminal record and also provides \u201ccrucial\u201d support to his sister and her young daughter.",
      "They argued for a two-year prison term, which is the mandatory minimum sentence for aggravated identity theft.",
      "The lawyers maintain such a sentence is in line with those handed to former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and other political figures facing similar financial crimes.",
      "They also touted Santos' cooperation in a separate federal investigation into a Texas man who tried to dupe Santos out of nearly $1 million by posing as a political fixer offering to destroy evidence in his cases.",
      "\u201cThis sentence, coupled with the significant collateral consequences Mr. Santos has already suffered\u2014including the loss of his congressional seat and public humiliation \u2014 would send a clear message that such conduct will not be tolerated,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",
      "A federal judge on Long Island is scheduled to decide Santos\u2019 sentence during a court hearing April 25.",
      "The once-rising Republican, who represented parts of Queens and Long Island, served barely a year in office before he was ousted by his House colleagues in 2023, just the sixth congressperson ever expelled in the chamber\u2019s history.",
      "Santos\u2019 political demise came after it was revealed that he had fabricated much of his life story, leading to questions about how the political unknown had funded his winning campaign.",
      "The now-36-year-old cast himself as a wealthy businessman who had graduated from top colleges, worked at prestigious Wall Street firms and held a valuable real estate portfolio. In truth, he was struggling financially and faced eviction.",
      "Santos admitted in August that he duped voters, deceived donors and stole the identities of nearly a dozen people, including his own family members, to make donations to his congressional campaign.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Paul Schrader, the writer of \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and director of \u201cAmerican Gigolo,\u201d has been accused in a lawsuit of sexually assaulting his former personal assistant, firing her when she wouldn't acquiesce to advances and reneging on a settlement that was meant to keep the allegations confidential.",
      "The former assistant, identified in court documents as Jane Doe, sued the filmmaker and his production company on Thursday. She is seeking a judge's order to enforce the agreement after Schrader said he couldn\u2019t go through with it. The terms, including a monetary payment, were not disclosed.",
      "\u201cThis is an open-and-shut settlement enforcement matter,\u201d Doe's lawyer, Gregory Chiarello, wrote in court papers accompanying the breach of contract claim.",
      "Schrader's lawyer, Philip J. Kessler, deemed the lawsuit \u201cdesperate, opportunistic and frivolous\" and said many of the allegations in it are false or materially misleading.",
      "\u201cWe absolutely deny that there was ever a sexual relationship of any kind between Mr. Schrader and his former assistant, and we deny that Mr. Schrader ever made an attempt to have a sexual relationship of any kind with his former assistant,\" Kessler said.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in a New York court, laid bare allegations that the confidential settlement between Doe, 26, and Schrader, 78, had been intended to keep under wraps.",
      "They include her claim that the filmmaker trapped her in his hotel room, grabbed her arms and kissed her against her will last year while they were promoting his latest film, \u201cOh, Canada,\u201d at the Cannes Film Festival in France.",
      "Two days later, the lawsuit said, Schrader called Doe repeatedly and sent her angry text messages claiming he was \u201cdying\u201d and couldn't pack his bags. When Doe arrived to help, the lawsuit said, Schrader exposed his genitals to her as he opened his hotel room door wearing nothing but an open bathrobe.",
      "Doe alleges Schrader fired her last September after she again rejected his advances. Soon after, the lawsuit said, he sent her an email expressing fear that he'd become \"a Harvey Weinstein\u201d in her mind. Weinstein, the movie mogul turned #MeToo villain, was convicted of rape in Los Angeles in 2022 and is awaiting an April 15 retrial in his New York rape case.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Schrader agreed to the settlement on Feb. 5 but changed his mind after an illness and \u201csoul searching.\u201d Schrader conveyed through his lawyers last month that he \u201ccould not live with the settlement,\u201d the lawsuit said. Kessler disputed that.",
      "\u201cThe agreement that they're trying to enforce against Mr. Schrader, in plain English, required both parties to sign it before it became legally effective,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cMr. Schrader declined to sign it. It's frankly as simple as that.\u201d",
      "Doe worked for Schrader from 2021 until 2024, according to the lawsuit. During that time, Kessler said, she posted on social media about how much she loved her job and referred to Schrader as an extraordinary mentor and \u201cmy man.\u201d",
      "Schrader rose to fame through his collaborations with director Martin Scorsese, beginning with \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d in 1976. Robert De Niro\u2019s iconic line, \u201cYou talkin' to me,\u201d is seared into the lexicon and ranked among the American Film Institute\u2019s all-time greatest movie quotes.",
      "Schrader co-wrote Scorsese's 1980 boxing drama \u201cRaging Bull,\u201d also starring De Niro, and authored his 1988 religious epic \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\" and his 1999 paramedic drama \u201cBringing Out the Dead.\u201d",
      "He's also directed 23 of his own films, highlighted by 1980\u2019s \u201cAmerican Gigolo,\u201d which he also wrote. He received his only Academy Award nomination for writing \u201cFirst Reformed,\u201d a 2017 thriller about a small-town minister that he also directed.",
      "Schrader told The Associated Press last year that he made \u201cOh, Canada\u201d \u2014 the film that Doe said brought them to Cannes \u2014 as he reconciled his own mortality after a string of hospitalizations for long COVID.",
      "In 2016, Schrader told The Hollywood Reporter police visited him after he ranted on Facebook about Donald Trump\u2019s then-looming presidency. Schrader wrote Trump\u2019s election was \u201ca call to violence\u201d and said people should be \u201cwilling to take arms.\u201d",

      "The job cuts will begin with the IRS Office of Civil Rights and Compliance, which would be reduced by 75% through layoffs, and its remaining workers would be absorbed into the agency\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel, according to those two people as well as a third person familiar with the matter. Fewer than 200 people work in the Office of Civil Rights and Compliance, formerly known as the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.",
      "The three people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the plans. The Washington Post first reported on Friday's layoffs at the IRS, which collects revenue and enforces tax laws.",
      "The workforce reductions are part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to shrink the size of the federal bureaucracy through billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.

      "Georgia lawmakers passed a bill that would change how wrongfully convicted people are compensated",
      "ATLANTA -- A repeated attempt to fix Georgia's inefficient system for compensating people wrongfully convicted of crimes almost died. Then it got tacked onto a bill that could compensate former President Donald Trump and his codefendants for attorneys' fees after they were indicted for attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia.",
      "The combined bill, Senate Bill 244, won final approval Friday, the last day of Georgia's legislative session.",
      "If Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signs the bill, it would let criminal defendants recoup attorneys\u2019 fees in cases where a prosecutor gets disqualified and the case is dismissed. It would also establish a state law requiring an administrative law judge to award $75,000 per year of incarceration to people who have been found wrongfully convicted if they prove they are innocent of the crime or any lesser offense.",
      "Georgia is one of 12 states without a law compensating people wrongfully convicted of crimes, according to an analysis by the Georgia Innocence Project. Instead, a lawmaker must sponsor a measure to compensate people and get legislative approval \u2014 a process plagued by politics that often leaves people without money, including five who tried this year.",
      "The original half of the bill has a different backstory. Trump and 18 codefendants were indicted in Fulton County in August 2023. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was disqualified from the case by a state appeals court based on a romantic relationship she had with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom Willis hired to lead the case.",
      "This is what led state Sen. Brandon Beach, an Alpharetta Republican, to bring forward the measure. He was recently named treasurer of the United States by Trump after years of vociferous support for the president.",
      "The measure passed the Senate 35-18 with all Republicans voting yes. The three highest-ranking Democrats crossed over to vote yes -- House Minority Leader Harold Jones II of Augusta House Democratic Caucus Chair Sen. Elena Parent of Atlanta and House Democratic Whip Kim Jackson of Stone Mountain.",
      "But many Democrats were not on board.",
      "\u201cI understand some people have allegiance to the president and some people voted for him, and that\u2019s their right. But do not force my constituents to pay his legal fees,\" Atlanta Democrat state Sen. RaShaun Kemp said.",
      "Atlanta Democrat state Rep. Shea Roberts on Wednesday called the bill a \u201cdisgusting display of punitive politics.\u201d The bill passed 103-61 in the House.",
      "\u201cIt puts legislators and voters in a moral straitjacket,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIf you want to support justice for the wrongfully convicted, you also have to support protecting powerful politicians from accountability. That's not leadership, that's hostage-taking.\u201d",
      "The bill's passage came the day after Republican Senate Majority Whip Randy Robertson held a four hour committee meeting at 6 a.m. on a measure to compensate five people whose convictions were overturned after years of incarceration. By then, it was too late for that proposal to get a vote.",
      "Robertson, a former sheriff's deputy, has been the lead opponent against past measures to compensate people and to establish a law to let legal experts make that decision instead of legislators.",
      "People seeking compensation this year have had convictions overturned based on findings such as DNA evidence, legal and police errors and the discovery of new evidence indicating they did not commit the crime they were incarcerated for.",
      "But Robertson said people found wrongfully convicted aren\u2019t necessarily innocent because convictions may be overturned due to technical errors. He also had doubts about whether some of the people seeking compensation this year were innocent. Still, he said the current method is flawed, and he decided to support this year's bill to take the compensation process out of the legislature's hand.",
      "Republican sponsor state Rep. Katie Dempsey of Rome said the bill will let the wrongfully convicted \"have a true chance, that is not a retrial from legislators.\u201d",
      "Democratic Rep. Scott Holcomb, who has championed the wrongful compensation bill for years, begged Democrats in both chambers to vote for a measure he called one of the few \u201cincredibly consequential\u201d bills he worked on.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t a person alive who would trade the money that these individuals are receiving for what happened to them in terms of being locked up in our state\u2019s prisons, for usually decades of their lives, for something they didn\u2019t do,\" he said Friday.",

      "In addition to ending the program going forward, FEMA said it was also cancelling all applications to the program from 2020 to 2023 and that money that was awarded as part of grants but not already distributed would be immediately returned to the federal government.",
      "The program was started under the first Trump administration and then expanded under the Biden administration.",
      "About $1 billion had been allocated to the program as part of the Biden administration's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021. According to FEMA, about $133 million has already been handed out to about 450 applicants across the country.",
      "Communities across the country have used program funds to help their cities and towns mitigate disasters, such as raising roads to keep them out of floodwaters or building underground storage units to prepare for droughts.",
      "The announcement didn't detail what exactly the agency found to be \u201cwasteful,\u201d but the Trump administration has targeted programs or funding across the federal government that goes to address climate change or that promotes diversity, equity and inclusion goals.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the BRIC program was a key part of the government's efforts to address climate change and while grants were awarded to a wide range of communities across the country, there was a special emphasis on helping historically underserved communities.",
      "The cuts come as the future of FEMA itself is in question. President Donald Trump has questioned whether to disband it entirely and give money directly to states to handle disasters. Trump has created a council to study what to do with FEMA and whether to get rid of it.",

      "Heading into this year, most U.S. farmers were hoping to break even or maybe record a small profit",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Heading into this year, most U.S. farmers were hoping to break even or maybe record a small profit if they could find a way to limit their sky-high costs. But now they are faced with losing the biggest export market for many of their crops after China retaliated against President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "\u201cThere's just not any margin for error in the current farm economy,\u201d said Kentucky farmer Caleb Ragland, who serves as president of the American Soybean Association.",
      "Soybean and sorghum farmers have particular reason to worry because at least half of those crops are exported and China has long been the biggest buyer. China has also bought a lot of American corn, beef, chicken and other crops as part of spending $24.65 billion on U.S. agricultural products last year. Now with China slapping 34% tariffs on all American products Friday \u2014 on top of other tariffs it imposed earlier this year \u2014 all of those products will be significantly more expensive in China",
      "Crop prices, much like the stock market, dropped after Trump announced his tariffs earlier this week.",
      "Tim Dufault, whose farm is in northwest Minnesota only about 80 miles south of Canada, said in a good year soybean farmers might make $50 to $75 an acre. But this isn't a good year because crop prices aren't high enough to cover soaring costs, and the price drop in the past two days cost them about $25 an acre, he said.",
      "Dufault said he is worried that these new tariffs might put many farmers out of business, including the young farmers he rented his land to heading into this year as he retired because they likely won't make anything in 2025.",
      "\u201cI just I hope to God they can stay in business,\u201d said Dufault, who is active with the Farmers for Free Trade group that pushes for open markets.",
      "One of the biggest long-term concerns is that American farmers and ranchers will lose market share as China turns to Brazil and other countries to buy the soybeans, beef, chicken and other crops it consumes. China will buy lots of sorghum because it is distilled into the drink baijiu that is as popular there as whiskey is in the United States, but they will get it from other countries.",
      "Farmers endured Trump's previous trade war with China during his first term. But this time, Trump's tariffs extend around the globe, so China likely won't be the last country to retaliate with tariffs of its own.",
      "The only way most farmers survived Trump's last trade war was with tens of billions of government aid payments, but it's not clear if he will do that this time. He gave them more than $22 billion in aid payments in 2019 and nearly $46 billion in 2020, though that year also included aid related to the COVID pandemic.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told Fox News this week that right now she doesn't believe massive aid payments will be necessary, although she won't know that for several months. \"But if it is, then this president has always said and he is resolute in his commitment to our farmers and our ranchers and our great rural communities in America, so we will we\u2019ll make sure we\u2019re ready if in fact that is necessary,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBut none of us like that,\u201d said farmer Andy Hineman, who is vice president of the Kansas Grain Sorghum Producers Association. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to live on government handouts. We\u2019d rather sell the crops we grow.\u201d",
      "But farmer Bryant Kagay, part owner of Kagay farms in Amity, Missouri, said he doesn\u2019t \u201chave a lot of faith that these tariffs \u2014 the way they are laid out today \u2014 will stick around long term.\u201d",
      "He also doesn't like the idea of getting aid from the government.",
      "\u201cI really hate that seems to be the solution that, well, we\u2019ll just pay farmers some just off-the-cuff payment to help offset this,\u201d Kagay said. \u201cI think a federal government that\u2019s vastly overspending today, like this is not the way to solve that problem.\u201d",
      "The hope for farmers is that Trump\u2019s tariffs will lead to negotiations with other countries that will lower tariffs and other trade barriers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the type of positive development that we can do that\u2019s good for everybody involved, and that\u2019s what we need to look for,\u201d Ragland said. \u201cInstead of beating each other up with higher and higher tariffs \u2014 it\u2019s just like punching each other in the face. We\u2019re not going to gain anything from it. It\u2019s just going to cause us to hurt. That would be my encouragement to the administration, is to look for opportunities and get some great deals done proactively.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- Georgians may be able to sue local governments for enacting local gun safety measures under a bill passed Friday that supporters say ensures localities don\u2019t violate people\u2019s gun rights.",
      "Senate Bill 204, would let people sue local governments if they have been \u201caggrieved\u201d by a rule that conflicts with gun rights granted by state law and seek compensation for some damages. The Senate will likely give final approval to the measure that passed in the Republican-led House 99-74 on the last day of the legislative session.",
      "Trenton Republican Sen. Colton Moore proposed the original measure to thwart gun safety ordinances like one in Savannah that punishes people who leave weapons in unlocked cars. But Moore said he no longer supports the move in part because the most individuals can receive in compensation is $25,000 instead of $50,000.",
      "Democrats \u2014 including those who said they own and value their guns \u2014 said the bill would hinder local governments that want to protect people from preventable gun violence.",
      "The legislation also comes months after a mass shooting at Apalachee High School, the school northeast of Atlanta where a 14-year-old boy stands accused of killing two teachers and two students and wounding several others last year on Sept. 4. He obtained a firearm from his father.",
      "\u201cThe Apalachee families have come here again and again, asking you to pass common-sense safe storage laws,\u201d said Atlanta Democrat Shea Roberts. \u201cAnd how do we respond? With a bill that precludes safe storage? SB 204 is a slap in the face to those families. And for what? To punish Savannah for trying to prevent gun theft and violence?\u201d",
      "Republican Rep. Alan Powell called it a \u201cshame\u201d for Democrats to bring up the shooting, arguing it had nothing to do with ensuring state gun laws are upheld.",
      "\u201cThis is an affirmation of our strong and unwavering support of the Second Amendment and this legislation ensures that Georgians are protected from government overreach,\" said Republican House Majority Leader Chuck Efstration.",
      "Democrats also accused Republicans of \u201chijacking\u201d bills. The measure got tacked onto a separate Senate Democratic bill.",
      "Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s office said he declined to comment on pending legislation, including whether the Republican would sign the bill if it reached his desk.",
      "Another Democratic proposal would have created a $300 tax credit for safe storage devices and lessons and had bipartisan support in past years. Democrats also wanted to make it a crime for adults to let kids get their hands on a gun if they didn't store it safely.",
      "Their proposals got stripped down and merged with House Bill 79 to create a four-day sales tax holiday in October for guns and gun accessories. It instead offers a $300 tax credit for people who participate in an in-person course on safe gun use. It did not get a final Senate vote.",

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- When retired school counselor Don Herneisen meets up with friends each week for breakfast at a hole-in-the-wall restaurant, the conversation often turns to the economy. With financial markets in turmoil as President Donald Trump unveiled his latest tariffs this week, the popularity of that topic is unlikely to change anytime soon.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s political uncertainty, there\u2019s economic uncertainty, and if you\u2019re retired, you don\u2019t much like uncertainty at this point,\u201d said Herneisen, 77, as he and his wife made a stop at Union Station in Kansas City, Missouri, on Friday while visiting family.",
      "Stock markets worldwide careened even lower Friday after China matched Trump\u2019s big raise in tariffs in an escalating trade war. The sweeping new tariffs, on top of previous levies and retaliation worldwide, are also expected to increase prices for everyday items.",
      "Herneisen, who lives in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and his wife, Cathy Herneisen, a 74-year-old retired Verizon worker, are living on a mix of pension, Social Security and an individual retirement account, or IRA.

      "\u201cPrices are higher, but I am still spending the same amount of money,\u201d she said. \u201cI am sticking with the grocery budget, and that means that I\u2019m cutting back on prepared food, so I\u2019m buying the products themselves so it is hurting people who run a small business that sell their pre-made food.\"",
      "They live in a Republican-leaning area of the swing state but neither voted for Trump, who has said Americans may feel \u201csome pain\u201d because of tariffs, but that the long-term goals, including getting more manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., are worth it.",

      "NeSmith said retirees generally have a little bit less risk in their portfolios and bonds have been performing well in the volatility.",
      "\u201cThe overall theme that we\u2019re really getting at is you really have to be aware of your risk tolerance and your financial plan, and you needed to do that going into this so that way you can ride through this volatility that we\u2019re seeing right now,\u201d he said.",

Problems have included long lines, poll worker and ballot shortages and ballots that were not counted the day of the election.",

      "Washington and Oregon have become the latest states to ask a court to reject President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overhaul elections in the U.S., a day after Democratic officials in 19 others filed a similar lawsuit",
      "SEATTLE -- Washington and Oregon on Friday became the latest states to ask a court to reject President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overhaul elections in the U.S., a day after Democratic officials in 19 others filed a similar lawsuit.",
      "Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said the two states sued separately because they conduct elections entirely by mail and would be particularly harmed by the president\u2019s efforts.",
      "\u201cNeither the Constitution nor any federal law gives the president authority to set rules for how states conduct elections,\u201d Brown, a Democrat, said during a news conference. \u201cIt is the states that decide how voters are registered. It is the states that decide how ballots are counted.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Seattle is the fifth against the executive order since it was issued last week. The order includes new requirements that people provide documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and a demand that all mail ballots be received by Election Day. It also puts states\u2019 federal funding at risk if election officials don\u2019t comply.",
      "That could disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters in the Pacific Northwest, where ballots must be postmarked \u2014 but not necessarily received \u2014 by Election Day. Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs noted at the news conference that more than 300,000 ballots in Washington arrived after Election Day last year.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s executive order is nothing more than a blatant attempt to rig the system and suppress votes,\u201d Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a news release. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to make it harder for people to vote. It\u2019s a direct assault on the Constitution and a brazen attempt to act like a king, dictating how states should run their elections.\"",
      "The lawsuits from the states follow earlier ones against the executive order by nonprofit voting groups and the Democratic National Committee. They say the order could disenfranchise voters because millions of eligible voting-age Americans do not have the proper documents readily available. People already are required to attest to being U.S. citizens, under penalty of perjury, in order to vote.",
      "The lawsuits have said Trump's directive violates the Constitution, which specifies that states have the authority to set the \u201ctimes, places and manner\u201d of elections. Congress has the power to \u201cmake or alter\u201d regulations for elections for president and Congress, but the Constitution doesn\u2019t mention any presidential authority over election administration.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields on Friday called the proof-of-citizenship requirements \u201ccommon sense\u201d and said the administration \u201cis standing up for free, fair, and honest elections.\u201d",
      "Trump has continued to claim he won the 2020 election despite all evidence to the contrary. Courts rejected dozens of his legal challenges and his attorney general at the time said there was no sign of widespread fraud. Reviews, recounts and audits in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s victory.",
      "He and other Republicans also promoted the idea during last year's presidential election that large numbers of people who were not U.S. citizens might be voting. Voting by noncitizens is rare and, when caught, can lead to felony charges and deportation.",
      "\"It is hard to imagine a subject where this president has less credibility than he does with elections,\u201d said Brown, citing Trump's lies about the 2020 election and his loss to Biden. \u201cHe is always looking to undermine faith in our democracy.\u201d",

      "As the stock market reeled Friday from President Donald Trump\u2019s move to institute widespread global tariffs, Trump shared a video on Truth Social that erroneously claimed legendary investor Warren Buffett praised his recent economic policies.",
      "Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "CLAIM: Warren Buffett said President Donald Trump is \u201cis making the best economic moves he\u2019s seen in 50 years.\u201d",
      "THE FACTS: This is false. Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's company, issued a statement shortly after Trump posted the video, calling reports on social media attributing comments to Buffett \u201cfalse.\u201d Buffett told a reporter Friday that he won't be commenting on the economy until Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting later this spring.",
      "\u201cThere are reports currently circulating on social media (including Twitter, Facebook and TikTok) regarding comments allegedly made by Warren E. Buffett. All such reports are false,\u201d reads the Berkshire Hathaway statement.",
      "The company did not specify which reports the statement was referring to and did not respond to requests for clarification.",
      "In the video the president shared, a voiceover states as it shows a clip of Buffett: \u201cTrump is purposely crashing the stock market by 20% this month, but he's doing it on purpose. And this is why Warren Buffett just said Trump is making the best economic moves he's seen in over 50 years.\u201d",
      "The video's audio comes from a March 13 Instagram post.",
      "CNBC reporter Becky Quick reported Friday that Buffett said any quotes circulating on social media about the current economic situation that are purportedly from him are not authentic.",
      "\u201cHe says that he\u2019s not talking to anybody about anything related to the markets, the economy or tariffs, and that he will not be doing that between now and the annual meeting for Berkshire Hathaway, which takes place on Saturday, May 3,\u201d Quick said in a CNBC segment.",
      "However, Buffett did speak briefly about tariffs in an interview for CBS News' \"Sunday Morning\u201d that aired March 2.",
      "\u201cTariffs are actually, we\u2019ve had a lot of experience with them. They\u2019re an act of war to some degree,\u201d he said in response to a question on how he thinks tariffs will effect the economy.",
      "He was vaguer when asked how he sees the state of the economy saying, \u201cI can\u2019t talk about it now, I really can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Buffett has stopped commenting on politics or other controversial subjects because, he has said, he doesn\u2019t want to hurt Berkshire\u2019s businesses by offending anyone. The longtime Democrat hasn\u2019t publicly backed any candidates for office since Hillary Clinton ran for president.",
      "He did offer advice addressed to \u201cUncle Sam\u201d in his most recent annual letter to shareholders, reminding the country that \u201cwe need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Trump did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The S&P 500 lost 6% Friday after China matched Trump\u2019s big raise in tariffs announced earlier this week. The move increased the stakes in a trade war that could end with a recession.",

      "The drugs were transported mostly through Native American reservations along the border in vehicles with secret compartments. They were then delivered to stash houses in New York City before being distributed by street-level dealers throughout the metropolitan area, according to prosecutors.",
      "In one of the criminal cases that prompted Friday\u2019s arrest, prosecutors say Braun fought with a guest during a March 29 event observing the Sabbath at his home in Lawrence, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) east of Manhattan.",
      "Braun punched the man in the face, shoved him to the ground, then pushed his 3-year-old son to the ground, leaving a red mark on the child's back, according to a complaint filed in Nassau County court.",
      "He has been charged with two counts of assault and one count of endangering the welfare of a child.",
      "Braun also faces two counts of menacing. Prosecutors say he argued with a staffer at a hospital in January and swung an IV pole at her. In March, he threatened a man who asked him to be quiet during a synagogue service.",
      "\u201cDo you know who I am or what I can do to you?\u201d Braun said, grabbing the man\u2019s arm, according to the complaint.",

      "In a case last summer, police said Braun evaded bridge tolls at least 40 times, accruing $160 in unpaid fees because his Lamborghini and Ferrari sports cars didn\u2019t have license plates, court records show.",
      "Braun\u2019s legal troubles don\u2019t end there. The Federal Trade Commission sued him and won a $20 million judgment last year.",

    "story": [
      "As stock markets continue to tumble after the US imposition of sweeping and swingeing tariffs, many are asking does this qualify as a stock market \"crash\" and what that could mean for them.",
      "The word crash has been used sparingly over the decades and is usually reserved for a fall of over 20% from a recent peak in a day, or over the course of a couple of days.",
      "On 19 October, 1987 - also known as Black Monday - the US stock market lost 23% of its value in a single day, and other stock markets had similar falls. The UK FTSE index fell 23% over two days \u2013 partly because it closes earlier than New York, and so it often plays catch up with whatever happens in the US the next morning.",
      "That was most definitely a crash.",
      "In 1929, the US stock market lost over 20% of its value in two days - and 50% within three weeks. That was the famous Wall Street Crash that ushered in the great depression of the 1930s.",
      "By comparison, the US stock market has lost around 17% of its value from its peak in February and is now down 2% from where it was this time last year.",
      "Nevertheless, these are the biggest and quickest declines we have seen in world markets since they were gripped by the panic of Covid-19 in early 2020.",
      "A decline of 20% from a peak is considered a \"bear market\" - a description of a market that appears to be more likely to go down than go up. We are very close to that description right now.",
      "How does it affect you?",
      "While many people own stocks and shares directly, most people's exposure to stock markets come through their pension plans. There are two types \u2013 defined benefit schemes which guarantee a fixed pension income, and defined contribution where your pension pot rises and falls with financial markets.",
      "That may sound like defined contribution plans are very vulnerable to this sell off \u2013 but not all of your contributions go into shares. Much of the money goes into safer investments such as government bonds. These tend to increase in value when stock markets fall as they are seen as a \"safe haven\" along with other assets such as gold.",
      "That is exactly what has happened here.",
      "Government bonds have risen in value and that can offset some or all of the fall in shares depending on how your pension savings are allocated.",
      "The closer to retirement you are, the higher percentage of your pension pot is likely to be invested in bonds - so the less affected you will be.",
      "There have been many falls like this in the decades since the Wall Street Crash but in the long term, shares have turned out to be a good investment \u2013 and pension savings is a long term game.",
      "So, does it matter?",
      "It does matter. A company's share value is a measure of how profitable those companies are expected to be in the future. A plummeting market is an indication that most people think that most companies are likely to see their profits fall.",
      "The markets believe that US President Donald Trump's tariff bombshell is expected to raise prices, lower demand and reduce profits, making companies less valuable and more inclined to cut investment and jobs.",
      "So the real warning sign here is not about the value of your pension but about the health of the economy in which we live and work.",
      "Falls like this sometimes, often even, herald an economic downturn. That is more of a worry than the value of your pension, which has seen and will see volatility like this over the years.",

      "So what will all this mean for the price of Nike's shoe?",

      "'Competitive industry'",
      "Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes - between 32% to 54%.",

      "Nike is already facing a tight bottom line.",
      "It had around $51bn (\u00a339.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%.",
      "But that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense.",
      "By the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to roughly 11%.",
      "That's across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items.",

      "\"I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,\" he says.",
      "Theoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: \"Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?\"",
      "Even before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes.",
      "Finance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence.",

      "Chemicals: 'We're hoping there is an opportunity'",
      "For something not visible to the naked eye, organic chemicals are a huge US export for the UK, totalling close to \u00a33bn last year.",
      "They are used across a massive range of industries from food to make-up to engines and into agriculture.",
      "Rather than feeling fearful about the US tariff, Robinsons Brothers reckons it may help the West Bromwich-based organic chemicals firm wrestle back American customers from cheaper overseas rivals.",
      "Chief executive Adrian Hanrahan says: \"We supplied a lot more to the US but China and India knocked us out of that because of very low pricing.\"",
      "Under Trump's new regime, China's imports face a 34% tariff while India's products will be taxed at 27%. Robinsons Brothers chemicals are already taxed at 6% when they reach the US",
      "Mr Hanrahan says he is still trying to nail down whether the new 10% US tariff on UK goods means Robinsons Brothers' American customers will be paying an additional 4% or a total 16%.",
      "\"Either way, it is a lot less than China or India will see going into the US,\" he says. \"So I am really hoping and seeing an opportunity for us here in one area.\"",
      "He says that since January, the company has been receiving more enquiries from the US, including two customers Robinsons Brothers lost five years ago \"at great expense\".",
      "At the moment, Robinsons Brothers derives between 1.5% and 2% of total sales - which reached \u00a324m last year - from America.",
      "This \"doesn't seem a lot\" says Mr Hanrahan but they are high margin products.",
      "There are, of course, concerns that rival countries may have to dump products once destined for the US on other markets, such as the UK which, in turn, could drive down domestic prices.",
      "Mr Hanrahan says: \"I am hoping that the UK government is preparing for that and putting something in place to mitigate any form of product dumping in the UK and in the EU.\"",

      "The central government has described the situation as \"a social emergency\" and agrees that a lack of supply is driving the crisis. Last year, the Housing Ministry estimated that the country needs between 600,000 and one million new homes over the next four years in order to meet demand.",
      "This need for more housing has been pushed up in part by the arrival of immigrants who have joined the workforce and are helping drive Spain's economic growth. The ministry also pointed to a lack of social housing, which at 3.4% of total supply, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "In 2007, at the height of a property-ownership bubble, more than 600,000 homes were built in Spain. But high building costs, lack of available land and a shortage of manpower have all been factors in restricting construction in recent years, with just under 100,000 homes completed in 2024.",
      "The government has taken measures to incentivise construction, apportioning land for the building of affordable homes, while trying to ensure that public housing does not end up in the private market, which has been a problem in the past.",
      "But the Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has also expressed a willingness to intervene in the market in order to bring rental prices under control.",
      "At a recent event to mark the opening of 218 low-rent flats in the southern city of Seville, he declared that Spaniards \"want us to act, they want the housing market to operate according to the law of reason, of social justice, not the law of the jungle; they want to ensure that vulture funds and speculators are not doing whatever they like\".",
      "The central government and a number of local administrations have identified short-term tourist accommodation as part of the problem. Last year, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and several cities on the mainland saw protests by locals against surging tourist numbers, with their impact on rental costs the main complaint.",
      "Several city halls have responded by announcing plans to restrict the granting of tourist-flat permits, while Barcelona is going further, revoking the licences of all of the city's 10,000 or so registered short-term apartments by 2028.",
      "The S\u00e1nchez government has also pushed through parliament a housing law, which includes a cap on rentals in so-called \"high-tension\" areas where prices are climbing out of control. Political resistance has meant that the legislation is so far only being implemented in the northern regions of the Basque Country, Navarre and Catalonia, and its success is open to debate.",
      "The Socialist-led regional and central governments have pointed to a 3.7% drop in rental costs in \"high-tension\" areas of Catalonia since the cap's introduction there a year ago, with Barcelona seeing a decrease of 6.4%.",
      "However, critics warn that the rental cap has spooked owners and caused thousands of properties to be withdrawn from the market.",
      "\"On the supply side, the problem is that all measures taken by the local or national governments are going against landlords,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"Even people that were doing build-to-rent new properties have been selling their properties because they don't want to get into the rental market.\"",
      "Another initiative proposed by the central government which has stirred up debate is a tax of up to 100% on properties bought by non-residents from outside the EU, on the grounds that such homes are often barely inhabited. This is a measure that, if rolled out, would heavily affect British buyers.",
      "The conservative opposition has accused the government of being too heavy-handed with its approach. However, as public anger builds over this issue, there are many others who would like the country's leaders to act much more stridently.",
      "Gonzalo \u00c1lvarez, of the Sindicato de Inquilinas e Inquilinos, an organisation that campaigns for tenants' rights, agrees that a shortage of available homes is a problem, but insists that building more is not the answer.",
      "\"There is a lack of housing because homes are being hijacked - on the one hand tourist flats, and on the other hand all the empty flats belonging to vulture funds and the banks,\" he says. \"So there's no need to build more, it's not necessary. But the housing we have has been hijacked.\"",
      "His organisation wants the government to impose drastic mandatory reductions in rent on owners and is threatening to orchestrate a nationwide strike by tenants that would see participants refuse to pay their rent.",
      "\"The [central and local] governments are not setting any limits,\" says Mr \u00c1lvarez. \"So who is going to? We will have to do it.\"",

      "\"We don't support tariffs, to be clear. In pharma, about 70% of global R&D takes place in the United States. So we're creating the next generation of breakthroughs and cures.",
      "\"But the production is heavily weighted outside the US. And that's not unique to our industry. It happened with electronics and software and other things\".",
      "\"So I think what this administration is saying is we want both. We want the means of production and we want the research and development intellectual property generation.\"",
      "Eli Lilly are in the process of building a new additional $800m facility in Ireland, where they employ more than 3,000 people. Mr Ricks said that development would proceed.",
      "\"There's plenty of demand outside the US so we'd have to look at the flow of goods because we wouldn't want to have to pay tariffs if we didn't need to, but I think for the moment that's fine.\"",
      "But Mr Ricks said that its investment in the UK had been in decline and warned that slow regulation and poor uptake of new medicines threatened the UK's reputation as an important life sciences hub and that patients were missing out on new advances in medicine.",
      "Mr Ricks said he delivered some \"candid\" comments to senior ministers including the prime minister, health secretary and business secretary.",
      "\"The UK's advantage is slipping. If you look at the numbers there is disinvestment in research and development. It's been on a steady decline,\" he said.",

      "Live shopping is a close relative to shopping channels like QVC, where viewers are urged to call in and buy the products demonstrated by presenters.",
      "But live shopping acts as a quicker shortcut from buyer to product, especially in the era of one-click purchases, made popular by online retailers such as Amazon.",

      "In February, Apple committed to invest more than $500bn (\u00a3396bn) in the US over the next four years. At the time, Trump claimed Apple's support for US manufacturing was partially a response to his trade policies, including tariffs.",

      "Jock Scott, from Nuneaton, asks Business reporter Nick Edser if the US tariffs have an effect on the UK's cost of living.",
      "As ever when looking at the implications of the tariffs, there's a lot of uncertainty over this. In some circumstances UK prices could go up, in others they could fall.",
      "The tariffs announced by Trump on Wednesday will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US. This means the initial impact of price rises is likely to be on US consumers, if American firms pass on the extra costs.",
      "However, some economists think the tariffs could strengthen the value of the dollar against other currencies. If the pound weakens against the dollar, then UK firms importing goods from the US will face higher costs. This could then lead to higher prices of these goods in UK shops if companies cannot absorb the increased costs themselves.",
      "Also, if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on the extra costs to customers.",
      "However, some economists have suggested prices could also fall as a result of the tariffs.",
      "Swati Dhingra, an economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US may instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods.",
      "What does this mean for my pension?",
      "Robert Jones, from Cardiff, asks Kevin Peachey, Cost of living correspondent, about the impact of tariffs on our pension investments.",
      "There is little doubt Trump's announcement on tariffs has led to immediate moves in share prices and are also likely to have a longer-term economic impact.",
      "Robert and Stephen have mentioned the drop in the value of their pension investments, and the situation will be unsettling for millions of people with any kind of investments.",
      "Experts say that investors have always had to ride economic shocks. Investments, by definition, require a long-term outlook and strategy. So, they are urging people not to panic or make knee-jerk decisions.",
      "That said, for those about to draw on investments, it may be more worrying, albeit that most pension savings are moved into safer holdings like cash or bonds as people approach retirement age. The state pension is unaffected.",
      "Does the UK have a 'Brexit benefit' over the EU?",
      "Paul Naldrett from Windsor asks Business correspondent Marc Ashdown if the UK's position outside of the European Union is actually an opportunity as the EU is given 20% tariffs.",
      "Some are referring to a \"Brexit benefit\" because the UK is only subject to 10% tariffs rather than the 20% being slapped on the EU.",
      "Not only will that limit the pain felt by British businesses compared to their European neighbours, but it could present trading opportunities.",
      "UK exporters to America could have a competitive edge, with US importers only facing half the tax by dealing with UK businesses instead of EU businesses.",
      "British firms - and consumers - could also benefit from cheaper goods finding their way here instead of America if the extra costs prove insurmountable.",
      "But, there are concerns about the impact that could have on homegrown industries if cheap products, possibly with lower standards, flood the UK market."

      "But how exactly were these tariffs -  essentially taxes on imports - worked out? BBC Verify has been looking at the calculations behind the numbers.",
      "What were the calculations?",
      "When Trump presented a giant cardboard chart detailing the tariffs in the White House Rose Garden it was initially assumed that the charges were based on a combination of existing tariffs and other trade barriers (like regulations).",
      "But later, the White House published what might look like a complicated mathematical formula.",
      "But if you unpick the formula above it boils down to simple maths: take the trade deficit for the US in goods with a particular country, divide that by the total goods imports from that country and then divide that number by two.",

      "Explainer: What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them?",
      "US analysis: Trump's tariffs are his biggest gamble yet",
      "For example, the US buys more goods from China than it sells to them - there is a goods deficit of $295bn. The total amount of goods it buys from China is $440bn.",
      "Dividing 295 by 440 gets you to 67% and you divide that by two and round up. Therefore the tariff imposed on China is 34%.",
      "Similarly, when it applied to the EU, the White House's formula resulted in a 20% tariff.",
      "Are the Trump tariffs 'reciprocal'?",
      "Many commentators have pointed out that these tariffs are not reciprocal.",
      "Reciprocal would mean they were based on what countries already charge the US in the form of existing tariffs, plus non-tariff barriers (things like regulations that drive up costs).",
      "But the White House's official methodology document makes clear that they have not calculated this for all the countries on which they have imposed tariffs.",
      "Instead the tariff rate was calculated on the basis that it would eliminate the US's goods trade deficit with each country.",
      "Trump has broken away from the formula in imposing tariffs on countries that buy more goods from the US than they sell to it.",
      "For example the US does not currently run goods trade deficit with the UK. Yet the UK has been hit with a 10% tariff.",
      "In total, more than 100 countries are covered by the new tariff regime.",
      "'Lots of broader impacts'",
      "Trump believes the US is getting a bad deal in global trade. In his view, other countries flood US markets with cheap goods - which hurts US companies and costs jobs. At the same time, these countries are putting up barriers that make US products less competitive abroad.",
      "So by using tariffs to eliminate trade deficits, Trump hopes to revive US manufacturing and protect jobs.",
      "But will this new tariff regime achieve the desired outcome?",
      "BBC Verify has spoken to a number of economists. The overwhelming view is that while the tariffs might reduce the goods deficit between the US and individual countries, they will not reduce the overall deficit between the US and rest of the world.",
      "\"Yes, it will reduce bilateral trade deficits between the US and these countries. But there will obviously be lots of broader impacts that are not captured in the calculation\", says Professor Jonathan Portes of King's College, London.",
      "That's because the US' existing overall deficit is not driven solely by trade barriers, but by how the US economy works.",
      "For one, Americans spend and invest more than they earn and that gap means the US buys more from the world than it sells. So as long as that continues, the US may continue to keep running a deficit despite increasing tariffs with it global trading partners.",
      "Some trade deficits can also exist for a number of legitimate reasons - not just down to tariffs. For example, buying food that is easier or cheaper to produce in other countries' climates.",
      "Thomas Sampson of the London School of Economics said: \"The formula is reverse engineered to rationalise charging tariffs on countries with which the US has a trade deficit. There is no economic rationale for doing this and it will cost the global economy dearly.\"",

    "summary": "The UK has been hit with 10% tariffs by the US, but there is uncertainty as to the impact of them.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has announced fresh import taxes on goods being imported to America in the latest escalation of the global trade war.",
      "The UK has been hit with a 10% tariff on nearly all of its goods being brought into the US, which Trump says is a retaliation to UK tariffs on American goods, but uncertainty remains over the potential impact on British consumers.",
      "Here's how you and your money could be affected.",
      "1. Prices could go up, but could also go down",
      "The tariffs Trump has just announced will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US.",
      "Clarissa Hahn, economist at Oxford Economics, says this means that the initial impact of price rises will be on US consumers, as American firms are likely to pass on the extra costs to their customers.",
      "However, she adds people in the UK could subsequently be affected by the measures, which come into effect on 5 April.",
      "One way is via the value of the pound and exchange rates, which dictate the cost to  UK businesses importing goods and raw materials from abroad. If import costs go up, these extra costs could be passed on to consumers through higher prices.",
      "Following Trump's speech on Wednesday, exchange rates between the dollar and pound fluctuated. If the value of the dollar strengthens as some economists have predicted, import costs could rise for UK firms importing goods.",
      "Higher prices in the UK could also \"prompt workers to demand higher wages\", which would further raise costs for businesses, according to Ahmet Ihsan Kaya, principal economist, at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.",
      "Ms Hahn adds if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on extra costs to customers.",
      "However, some economists have suggested prices could also initially fall as a result of Trump's decision to impose tariffs.",
      "Swati Dhingra, economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US, may instead send them to countries such as the UK which don't have such steep tariffs, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods in the UK.",
      "\"Tariffs of the proposed magnitude are likely to prompt firms that export to the US to lower their prices to retain demand for their products,\" she suggests.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "The countries hit hardest by new US tariffs - Trump's plan at a glance",
      "How were Donald Trump's tariffs calculated?",
      "2. It could affect your job",
      "British companies exporting goods to the US are set to be the hardest hit from the latest measures.",
      "The UK exported almost \u00a360bn worth of goods to the US last year, mainly machinery, cars and pharmaceuticals. Other industries, which are big exporters to the US, include fishing and electronics.",
      "If US demand for UK products dwindles due to the extra charges importers face, this could hit profit margins and ultimately lead to UK job cuts unless British firms find new customers outside the US.",
      "According to the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, Jaguar Land Rover and the Mini factory in Cowley, Oxford, appear to be the most exposed to US tariffs on cars.",
      "It says more than 25,000 jobs in the UK car manufacturing industry \"could be at risk\" with a 25% tariff coming into effect on Thursday, with one in eight UK-built cars exported to the US.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry is also heavily reliant on trade with the US, says Ms Hahn, of Oxford Economics.",
      "The US makes up 40% of AstraZeneca's sales and 50% of GSK's. Although both British-headquartered firms have manufacturing facilities in America, raw ingredients for life-saving medicines and vaccines travel between the UK, EU and US. Under tariffs the firms could be hit with multiple tax charges as they cross borders to be developed.",
      "There is also the issue of how tariffs work when they collide with pricing caps that both the NHS and other health organisations set for buying drugs in bulk.",
      "3. Interest rates may stay higher for longer",
      "UK interest rates dictate the costs households have to pay to borrow money for things such as mortgages, credit cards and loans. Higher rates also boost returns for savers.",
      "They are currently at 4.5%, but economists are predicting two more rate cuts by the end of the year.",
      "However, the Bank of England highlighted US tariffs as a reason why it avoided cutting rates further last month, saying economic and global trade uncertainty had \"intensified\".",
      "If prices are pushed up for long enough to affect the rate of inflation - this could mean interest rates stay higher for longer.",
      "Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, said it was Bank's job \"to make sure that inflation stays low and stable\" and that would be \"looking very closely\" at the impact of tariffs."

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs have shaken global trade, but disruption often creates opportunity.",
      "Starting 9 April, Indian goods will face tariffs of up to 27% (Trump's tariff chart lists India's rate as 26%, but the official order says 27% - a discrepancy seen for other nations too). Before the tariff hike, US rates across trading partners averaged 3.3%, among the lowest globally, compared to India's 17%, according to the White House.",
      "However, with the US imposing even higher tariffs on China (54%), Vietnam (46%), Thailand (36%) and Bangladesh (37%), India \"presents an opportunity\" in textiles, electronics and machinery, according to the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).",
      "High tariffs on Chinese and Bangladeshi exports open space for Indian textile manufacturers to expand in the US market. While Taiwan leads in semiconductors, India can tap into packaging, testing and lower-end chip manufacturing - if it strengthens infrastructure and policy support. Even a partial supply chain shift from Taiwan, driven by 32% tariffs, could work in India's favour.",

      "Live updates: Reaction to Trump's tariffs announcement",
      "At a glance: The countries hit hardest by these plans",
      "Explainer: What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them?",
      "Analysis: Trump's tariffs are his biggest gamble yet",
      "Machinery, automobiles and toys - sectors led by China and Thailand - are ripe for tariff-driven relocation. India can capitalise by attracting investment, scaling production and boosting exports to the US, according to a note by GTRI.",
      "But will India be able to seize the moment?",
      "High tariffs have increased costs for companies dependent on global value chains, hobbling India's ability to compete in international markets. Despite growing exports - primarily driven by services - India runs a significant trade deficit. India's share of global exports is a mere 1.5%. Trump has repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties. With his new tariffs, the fear is that Indian exports will be less competitive.",
      "\"Overall, the US's protectionist tariff regime could act as a catalyst for India to gain from global supply chain realignments,\" says Ajay Srivastava of GTRI.",
      "\"However, to fully leverage these opportunities, India must enhance its ease of doing business, invest in logistics and infrastructure and maintain policy stability. If these conditions are met, India is well-positioned to become a key global manufacturing and export hub in the coming years.\"",
      "That's easier said than done. Biswajit Dhar, a trade expert from the Delhi-based Council for Social Development think tank, points out that countries like Malaysia and Indonesia are possibly better positioned than India.",
      "\"We may regain some lost ground in garments now that Bangladesh faces higher tariffs, but the reality is we've treated garments as a sunset sector and failed to invest. Without building capacity, how can we truly benefit from these tariff shifts?\" says Mr Dhar.",
      "Since February, India has ramped up efforts to win Trump's favour - pledging $25bn in US energy imports, courting Washington as a top defence supplier and exploring F-35 fighter deals. To ease trade tensions, it scrapped the 6% digital ad tax, cut bourbon whiskey tariffs to 100% from 150% and slashed duties on luxury cars and solar cells. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's Starlink nears final approval. The two countries have launched extensive trade talks to narrow the US's $45bn trade deficit with India.",
      "Yet, India did not escape the tariff war.",
      "\"India should be concerned - there was hope that ongoing trade negotiations would shield it from reciprocal tariffs. Facing these tariffs now is a serious setback,\" says Abhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade.",
      "One upside: pharmaceuticals are exempt from reciprocal tariffs, a relief for India's generic drug makers. India supplies nearly half of all generic medicines in the US, where these lower-cost alternatives account for 90% of prescriptions.",
      "However, exports in key sectors like electronics, engineering goods - automobile parts, industrial machines - and marine products could take a hit. It would be especially troubling for electronics, given the heavy investments through India's flagship \"production-linked incentives\" (PLI) schemes to boost local manufacturing.",
      "\"I'm apprehensive about our exporters' capacity - many are small manufacturers who will struggle to absorb a 27% tariff hike, making them uncompetitive. High logistical costs, rising business expenses and deteriorating trade infrastructure only add to the challenge. We're starting at a major disadvantage,\" says Mr Dhar.",
      "Many see these tariffs as Trump's bargaining chip in trade negotiations with India. The latest US Trade Representative report underscores Washington's frustration with India's trade policies.",
      "Released on Monday, the report flags India's strict import rules on dairy, pork and fish, requiring non-GMO certification without scientific backing. It also criticises India's sluggish approval process for genetically modified products and price caps on stents and implants.",
      "Intellectual property concerns have landed India on the 'Priority Watch List', for which the report cites weak patent protections and a lack of trade secret laws. The report also frets about data localisation mandates and restrictive satellite policies, straining trade ties further. Washington fears India's regulatory approach is increasingly mirroring China's. If these barriers were removed, US exports could rise by at least $5.3bn annually, according to the White House.",
      "\"The timing couldn't be worse - being in the middle of trade negotiations only deepens our disadvantage. This isn't just about market access; it's the whole package,\" says Mr Dhar. Also, gaining an edge over Vietnam or China won't happen overnight - building opportunities and competitive strength takes time."

      "On Wednesday, Trump declared a national economic emergency and announced tariffs on goods from every country of at least 10%. For countries he has deemed the \"worst offenders\", the rates can go as high as 50%. The 10% tariffs will take effect on 5 April, and the higher ones on 9 April.",
      "Canada and Mexico are currently exempted from these charges - but they, along with China, were already facing tariffs on some products. And the Trump administration has now expanded existing steel and aluminium tariffs to include beer and empty cans, which could hit both countries hard.",
      "On top of that, on Thursday, 25% tariffs on automobiles coming into the US will come into effect. Tariffs on certain car parts are set to start in May or later.",
      "Economists have warned these levies - and those introduced in response by other countries - could push prices up for American consumers.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.",
      "So which things could become more expensive?",
      "Cars",
      "The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade.",
      "Most analysts estimate that the auto tariffs will add thousands of dollars to the prices of new cars in the US, which reached a record average of $49,738 in December, according to Cox Automotive. As competition for used cars increases, so could the prices paid for them.",
      "Even for cars made in the US, prices will probably rise.",
      "Many US car companies also have operations in Mexico and Canada, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between them.",
      "Component parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.",
      "The new tariffs on car parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt for now while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties.",
      "Anderson Economic Group has estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by roughly $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle.",
      "Experts say these costs are likely to be passed on to customers, though Trump himself has said he \"couldn't care less\" if that happens as he believes it will encourage Americans to buy American-made cars instead.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Beer, whisky and tequila",
      "Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.",
      "Modelo, and many foreign-made beers, will also be affected by the expanded aluminium tariff which will include canned beers starting on 4 April. Most of the beverage in the US - 64.1% - is poured out of cans, according to the Beer Institute.",
      "Meanwhile, representatives from the American, Canadian, and Mexican spirit industries argued in a joint statement that drinks like bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila, and Canadian whisky \"can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So, given they have to be made in those locations, supplies might be affected, leading to price rises.",
      "Trump has also threatened a 200% tariff on alcohol from the EU, which could make Spanish wine, French champagne, or German beer more expensive for Americans, though it is not clear if this will be carried out.",
      "Houses",
      "The US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs.",
      "Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".",
      "However, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",
      "\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.",
      "Imports from the rest of the world could also be affected.",
      "On 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production.",
      "Findings are due towards the end of 2025.",
      "Maple syrup",
      "Canada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of global production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",
      "\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" said Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.",
      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",
      "Fuel prices",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil.",
      "According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.",
      "While the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%.",
      "The US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.",
      "\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.",
      "That means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices.",
      "Avocados",
      "Avocados thrive in the Mexican climate.",
      "Nearly 90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.",
      "The US Agriculture Department has warned that tariffs on Mexican fruit and vegetables could increase the cost of avocados.",
      "Related dishes like guacamole could also become more expensive.",

    "summary": "MPs hear the airport was warned about power supply resilience days before the disruptive closure.",
    "story": [
      "Heathrow Airport was warned about the \"resilience\" of its power supply in the days before a fire which shut down the airport for more than a day last month.",
      "Nigel Wicking, chief executive of Heathrow Airline Operators' Committee, a group representing airlines, told MPs on Wednesday that he spoke to Heathrow twice in the week before the closure on 21 March.",
      "He questioned why the airport was closed as long as it was and why it was not more prepared considering its importance.",
      "However, Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye called the fire an \"unlikely event\" and defended the length of the closure, saying he had to make \"very serious safety decisions\".",
      "Mr Woldbye apologised to the more than 300,000 passengers whose journeys were disrupted.",
      "He offered his \"deepest regrets\" adding that the \"situation was unprecedented\". The airport was shutdown after a fire at an electrical substation.",
      "The chaos at Heathrow has raised concerns about the reliability of the major transport hub - and brought into question the UK's energy resilience more broadly.",
      "Power concerns",
      "Speaking to MPs on the transport committee, Mr Wicking said he raised cases of \"theft of wire and cable around some of the power supply\" which he said temporarily took out runway lights, which are critical to passenger safety.",
      "\"I wanted to understand better the overall resilience of the airport.\"",
      "He said he had spoken to the Team Heathrow director on 15 March about his concerns - six days before the fire - and the chief operating officer and chief customer officer on 19 March - two days before the fire.",
      "Mr Woldbye said the airport had to rely on contracts it has with Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks for making the network resilient, and to improve that \"comes at a very high cost\", which would raise costs for airlines, and passengers.",
      "However, Mr Wicking said Heathrow is \"already the most expensive airport in the world\".",
      "\"From an airline perspective, we expect resilience, we expect there to be the capability there and the understanding of when a power supply or an asset is not available, what will you do next, and how quickly will you bring it back?\"",
      "On the day of the shutdown, airlines had to divert 120 aircraft, which is \"not a light decision to be made in any context\", Mr Wicking added.",
      "As a consequence, when Mr Wicking joined a call with NATs, the national air traffic service, at 05:30, \"they'd run out of space within the UK for aircraft to divert\".",
      "\"Aircraft were then going to Europe, and then some were even halfway across Europe and going back to base in India,\" he said. \"So, quite a level of disruption for those passengers, let alone all of the cancellations\".",
      "There were 1,300 cancelled flights, he said.",
      "The airport reopened on the Saturday following the fire.",
      "When asked why it had not reopened sooner, Mr Woldbye said that could have meant passengers got hurt.",
      "He said: \"If we had got this wrong, we might be sitting here today having a very different discussion about why people got injured, and I think it would have been a much more serious discussion.",
      "\"So there is a margin within which our people have to take very serious safety decisions, and that is what they are trained for, that is what they do, and that requires that every single system is up and running, tested and safe.\"",
      "However, Mr Wicking said Terminal 5 could have reopened sooner.",
      "He said: \"In terms of T5, my understanding both from British Airways but also on the day, was that pretty much everything was fine to operate by mid-morning, by 10 o'clock.\"",
      "'Losing power'",
      "After the substation fire began on the Thursday night, Mr Woldbye said Heathrow realised \"during the early hours\" of Friday 21 March that \"we were losing power to the airport\".",
      "\"In our operations centre you would seen all the red lights go, that the systems were powering down,\" he said. \"We had no information as to why.\"",
      "\"We then had a slightly later stage call from the fire department that the substation was on fire,\" he said.",
      "Heathrow is supplied by three substations, but knocking out one caused the airport to shut down.",
      "Mr Woldbye said a third of the airport was powering down and that Terminal 2 was particularly affected, along with certain central systems. He added that it became \"first and foremost a safety situation\".",
      "\"We need to make sure, when a crisis happens, that people are safe,\" he said.",
      "The safest way to proceed was to shut down airport systems, then bring them back on line, he said.",
      "The first priority was to check that no-one been caught in lifts or was hurt.",
      "Safety critical systems such as runway lighting and the control tower \"switched in as they should\", however, he said.",
      "The government has backed plans for Heathrow to build a third runway as part of efforts to boost UK economic growth.",
      "The airport would need double the amount of power for its expansion plans, Mr Woldbye said.",
      "However, Mr Wicking said airlines, which support expansion, nevertheless had concerns that it would cost \u00a340bn to \u00a360bn, and that the costs would ultimately be passed onto passengers in the form of higher fees.",
      "The danger was the expansion could turn into a \"white elephant\", he said."

      "Any retaliation by the EU could lead to the a unique situation where US goods coming into Northern Ireland - a part of the UK - will face EU tariffs.",

      "Tariffs are effectively taxes applied to goods imported from other countries.",
      "Governments impose tariffs in the hope of protecting local manufacturers from international competition.",
      "What did Trump say about UK and EU tariffs?",

      "He added that it will be remembered as the day American industry was \"reborn\" and the day America was \"made wealthy again\".",

      "What you're probably likely to see is the volume of goods that might be sold into the US will decline just because they get more expensive.",
      "There is also a Windsor Framework element to this \u2013 not on the export side because Northern Ireland goods going into the US are just UK goods.",
      "But goods coming into Northern Ireland have to meet EU rules, so you could have a situation where the UK doesn't retaliate, doesn't impose any tariffs on US goods, but the EU would retaliate.",
      "In that circumstance, US goods entering Northern Ireland would have to pay the EU tariffs but US goods entering the rest of the UK would not have to pay the tariffs.",

      "\"Everything has to be perfect,\" says the production specialist. \"So many different things can affect other things that can affect the final product in such a massive, massive way.\"",
      "Mr Barrientos works for Varjo, one of a growing number of companies in Finland developing innovations that can assist military forces and governments in preparing for or reacting to conflict.",
      "The Nordic nation, with a population of just five million, has 368 defence tech companies, according to research for Tesi, a state-funded venture capital company, released last September.",
      "Around 40% of these are start-ups and scale-ups, with many growing at rates of 30% to 40% if their tools are dual-use technologies that can also be used in other industries.",
      "Helsinki is now among the top five cities in Europe for defence, security and resilience investments, according to a separate report released in February by tech data platform Dealroom, in collaboration with the Nato Innovation Fund, an independent venture capital fund launched in 2023 with funding from 24 Nato allies.",
      "Varjo says its headsets are being used to provide 80 simulation programmes to Nato forces in the US and Europe.",
      "In simple terms, its products are more advanced versions of the virtual reality headsets used in gaming.",
      "But they combine synthetic artificial content with views of real-world environments.",
      "This \"mixed reality\" experience \"squeezes the training continuum\" for fighter pilots, says the firm's CEO Timo Toikkanen, because they no longer have to travel long distances to complete war simulations in giant aircraft hangers, which are expensive to power and run. \"You can do 99% of the same [training] inside of the headset.\"",
      "The start-up had already attracted heavy investment prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and started working with medical research companies and car manufacturers.",
      "But Mr Toikkanen says the start of the conflict and Finland's admission to Nato a year later \"just kind of put everything on steroids\" in terms of interest in its defence offering.",
      "Since March 2022 the company has raised more than \u20ac50m (\u00a342m; $54m) in additional funding.",
      "Mr Toikkanen says that before the war technologies that could be used by military forces used to be \"kind of a red flag\" for investors concerned about social and environmental responsibilities, and Varjo's executives would \"tiptoe around\" that side of the business when seeking funding.",
      "Now the opposite is now true.",
      "\"Investors are looking for companies that are active in the field of defence technology and it's not frowned upon anymore,\" he explains.",
      "Following President Trump's return to office in January, Mr Toikkanen says there's been a renewed interest in its products from European militaries in the wake of rising geopolitical tensions.",

      "Finland shares around 1,340 km (830 miles) of its border with Russia, and the Finnish government spent a greater proportion of its budget on defence than many other European countries even before the war in Ukraine.",
      "\"There's a phrase I like to leverage, which is 'the tyranny of geography' - the closer you are to a threat, the more likely you are to perceive it as more apparent and indeed more existential,\" says Nicholas Nelson, a UK-based defence tech investor and visiting fellow at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"They also have a memory of the Winter War, which transpired during World War Two, where they were invaded by the Soviet Union.\"",
      "The duty of Finns to defend their country is enshrined in the Finnish constitution, and there is mandatory military service for men.",

      "He highlights national surveys which suggest at least 80% of the Finnish population are prepared to fight for their country, and agrees with Mr Nelson that this \"spirit to be ready to defend\" has trickled into start-up and business strategies, and is likely to fuel the sector's continued growth.",
      "Defence tech companies launching in Finland have also been boosted by a strong general tech scene in the country.",
      "Many of the country's tech alumni \u2013 including Mr Toikkanen at Varjo \u2013 honed their skills at Nokia, the former global mobile phone giant which has its roots in Finland.",
      "It ran into financial difficulties following the launch of Apple's iPhone in the mid-2000s, but this encouraged a sizable number of former employees to launch or invest in new companies.",
      "Although not as mature as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Helsinki has spawned a handful of unicorn businesses, worth a billion dollars or more, including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura and game developer Supercell.",
      "There is also strong state support for the defence tech scene. Last year Business Finland, a government agency that promotes investment and innovation, launched a new defence and digital resilience programme which is directing \u20ac120m towards supporting research and development initiatives from small businesses and startups.",
      "\"Our current government\u2026 they are really enforcing this kind of public-private collaboration,\" says the programme's director Kirsi Kokko. \"I think they understand the urgency.\"",
      "Despite the rapid growth of defence tech in Finland, the sector is facing a range of local and European-wide challenges.",
      "Mr Hietala, the founder of airship technology platform Kelluu, describes something of a \"culture clash\" between agile start-ups and large defence companies and governments that have typically required years of experimentation and prototyping before acquiring new technologies.",
      "\"That's really on the opposite side of the spectrum for start-ups, in which the DNA is that we will fail fast and rapidly, and you don't have every start-up succeed.\"",
      "At Business Finland, Ms Kokko says the Nordic nation is also impacted by strong global competition for the software talent needed to grow defence tech and dual use businesses.",
      "But while Finland's compact size and long dark winters might put off some potential recruitments, she hopes the nation's reputation for innovation, flat working hierarchies and low crime levels can attract employees with the right skill sets - alongside its success in the sector so far.",

      "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.",
      "Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.",
      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",
      "\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"",
      "But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.",
      "\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.",
      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",
      "\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.",

      "\"And it's a tail-first layout called a canard so it's got the tail at the front.  The all up weight is 750kg but 240kg of that are batteries so all the structure is carbon fibre to keep it as light as possible,\" Dr Brooks says.",
      "Safety is an important part of the design too.",
      "'Environmental benefits'",
      "The large wings help it to glide in the event of power failure and there are two motors at the end of each wing so that if one fails the other can compensate.",
      "It is also equipped with an emergency ballistic parachute to bring the aircraft and passengers down safely.",
      "As well as being safer and cleaner than conventional aircraft, Michael Thompson, Skyfly's chief executive, says electric models are significantly quieter too.",
      "\"When you're taking off, you're no longer annoying everyone around you from a noise perspective, so I do think electric propulsion brings not only environmental benefits but from a noise pollution point of view, it's a huge benefit as well,\" he says.",

      "Other eVTOLs under development include those looking to provide an electric flying-taxi service like Bristol-based Vertical Aerospace (VA) .",

    "summary": "Morrisons and Sainsbury's have announced a raft of cafe closures - but some customers insist they should stay open.",
    "story": [
      "It's Friday lunchtime at a Morrisons in Queensbury, north-west London, and the in-store cafe is busy.",
      "At one table, a teenager tucks into a ham sandwich while on the phone with a friend. She stays for well over half an hour.",
      "At another, an elderly couple chat over a hot meal, while a queue of customers steadily forms at the till.",
      "But this is one of 52 cafes set to close - including others in London, Leeds, Portsmouth and Glasgow - announced this week in a cost-cutting drive that the supermarket chain says is designed to \"renew and reinvigorate Morrisons\" and focus \"investment into the areas that customers really value\".",
      "That came two months after Sainsbury's said it was closing all 61 of its supermarket cafes.",
      "While some see the decline of supermarket cafes as inevitable, shoppers around the country have told BBC News that these cafes give them a cheap, convenient and welcoming place to get a warm meal while catching up with friends.",
      "'Share a meal without the stress of cooking'",
      "Regulars at the Morrisons cafe in Queensbury say they're surprised - and saddened - to hear it's closing.",
      "Philomena Hughes, 76, is having a meal with two friends, having just been shopping. The trio have bumped into a couple they know at the cafe, who move over to the table next to them and join in their conversation.",
      "Philomena says she's \"furious\" about the closure. \"Morrisons was really the only place I would come,\" she says. \"We meet people we know in here.\"",
      "Other regulars at the cafe tell the BBC that the quality is good, prices are low, and it's convenient to grab groceries beforehand. They point to offers such as a free kids meal with an adult's one, free parking, and fish and chips with mushy peas for \u00a38.50.",
      "Morrisons says 344 of its cafes will remain open despite the planned closures but, according to its chief executive Rami Baiti\u00e9h, \"a minority have specific local challenges and in those locations, regrettably, closure and re-allocation of the space is the only sensible option\".",
      "Elsewhere in the country, Ben Hopkins, 32, feels his local Morrisons cafe in Meltham, West Yorkshire, is bustling every time he goes because \"the food is typical of that you'd get in a traditional greasy spoon\".",
      "Such outlets can come in handy for parents, too. Lisa Clavering, from St Albans, says she relied on Asda and Morrisons cafes for a \"quick and cheap hot lunch\" when her two sons were younger.",
      "\"As they grew, it was somewhere we could go together and share a meal without the stress of cooking it and cleaning up, where I didn't feel judged by other customers if they made a noise,\" the 42-year-old says.",
      "Lisa says part of the appeal of supermarket cafes is that they feel accessible - a \"warm and welcoming place with no fuss and no surprises\".",
      "\"I do worry that once they go, there's not really a like-for-like to replace them, and other alternatives are typically much more expensive,\" Lisa says.",
      "'Should come as no surprise'",
      "But other people question the need for supermarket cafes, pointing to changes in people's shopping habits and the growing competition from high-street coffee chains.",
      "The closure of Morrisons cafes \"should come as no surprise,\" retail analyst Natalie Berg tells the BBC.",
      "\"The grocers are desperately trying to navigate significant cost headwinds, while simultaneously competing with discounters like Aldi and Lidl.",
      "\"This is a low-margin industry, so supermarkets need to be utterly ruthless when it comes to cost-cutting.\"",
      "When shoppers come into larger supermarkets, they \"want low prices and they want a frictionless experience. In-store cafes work in certain locations, but they're simply not essential for most stores,\" Ms Berg says.",
      "It largely echoes the reasoning Sainsbury's has given for its closures - that \"the majority of [its] most loyal shoppers do not use the cafes regularly\".",
      "Ben Tinca, 19, a student living near the Morrisons store in Queensbury, says he usually meets his friends at fast-food chains like Nando's, KFC and McDonald's.",
      "He's only ever been to a Morrisons cafe once. \"You usually only see older people eating there,\" he says.",
      "And back at the Queensbury store, Snehal Khimani doesn't think people care too much about supermarket cafes closing, saying there has been no \"outrage\".",
      "\"If it was popular, you'd hear about it,\" like when Pret A Manger changed its subscription service, he says.",
      "And besides, rival supermarket chains Tesco and Marks & Spencer - which have more than 300 cafes each - haven't said anything about closing their cafes.",
      "M&S tells the BBC that it's continuing to invest in its cafes and plans to have coffee shops in the majority of its bigger stores. Last year, it announced it would try offering more takeaway food and drink to attract younger customers.",
      "At an M&S Cafe in central London that the BBC visited, Matthew Wilsher has just got a cappuccino to go.",
      "For the 62-year-old, the numbers don't lie. His coffee cost \u00a33.40, and would have been less if he'd remembered his reusable cup. For him, \"that's cheaper than a Pret or a Starbucks,\" he says.",

      "If the legal challenge is successful, the government could consider whether it would amend the policy, but it would be under no obligation to do so.",
      "How will the extra money be spent?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",
      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in 2024/25, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"every single penny\" will go to state schools.",
      "Labour has repeatedly pledged to use the money to recruit 6,500 new teachers for state schools in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "In October's Budget, the government allocated different sources of funding to address other issues in schools, like crumbling buildings and a stretched system for pupils with special educational needs.",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",
      "While some famous schools, like Eton and Harrow, charge about \u00a350,000 a year, the average is about \u00a315,000.",
      "There are about 2,500 private schools in the UK, educating about 7% of all pupils, including about 570,000 in England.",
      "Private schools have more freedom than government-funded state schools, and do not have to follow the national curriculum.",

      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Will private school fees go up for everyone?",
      "Applying VAT does not necessarily mean fees will go up by 20%. Some private schools may decide to put up their fees more than others.",
      "On average, the government expects fees to increase by around 10%.",
      "The average cost of private school fees has risen by 55% since 2003, even without VAT, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tanks says.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period has not fallen.",
      "Children with Send that have a local authority EHCP, which names the specific school that can meet their needs, are exempt from the VAT policy.",
      "The government says a grant to help cover boarding school fees for children of military families has also been increased to take account of rising charges.",
      "What could the tax change mean for state schools?",

      "It estimates that around 37,000 students will move to the state sector over the long term, but believes class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which says it would be possible for the state sector to \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The ISC says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in Year 7 pupils in September 2024.",
      "It believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused."

    "story": [
      "Pronatalists, a controversial fringe group almost exclusively from the political right, claim that some of the most powerful people in the US government are sympathetic to their cause. But how much influence do they really have?",
      "Listen to Stephanie read this article",
      "Simone Collins is sitting in her 18th century cottage in Pennsylvania, dressed in a black pilgrim pinafore with a wide collar, bouncing one of her four children on her lap. It is 8.30am and she looks a little tired \u2013 she runs several businesses, a foundation and is currently pregnant with her fifth child, though she and her husband Malcolm plan to have more.",
      "\"At least seven,\" she declares, \"and as many as I can physically carry - 12 would be even more brilliant.\"",
      "The US couple, aged 37 and 38, ardently believe that the world needs to have more babies or risk civilisational collapse. They have become the poster children for pronatalism, a movement that believes falling birth rates are a big problem for society. And that big families are the answer.",
      "For the last five years, they have spread the word about their goal by opening up their home for interviews and photoshoots. They claim to have used special technology, during the IVF process, to screen their embryos for traits such as intelligence.",
      "\"The studies let us know what our genetic predilection for IQ is,\" they told an undercover reporter in 2023. \"We will never choose a child who is less privileged in IQ than either of us.\"",
      "Speaking today, however, Malcolm admits, \"The easiest way to [spread the word about pronatalism] was to turn ourselves into a meme... If we take a reasonable approach to things and say things are nuanced, nobody engages. And then we go and say something outrageous and offensive and everyone's into it.\"",
      "But since Donald Trump was sworn in as US President for the second time earlier this year, they have taken their evangelising to a new level. The Collinses now see certain people in the White House as potential allies - and they fully intend to capitalise on that.",
      "Elon Musk, who is said to have fathered 14 children, has called fertility decline \"the biggest danger civilisation faces, by far\". He has donated $10m (\u00a37.75m) to the Population Wellbeing Initiative in Texas, which conducts research into fertility, parenting, and the future of population growth.",
      "The US Vice President JD Vance has also spoken openly about his views on procreation. At an anti-abortion rally in January he declared: \"I want more babies in the United States of America.\"",
      "There are early indications that the Trump administration is prioritising family too. On 18 February, Trump signed an executive order to improve access for IVF that recognised \"the importance of family formation and that our nation's public policy must make it easier for loving and longing mothers and fathers to have children\".",
      "Pronatalists are buoyed by this and many hope it is a sign of things to come.",
      "The facts of fertility decline are clear. The US is at a record low of 1.62 children per woman, and by the end of the century the UN projects a majority of countries will have a shrinking population. That will have a profound effect on society and our economies. Some people believe we can adapt over time to this new reality, but pronatalists are less sanguine.",
      "But there is a political element to the movement too. Pronatalists are almost exclusively from the political right. Malcolm and Simone Collins, for example, describe themselves as former liberals who became disillusioned with progressive, \"woke\" politics.",
      "They see themselves as pragmatic and profoundly anti-bureaucratic.",
      "\"We are a coalition of people who are incredibly different in our philosophies, our theological beliefs, our family structures,\" says Malcolm. \"But the one thing we agree on is that our core enemy is the urban monoculture; the leftist unifying culture.\"",
      "So, could this fringe group really gain the ear of some of the most powerful people in the US government? And if so, just how much soft power could they have to influence policy not only around population decline but about wider issues too?",
      "Vance, Musk and the 'Fertilisation President'",
      "Last weekend, a group of roughly 200 pronatalists congregated in Texas for the second Natal Conference, an annual weekend-long event that cost around $1,000 (\u00a3775) to attend.",
      "The conference brings together two strands in pronatalism that come from very different branches of the American right: both conservative Christians and members of the so-called 'tech right,' an ascendant wing that came out of the libertarian, start-up culture of Silicon Valley.",
      "Some are connected to the current US government. Michael Anton was appointed by Trump as the Director of Policy Planning at the State Department. He spoke at last year's conference.",
      "Other speakers at this year's conference included Carl Benjamin, who has links to far-right activist Tommy Robinson, and Charles Cornish-Dale, an influencer who goes by the name Raw Egg Nationalist.",
      "\"It's like an unholy alliance,\" says Catherine Pakaluk, an economist, mother of eight and stepmother of six. She too spoke at the conference but is reluctant to call herself a pronatalist. \"It's a complicated movement and includes people with very different positions,\" she says.",
      "One thing they have in common, however, is that they all want their message to be heard at the highest levels of government.",
      "Some believe they already are being heard. \"[If you ask me] do we have pronatalists in the White House right now who are pushing policy,\" says Malcolm, \"my response to this would be, 'I mean, duh, like Elon and JD Vance'.\"",
      "In President Trump's executive orders to date, there has been little apart from the order on IVF that could be seen as directly pro-family. But pronatalist thinking may be starting to influence policy that is less explicitly about fertility.",
      "In January, the US transportation secretary Sean Duffy circulated a memo instructing his department to \"give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average\" when awarding grants.",
      "Roger Severino, Vice-President of Domestic Policy at right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation, sees the influence of JD Vance in that policy. \"Vance comes at it from a long history of pro-family thinking and policymaking,\" he says.",
      "Vance has often spoken about the need to fix a \"broken culture\" that is tearing the US family apart, by undermining men.",
      "In a recent interview, he said: \"We actually think God made male and female for a purpose and we want you guys to thrive as young men and young women and we're going to help with our public policy to make it possible to do that.\"",
      "This idea has been echoed in pronatalist circles.",
      "\"Vance is a vocal pronatalist,\" says Rachel Cohen, policy correspondent at Vox. \"Trump himself campaigned on implementing a new \"baby boom\" and last week he declared himself the 'fertilisation president'.\"",
      "The pronatalists drafting DIY executive orders",
      "Malcolm says he has already made attempts to influence the White House. He claims to have engaged in \"backroom channelling of influential people, making sure that pronatalism became normal to talk about within the centres of power, and that ended up dripping its way up to administration and core tech culture\".",
      "They are in discussions on pronatalist policy with the Heritage Foundation. Then there is a rather more direct approach they claim to have taken. \"We have submitted draft executive orders to the Trump administration,\" says Simone.",
      "Their proposals include suggestions for how to remove layers of regulation from childcare providers and expanding car seat choice so cars can fit more children.",
      "The couple aren't sure if those are going to translate into anything concrete just yet \u2013 but they believe they have a receptive audience.",
      "Their connection to power is thanks to the so-called tech right, a reactionary movement against liberalism led by some of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley. Those in the tech right include Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel \u2013 who sponsored Vance's Senate race and has invested in fertility technology \u2013 and venture capitalists David Sacks and Marc Andreessen.",
      "Simone Collins was formerly the managing director of an exclusive members' club run by Mr Thiel, and the couple say they ran two other invite-only networking groups for business elites. Their Pronatalist Foundation, founded in 2021, received just under $500,000 (\u00a3387,000) through a fund of the Skype co-founder, Estonian billionaire Jann Tallinn.",
      "\"The tech right bring a lot of energy to the discussion,\" says Roger Severino, Vice-President of Domestic Policy at the Heritage Foundation. \"We've been discussing how we could blend these various strains on the right. We're trying to cohere the movement.\"",
      "Cracks in the pronatalist alliance",
      "There are, however, cracks in the alliance which add to the challenge of trying to make the movement \u201ccoherent\u201d.",
      "Many on the traditional religious right have misgivings about the use of IVF and disagree with embryo screening, while some also oppose gay marriage and parenthood.",
      "\"It's just an odd alliance of people who seem to agree on this one point: that the birth rate is too low. But there are wildly different prescriptions and ideas about what might be done to fix it,\" says Ms Pakaluk.",
      "\"There's a renewed interest in pronatalism and family promotion among American conservatives,\" says Timothy Carney, author of Family Unfriendly, How our Culture Made Raising Kids Much Harder than it Needs to Be. But he adds: \"There will definitely be tensions.\"",
      "One of those most divisive issues in pronatalism are the mention of certain aspects related to genetics among some of its tech right proponents. It's something that has prompted concern, in particular around the ethics of this, on all sides of the political spectrum.",
      "Patrick T Brown, a fellow at the right-leaning American Ethics and Public Policy Centre working on pro-family policy, suggests that the executive order to improve access to IVF could show the influence of the tech-right on policy. But he has his concerns about that influence, particularly around embryo screening. \"Turning children into consumer products is something that I really worry about,\" he says. \"That leads to a troublesome place.\"",
      "Some of those attending the recent conference describe themselves as \"race realists\", and one has published offensive views alleging a link between intelligence and race that, according to many scientists, are plain wrong.",
      "Geneticist Adam Rutherford describes the data used as \"fraudulent and racist, drawn from hopeless sample sizes that wouldn't constitute valid scientific evidence to anyone vaguely interested in truth.",
      "\"These assertions are recapitulations of historical ideas of scientific racism.\"",
      "The associations with extreme views in the movement is one of the reasons some people don't like to call themselves pronatalists. Catherine Pakaluk is one of them. \"I think there probably are some people who are just pure eugenicists or white supremacists,\" she says.",
      "\"I find it disgusting and reprehensible and I have no interest in ever being aligned with people like that.\"",
      "Could controversy translate into soft power?",
      "The question that remains is, where does all of this leave pronatalists - and just how much power do they wield?",
      "According to some onlookers, their impact is already being felt. \"There's definitely strong influence from pronatalists in the Trump White House,\" claims Ms Cohen. \"I think an outstanding question is how this will all overlap with efforts to restrict birth control and contraception, and how this will affect debates around spending like on childcare funding.\"",
      "Mr Carney is more circumspect: \"Vance is very pro-family and very pronatalist, and he wants the government to promote families and to help drive up the birth rate - but JD Vance is not the president. I don't think Donald Trump has firm conviction on this.\"",
      "He also believes there might be resistance to some pro-family policies, pointing out that at least some of the Republicans in control of Congress don't like the idea of family support. \"They think that it's welfare to the undeserving.\"",
      "The attention gleaned by the Collinses, and by the recent conference, is undoubtable. But one expert suggests they are doing little more than stirring up controversy.",
      "\"If you go to Capitol Hill, and talk to members of Congress or governors in states across America, they don't necessarily even recognise the problem,\" argues Mr Brown.",
      "As he puts it, \"the incentives of the internet\" aren't always the incentives of a successful mass movement. \"And what gets attention is provocation and being edgy and crossing the line. That gets clicks, that gets followers.",
      "\"[But] that to me is not how you end up changing the political dynamics.\"",

      "A companion album, Autumn Variations, released later the same year, fared even worse.",
      "Despite debuting at number one, it left the Top 40 after two weeks, and has yet to be certified gold - meaning it has sold fewer than 100,000 copies.",

      "The director tells the BBC that \"the film was developed and made by Millennials, but it's a Gen Z coming of age story\".",

      "\"It's not a pandemic film,\" he says, \"but it was developed during that time when young people from all over the world were having the seminal years of their lives taken away.",

My brothers just turned 18 and 20 years old, they were going through adolescence during Covid, there so many changes in their personal and school life anyway, and then for all of that to happen.",
      "\"We're all still regrouping and refiguring ourselves out.\"",

    "story": [
      "Val Kilmer, who has died at the age of 65, was often underrated as an actor.",
      "He had extraordinary range: excelling in comedies, westerns, crime dramas, musical biopics and action-adventures films alike.",
      "And perhaps his best performance combined his skills as a stage actor with a fine singing voice, to bring to life 1960s-counterculture icon Jim Morrison, in Oliver Stone's film The Doors.",
      "Critic Roger Ebert wrote: \"If there is an award for the most unsung leading man of his generation, Val Kilmer should get it.",
      "\"In movies as different as Real Genius, Top Gun, Top Secret!, he has shown a range of characters so convincing that it's likely most people, even now, don't realise they were looking at the same actor.\"",

      "Val Edward Kilmer was born, on 31 December 1959, into a middle-class family in Los Angeles.",
      "His parents were Christian Scientists, a movement to which Kilmer would adhere for the rest of his life.",
      "He attended Chatsworth High School, in the San Fernando Valley, where future actor Kevin Spacey was among his classmates and where he developed a love of drama.",
      "Kilmer's ambition was to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada), in London, but his application was rejected because, at 17, he was a year below the minimum entry age.",
      "Instead, Kilmer became the then youngest pupil to enrol at the Julliard School, in New York, one of the world's most prestigious drama conservatories.",
      "A gifted student, Kilmer co-wrote and made his stage debut in How It All Began, a play based on the life of a German radical, at the Public Theatre.",
      "But he recalled a tough regime.",
      "\"I had a mean teacher once, who kind of said, 'How dare you think you can act Shakespeare? You don't know how to walk across the room yet,'\u2026 and in a way, that's true,\" Kilmer said.",
      "Minor parts, including in Henry IV Part 1 and As You Like It, preceded a meatier role as Alan Downie in the 1983 production of Slab Boys, with Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon.",
      "Kilmer made his film debut in spy spoof Top Secret!, written by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker. He played star Nick Rivers, sucked into an East German plot to reunify Germany.",
      "The film proved Kilmer had a good voice and he later released an album under the name of his fictional character.",
      "He also published a book of poetry, My Edens After Burns, some of which reflected on a relationship with a young Michelle Pfeiffer.",
      "Two years later, Kilmer played Lt Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, Tom Cruise's deadly fighter pilot rival in Top Gun.",
      "A thrilling patriotic Cold War buddy movie, it cost just $15m (\u00a312m) to make but took more than $350m at the box office.",
      "Kilmer's increased profile led to renewed press interest in his eventful private life.",
      "He dated Daryl Hannah, Angelina Jolie and Cher. In 1988, he married Joanne Whalley, whom he had met when they appeared in the fantasy film Willow,",
      "The couple had two children but divorced after eight years of marriage.",
      "Despite his rising popularity in the cinema, Kilmer did not abandon the stage, playing Hamlet at the 1988 Colorado Shakespeare Festival, and then Giovanni in a New York production of 'Tis Pity She's a Whore.",
      "But in the 1990s, he proved he could carry a major film as a lead actor.",
      "Director Stone had long wanted to make a biopic of The Doors, focusing on the band's singer, who had died of a drugs overdose in Paris in 1971.",
      "A number of actors were considered, including John Travolta and Richard Gere, before Stone chose Kilmer because of his physical resemblance to Morrison and strong singing voice.",
      "In his trademark single-minded approach, Kilmer lost weight and learned 50 Doors songs by heart, as well as spending time in a studio perfecting Morrison's stage style.",
      "And in his 1996 biography of Oliver Stone, James Riordan said the surviving Doors could not tell recordings of Kilmer singing their songs from Morrison's original.",
      "Kilmer also played Elvis Presley in Tony Scott's True Romance, written by Quentin Tarantino, and sickly alcoholic gambler and dentist Doc Holliday in the 1993 film Tombstone - a retelling of the story of Wyatt Earp's gunfight at the OK Corral, which some critics called his finest performance.",
      "In 1995, Kilmer replaced Michael Keaton in the third of a trilogy of Batman films, Batman Forever.",
      "But he later said he had been uncomfortable with the role and declined to play it in the follow-up, Batman and Robin.",
      "Kilmer's reputation for being difficult on set had reportedly exploded into open warfare with the director, Joel Schumacher, normally the most temperate of men, who called his leading man's behaviour \"difficult and childish\".",
      "John Frankenheimer, who directed Kilmer in The Island of Dr Moreau, was even blunter.",
      "\"I don't like Val Kilmer,\" he said. \"I don't like his work ethic and I don't want to be associated with him ever again.\"",
      "The actor responded: \"When certain people criticise me for being demanding, I think that's a cover for something they didn't do well. I think they're trying to protect themselves.",
      "\"I believe I'm challenging, not demanding, and I make no apologies for that,\" he told the Orange County Register newspaper in 2003.",
      "Kilmer remained much in demand and reportedly received $6m for his role as Simon Templar in the 1997 film The Saint - although, critics were not overwhelmed by the film or his performance.",
      "In the early 2000s, there was no shortage of film appearances - but Kilmer's cinema career had hit a plateau.",
      "In 2004, he returned to the theatre, in a musical production of The Ten Commandments, in Los Angeles.",
      "A year later, Kilmer starred in London's West End, in Andrew Rattenbury's adaptation of The Postman Always Rings Twice - as Frank Chambers, the drifter played by Jack Nicholson in the 1981 film.",
      "And in 2006, he reunited with director Scott, for sci-fi film Deja Vu, which received a mixed response.",
      "Kilmer also voiced Kitt - the futuristic car - in a pilot for television series Nightrider.",
      "He spent years working on a one-man show, Citizen Twain, which examined the relationship between Christian Science founder Mary Baker Eddy and her long-term critic writer Mark Twain.",
      "A 90-minute film was eventually released, directed by Kilmer.",
      "In 2014, Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer.",
      "Chemotherapy and radiation left him with a tube in his trachea and difficulty breathing.",
      "As a Christian Scientist, Kilmer had mixed views about seeking medical interventions and at times ascribed physical improvements to the power of prayer rather than medicine. On occasion, he denied he had cancer at all.",
      "In 2021, Kilmer made Val, a documentary about his life.",
      "It delved into his darkest places and experiences, including his brother Wesley's accidental drowning as a teenager and the breakdown of his marriage.",
      "A year later, there was time for a final starring role.",
      "Planned for a decade, Top Gun: Maverick reunited Kilmer and Cruise, updating their former rivalry in the post-Cold War era.",
      "Kilmer's cancer could not be hidden. Instead, it was written into his character's story.",
      "\"It's time to let go,\" Iceman tells Maverick in one poignant scene.",
      "Kilmer will be remembered as a complicated man and a fine but difficult actor.",
      "He never embraced the kind of Hollywood party lifestyle his looks and fame might have brought him.",
      "Instead, he tended to slip away to spend time with his children, on a ranch he owned in New Mexico.",
      "\"I don't really have too much of a notion about success or popularity, \" Kilmer once said.",
      "\"I never cultivated fame, I never cultivated a persona, except possibly the desire to be regarded as an actor.\"",

      "Those working on theatre productions were among the workers facing the most uncertainty with many on freelance contracts and not knowing when the curtains would go up again.",
      "\"It was just absolutely horrendous because we didn't know how long it was going to last,\" theatre producer Eleanor Lloyd said.",

      "Ms Lloyd, who produces Witness for the Prosecution on the West End, said theatres faced many false starts over the course of the pandemic which added to the uncertainty for her and her 45 employees.",
      "Some in the sector went on to find other forms of income, including actor Serene Sabah who decided to open an ice cream parlour.",
      "\"I remember having a conversation on a Zoom [call] with other theatre makers where we were being told that it might be that we never go to their theatre again,\" she said.",
      "\"Will it ever come back?\"",

    "story": [
      "Inside a soundstage once used by silent film stars Charlie Chaplin and Mabel Normand, Hollywood executives, actors and filmmakers sipped cocktails as they marvelled at what some say is the biggest breakthrough since the talkies: AI-generated video.",
      "But whether AI will be the future, or the end, of cinema is still up for debate.",
      "It was only two years ago that actors and writers shut down Hollywood with strikes demanding protections from AI. Now the technology is controversially creeping into TV, movies and video games. Two films honoured at the Oscars even used the technology.",
      "As a DJ played '90s hip hop, computer developers rubbed shoulders with actors and executives, in a sign of the changing power players in the industry.",
      "AI in Hollywood is \"inevitable\", says Bryn Mooser, the party's host and the co-founder of Moonvalley, which created the AI generator tool Marey by paying for footage from filmmakers with their consent. Mooser says that while AI may still be a dirty word, their product is \"clean\" because it pays for its content.",
      "\"Artists should be at the table,\" he says, adding that it's better to build the tool for filmmakers rather than get \"rolled over by big tech companies\".",
      "Artificial Intelligence has long been depicted as a villain in Hollywood. In The Terminator, AI used by the US military decides it must destroy everyone on earth.",
      "But it's AI's creators, and not the technology itself, that has received the brunt of real-life criticism. Companies use publicly available data to build their AI models - which includes copyrighted material shared online - and creators say they're being ripped off.",
      "OpenAI, Google and other tech companies are facing multiple lawsuits from writers, actors and news organisations, alleging their work was stolen to train AI without their consent. Studios like Paramount, Disney and Universal who own the copyright on movies and TV shows have been urged by writers to do the same, though none have taken legal action.",
      "\"We've all fought very hard for copyright laws, and nobody wants to see their work stolen to have somebody else profit from it,\" Mooser says.",
      "Hollywood has begun toying with the new technology. The Oscar-nominated films Emilia Perez and The Brutalist used AI to alter voices. Adrian Brody won the Academy Award for best actor, even with the help of AI to fine tune his accent when he spoke Hungarian in his starring role in The Brutalist. AI has even been used to de-age actors like Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford.",
      "The technology is seemingly everywhere. OpenAI hosted an AI film festival in Los Angeles earlier this month. Marvel directors Joe and Anthony Russo told the Wall Street Journal they plan to invest $400 million to craft AI tools for filmmakers.",
      "But the impacts on how it will alter the future of the entertainment industry remain unclear. Generative AI, for instance, allows computers to learn and solve problems in ways that can seem human \u2013 albeit much faster. And many worry about the technology replacing their jobs as AI is used to generate scripts, animation, locations, voices and human actors.",
      "If you ask OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, which Hollywood jobs are most easily replaced by AI, background actors are top of the list as \"most vulnerable\" with \"A-List actors & directors\" considered safest because \"star power and brand recognition keep top talent irreplaceable\".",
      "At the Moonvalley party, everyone was talking about new AI technology though few wanted to speak with a reporter on record about it. But dozens of powerful people made the trek east to the hip Silver Lake neighbourhood from west Los Angeles, even though it was raining. In LA, that's remarkable.",
      "\"We're here to learn,\" said one executive who spent an hour in traffic getting to the party. \"We're not signing anything or buying anything, but we're interested.\"",
      "Mooser and his co-founder Naeem Talukdar speak passionately about how AI will transform Hollywood and allow filmmakers to create blockbuster style epics on much lower budgets. It could lead to many bad films - but it could also help discover the next Quentin Tarantino or Martin Scorsese, even if they don't have the backing of a big studio.",

      "Hollywood's foray into using AI comes as the Trump administration prepares a new AI plan for the United States.",
      "Tech companies say they can't compete with China under existing US copyright laws and that they need unfettered access to art - from Mickey Mouse to Moana to The Matrix - to train their AI models as a matter of national security.",
      "Google and OpenAI want the US government to designate copyrighted art, movies and TV shows as \"fair use\" for them to train AI, arguing that without the exceptions, they will lose the race for dominance to China.",

      "The letter's signatories included A-List stars like Ben Stiller, Sir Paul McCartney, Cate Blanchett and Lilly Wachowski, who co-created The Matrix, which depicts a dystopian simulated reality where humans are enslaved by intelligent machines.",
      "Many in Hollywood remain terrified of what AI means for their futures.",
      "Outside a Disney Character Voices office earlier this month, dozens of actors picketed against video game companies for refusing to come to an agreement on using AI in video games.",

US reviewers have been somewhat more positive \u2013 but despite it topping the North America box office chart, it hasn't made as much money as expected.",

      "But Anna Smith, film critic and host of the Girls On Film podcast, told BBC News that some of the headlines may have be misleading.",
      "\"Zegler pointed out that times and attitudes have changed, and that the new Snow White has been adapted for the current age. This is the case with many remakes and reboots, many of which do not make the headlines with comments about 'woke' culture.\"",
      "Zegler's political views have also sparked a backlash.",
      "Last summer, she thanked fans for their response to the film's trailer in a post on X, adding, \"and always remember, free Palestine\".",
      "According to the Variety article, Marc Platt - mentioned above - flew to New York to speak directly with Zegler after the post.",
      "Neither Zegler nor Platt have responded to a request for a comment on that.",
      "Zegler also stoked controversy with her views after the 2024 US presidential election. Writing on Instagram, she said she hoped \"Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace\".",
      "She later apologised for what she had said.",
      "Some commend her for speaking her mind. Ehenulo says that she is \"not the first and certainly not the last actor to be speaking about politics\".",
      "And Luxford told me she was \"hard-pressed\" to imagine the film's core audience, children under 10, being swayed by her politics.",
      "But film critic Conor Riley said that her comments about Trump didn't \"help the stability of the movie's release\".",
      "He notes that Gal Gadot, who plays Snow White's stepmother, the Evil Queen, has also faced a backlash from some people. Gadot, who is Israeli, has been vocal in her support of the country.",
      "The timing of the film also didn't help, he added.",
      "\"Ultimately, [Zegler] became a lightning rod for controversy, not just due to her own actions, but because Snow White landed at the intersection of Hollywood's creative stagnation, racial politics, international conflict, and America's deep ideological divide,\" he said.",
      "'Targets for backlash'",
      "Some, like Luxford, argue that some of the pile-on comes from \"a place of prejudice\".",
      "\"She's a young Latina woman with political opinions that don't align with certain groups, who are quick to voice their anger,\" she said.",
      "Zegler is far from the first young female actress to find herself facing a toxic backlash. Recently, Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown criticised press articles about her appearance, saying \"this isn't journalism, this is bullying\".",
      "Smith notes that women in positions of prominence are more likely to be targeted in this way.",
      "\"When women in the public eye are criticised, there is often bias at work. Regardless of the topic, the way it's dealt with, talked about and reported will often differ compared to the way men are treated,\" she said.",
      "Ehenulo, for her part, calls on the industry to do more to protect their stars.",
      "\"What irks me is how easy [people of colour] actors become targets for backlash on social media and yet the culture of silence from studios, news outlets and social media platforms says it all,\" she said.",
      "\"That lack of public protection... means the toxicity continues to fester and rise. It's the Wild West out there and I can't see it getting better when this has been normalised to such an extent.\"",
      "We put those claims to Disney, but they declined to comment.",
      "The big roles keep coming for Zegler. She is now signed up to star in Evita in the West End this summer, and on Friday, she made a splash in a different way - reading a CBeebies Bedtime Story.",
      "At the end of the story, Zegler tells young viewers: \"To be a powerful princess you just need to be wonderful, brilliant you!\" For some, this is a message that encapsulates Zegler herself.",
      "\"I don't know if she's going to be doing another Disney film anytime soon,\" says Luxford, \"but she's 23, she's a Golden Globe winner, and she's a very talented actor.\"",

    "story": [
      "Susan was no more than puzzled when she saw the first results from her home DNA testing kit.",
      "Now a woman in her mid 70s, she had never known much about her grandfather, and paid for the private test to see if it threw up anything unusual.",
      "\"I did notice there was a lot of Irish heritage, which as far as I knew was wrong,\" she says.",
      "\"But I just pushed it aside and didn't think any more of it. I stopped paying for my subscription and that was that.\"",
      "Except it very much wasn't.",
      "It took another six years for Susan - not her real name - to realise everything she knew about her family history was wrong.",
      "She later found out that back in the 1950s, she had been swapped at birth for another baby girl in a busy NHS maternity ward.",
      "Her case is now the second of its type uncovered by the BBC. Lawyers say they expect more to come forward driven by the boom in cheap genetic testing and ancestry websites.",
      "Out of the blue",
      "A sharp, funny woman with shoulder-length white hair, Susan tells me her story from her sunny front room somewhere in southern England.",
      "Her husband is sitting next to her, jogging her memory and chipping in from time to time.",
      "After taking that DNA test almost a decade ago, the genealogy company entered her data into its vast family tree, allowing other users to make contact with their genetic relatives \u2013 close or distant.",
      "Six years later she received a message out of the blue.",
      "The stranger said that his data matched hers in a way that could only mean one thing: he must be her genetic sibling.",
      "\"That was just panic. It was every emotion I could think of, my brain was all over the place,\" she says.",
      "Susan's first reaction was that she may have been secretly adopted. Both her parents had died some years before, so she plucked up the courage and asked her older brother.",
      "He was sure the whole thing was a scam. His sister had always been part of his life, and he was \"absolutely certain\" that one of his first memories was of his mother being pregnant.",
      "Susan though still had her suspicions. She was slightly taller than her brother and, with her striking blonde hair, had never looked like the rest of family.",
      "Her eldest daughter did some digging and found a copy of all the births registered in the local area on the day her mother was born.",
      "The next baby girl on the list, registered at the same NHS hospital, had the exact same surname as the man who had contacted her through the genealogy website.",
      "It couldn't be a coincidence. The only possible explanation was a mistake or mix-up in that maternity ward more than seven decades ago.",
      "Until recently cases like this were unheard of in the UK, although there have been a handful of examples in other countries.",
      "The standard practice in the NHS today is to place two bands around babies' ankles immediately after birth and keep mother and child together through their hospital stay.",
      "In the 1950s maternity care was very different. Babies were often separated, placed in large nursery rooms and cared for by midwives.",
      "\"The whole system was far less sophisticated back then,\" says Jason Tang, from the London law firm Russell Cooke, which is representing Susan.",
      "\"It may be that staff didn't attach a card or tag immediately, or that it simply fell off and was put back on the wrong baby or on the wrong crib.\"",
      "From the late 1940s the UK also saw a post-war baby boom putting more pressure on busy maternity services in the newly formed NHS.",
      "This, of course, meant nothing to Susan for decades.",
      "She grew up as part of a \"normal, working class\" household, met her husband and ended up working for the NHS herself in a \"hands-on\" clinical role.",
      "Other than \"a bit of the usual trauma\" in her teenage years, she remembers her parents as a \"very good, loving\" couple who \"did everything they could and always encouraged me\".",
      "\"In a way, I'm so glad they are not here anymore to see this,\" says Susan. \"If they are up there watching me, I really hope they don't know what's gone on.\"",
      "If home DNA tests had been available earlier, she doesn't think she could have told them the truth \"because it would have been so awful\".",
      "\"But I really don't think that for me, anything has changed about them, they are still mum and dad,\" she says.",
      "On the other hand, her relationship with the man she has always known as her older brother has, she thinks, been strengthened by what she's gone through.",
      "\"It's actually brought us closer together. Now we meet up more often and I get cards sent to 'my dear sister',\" she says.",
      "\"Both he and his wife have been absolutely fantastic, honestly I cannot praise them enough.\"",
      "She remembers receiving another \"lovely letter\" from a cousin at the time who told her, \"Oh don't worry, you're still part of the family\".",
      "As for her new blood relations, she says the situation has been more difficult.",
      "She has met up with the man who contacted her, her genetic sibling, and laughs as she remembers how similar they both looked.",
      "\"If you'd put a wig on him and a bit of makeup, it could honestly have been me,\" she jokes.",
      "She has also seen photographs of the other woman who she was swapped with at birth, and her sons.",
      "But building a relationship with that new side of her family has not been easy.",
      "\"I know they are my biological relatives but I didn't grow up with them so there's not that emotional connection there,\" she says.",
      "\"They closed ranks, basically, through loyalty to their sister which is admirable and I understand.\"",
      "Susan's genetic parents died some years ago but she's been told she looks like her biological mother.",
      "\"I'd still like to know a bit more about her \u2013 what she was like and all that \u2013 but I never will, so there you go,\" she says.",
      "\"But if I take the emotion out of it, and just think logically and clearly, I was better off how I grew up.\"",
      "Historic mistake",
      "Susan is one of the first to ever receive compensation - the amount is not being disclosed - in a case like this.",
      "She needed to take a second DNA test before the NHS trust involved accepted its historic mistake and made a \"very lovely\" apology.",
      "Last year, the BBC reported on another decades-old case of babies swapped at birth, which again came to light after someone was given a DNA testing kit for Christmas.",
      "Susan says the settlement was never about money but the recognition a mistake had been made all those years ago.",
      "\"I suppose you always want someone to blame, don't you?\" she asks.",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 01:24:38 GMT",
    "summary": "BBC News reports on assisted dying in Canada, where some say it's now easier to choose to die than get support to live",
    "story": [
      "April Hubbard sits on the theatre stage where she plans to die later this year.",
      "She is not terminally ill, but the 39-year-old performance and burlesque artist has been approved for assisted dying under Canada's increasingly liberal laws.",
      "Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing",
      "She is speaking to BBC News from the Bus Stop Theatre, an intimate auditorium with a little under 100 seats, in the eastern city of Halifax, Nova Scotia.",
      "Illuminated by a single spotlight on a stage she has performed on many times before, she tells me she plans to die here \"within months\" of her imminent 40th birthday. She'll be joined by a small group of her family and friends.",
      "April plans to be in a \"big comfy bed\" for what she calls a \"celebratory\" moment when a medical professional will inject a lethal dose into her bloodstream.",
      "\"I want to be surrounded by the people I love and just have everybody hold me in a giant cuddle puddle and get to take my last breath, surrounded by love and support,\" she says.",
      "April was born with spina bifida and was later diagnosed with tumours at the base of her spine which she says have left her in constant, debilitating pain.",
      "She's been taking strong opioid painkillers for more than 20 years and applied for Medical Assistance in Dying (Maid) in March 2023. While she could yet live for decades with her condition, she qualified to end her life early seven months after applying. For those who are terminally ill it is possible to get approval within 24 hours.",
      "\"My suffering and pain are increasing and I don't have the quality of life anymore that makes me happy and fulfilled,\" April says. Every time she moves or breathes, she says it feels like the tissues from the base of her spine \"are being pulled like a rubber band that stretches too far\", and that her lower limbs leave her in agony.",
      "We meet April as, almost 3,000 miles away, MPs are scrutinising proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. They voted in principle in support of those plans in November 2024, but months of detailed scrutiny have followed - and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could possibly become law.",
      "This week, the BBC witnessed a man's death in California, where assisted dying laws are far more similar to those being considered in Westminster.",
      "Critics say Canada is an example of the \"slippery slope\", meaning that once you pass an assisted dying law it will inevitably widen its scope and have fewer safeguards.",
      "Canada now has one of the most liberal systems of assisted dying in the world, similar to that operating in the Netherlands and Belgium. It introduced Maid in 2016, initially for terminally ill adults with a serious and incurable physical illness, which causes intolerable suffering. In 2021, the need to be terminally ill was removed, and in two years' time, the Canadian government plans to open Maid to adults solely with a mental illness and no physical ailment.",
      "Opponents of Maid tell us that death is coming to be seen as a standard treatment option for those with disabilities and complex medical problems.",
      "\"It is easier in Canada to get medical assistance in dying than it is to get government support to live,\" says Andrew Gurza, a disability awareness consultant and friend of April's.",
      "Andrew, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, says he respects April's decision, but tells us: \"If my disability declines and my care needs got higher, I'd still want to be here. To know there's a law that's saying you could easily end your life - it's just really scary.\"",
      "Before she was approved for Maid, April was assessed by two independent physicians who were required to inform her of ways to alleviate her suffering and offer alternative treatments.",
      "\"The safeguards are there,\" she says, when we press her about disabled people who feel threatened by assisted dying, or whether Maid is being used as a shortcut to better quality care. \"If it's not right for you and you're not leading the charge and choosing Maid, you're not going to be able to access it unless it's for the right reasons,\" she adds.",
      "There were 15,343 Maid deaths in 2023, representing around one in 20 of all deaths in Canada - a proportion that has increased dramatically since 2016 and is one of the highest in the world. The average age of recipients was 77.",
      "In all but a handful of cases, the lethal dose was delivered by a doctor or nurse, which is also known as voluntary euthanasia. One doctor we spoke to, Eric Thomas, said he had helped 577 patients to die.",
      "Dr Konia Trouton, president of the Canadian Association of Maid Assessors and Providers, has also helped hundreds of patients to die since the law was introduced.",
      "The procedure is the same each time - she arrives at the home of the person who has been given approval for Maid and asks if they wish to go ahead with it that day. She says the patients always direct the process and then give her the \"heads up and ready to go\".",
      "\"That gives me an honour and a duty and a privilege to be able to help them in those last moments with their family around them, with those who love them around them and to know that they've made that decision thoughtfully, carefully and thoroughly,\" she adds.  If the answer is yes, she opens her medical bag.",
      "Demonstrating to the BBC what happens next, Dr Trouton briefly puts a tourniquet on my arm. She shows me where the needle would be inserted into a vein in the back of my hand to allow an intravenous infusion of lethal drugs.",
      "In her medical bag she also has a stethoscope. \"Strangely, these days I use it more to determine if someone has no heartbeat rather than if they do,\" she tells me.",
      "A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line",
      "Some 96% of Maid provisions are under \"track one\" where death is \"reasonably foreseeable\". Dr Trouton says that means patients are on a \"trajectory toward death\", which might range from someone who has rapidly spreading cancer and only weeks to live or another with Alzheimer's \"who might have five to seven years\".",
      "The other 4% of Maid deaths come under \"track two\". These are adults, like April, who are not dying but have suffering which is intolerable to them from a \"grievous and irremediable medical condition\".",
      "That is in stark contrast to Labour MP Kim Leadbeater's bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, which says patients must be expected to die within six months. The Westminster bill would not allow doctors to give a lethal dose \u2013 rather patients would have to self-administer the drugs, usually by swallowing them.",
      "Death via intravenous infusion normally takes just a few minutes, as the lethal drugs go straight into the bloodstream, whereas swallowing the drugs means patients usually take around an hour or two to die, but can take considerably longer, although they are usually unconscious after a few minutes.",
      "Dr Trouton told me she regarded the Canadian system as quicker and more effective, as do other Maid providers. \"I'm concerned that if some people can't swallow because of their disease process, and if they're not able to take the entire quantity of medication because of breathing difficulties or swallowing difficulties, what will happen?\"",
      "'Canada has fallen off a cliff'",
      "But opponents argue it's being used as a cheaper alternative to providing adequate social or medical support.",
      "One of them is Dr Ramona Coelho, a GP in London, Ontario, whose practice serves many marginalised groups and those struggling to get medical and social support. She's part of a Maid Death Review Committee, alongside Dr Trouton, which examines cases in the province.",
      "Dr Coelho told me that Maid was \"out of control\". \"I wouldn't even call it a slippery slope,\" she says \"Canada has fallen off a cliff.\"",
      "\"When people have suicidal ideations, we used to meet them with counselling and care, and for people with terminal illness and other diseases we could mitigate that suffering and help them have a better life,\" she says. \"Yet now we are seeing that as an appropriate request to die and ending their lives very quickly.\"",
      "While at Dr Coelho's surgery I was introduced to Vicki Whelan, a retired nurse whose mum Sharon Scribner died in April 2023 of lung cancer, aged 81. Vicki told me that in her mum's final days in hospital she was repeatedly offered the option of Maid by medical staff, describing it as like a \"sales pitch\".",
      "The family, who are Catholic, discharged their mother so she could die at home, where Vicki says her mum had a \"beautiful, peaceful death\". \"It makes us think that we can't endure, and we can't suffer a little bit, and that somehow now they've decided that dying needs to be assisted, where we've been dying for years.",
      "\"All of a sudden now we're telling people that this is a better option. This is an easy way out and I think it's just robbing people of hope.\"",
      "'Not a way I want to live'",
      "So is Canada an example of the so-called slippery slope? It's certainly true that the eligibility criteria has broadened dramatically since the law was introduced nine years ago, so for critics the answer would be an emphatic yes and serve as a warning to Britain.",
      "Canada's assisted dying laws were driven by court rulings. Its Supreme Court instructed Parliament that a prohibition on assisted dying breached the country's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The extension of eligibility for those who were not terminally ill was in part a response to another court decision.",
      "In Britain, judges in the most senior courts have repeatedly said any potential change to the law around assisted dying is a matter for Parliament, after the likes of Tony Nicklinson, Diane Pretty and Noel Conway brought cases arguing the blanket ban on assisted suicide breached their human rights.",
      "April knows some people may look at her, a young woman, and wonder why she would die.",
      "\"We're the masters of masking and not letting people see that we're suffering,\" she says. \"But in reality, there's days that I just can't hide it, and there's many days where I can't lift my head off the pillow and I can't eat anymore.",
      "\"It's not a way I want to live for another 10 or 20 or 30 years.\"",

      "The ONS says girls turning 18 in 2025 are likely to have an average of one child per woman by the age of 35 - unlike their mothers' generation, which had an average of one child per woman by the time they were 31.",
      "They are also projected to have an average of 1.52 children during their lifetimes - down from 1.95 children for their mothers and 2.04 children for their grandmothers.",
      "The new analysis marks the first time the ONS has explored how fertility levels could change in future generations.",
      "It looks at fertility patterns for women born in 1978 alongside patterns for their mothers' generation - assumed to be those born in 1951 - and projections for their daughters' generation - considered to be those born in 2007, who turn 18 this year.",
      "It shows those born in 1978 on average have one child by the time they reach 31. For their mothers' generation, this occurred by the age of 26.",
      "By projecting this trend forwards into the future, the ONS found that women born in 2007 are likely to have an average of one child by the time they are 35.",
      "For girls born in 2025, this is projected to occur by the time they are 36.",
      "Kerry Gadsdon, from the ONS, said the trend may be driven by \"financial pressures and the timing of other life events such as partnership formation and moving into your own home generally happening later\".",

    "summary": "A Macclesfield woman fears she will have to leave Australia due to her medical condition.",
    "story": [
      "A British couple who face being deported from Australia after one of them was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) have said it is not fair the life they built could be taken away \"any minute\".",
      "Jessica Mathers was told the potential cost to health services of treating her condition meant her 2023 application for permanent residency alongside boyfriend Rob O'Leary was rejected.",
      "The 30-year-old, a project manager and DJ from Macclesfield who has lived in Sydney since 2017, said the couple had been \"living in a state of uncertainty\" for years as they waited for an outcome of an appeal against the decision.",
      "The Australian Department of Home Affairs said it cannot comment on individual cases.",
      "Ms Mathers and Mr O'Leary, 31, from East London, met while backpacking in the country in 2017 and have lived there ever since.",
      "He started a business in the carpentry and construction trade three years ago, and said the couple had \"made the most of our lives here\".",
      "But Ms Mathers's diagnosis of the relapsing-remitting variant of MS in 2020 has led to a visa battle with authorities that could see the pair thrown out of the country.",
      "MS is a neurological condition where immune cells in the body attack the brain and spinal cord, leading to symptoms including muscle stiffness and problems walking and talking.",
      "The disease affects everyone differently, and in those with the relapsing remitting variant, symptoms can fluctuate mild to severe, according to the NHS.",
      "Ms Mathers has received treatment in Australia under a reciprocal health agreement with the UK and said her condition had been \"well managed\" so far.",
      "But the couple's requests for permanent residency were rejected in 2023 due to the costs associated with her medical care.",
      "Non-citizens entering Australia must meet certain health requirements, including not having \"unduly increasing costs\" for the country's publicly-funded healthcare service Medicare.",
      "'You're not welcome here': Australia\u2019s treatment of disabled migrants",
      "The couple lodged an appeal with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal after the visa rejection in 2023, and have been waiting for the past two years for an outcome.",
      "Mr O'Leary said they had offered to pay the medical costs themselves or take out private insurance, \"but the law is black and white, and the refusal is based on that, it's really hard for us\".",
      "They have started an online petition to call for Australia's Minister for Home Affairs to review their case and look into immigration policies that \"unfairly target individuals with well-managed health conditions\".",
      "Mr O'Leary said the couple were \"not asking for special treatment\" but a chance to continue \"working hard to contribute to this country in meaningful ways\".",
      "He said: \"We've always paid tax, we've always worked, Jess has done heaps of charity work.\"",
      "Ms Mathers said the couple had been \"stuck not knowing what to do\" as they waited for the outcome of their appeal, which had made it difficult for her to find anything other than temporary work.",
      "She said: \"It's held up our whole life, it's really upsetting.",
      "\"We know that we could get a refusal from the tribunal and then get given 28 days to leave the country, at any minute.",
      "\"We've got so much opportunity in Australia, and to walk away from it would be so sad.\"",

    "story": [
      "Public satisfaction with the NHS has hit a new low, according to the long-running British Social Attitudes survey.",
      "Just 21% said they were satisfied with the NHS in 2024, with waiting times and staff shortages the biggest concerns.",
      "Satisfaction rates have dropped sharply since the pandemic \u2013 in 2019, 60% were satisfied.",
      "Responding to the findings, Sir Jim Mackey, the new chief executive of NHS England, said he was worried about the \"growing disconnect\" between the service and the population.",
      "The poll - the gold-standard measure of the public's view of the health service - has been running since 1983.",
      "Nearly 3,000 people from England, Wales and Scotland were asked for their views last autumn.",
      "There have been particularly sharp falls in satisfaction with three core services:",
      "19% satisfied with A&E, compared to 54% in 201920% satisfied with dentistry, compared to 60% in 201931% satisfied with GP services, compared to 68% in 2019",

      "31% satisfied with GP services, compared to 68% in 2019",
      "The public in Wales were the most dissatisfied with the NHS.",
      "Satisfaction with social care, which covers care homes and help in the home, was lower still, with just 13% saying they were satisfied - the same as last year.",
      "Sir Jim, in his  first broadcast interview since starting his new role, said: \"None of us have felt we are delivering improvements at the pace needed for our population.",
      "\"I am very worried about a growing disconnect between the service and the population. The results are pretty bad - and there's a big message in that.",
      "\"We are here for the population. The population own the NHS. It's their service.\"",
      "'Horrific ordeal'",
      "James Cullinane, 41, from Luton, is someone who has become frustrated with the state of GP care.",
      "He said he struggles to get an appointment when he needs one for himself or his children \u2013 his 11-year-old son suffers with allergies.",
      "\"They constantly tell you to phone back every morning at 8am to see if there's appointments available \u2013 and there generally never are.\"",
      "He said he has resorted to visiting local walk-in centres or phoning NHS 111.",
      "\"I can understand people's opinion of the NHS dropping,\" he added.",
      "Susan Quenby told the BBC about what she described as a \"horrific\" ordeal after being taken to hospital with what turned out to be sepsis.",
      "The 68-year-old from York went to A&E because of wounds that had been gradually getting worse and spent 17 hours in A&E before being taken to a ward.",
      "\"I waited in A&E with oozing weeping open sores on both shins. I had to ask a nurse in A&E for somewhere to lie down as I felt so terribly ill with chills and a fever.",
      "\"Once in a bed, it was confirmed I had sepsis with a very high infection rate. I spent eight days in hospital on an antibiotic drip.",
      "\"While I was there my bed sheets were changed just once in a week. My legs wouldn't stop oozing so the sheets were filthy. I was worried about picking up another infection.\"",
      "'Sobering reminder'",
      "The survey, which was carried out before last year's Budget when the government announced a rise in funding, also found more than two thirds did not think enough was spent on the NHS.",
      "But the public is also concerned about waste \u2013 with just 14% saying the NHS spends the money it has efficiently.",
      "Bea Taylor, from the Nuffield Trust think-tank, which has published the findings along with the King's Fund, said: \"Just five years after the British public were called on to 'Protect the NHS' at the start of the pandemic, these findings reveal just how dismayed they are about the state of the NHS.",
      "\"The government says the NHS is broken - and the public agree. But support for the core principles of the NHS \u2013 free at the point of use, available to all and funded by taxation \u2013 endures despite the collapse in satisfaction.\"",
      "Louise Ansari, of the patient watchdog Healthwatch England, said the survey was a \"sobering reminder\" of the state of the NHS.",
      "\"Although many people tell us that they are grateful for the hard work of NHS staff, long waiting times and access issues across the health system have taken their toll on people's confidence in getting timely care in the first place.\"",
      "And Saffron Cordery, interim chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health managers, said: \"These figures must be a wake-up call for the NHS.",
      "\"It's clear radical action is needed across the board to restore the public's faith in the NHS.\"",
      "England's Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"We inherited a broken NHS and this survey shows patients agree.\"",
      "He said since the survey was carried out extra money had been invested and improvements were starting to be seen, but it would take time.",
      "He said the forthcoming 10-year plan for the NHS, which is expected in the summer, would once again make the NHS the \"envy of the world\".",

    "summary": "Research suggests the synthetic hair used for braiding could be bad for you - but will that stop women using it?",
    "story": [
      "Braids are one of the most popular hairstyles for black women, worn by celebrities and aunties alike - but questions are being raised about its effects on our health.",
      "The process can last up to five hours as stylists deftly part small, evenly-spaced sections of hair, and gradually add in extensions.",
      "Despite the long salon visits, braids have always been closely linked to convenience for me.",
      "Growing up, they were for holidays, as the style meant that instead of fretting over how frizzy my hair would get, I could jump in the pool with no worries.",
      "Braids are still what I turn to now when I want a few months break from all the detangling - or I want to try a new colour without the potential damage of hair dye.",
      "But a new study suggests that the synthetic hair many black women use to achieve this style could be bad for their health.",
      "The US non-profit organisation Consumer Reports tested samples from ten of the most popular brands of synthetic braiding hair, and found that all of them contained carcinogens, and in some cases, lead.",
      "The research made an impact, as my Instagram feed and WhatsApp groups were flooded with links to the study, warning of the alleged risks hidden in our hair.",
      "One of the messages was from my cousin, Rochelle, who does her braids herself every other month.",
      "\"Braids, famously, are called a protective style,\" she later told me.",
      "It's a term typically used to describe several Afro hairstyles, including braids, locs and wigs, that reduce how much your hair is exposed to the elements and cut back on constant styling.",
      "\"The fact that this style is doing everything but protect us - it's actually harming us - is actually quite wild to me.\"",
      "It is the lack of awareness among black women that is most concerning, she adds.",
      "\"People that are eating unhealthy food or smoking, they know that what they're doing could harm their body, whereas if you're putting braids in your hair, you're not thinking that it's harming you.\"",
      "James Rogers, the head of product safety testing at Consumer Reports, says that the results are a cause for concern because women have \"constant contact\" with harmful chemicals if their hair is in braids, often for months at a time.",
      "\"We believe that whenever you're exposed to harmful chemicals, that it's cumulative - it all adds up.\"",
      "But he also emphasised that more research was needed, saying: \"We're hoping that this begins the conversation, not only at the regulatory level, but also amongst our own communities, about sharing accurate information.\"",
      "Here at Jos\u00e9e's Professional Braiding Studio in north London, the study certainly isn't putting clients off.",
      "Jos\u00e9e and her daughters Abigail and Naomi, who work with her in the salon, have seen interest from new customers, especially after they helped to create the wig worn by Elphaba in Wicked, one of highest-grossing movies of 2024.",
      "\"People were shocked by how versatile we can be with our braiding,\" Abigail tells me, adding that her mum received several messages from clients telling them how proud they were.",
      "Jos\u00e9e says that while the findings are \"worrying\", it has been business as usual at the salon.",
      "Some of her customers, however, have been rattled by the research.",
      "It's Kellie-Ann's first time getting her braids done at Jos\u00e9e's salon, but she has been wearing the style since she was a child.",
      "She tells me she felt betrayed after reading the study: \"I think it's awful that companies have been doing this for years to black women and I think we deserve better.\"",
      "She's now seeking out brands free from harmful chemicals and plastic - and says many of her friends are doing the same.",
      "\"A lot of women I've spoken to about it have agreed that biogradable would be better - it's good for the planet as well.\"",
      "Ifeanyi has also worn braids since childhood, and says they are the easiest and most convenient style to handle while she's busy studying at university.",
      "She argues that the study is not alarming, pointing out that people may come into contact with carcinogens every day, in certain processed foods, alcohol and tobacco.",
      "\"Obviously you want be cautious - I just think that it's not necessarily something to completely abandon the style or the hair for.\"",
      "She's concerned that the social media posts she has seen will \"scare people out of wanting to engage\", to the detriment of a critical source of income for black entrepreneurs working in the hair industry.",
      "In 2021 Treasure Tress, a UK-based beauty subscription for black hair, found that black British women spent \u00a3168m a year on hair products. Earlier research by L'Oreal suggested that black women in the UK spend six times more on their hair than white women.",
      "\"I'd like to see more of a commitment to making sure that things are safer for us, rather than telling us that some of our historical, traditional practices as black women are wrong,\" Ifeanyi says.",
      "For some, changing attitudes towards synthetic hair are opening up business opportunities.",
      "Tendai Moyo co-founded Ruka Hair in 2021, which specialises in extensions made from natural hair sourced from South East Asia, as well as biodegradable synthetic hair, made from collagen fibre.",
      "She tells me they have seen a \"huge uptick in demand\", especially in the US, where the study was published.",
      "But she sees this as part of a wider trend, which stretches beyond concerns raised by the new research.",
      "\"We launched in the pandemic, and people were like, 'Oh, but salons are closed', but we were selling out because people don't stop doing their hair.\"",
      "She tells me that black women \"got to experiment\" more with their hair during lockdown and were more willing to try out new products.",
      "One of the biggest draws of traditional synthetic hair brands, however, is their low price, which has made experimenting with different styles and colours affordable for years.",
      "But newer brands tend to have a higher price point - Tendai tells me that Ruka's most popular synthetic hair type costs around 2.5 times more than several high street brands.",
      "Ifeanyi says that, as a student, brands like Ruka are out of reach for her: \"To purchase the hair is equivalent to the amount it would cost you to get the hairstyle done, so you're essentially doubling the price.\"",
      "Tendai defends this by comparing it to choosing between \"fast food and healthy food\".",
      "She adds: \"You can actually reuse our products if you'd like, and therefore you're saving money in that way.\"",
      "Back at Jos\u00e9e's salon, Naomi tells me that braiding is not just an important source of income, but a valued cultural practice that brings her family together.",
      "\"I call myself a braid baby because I've been braiding since I was 6 years old,\" she says, telling me how her family would bond over the skill as her mum proudly looks on.",
      "\"It's an empowering service to offer,\" she adds, saying that it's gratifying to do a job that leaves other women feeling uplifted.",
      "Despite growing concerns about the effect it could have on our health, braiding is a precious heirloom for this family - and for many other black women - passed down from generation to generation.",

      "I knock on the door and meet his children - Emily, 48, and Ashley, 44 - who have spent the last two weeks at their father's side.",
      "Wayne sits in a reclining chair where he spends most of his days. Terminally ill, he is too weak to leave the house.",
      "He has invited BBC News to witness his death under California's assisted dying laws - if MPs in London vote to legalise the practice in England and Wales, it will allow some terminally ill people here to die in a similar way.",
      "Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing",
      "Half an hour after arriving at Wayne's house, I watch him swallow three anti-nausea tablets, designed to minimise the risk of him vomiting the lethal medication he plans to take shortly.",
      "Are you sure this day is your last, I ask him? \"I'm all in,\" he replies. \"I was determined and decided weeks ago - I've had no trepidation since then.\"",
      "His family ask for one last photo, which I take, and you can see at the top of this page. As usual, Stella and Wayne are holding hands.",
      "Shortly after, Dr Donnie Moore arrives. He has got to know the family over the past few weeks, visiting them on several occasions alongside running his own end-of-life clinic. Under California law, he is what is known as the attending physician who must confirm, in addition to a second doctor, that Wayne is eligible for aid in dying.",
      "Dr Moore's role is part physician, part counsellor in this situation, one he has been in for 150 assisted deaths before.",
      "On a top shelf in Wayne's bedroom sits a brown glass bottle containing a fine white powder - a mixture of five drugs, sedatives and painkillers, delivered to the house four weeks before. The dosage of drugs inside is hundreds of times higher than those used in regular healthcare and is \"guaranteed\" to be fatal, Dr Moore explains. Unlike California, the proposed law at Westminster would require a doctor to bring any such medication with them.",
      "When Wayne signals he is ready, the doctor mixes the meds with cherry and pineapple juice to soften the bitter taste - and he hands this pink liquid to Wayne.",
      "No one, not even the doctor, knows how long it will take him to die after taking the lethal drugs. Dr Moore explains to me that, in his experience, death usually occurs between 30 minutes and two hours of ingestion, but on one occasion it took 17 hours.",
      "This is the story of how and why Wayne chose to die. And why others have decided not to follow the same course.",
      "We first met the couple a few weeks earlier, when Wayne explained why he was going ahead with the decision to have an assisted death - a controversial measure in other parts of the world.",
      "\"Some days the pain is almost more than I can handle,\" he said. \"I just don't see any merit to dying slow and painfully, hooked up with stuff - intubation, feeding tubes,\" he told me. \"I want none of it.\"",
      "Wayne said he had watched two relatives die \"miserable\", \"heinous\" deaths from heart failure.",
      "\"I hate hospitals, they are miserable. I will die in the street first.\"",
      "Wayne met Stella in 1969; the couple married four years later. He told us it was something of an arranged marriage, as his mother kept inviting Stella for dinner until eventually the penny dropped that he should take her out.",
      "They lived for many years in Arcata, northern California, surrounded by sweeping forests of redwood trees, where Wayne worked as a landscape architect, while Stella was a primary school teacher. They spent their holidays hiking and camping with their children.",
      "Now Wayne is terminally ill with heart failure, which has already brought him close to death. He has myriad other health issues including prostate cancer, liver failure and sepsis which brings him serious spinal pain.",
      "He is expected to live less than six months, qualifying him for an assisted death in California. His request to die has been approved by two doctors and the lethal medication is self-administered.",
      "It was during our first meeting that he asked the BBC to return to observe his final day, saying he wanted terminally ill adults in the UK to have the same right to an assisted death as him.",
      "\"Britain is pretty good with freedoms and this is just another one,\" he said. \"People should be able to choose the time of their death as long as they meet the rules like six months to live or less.\"",
      "Stella, 78, supports his decision. \"I've known him for over 50 years. He's a very independent man. He's always known what he wants to do and he's always fixed things. That's how he's operating now. If this is his choice, I definitely agree, and I've seen him really suffer with the illness he's got. I don't want that for him.\"",
      "Wayne would also qualify under the proposed new assisted dying law in England and Wales. The measures return to the House of Commons later this month, when all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on changes to the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill.",
      "The proposed legislation, tabled by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, says that anyone who wants to end their life must have the mental capacity to make the choice, that they must be expected to die within six months, and must make two separate declarations - witnessed and signed - about their wish to die. They must satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible.",
      "MPs in Westminster voted in favour of assisted dying in principle last November but remain bitterly divided on the issue. If they ultimately decide to approve the bill, it could become law within the next year and come into practice within the next four years.",
      "A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line",
      "There are also divisions here in California, where assisted dying was introduced in 2016. Michelle and Mike Carter, both 72 and married for 43 years, are each being treated for cancer - Mike has prostate cancer that has spread to his lymph nodes, and Michelle's advanced terminal ovarian cancer has spread throughout much of her body.",
      "\"I held my mother's hand when she passed; I held my father's hand when he passed,\" Michelle told me. \"I believe there's freedom of choice however for me, I choose palliative care\u2026 I have God and I have good medicine.\"",
      "Michelle's physician, palliative care specialist Dr Vincent Nguyen, argued that assisted dying laws in the US state lead to \"silent coercion\" whereby vulnerable people think their only option is to die. \"Instead of ending people's lives, let's put programmes together to care for people,\" he said. \"Let them know that they're loved, they're wanted and they're worthy.\"",
      "He said the law meant that doctors have gone from being seen as healers to killers, while the message from the healthcare system was that \"you are better off dead, because you're expensive and your death is cheaper for us\".",
      "Some disability campaigners say assisted dying makes them feel unsafe. Ingrid Tischer, who has muscular dystrophy and chronic respiratory failure, told me: \"The message that it sends to people with disabilities in California is that you deserve suicide assistance rather than suicide prevention when you voice a desire to end your life.",
      "\"What does that say about who we are as a culture?\"",
      "Critics often say that once assisted dying is legalised, over time the safeguards around such laws get eroded as part of a \"slippery slope\" towards more relaxed criteria. In California, there was initially a mandatory 15-day cooling off period between patients making a first and second request for aid in dying. That has been reduced to 48 hours because many patients were dying during the waiting period. It's thought the approval process envisaged in Westminster would take around a month.",
      "'Goodbye,' Wayne tells his family",
      "Outside Wayne's house on the morning of his death, a solitary bird begins its loud and elaborate song. \"There's that mockingbird out there,\" Wayne tells Stella, as smiles flicker across their faces.",
      "Wayne hates the bird because it keeps him awake at night, Stella jokes, hand in hand with him to one side of his chair. Emily and Ashley are next to Stella.",
      "Dr Moore, seated on Wayne's other side, hands him the pink liquid which he swallows without hesitation. \"Goodnight,\" he says to his family - a typical touch of humour from a man who told us he was determined to die on his terms. It's 11.47am.",
      "After two minutes, Wayne says he is getting sleepy. Dr Moore asks him to imagine he is walking in a vast sea of flowers with a soft breeze on his skin, which seems appropriate for a patient who has spent much of his life among nature.",
      "After three minutes Wayne enters a deep sleep from which he will never wake. On a few occasions he lifts his head to take a deep breath without opening his eyes, at one point beginning to snore softly.",
      "Dr Moore tells the family this is \"the deepest sleep imaginable\" and reassures Emily there is no chance her dad will wake up and ask, \"did it work?\"",
      "\"Oh that would be just like him,\" Stella says with a laugh.",
      "The family start to reminisce about hiking holidays and driving around in a large van they converted to become a camper. \"Me and dad insulated it and put a bed in the back,\" says Ashley.",
      "On the walls are photos of Emily and Ashley as small children next to huge carved Halloween pumpkins.",
      "Dr Moore is still stroking Wayne's hand and occasionally checking his pulse. For a man who Emily says was \"always walking, always outdoors, always active\", these are the final moments of life's journey, spent surrounded by those who mean most to him.",
      "At 12.22pm Dr Moore says, \"I think he's passed\u2026 He's at peace now.\"",
      "Outside, the mockingbird has fallen silent. \"No more pain,\" says Stella, embracing her children in her arms.",
      "I step outside to give the family some space, and reflect on what we have just seen and filmed.",
      "I have been covering medical ethics for the BBC for more than 20 years. In 2006, I was present just outside an apartment in Zurich where Dr Anne Turner, a retired doctor, died with the help of the group Dignitas - but California was the first time I had been an eyewitness to an assisted death.",
      "This isn't just a story about one man's death in California - it's about what could become a reality here in England and Wales for those who qualify for an assisted death and choose to die this way.",
      "Whether you're for or against the proposed new Westminster law, the death of a loved one is a deeply personal and emotional time for a family. Each death leaves an imprint, as will Wayne's.",

      "The British overseas territory is facing a 42% tax on the goods it exports to the US under Trump's shake-up of international trade.",
      "Teslyn Barkman, who oversees trade in the parliament, said the taxes would impact the economy, which is heavily dependent on the sale of fish to the EU and the US.",
      "But Barkman said the Falklands government would not respond with retaliatory tariffs and wanted a \"warm\" relationship with the US.",
      "Only eight other countries or territories dubbed the \"worst offenders\" for trade imbalances were given higher rates on Trump's list of tariffs, which are due to come into effect on Wednesday.",
      "\"It was a surprise,\" Barkman told the BBC. \"The fact a global superpower such as the US was paying attention to us at all caught us off guard.\"",
      "With a population of about 3,600 people, the Falkland Islands is an archipelago located in the South Atlantic Ocean.",
      "The territory has a government and sets its own trade policy, while the UK takes responsibility for its defence and foreign affairs.",
      "In 2023, the Falklands government reported a national income of \u00a3280m, with fishing accounting for 60% of gross domestic product (GDP).",
      "\"We're a village running a country,\" said Barkman, who holds responsibility for trade and economic development in the Legislative Assembly.",
      "\"So the sum of our trade exports is massive in terms of GDP.\"",
      "In 2023, the Falklands exported $27.4m (\u00a321.2m) of goods to the US, mostly non-fillet frozen fish, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC).",

      "\"The UK government has a responsibility to step up and defend British citizens everywhere \u2013 including in the Falklands.",
      "\"President Trump has arbitrarily decided to hit Falklanders with some of his highest tariffs in an outrageous act of aggression that cannot be allowed to stand.\"",
      "Barkman said the Falklands was still trying to figure out why Trump decided to levy a 42% tariff on its goods. The US imposed a 10% tariff on UK products.",
      "As analysis by BBC Verify showed, the tariffs are based on a calculation that factors in the difference in goods traded between the US and other countries.",
      "\"We're certainly not looking at any anything retaliatory at all,\" Barkman said.",
      "\"We need to understand how that figure was arrived at because certainly the Falkland Islands approach has been that we're here to support the UK and her Western allies.",
      "She added: \"We want a warm relationship with the US as well.\"",

      "Councils are exposing homeless children to serious health and safeguarding risks by housing them in unsuitable temporary accommodation, an inquiry by MPs has found.",
      "MPs said a \"crisis in temporary accommodation\" in England had left a record 164,000 children without a permanent home.",
      "The inquiry concluded many children were living in \"appalling conditions\" and suffering significant impacts to their health and education as a result.",
      "In a report, the MPs urged ministers to deliver more affordable homes and take urgent action to support families living in temporary accommodation.",
      "In England, some local authorities have a legal duty to support the homeless, including providing temporary accommodation.",
      "Temporary accommodation is meant as a short-term solution for those experiencing or at risk of homelessness and can include hostels and rooms in shared houses.",
      "The inquiry was launched last year by MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee, which condemned the state of some temporary accommodation as \"utterly shameful\".",
      "The inquiry heard evidence of \"egregious hazards\" to children, including serious damp, mould, and mice infestations, and families living in temporary housing for years.",
      "Florence Eshalomi, the Labour MP who leads the committee, told the BBC evidence showing the deaths of 74 children had been linked to temporary housing \"should shock all of us\".",
      "\"That should send alarm bells ringing,\" she said. \"What was most shocking as well was the fact that over 58 of those young children were under the age of one. Where have we gone wrong?\"",
      "Eshalomi said when she was a child, she once lived in temporary accommodation filled with damp.",
      "She said: \"I think about what I went through as a young person and it pains me to think that many years later now as an MP, I see that still happening in the constituency I represent.\"",
      "In its report, the committee set out recommendations, including requiring councils to check housing is safe to be used as temporary accommodation.",
      "Another key recommendation was the proposal to give more powers to the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman, which investigates complaints about the treatment of people placed in temporary housing.",
      "In response to the inquiry, a government spokesperson said the findings were shocking, adding that the government was taking \"urgent action to fix the broken system we inherited, investing nearly \u00a31bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation\".",
      "They said: \"Alongside this, we are developing a long-term strategy to tackle homelessness, driving up housing standards and delivering the biggest boost in social and affordable homes in a generation.\"",
      "In extreme cases, the ombudsman can ask councils to compensate people whose complaints are upheld - and data shared with the BBC shows a marked rise in those payouts.",
      "Last year, the ombudsman upheld 176 complaints against councils and recommended 144 payouts in those cases.",
      "The number of payouts last year - some worth thousands of pounds - was greater than the 121 in 2022-23 and the 73 in 2021-22.",

      "Sam said she ended up homeless after separating from her partner and approached the council for help.",
      "\"I couldn't get hold of an actual person to speak to,\" Sam said. \"All my emails just went unanswered.\"",
      "At one stage, she and her children slept overnight in her car when they had nowhere else to go.",
      "\"I think the one thing as a parent, you just put a roof over your children's head,\" Sam said.",
      "\"That for me, is just basic, and I couldn't even do that. I got a good job. I was in full-time employment, and the kids were in school and everything.\"",
      "The ombudsman said the council eventually placed them in unsuitable interim accommodation, which was too far from her children's school and her workplace.",
      "\"It was like 33 miles in total and it took us sort of an hour each way,\" Sam said.",
      "Sam said the council did not take account of her child's need to continue attending the primary school where she received specialist support.",
      "She said the flat itself was \"horrendous\" and claimed neighbours were regularly taking drugs near her front door.",
      "The ombudsman said the council did not respond properly to Sam's reports about delays in getting repairs done in this accommodation and incidents when she was threatened and physically assaulted by neighbours.",
      "Sam and her children were allocated alternative accommodation in September 2022 but she had to wait three months before she could move in.",
      "She accused the council of leaving her \"in such a vulnerable situation that it was just so dangerous\" and said the experience still affects her children to this day.",
      "A council spokesperson said a national housing shortage meant offering homeless residents temporary accommodation they \"would not have chosen for themselves\".",
      "The spokesperson said: \"We accept that mistakes were made in this case and extend our apology to this resident, recognising the continued understandable disquiet this experience has had.",
      "\"It is important to note Bromley Council co-operated fully with the ombudsman's investigation, which was two years ago, and agreed with the proposed remedial action, which has been fully implemented and lessons have been learnt.\"",
      "Cameron Black, a spokesman for the ombudsman, said the payouts recognise \"the gravity of the injustice that's caused to the individuals in these cases\".",
      "He said there was a growing but small number of councils who are resistant to the ombudsman's findings and recommendations.",
      "He said the ombudsman is calling for more powers to monitor whether councils are meeting their legal duties to support homeless people.",
      "The rise in payouts comes as councils struggle to cover the costs of their legal duty to support the growing number of homeless families.",

      "London Luton Airport said it hoped to almost double annual passenger numbers to 32 million by 2043 after the government approved expansion plans, including a new terminal.",
      "The approval came despite a Planning Inspectorate recommendation that Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander should reject the proposals due to environmental concerns.",
      "Luton Rising, the airport's owner, said the decision could bring \"significant economic, employment and social benefits for our town\".",
      "However, environmental campaigners said \"with climate change worsening, the last thing any of us need is 70,000 more aircraft a year\".",
      "Luton was the UK's fifth busiest airport last year, with 16.9 million people travelling on 132,000 flights.",
      "The expansion plans involve building a new terminal, new taxiways and increasing capacity in the existing terminal, from its current 18 million passengers a year.",
      "'Vital infrastructure'",
      "A spokesman for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"pleased\" with the decision.",
      "He said: \"Improving our national infrastructure is critical to achieving growth and delivering jobs across the country, and this decision will help us deliver growth as part of our plan for change.",
      "\"This step underlines the government's commitment to unlocking vital infrastructure and backing growth.\"",
      "The expansion decision had been delayed three times, most recently so newly appointed Alexander could have more time to consider the application.",
      "Paul Kehoe, independent chair of Luton Rising, which is owned by Luton Borough Council, said up to 11,000 new jobs would be created.",
      "He said this was along with \"additional annual economic activity of up to \u00a31.5bn\".",
      "The announcement came less than a week after Vauxhall's van-making factory in Luton was closed by parent company Stellantis, putting up to 1,100 jobs at risk.",

      "Alexander said she was \"minded to approve\" a second runway at Gatwick Airport in February, while Chancellor Rachel Reeves has backed a third runway at Heathrow.",
      "Andrew Lambourne, of campaign group LADACAN, said the government ignored the concerns of local people.",
      "He said many felt the application was \"out-of-keeping\" with the area, adding: \"People living under the flight path are already at risk of health damage from being awoken by night flights, so adding 70% more is inhumane.\"",
      "Countryside charity CPRE added the expansion made \"a mockery\" of the government's \"commitment to reaching net zero by 2030\".",
      "One of the concerns expressed by the examining authority, on behalf of the Planning Inspectorate, was disruption to the \"relative tranquility\" of the Chilterns.",
      "It was understood the expansion plan would mean a plane flying over the area up to once every 15 minutes, compared with once every half an hour currently.",
      "Mr Kehoe, from Luton Rising, said the airport had introduced limits on noise and greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "Marion Geoffroy, managing director of Wizz Air, said she hoped the company, which is the airport's largest operator, could continue to grow.",

      "But operators will be competing for the new space. Earlier this week, Jet2 began to offer routes for the first time.",
      "Ms Geoffroy insisted \"competition is good\", adding: \"We are delighted the airport can offer more capacity, but we will be competing for sure.\"",
      "King's Walden Parish Council, which covers several villages near the airport, said it was \"hugely disappointed by the decision.\"",
      "It said: \"This development will negatively impact the rural communities of Breachwood Green, Tea Green and permanently destroy landscapes. This is on top of causing increased noise, sound and air pollution.",

      "Premiership rugby union clubs accounted for 57% (\u00a3124m) of the DCMS's total loans of \u00a3218m to sports bodies during the pandemic. Rugby league (\u00a324.2m), horse racing (\u00a321.5m) and tennis (\u00a314.3m) were the next highest beneficiaries, while non-league football clubs received \u00a313.4m.",
      "But with then-Premiership clubs London Irish, Wasps and Worcester all going out of business during the 2022-23 campaign, the taxpayer has been left out of pocket by tens of millions of pounds in unrecovered loans.",
      "\"DCMS insisted that these clubs were financially viable when it awarded the loans, despite public reports at the time to the contrary,\" said the PAC.",
      "Noting that some borrowers had been granted \"repayment holidays\" of up to four years, the PAC said that loans \"should not be extended to provide support for bodies which are financially unviable five years post-pandemic\".",
      "The report recommends that the DCMS \"should demonstrate a tough approach on behalf of taxpayers to managing those borrowers in trouble, including when considering any future additional financial support\".",
      "'Concerning and avoidable'",
      "Last month, government officials defended the loans to professional rugby union clubs.",
      "But with both Newcastle and Exeter both recently seeking investment, they also admitted being increasingly pessimistic over the financial stability of the club game.",
      "The last set of accounts filed by all Premiership clubs in 2022-23 showed that the sides collectively lost \u00a330.5m and have net debts of more than \u00a3300m, amid fears that the finances of elite club are unsustainable.",
      "The most senior DSMS civil servant - permanent secretary Susannah Storey - told the PAC that her department would use \"all financial levers\" to recover the money owed to it.",
      "However in its report, the PAC says that Storey has \"a conflict of interest regarding rugby union\", because her husband Pev Hooper is on the board of Premiership Rugby, and is also a director at CVC Capital Partners - a major investor in the sport.",
      "\"She has properly declared this conflict and recused herself from relevant discussions and decisions, and the department has put in place arrangements involving other staff to handle the conflict\", says the PAC.",
      "\"However, the department is most heavily exposed to rugby union in terms of both the amount of loans it has made and the financial health of the sport. The conflict of interest meant that we could not question the Permanent Secretary directly about the \u00a3124m that the department had loaned to top-tier rugby union clubs and its subsequent management of these loans.\"",
      "It adds that \"this gap in senior oversight and accountability for such a significant amount of public money is concerning and avoidable. It strikes this committee as odd that the department has not taken steps to address this such as by asking another Permanent Secretary to provide scrutiny and assurance\".",
      "The PAC published correspondence it had received from Storey in which she said that \"it is not accurate to state that there is a gap in accountability\" because relevant decision-making had been delegated to colleagues in line with guidelines.",
      "She also said that it was wrong to say the DCMS was \"overly optimistic\" about recouping all the funding because it had made clear that as it expected 14% of borrowers to fail over a 10-year period.",
      "'Inconsistent approach'",
      "The PAC also said the DCMS has shown \"an inconsistent approach to its engagement with professional sports.\"",
      "\"The department says it took a common approach when lending to borrowers in different sports, but, in our view, its subsequent actions display different approaches in practice,\" it said.",
      "\"It has appointed consultants and engaged with the Rugby Football Union, the Premier Rugby League and CVC Capital Partners on the future of rugby union.",
      "\"In contrast, the department was less certain about the extent of engagement by itself and Sport England with professional basketball over proposed structural changes to the game that could put at risk repayment of the last outstanding loans from four of the 11 professional clubs that received loans.",
      "\"When the department did provide us with more information, it was clear to us that it has been less engaged with basketball than with professional rugby union.\""

      "There is already a review of the sentencing system under way, led by former Conservative justice secretary David Gauke and aimed tackling prison overcrowding.",
      "It is not currently clear how the two reviews will interact.",
      "The guidelines were set to advise magistrates and judges to obtain a pre-sentence report - giving further details of an offender's background - before handing out punishment to someone of an ethnic or faith minority, alongside other groups such as young adults, abuse survivors and pregnant women.",
      "Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick first raised concerns about the guidelines earlier this month, saying they were biased \"against straight white men\" and amounted to \"two-tier justice\".",
      "In response, Mahmood said she also opposed a \"two-tier sentencing approach\" and that she \"did not stand for any differential treatment before the law\".",

      "\"I will do so in the coming months. It is right that this question is considered in greater depth,\" she said.",
      "She added that \"should further legislation be required,\" she would propose it as part of the government's planned Sentencing Bill.",
      "\"The Sentencing Council, while only 15 years old, holds an important position within the firmament of our justice system and any changes must be made carefully and with due consideration,\" she told MPs.",

      "Or in the overnight stock market falls, especially in Asia.",
      "But the true measure of these changes will be significant changes to long-standing global avenues of trade.",
      "At its heart this is a universal tariff of 10% on nearly all imports into the US for every country, coming in on Friday night. On top of that dozens of \"worst offenders\" will be charged reciprocally for having trade surpluses.",
      "The tariffs on Asian nations are truly remarkable. They will break the business models of thousands of companies, factories, and possibly entire nations.",
      "Some of the supply chains created by the world's biggest companies will be broken instantly. The inevitable impact will surely be to push them towards China.",
      "Is this just a grand negotiation? Well the US administration appears to be claiming the tariff revenue for planned tax cuts. The scope for quick adjustment seems limited. As one White House official said bluntly: \"This is not a negotiation, it's a national emergency\".",
      "The US's formula for the so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" basically just charges a country for having a goods trade surplus with the US, exporting more to America than it imports. Then even if there is no surplus it whacks up the charge at the universal baseline of 10%.",
      "All this reveals two things. The aim of policy is to reduce the US trade deficit to zero. That is a remarkable rerouting of world trade flows and explains the specific punitive focus on Asia.",
      "Secondly it is clearly the case that bilateral negotiations have not made much of a difference, or in fact any difference.",

    "summary": "Wayne Hawkins believes terminally ill people should be able to die when they choose, but others in the state disagree.",
    "story": [
      "It's 10am, and in a little over two hours, Wayne Hawkins will be dead.",
      "The sun is shining on the bungalow where the 80-year-old lives in San Diego, California with his wife of more than five decades, Stella.",
      "I knock on the door and meet his children - Emily, 48, and Ashley, 44 - who have spent the last two weeks at their father's side.",
      "Wayne sits in a reclining chair where he spends most of his days. Terminally ill, he is too weak to leave the house.",
      "He has invited BBC News to witness his death under California's assisted dying laws - if MPs in London vote to legalise the practice in England and Wales, it will allow some terminally ill people here to die in a similar way.",
      "Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing",
      "Half an hour after arriving at Wayne's house, I watch him swallow three anti-nausea tablets, designed to minimise the risk of him vomiting the lethal medication he plans to take shortly.",
      "Are you sure this day is your last, I ask him? \"I'm all in,\" he replies. \"I was determined and decided weeks ago - I've had no trepidation since then.\"",
      "His family ask for one last photo, which I take, and you can see at the top of this page. As usual, Stella and Wayne are holding hands.",
      "Shortly after, Dr Donnie Moore arrives. He has got to know the family over the past few weeks, visiting them on several occasions alongside running his own end-of-life clinic. Under California law, he is what is known as the attending physician who must confirm, in addition to a second doctor, that Wayne is eligible for aid in dying.",
      "Dr Moore's role is part physician, part counsellor in this situation, one he has been in for 150 assisted deaths before.",
      "On a top shelf in Wayne's bedroom sits a brown glass bottle containing a fine white powder - a mixture of five drugs, sedatives and painkillers, delivered to the house four weeks before. The dosage of drugs inside is hundreds of times higher than those used in regular healthcare and is \"guaranteed\" to be fatal, Dr Moore explains. Unlike California, the proposed law at Westminster would require a doctor to bring any such medication with them.",
      "When Wayne signals he is ready, the doctor mixes the meds with cherry and pineapple juice to soften the bitter taste - and he hands this pink liquid to Wayne.",
      "No one, not even the doctor, knows how long it will take him to die after taking the lethal drugs. Dr Moore explains to me that, in his experience, death usually occurs between 30 minutes and two hours of ingestion, but on one occasion it took 17 hours.",
      "This is the story of how and why Wayne chose to die. And why others have decided not to follow the same course.",
      "We first met the couple a few weeks earlier, when Wayne explained why he was going ahead with the decision to have an assisted death - a controversial measure in other parts of the world.",
      "\"Some days the pain is almost more than I can handle,\" he said. \"I just don't see any merit to dying slow and painfully, hooked up with stuff - intubation, feeding tubes,\" he told me. \"I want none of it.\"",
      "Wayne said he had watched two relatives die \"miserable\", \"heinous\" deaths from heart failure.",
      "\"I hate hospitals, they are miserable. I will die in the street first.\"",
      "Wayne met Stella in 1969; the couple married four years later. He told us it was something of an arranged marriage, as his mother kept inviting Stella for dinner until eventually the penny dropped that he should take her out.",
      "They lived for many years in Arcata, northern California, surrounded by sweeping forests of redwood trees, where Wayne worked as a landscape architect, while Stella was a primary school teacher. They spent their holidays hiking and camping with their children.",
      "Now Wayne is terminally ill with heart failure, which has already brought him close to death. He has myriad other health issues including prostate cancer, liver failure and sepsis which brings him serious spinal pain.",
      "He is expected to live less than six months, qualifying him for an assisted death in California. His request to die has been approved by two doctors and the lethal medication is self-administered.",
      "It was during our first meeting that he asked the BBC to return to observe his final day, saying he wanted terminally ill adults in the UK to have the same right to an assisted death as him.",
      "\"Britain is pretty good with freedoms and this is just another one,\" he said. \"People should be able to choose the time of their death as long as they meet the rules like six months to live or less.\"",
      "Stella, 78, supports his decision. \"I've known him for over 50 years. He's a very independent man. He's always known what he wants to do and he's always fixed things. That's how he's operating now. If this is his choice, I definitely agree, and I've seen him really suffer with the illness he's got. I don't want that for him.\"",
      "Wayne would also qualify under the proposed new assisted dying law in England and Wales. The measures return to the House of Commons later this month, when all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on changes to the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill.",
      "The proposed legislation, tabled by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, says that anyone who wants to end their life must have the mental capacity to make the choice, that they must be expected to die within six months, and must make two separate declarations - witnessed and signed - about their wish to die. They must satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible.",
      "MPs in Westminster voted in favour of assisted dying in principle last November but remain bitterly divided on the issue. If they ultimately decide to approve the bill, it could become law within the next year and come into practice within the next four years.",
      "A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line",
      "There are also divisions here in California, where assisted dying was introduced in 2016. Michelle and Mike Carter, both 72 and married for 43 years, are each being treated for cancer - Mike has prostate cancer that has spread to his lymph nodes, and Michelle's advanced terminal ovarian cancer has spread throughout much of her body.",
      "\"I held my mother's hand when she passed; I held my father's hand when he passed,\" Michelle told me. \"I believe there's freedom of choice however for me, I choose palliative care\u2026 I have God and I have good medicine.\"",
      "Michelle's physician, palliative care specialist Dr Vincent Nguyen, argued that assisted dying laws in the US state lead to \"silent coercion\" whereby vulnerable people think their only option is to die. \"Instead of ending people's lives, let's put programmes together to care for people,\" he said. \"Let them know that they're loved, they're wanted and they're worthy.\"",
      "He said the law meant that doctors have gone from being seen as healers to killers, while the message from the healthcare system was that \"you are better off dead, because you're expensive and your death is cheaper for us\".",
      "Some disability campaigners say assisted dying makes them feel unsafe. Ingrid Tischer, who has muscular dystrophy and chronic respiratory failure, told me: \"The message that it sends to people with disabilities in California is that you deserve suicide assistance rather than suicide prevention when you voice a desire to end your life.",
      "\"What does that say about who we are as a culture?\"",
      "Critics often say that once assisted dying is legalised, over time the safeguards around such laws get eroded as part of a \"slippery slope\" towards more relaxed criteria. In California, there was initially a mandatory 15-day cooling off period between patients making a first and second request for aid in dying. That has been reduced to 48 hours because many patients were dying during the waiting period. It's thought the approval process envisaged in Westminster would take around a month.",
      "'Goodbye,' Wayne tells his family",
      "Outside Wayne's house on the morning of his death, a solitary bird begins its loud and elaborate song. \"There's that mockingbird out there,\" Wayne tells Stella, as smiles flicker across their faces.",
      "Wayne hates the bird because it keeps him awake at night, Stella jokes, hand in hand with him to one side of his chair. Emily and Ashley are next to Stella.",
      "Dr Moore, seated on Wayne's other side, hands him the pink liquid which he swallows without hesitation. \"Goodnight,\" he says to his family - a typical touch of humour from a man who told us he was determined to die on his terms. It's 11.47am.",
      "After two minutes, Wayne says he is getting sleepy. Dr Moore asks him to imagine he is walking in a vast sea of flowers with a soft breeze on his skin, which seems appropriate for a patient who has spent much of his life among nature.",
      "After three minutes Wayne enters a deep sleep from which he will never wake. On a few occasions he lifts his head to take a deep breath without opening his eyes, at one point beginning to snore softly.",
      "Dr Moore tells the family this is \"the deepest sleep imaginable\" and reassures Emily there is no chance her dad will wake up and ask, \"did it work?\"",
      "\"Oh that would be just like him,\" Stella says with a laugh.",
      "The family start to reminisce about hiking holidays and driving around in a large van they converted to become a camper. \"Me and dad insulated it and put a bed in the back,\" says Ashley.",
      "On the walls are photos of Emily and Ashley as small children next to huge carved Halloween pumpkins.",
      "Dr Moore is still stroking Wayne's hand and occasionally checking his pulse. For a man who Emily says was \"always walking, always outdoors, always active\", these are the final moments of life's journey, spent surrounded by those who mean most to him.",
      "At 12.22pm Dr Moore says, \"I think he's passed\u2026 He's at peace now.\"",
      "Outside, the mockingbird has fallen silent. \"No more pain,\" says Stella, embracing her children in her arms.",
      "I step outside to give the family some space, and reflect on what we have just seen and filmed.",
      "I have been covering medical ethics for the BBC for more than 20 years. In 2006, I was present just outside an apartment in Zurich where Dr Anne Turner, a retired doctor, died with the help of the group Dignitas - but California was the first time I had been an eyewitness to an assisted death.",
      "This isn't just a story about one man's death in California - it's about what could become a reality here in England and Wales for those who qualify for an assisted death and choose to die this way.",
      "Whether you're for or against the proposed new Westminster law, the death of a loved one is a deeply personal and emotional time for a family. Each death leaves an imprint, as will Wayne's.",

    "story": [
      "Male fruit flies that drink alcohol become more attractive to females, according to a new study.",
      "Adding alcohol to males' food increases their release of chemicals that attract females and leads to higher mating success.",
      "Fruit flies, or Drosophila melanogaster, are often found around our food waste bins as they feed on rotting fruit which gradually produces alcohol.",
      "Scientists have been trying to study why they are attracted to alcohol and how it affects them.",
      "Previous research has studied different theories about this attraction, such as the flies were seeking a euphoric state or a substitute for the high of mating among males rejected by females.",
      "Study author Bill Hansson, head of the Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology at the Max Planck Institute, said such research has taken an anthropomorphic view of fly behaviour, whereas this latest study suggests drinking alcohol gives the flies a reproductive advantage.",
      "\"We don't think flies drink alcohol because they are depressed,\" he said.",
      "The fly's attraction both to the carbohydrates and yeast in rotting fruit, as well as to the alcohol, cannot be separated, he added.",
      "In the study, alcohol, and particularly methanol, increased the males' production and release of chemical sex signals, called pheromones, which made them more attractive to females.",
      "Pheromones are released into the air from one individual to influence the behaviour of another animal of the same species.",
      "Males were therefore strongly attracted to alcohol, especially those males which  had never mated.",
      "The new study also showed that the fly's response to smelling alcohol is controlled by three different neural circuits in its brain.",
      "While two are responsible for attracting male flies to small amounts of alcohol, a third ensures that excessive amounts have a deterrent effect.",
      "Because alcohol is toxic, the fly's brain must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of drinking it, and it does this by balancing signals of attraction with aversion.",
      "\"This means that the flies have a control mechanism that allows them to get all the benefits of alcohol consumption without risking alcohol intoxication,\" lead author Ian Keesey, of the University of Nebraska, said.",

      "The Environment Agency (EA) has launched a comprehensive review into shipments of waste tyres from the UK to India.",
      "Last week, BBC File on 4 Investigates heard that millions of these tyres - sent for recycling - were actually being \"cooked\" in makeshift furnaces, causing serious health problems and environmental damage.",
      "The pressure group Fighting Dirty has threatened legal proceedings against the EA over what it called a \"lack of action\" over the issue of tyre exports.",
      "The EA has asked the group to wait until its own review is complete, and it has also asked File on 4 Investigates to share the evidence from its investigation.",
      "The UK generates about 50 million waste tyres (nearly 700,000 tonnes) every year. According to official figures, about half of these are exported to India, supposedly to be recycled.",
      "But BBC File on 4 Investigates revealed that some 70% of tyres exported to India from the UK and the rest of the world are being sent to makeshift industrial plants, where they are \"cooked\" in order to extract steel, small amounts of oil as well as carbon black - a powder or pellet that can be used in various industries.",
      "Conditions at these plants - many of which are in rural backwaters - can be toxic and harmful to public health, as well as potentially dangerous.",
      "In January, two women and two children were killed in an explosion at a plant in the western state of Maharashtra, where European-sourced tyres were being processed.",

      "The campaigners from Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (WASP) and Save Windermere identified 140 illegal spill days in 2024, more than in any of the three previous years.",
      "United Utilities told BBC News that the campaigners' findings were \"inaccurate\" and some of the data \"erroneous\".",
      "The company declined to put in writing, despite repeated requests, any specific examples of mistakes or omissions.",
      "Regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency are both currently investigating United Utilities operations.",
      "Sewage dumped illegally in Windermere over 3 years",
      "Government vows to clean up England's largest lake",
      "Water firm behind spills says fixes will take time",
      "Part of the Lake District National Park Unesco World Heritage Site, Windermere is home to more than 14,000 people and its scenery attracts an estimated seven million visitors per year.",
      "But its pristine image is under threat. Regular discharges of sewage into Windermere have been blamed for increasing nutrient levels and turning parts of the lake green \u2013 so called \"algal blooming.\"",
      "The BBC has regularly reported on discharges into Windermere. Last October it was revealed that a single pumping station had illegally spilled more than 140 million litres of raw sewage between 2020 and 2023. In 2023 BBC Panorama said United Utilities was misreporting pollution incidents.",
      "Earlier in March environment secretary Steve Reed called the amount of pollution entering the lake \"a disgrace\" and pledged to clean it up.",
      "Last week the Environment Agency said United Utilities had spilled 77,817 times in 2024, the highest figure of all England's water companies.",
      "Many of the spills will have been legal. All water companies are legally allowed to discharge raw sewage to stop the network getting overwhelmed and this now happens regularly during periods of heavy rain.",
      "But almost all pumping stations and treatment plants operate under an environmental permit which specify that they must process or \"pass forward\" a certain amount of sewage and rainwater before spilling starts.",
      "The campaigners cross-referenced United Utilities datasets showing when an asset was spilling against how much sewage it was treating at the time. The campaigners' analysis \u2013 which has been shared with and scrutinised by the BBC -  found days when illegal spills appear to have occurred at each of six sewage facilities around the lake, which combined to 140 days in 2024. That's more than in any of the previous three years, as the chart below shows.",
      "The longest illegal spill the analysis identified was for 10 days from Hawkshead pumping station, which flows into Windermere via Cunsey Beck.",
      "\"This is an indication that their works have not been maintained properly or they're not being watched over properly,\" says Prof Peter Hammond, a mathematican and retired academic from campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution.",
      "Prof Hammond's analysis of water company data has been cited by regulators and he has been praised in Parliament by water company executives for bringing problems to light they were previously unaware of.",
      "The latest analysis covers four years of data from six sites that discharge sewage into the Lake Windermere catchment.",
      "Comparisons over a longer time period are impossible as United Utilities has only had made full data sets available since 2021.",
      "The regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency have since 2021 been investigating whether the water companies have been treating enough sewage before they start to spill. The EA call it a \"major criminal investigation\" while Ofwat call it \"the largest and most complex Ofwat has ever undertaken\".",
      "Last week Yorkshire Water agreed to a \u00a340m \"enforcement action\" after Ofwat uncovered \"serious failures\" in how it operated its treatment plant and network.",
      "Ofwat declined to comment on the campaigner's findings as their investigation into United Utilities is ongoing.",
      "In response to concerns about United Utilities the Environment Agency last year reviewed all of its environmental permits in the Windermere catchment and says this led directly to the water company tripling its investment plans for the area to \u00a3200m.",
      "\"We are currently carrying out investigations into suspected pollution incidents on the Windermere catchment and are unable to comment on these in detail until they have reached a conclusion,\" an EA spokesperson said when the campaigners' analysis was shared with them.",
      "\"Where we find breaches of environmental permits, we will take the appropriate enforcement action up to and including a criminal prosecution.\"",
      "United Utilities, which provides services to more than seven million people across north-west England, is more than \u00a39bn in debt. Its chief executive Louise Beardmore confirmed to parliament in February that she was last year paid \u00a31.4m including a bonus of \u00a3420,000.",
      "\"The methodology used by the campaigners is different to that used by the Environment Agency for its compliance assessments,\" the water company said in a statement.",
      "\"On top of that, erroneous data has been used, tags and naming conventions in data sets appear to have been misunderstood, and assumptions seem to have been made on whether different types of flow meters have been installed.\"",
      "\"The methodology fails to use other corroborating information from the sites which would prove that spills did not occur. As a result, the numbers quoted are inaccurate.\"",
      "BBC News presented United Utilities with five examples of illegal spills the campaigners' analysis had identified using the company's data and asked for any evidence or explanation as to why they were not illegal. United Utilities repeatedly declined to do so in writing or on camera.",
      "\"What we're seeing is the failure of privatisation. We're seeing a prioritisation of dividend returns over the long-term environmental protection of places like Windermere\" says Matt Staniek from Save Windermere.",
      "\"The bill payer has paid for a service that has never fully been provided, and the illegality demonstrates that for all to see.\"",
      "Over the next five years bills in the United Utilities area will go up by 32% above the rate of inflation. On average that will mean a rise of \u00a386 for the year that starts in April.",
      "Louise Beardmore said the rises will fund the \"largest investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in over 100 years\".",
      "For Windermere that's set to mean nine wastewater treatment works, including two that were included in the campaigners' analysis being upgraded and a reduction in the number of overflows discharging into the lake.",

      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",

      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",

      "US President Donald Trump has granted TikTok a second 75-day extension to comply with a law that requires the hugely popular video app to either sell its US operation or face a ban in the country.",
      "\"We do not want TikTok to 'go dark',\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal.\" The platform is currently owned by Chinese company ByteDance.",
      "Trump's first extension was granted after he took office in January and was set to expire on Saturday.",
      "The social media platform, which says it has more than 170 million users in the US, must close in the US under a law passed by Congress - unless a buyer is found.",
      "In a statement on Friday, ByteDance said it had been in discussion with the Trump administration, but \"an agreement has not been executed\".",
      "\"There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Former US President Joe Biden's administration had argued that TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.",
      "Congress passed a bipartisan law last year that gave ByteDance six months to sell its controlling stake in TikTok or see the app blocked in the US.",
      "Opponents of a ban have cited freedom of speech as a reason for keeping the platform open.",
      "The new extension comes as the Trump administration tries to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership, and keep the popular app running in the US.",

      "The unnamed source said the plan had been for Trump to sign an order initiating a 120-day period for closing the deal, allowing time to finish paperwork and secure financing.",
      "The agreement had won approval from existing investors, new investors, ByteDance, and the US government, but China backed out once Trump imposed the global import taxes, CBS reports.",
      "The Chinese embassy in Washington DC said in a statement that it \"opposed practices that violate the basic principles of the market economy\".",
      "China faces a 54% aggregate tariff on goods imported into the US, and has retaliated with 34% in counter tariffs.",
      "Reports suggest several potential buyers for TikTok have cropped up in recent days.",

      "Vice-President JD Vance is spearheading the administration's effort to find a buyer.",
      "The president has also suggested the US could offer a deal where China agrees to approve a TikTok sale in exchange for relief from US tariffs on Chinese imports.",
      "\"We hope to continue working in Good Faith with China, who I understand are not very happy about our Reciprocal Tariffs,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "He added that the trade levies are \"the most powerful economic tool, and every important to our national security\"."

      "Nintendo has been the talk of the gaming world this week after it finally unveiled details of the much-anticipated Nintendo Switch 2, the sequel to the third-best selling console ever made.",
      "Despite excitement over its upcoming launch in June, fan conversations have been dominated by one topic - the price of its games.",
      "The console itself is priced similarly to its rivals - Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X.",
      "But the games are a different story: Mario Kart World, which is being launched alongside the Switch 2, comes in at \u00a374.99.",
      "\"It makes it inaccessible, it's a lot to drop on one game,\" said Chloe Crossan, one of several gamers the BBC spoke to at a gaming store in Glasgow.",
      "I played the \u00a375 Mario Kart World on Switch 2 - was it worth it?",
      "She told the BBC she was excited about the console and its various games, but was concerned about the cost involved.",
      "\"I guess you could argue you're paying for a game that four people could play,\" she said.",
      "\"So there is that element - but it is \u00a375 for a game which is a lot.\"",
      "It's not expected that all of the Switch 2's titles will be so expensive - but charging so much for its best-known game still represents a big change in Nintendo's pricing strategy.",
      "It also risks confusing customers, as the same games can be purchased for different amounts depending on whether they are buying the physical game or the digital-only version.",
      "Experts don't think Mario Kart World will be a one off.",
      "Christopher Dring, editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Game Business, said he expected to see price rises elsewhere too - particularly for the most anticipated titles, such as the latest edition of the Grand Theft Auto franchise.",
      "\"I think if you're going see a game that's going to be able to charge more, look out for when GTA 6 gets a release date later in the year,\" he said.",
      "He says there are lots of reasons prices might go up, part of which is that modern games are a lot of work.",
      "\"These games are taking longer to make, they require more people to make them,\" he said.",
      "But there's also the fact, he says, that video game prices have not kept up with inflation.",
      "\"I bought N64 games for \u00a350 in the turn of the century and that's \u00a380 today,\" he pointed out.",
      "For some time developers have got round that by monetising transactions in games and relying more on cheaper digital downloads.",
      "But that process, Mr Dring says, is running out of road.",
      "\"That growth has started to slow, so they're now relying on price increases.\"",
      "But it's clear those kinds of prices won't put everyone off.",
      "Another gamer the BBC spoke to, Kathryn Brown, said she and her family were excited about the Switch 2 - even if it was \"more expensive than usual\".",
      "\"If it gets good reviews, and I wait until people have bought it first, then we'll think about it,\" she said.",
      "And Lewis Tocher - who's had the original Switch since the day it launched - said he would get the console as soon as he could afford it, despite the cost of the games.",
      "But he said considering the cost of game development nowadays, he was \"surprised\" it hadn't gone up in price sooner.",
      "But what will retailers make of it?",
      "Mr Dring told the BBC this was the first time a console's physical and digital games were being priced differently.",
      "He said that could be a real blow for the people who sell the physical games.",
      "\"When a Nintendo Switch game releases, around 80% of its sales are in a box - if you compare that to Xbox, around 80% of new game sales are digital.",
      "\"By charging more for the physical copy it's going to encourage people to download more, which will be good for Nintendo's bottom line.\"",
      "But of course it will be worse for the retailers who miss out on sales of the physical game.",
      "The price of failure",
      "One thing Nintendo will be hoping to avoid replicating is the disastrous launch of its handheld 3DS in 2011.",
      "It came hot off the heels of the DS, the best-selling handheld in history, with fans seemingly desperate for an upgrade.",
      "But the price tag of over \u00a3200 - more than double that of the original handheld - sparked consternation amongst fans who weren't willing to shell out so much for it.",
      "Within six months, Nintendo had slashed the price by almost half, and over time it picked up traction.",
      "It is fair to say the 3DS faced other problems such as a lacklustre list of launch games, whereas the Switch 2 is launching with the first Mario Kart game in a decade.",
      "Nonetheless Nintendo has form with price decisions backfiring.",
      "The N64 launched at \u00a3250 back in 1997, and within a year it had tumbled down to \u00a399.",
      "And in 2002 the firm cut \u00a321 off it widely-expected \u00a3150 price for the GameCube just two weeks before its launch.",
      "By bringing back the likes of Mario and Donkey Kong for the Switch 2, Nintendo has consciously looked to the past with its new console.",

      "According to industry expert Christopher Dring, these wallet-emptying prices are down to the costs involved in manufacturing - and President Donald Trump's tariff blitz.",
      "\u201cThese cartridges are exclusively made in Japan, which is a country that's just been hit with a 24% tariff from the US Government, and the threat of those tariffs may have impacted Nintendo's pricing decisions globally,\u201d he said.",

      "But there\u2019s more to the Switch 2 than Mario Kart.",
      "Fans will no doubt have been excited to see the hotly anticipated Metroid Prime 4,  the first game in the series in 18 years.",
      "But while they will be familiar with the typical way of playing - moving and aiming with joysticks and shooting with the \"A\" button - there\u2019s a significant new feature too.",
      "At any point in the game you can rotate the controller, put it on a surface and use it like a mouse. Fans of PC games will immediately feel at home with this, and it's a neat bit of engineering to be able to switch up on-the-fly without having to enter any menus.",
      "The optical mouse controls pop up elsewhere too, with PC strategy game Civilization VII a game that massively benefits.",
      "But in both cases, I do wonder how long you can play with the controller like this before the ergonomics become an issue. I have to admit I found myself wondering why I wasn't just playing on my PC with mouse controls and a comfortable resting position.",
      "Still, the fact that this is built in to the hardware means we may see the Switch 2 as the obvious home of future PC ports to home consoles.",
      "And there is another trick up Nintendo\u2019s sleeve - both controllers can be held like this and used as mice, opening up some interesting possibilities. In particular, futuristic wheelchair basketball game Drag x Drive, where both \"mice\" are pushed to mimic moving wheels.",
      "Elsewhere, Donkey Kong Bananza will be the first time the ape mascot has had a 3D platforming game of his own in 25 years, so there was some pressure on Nintendo to deliver a game which justified the wait.",
      "For lack of a better term it\u2019s a destruct-em-up - you can destroy much of the floor and scenery in each level.",
      "But there's that dreaded price news again. A digital copy will cost \u00a358.99, while a physical copy retails at \u00a366.99.",
      "It seems Nintendo has a lot to offer Switch fans - but it will be taking a fair bit from them too.",
      "Rivals and originals",
      "Some other titles I got to see in action were updated versions of Cyberpunk 2077 and Yakuza 0 - both of which big hitters on rival consoles which were deemed too complex to run on the original Switch.",

      "The original Switch created the genre of the hybrid console - one which works on a TV and as a portable system.",
      "But since that launch in 2017, things have changed a bit.",
      "Now, it has a rival in the Steam Deck, a hybrid machine with the power to play most PC games.",
      "Nintendo would say something its rivals don\u2019t have is that long list of exclusive titles.",
      "But there is a bit of a theme here: Nintendo has consciously gone for continuity.",

      "I had great experiences with these games in the 20 minutes I had with them.",
      "But for fans to get value for those high prices they will want something that holds up over weeks and months of gameplay.",

      "These scenes were live streamed to thousands more on YouTube - a platform popular with not just Yoon's supporters but the president himself.",
      "A disgraced Yoon is now stripped of his power, but he leaves behind an ever more divided South Korea.",
      "Last December, Yoon's shock martial law declaration cost him the confidence of much of the country. But among his supporters, his ongoing legal troubles have only further buttressed the image of a wronged saviour.",
      "Many of them echo narratives peddled by influential right-wing YouTubers who support Yoon: that martial law was necessary to protect the country from pro-North Korea opposition lawmakers and a dangerously powerful opposition, and that Yoon's conservative party was a victim of election fraud.",

      "From the outset Yoon embraced right-wing YouTubers, inviting some of them to his inauguration in 2022.",
      "In January, as he defied attempts to arrest him, the president told supporters that he was watching their rallies on YouTube livestream. PPP lawmakers said Yoon had urged them to consume \"well-organised information on YouTube\" instead of \"biased\" legacy media.",
      "Entwined on these YouTube channels are narratives of the opposition Democratic Party being obsequious to Beijing and trying to curry favour with Pyongyang.",
      "After the Democratic Party won at the polls by a landslide last April, some of these channels claimed that Yoon was a victim of electoral interference led by China, and that North Korea sympathisers lurking among the opposition were behind the ruling party's defeat. Similar claims were echoed by Yoon when he tried to justify his short-lived martial law declaration.",

One of them runs A Stroke of Genius, one of the largest pro-Yoon YouTube channels with 1.6 million subscribers.

While conservatives in South Korea have been \"very divided and feeble\" over the last decade, he says, Yoon is \"now more popular with them than he was before he tried to introduce martial law\".",
      "This solidarity has likely been fuelled by a shared dislike of the opposition, which has launched multiple attempts to impeach members of Yoon's cabinet, pushed criminal investigations against Yoon and his wife, and used its parliamentary majority to impeach Yoon's replacement Han Duck-soo.",
      "\"I think the opposition party's power in the assembly went to its head,\" says Mr Breen. \"Now they've shot themselves in the foot.\"",

      "\"By driving his insurrection attempt into the centre of Korean politics, Yoon has effectively executed a decade's worth of polarisation.\""

    "summary": "The BBC's Hugo Bachega explores the future for Hezbollah in the wake of Israel's devastating attacks.",
    "story": [
      "Last year, on 17 September, at around 15:30, a pager which a nurse called Adam was given at the start of his shift at a hospital in Lebanon received a message. The devices had been distributed by Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim group, to thousands of its members, including Adam, and he said it was how he and his colleagues expected to be alerted of emergencies or a disaster.",
      "\"The pager started beeping non-stop and, on the screen, it said 'alert',\" Adam, who did not want to use his real name for safety reasons, said. The text appeared to have been sent by the group's leadership. To read it, he had to press two buttons, simultaneously, with both hands. Adam did it many times, but the beeps continued. \"Then suddenly, as I was sitting at my desk,\" he said, \"the pager exploded\".",
      "On his phone, Adam showed me a video of the room, filmed by a colleague minutes after he was rescued. There was a trail of blood on the floor. \"I tried to crawl to the door because I had locked it while I changed my clothes,\" he said. The blast had opened a hole in the wood desk. I noticed a beige-like object. \"That's my finger,\" he said.",
      "Hezbollah is known for being a powerful militia and is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. But in Lebanon, it is also a significant political movement with representation in parliament and a social organisation. Here, being a Hezbollah member does not necessarily mean you are a fighter. In fact, many are not. Adam told me he had never been one. People can work in the group's large array of institutions that include hospitals and emergency services, for example.",
      "Hezbollah had decided to equip members with low-tech pagers for communicating rather than smartphones which it feared could be used by Israel, its arch-enemy, to gather sensitive information about the group. It turned out, though, that the devices which Hezbollah had distributed were part of a years-long elaborate Israeli plan: an explosive compound had been concealed within the pagers, waiting to be activated \u2013 and that is what happened on that day.",
      "In the attack, Adam, who is 38, lost his thumb and two fingers on his left hand, and part of a finger on the other. He was blinded in his right eye, which has been replaced with a glass eye, and has only partial sight in the other. He showed me a picture of him in a hospital bed, taken an hour after the explosion, with his face burned, entirely blooded, covered with bandages. Despite his wounds, Adam remained committed to Hezbollah. I asked him how he felt when he looked at himself like that. \"Very good,\" he said in English. Then, in Arabic, he told me: \"Because we believe that the wounds are a kind of medal from God. Honouring what we go through fighting a righteous cause.\"",
      "But the group is no longer the force it was since being dealt a devastating blow in Israel's bombing campaign and invasion of Lebanon, which followed the pager attacks, and faces serious challenges. At home, there is discontent among some supporters over the lack of funds for reconstruction, while the new government has vowed to disarm the group. In neighbouring Syria, the ouster of Bashar al-Assad's regime has disrupted the route used by Iran, its main supporter, for the supply of weapons and money.",
      "I visited communities in southern Lebanon that were destroyed by Israel's attacks, and saw that support for Hezbollah appeared undimmed. But, in views rarely expressed to media, others who backed it said the war had been a mistake, and even questioned the group's future as a military force.",
      "You can listen to more from Hugo in his radio documentary - Crossing Continents: Hezbollah in trouble - here",
      "Hezbollah, or Party of God, was created in the 1980s in response to Israel's occupation of Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war. To this day, the destruction of Israel remains one of its official goals. Their last war had been in 2006, which was followed by years of relative calm. Violence flared up again in 2023 after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. When Israel started bombarding Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel, saying it was acting in support of Palestinians. Israel responded with air strikes on southern Lebanon, and tens of thousands of people were forced to flee on both sides of the border.",
      "The pager attacks were a turning point in what had been, until then, an intensifying but relatively contained conflict. The devices exploded as people were working, shopping or at home. About a dozen people, including two children, were killed, and thousands wounded, many of them maimed. The attack caused anger in Lebanon, because of what was seen as its indiscriminate nature. A day later, walkie-talkies used by the group suddenly exploded too. I was at a funeral of some of the victims of the pagers when there was a loud blast. Hezbollah members, desperate, asked us to turn off our cameras or phones, as no-one knew what else could explode.",
      "In the following weeks, Israel carried out a relentless bombing campaign and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Across the country, around 4,000 people were killed and almost 18,000 others wounded. For Hezbollah, the conflict proved to be catastrophic. The group's top leaders were assassinated, many of its fighters killed and much of its arsenal destroyed. Among the dead was Hassan Nasrallah, who had been the head of Hezbollah for more than 30 years, assassinated in a massive air strike on the group's secret headquarters under apartment blocks in the Dahieh, where Hezbollah is based in Beirut.",
      "At the end of November, battered, the group agreed on a ceasefire that was essentially a surrender.",
      "Southern Lebanon is the heartland of Lebanon's Shia Muslim community, which is the bulk of Hezbollah's support base, and one of the regions of the country where the group has traditionally had a significant presence. I travelled to the border town of Kfar Kila, which had a pre-war population of 15,000 and was one of the first to fall when Israel invaded. Israel's stated war goal was to allow the return of residents to its northern communities, which had been emptied because of Hezbollah's attacks. In Kfar Kila, there was almost nothing left standing, and yellow Hezbollah flags dotted the huge piles of broken concrete and twisted metal.",
      "A 37-year-old woman called Alia had come with her husband and three daughters, aged 18, 14 and 10. The youngest was wearing a badge with a smiley picture of Nasrallah. \"I only knew that this was my house because of the remains of this plant over there, the roses, and this tree,\" Alia told me. From the street, she pointed at what she could identify in the rubble. \"This is the couch. There, the curtains. That was the living room. And that was the bedroom. That's my daughter's bicycle,\" she said. \"There's nothing to recover\".",
      "According to the World Bank, costs related to reconstruction and recovery are estimated at $11bn (\u00a38.5bn) across the country. One of Hezbollah's immediate challenges is to give financial help to people affected by the war, which is crucial to keep supporters on board. Those who lost their houses have received $12,000 to cover for a year's rent. But the group has not promised money to rebuild what was destroyed or to give compensation for destroyed businesses. The limited support is already fuelling discontent. Aila's shop had stock worth $20,000, and she was concerned no-one would cover her losses.",
      "Iran, Hezbollah's backer, is one of the group's main sources of funds, weapons and training. But Lebanon's international allies want to cut off any financial support from Iran, to put even more pressure on Hezbollah, and say there will be no help if the Lebanese government does not act against Hezbollah. With the group weakened militarily, critics see this as a unique opportunity to disarm it.",
      "Alia told me: \"We don't want any aid that comes with conditions about our arms... We won't allow them to take our dignity, our honour, take away our arms just for us to build a house. We'll build it ourselves.\"",
      "It is not surprising that Hezbollah's supporters remain defiant. For many, the group is a fundamental part of their lives, essential in their identities. But Hezbollah's power is seen - and felt - beyond its base. Before the war, its military wing was considered to be stronger than the Lebanese national army. A solid parliamentary bloc means that virtually no major decision has been possible without Hezbollah's consent. Because of Lebanon's fractured political system, the group has representation in the government. In short, Hezbollah has had the ability to paralyse the state, and many times has done so.",
      "But the war has diminished the group's domestic position too. In January, the Lebanese parliament elected a new president, former army chief Joseph Aoun, after a two-year impasse that critics had blamed on Hezbollah. In the past, its MPs and allies would walk out of the chamber when a vote was scheduled. But Hezbollah, severely wounded and with its communities in need of help, felt it could no longer block the process, which was seen as vital to unlock some international support. In his inauguration speech, Aoun promised to make the Lebanese army the sole carrier of weapons in the country. He did not mention Hezbollah, but everyone understood the message.",
      "Ultimately, Hezbollah's future may lie with Iran. One of the reasons for Iran to have a strong Hezbollah in Lebanon was to deter any Israeli attack, especially on its nuclear facilities. This is now gone. Other groups backed by Iran in the region, part of what it calls the Axis of Resistance, have also been significantly weakened, including Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen. And the fall of the Assad regime in Syria has interrupted Iran's land corridor to Lebanon - and Hezbollah. Even if Iran decides to rearm Hezbollah, it will not be easy.",
      "Nasrallah has been succeeded by Naim Qassem, his former deputy, who is not seen as charismatic or influential. From time to time, rumours emerge of internal disagreements. And whispers of dissent among the rank and file are spreading. In southern Lebanon, I met a businessman who did not want to have his name published, fearing that he could become a target on social media. On the wall of his office, he had pictures of Hezbollah's leaders. Now, he was critical of the group.",
      "\"The mistakes have been huge,\" he said. \"Hezbollah decided to engage in a war to support Gaza without proper calculations, without consulting the people or the Lebanese state\". (To date, Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.) He told me a lot of supporters shared his view. \"If Hezbollah don't do a proper reassessment of the situation... they will destroy themselves and harm us along the way. We brought this destruction on ourselves, and we're now suffering\".",
      "As part of the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah agreed to remove its weapons and fighters from southern Lebanon, and a Western diplomatic official told me the group had largely done it. Israel was required to withdraw its troops, but has remained in five positions, saying this is needed for the safety of its border communities. The Israeli military has also carried out air strikes on targets and people it says are linked to Hezbollah. Lebanon says the Israeli permanence in Lebanese territory and its attacks are violations of the deal.",
      "Discussions about Hezbollah's disarmament are likely to be difficult and long. A source familiar with the group told me one of the options was for Hezbollah's arsenal, believed to still include long-range missiles, to be put under the control of the state, while its fighters, estimated to be several thousand, could be integrated into the Lebanese army.",
      "The businessman told me: \"A lot of the families, especially those of wounded and martyred fighters, are totally dependent on Hezbollah. These people won't disengage from Hezbollah immediately\u2026 Without a plan, it would be a recipe for internal conflict. It would drive Lebanese to fight against each other\".",
      "For weeks, I tried to interview a representative from Hezbollah, but no-one was made available.",
      "Adam, the pager casualty, has now returned to his work as a nurse. He no longer does nightshifts, however, as he cannot see well. The explosion also left shrapnel in his head and chest. As he gets tired easily, he needs to take constant breaks to rest. Physiotherapy sessions are helping him adapt to using what is left of his left thumb and middle finger.",
      "Prominent in his living room, is a picture he framed, of himself, with his injured hands, holding a pager. He shared with me another picture, of his maimed hand, only now it also bore a tattooed message which expressed that his wounds were a cheap sacrifice in honour of Nasrallah, the late Hezbollah leader. He, like many, still believes in the group's purpose, and the role it plays.",

    "summary": "Far-right activist Laura Loomer, who met with Trump on Wednesday, said Gen Timothy Haugh was fired because he was \"disloyal\".",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has fired the head of both the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command, the BBC's US partner CBS has reported.",
      "The removal of General Timothy Haugh comes amid what appears to be a wider purge of top security officials at the agency and at the White House.",
      "Democrats have said they are \"deeply disturbed\" by the move and say it jeopardises  national security.",
      "It is not clear why Gen Haugh was removed, but it comes after a meeting between President Donald Trump and far-right activist Laura Loomer on Wednesday.",
      "Ms Loomer reportedly urged Trump to fire specific employees whom she suspected lacked support for his agenda.",
      "She posted on X that Gen Haugh and his deputy Wendy Noble, who US media reported was also sacked, \"have been disloyal to President Trump. That is why they have been fired.\"",
      "Trump, meanwhile, has denied that Ms Loomer played a role in the firings.",
      "Before the firings were reported, Trump told reporters he would get rid of any staff deemed to be disloyal.",
      "\"We're always going to let go of people \u2013 people we don't like or people that take advantage of, or people that may have loyalties to someone else,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.",
      "When asked whether Ms Loomer played a role, he said: \"No, not at all.\"",
      "Trump made the comments as reports emerged of the firings of at least three other officials at the White House National Security Council (NSC), following the reported meeting with Ms Loomer. The president did not confirm names.",
      "The National Security Agency (NSA) referred the BBC to the Office of the Secretary of Defense Public Affairs for comment, which said on Friday it had seen the reports but had nothing to offer at this time, and would provide more information when it became available.",
      "The White House previously told the BBC that the NSC \"won't comment on personnel\" matters.",
      "The top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees - Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence - disclosed Gen Haugh's firing to CBS.",
      "Himes said in a statement that he was \"deeply disturbed\" by the decision, CBS reported.",
      "\"I have known General Haugh to be an honest and forthright leader who followed the law and put national security first \u2014 I fear those are precisely the qualities that could lead to his firing in this Administration,\" Himes said.",
      "Those fired from the NSC on Thursday included Brian Walsh, a director for intelligence; Thomas Boodry, a senior director for legislative affairs; and David Feith, a senior director overseeing technology and national security, CBS reported.",
      "It was not clear if Gen Haugh and Ms Noble's removals were connected to those at the NSC.",
      "The firings follow a major controversy involving the NSC last month when senior officials inadvertently added a journalist to a Signal messaging thread about military strikes in Yemen.",
      "Gen Haugh, who was not on the Signal chat, testified on Capitol Hill last week about the leak.",
      "The extent to which that controversy played a role in the firings is unclear.",
      "Trump has so far stood by top officials involved in the incident, including National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who took responsibility for the Atlantic magazine reporter being added to the Signal chat, and said it was an accident.",
      "According to CBS, a source familiar with the situation said the Signal incident \"opened the door\" to looking into staff members believed not to be sufficiently aligned with Trump, while Ms Loomer's visit sealed the fate for those who were terminated.",
      "The administration has been looking at outside meetings held by national security staff, reprimanding some for meeting people not believed to be aligned with the president, according to the source.",
      "Aboard Air Force One en route to Miami, Florida, on Thursday, Trump praised Ms Loomer and confirmed he had met with her, calling her a \"great patriot\" and a \"very strong person\".",
      "\"She makes recommendations\u2026 sometimes I listen to those recommendations,\" he said. \"I listen to everybody and then I make a decision.\"",
      "In a phone call with the BBC, Ms Loomer said it would be \"inappropriate\" to divulge details of her meeting with Trump on Wednesday.",
      "\"It was a confidential meeting,\" she said. \"It's a shame that there are still leakers at the White House who leaked this information.\"",
      "She texted a statement that said: \"It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my research findings.",
      "\"I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of STRONG VETTING, for the sake of protecting the President of the United States of America and our national security.\"",
      "Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, who posted information in the chat, is now the subject of an internal review into his use of Signal and whether he complied with his department's policies, the Pentagon's office of the acting inspector general said on Thursday.",
      "Inspector general offices routinely conduct independent investigations and audits of federal agencies, and look into possible security breaches.",
      "Upon returning to the White House in January, Trump removed many of the government's inspectors general and has installed acting heads of the watchdogs at the defence, commerce, labour and health departments.",
      "On Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi was asked at an event in Florida whether she would also investigate the incident. She said she had not discussed the matter with the president and the incident was being reviewed internally.",
      "\"Nothing has been referred to us,\" she said. \"These are intelligence agencies, and they are reviewing it internally.\"",

    "story": [
      "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has dismissed accusations that Washington was left unable to help in the Myanmar earthquake due to the Donald Trump administration's shuttering of its humanitarian aid agency.",
      "Asked by the BBC why the US had not meaningfully responded, as it routinely has to past such disasters, Rubio said \"we are not the government of the world\".",
      "Earlier this week, former officials at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) said the US was left unable to send rescuers and dogs due to the agency's dismantling.",
      "Rubio said the US had to balance global humanitarian rescue work with \"other needs\" and \"other priorities\" that were in the US national interests.",
      "\"There's a lot of other rich countries in the world, they should all be pitching in.",
      "\"We're going to do our part. We already have people there. We'll have more people there. We'll help as much as we can [but] it's not the easiest place to work\u2026 they have a military junta that doesn't like us,\" Rubio said.",
      "On Tuesday, a former USAID official told the BBC the shuttering of the agency, led by the billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, meant the White House could not send teams from the US to save lives in the immediate aftermath of the 28 March magnitude 7.7 earthquake.",
      "The confirmed death toll rose to 3,354 on 4 April, Myanmar's ruling military said. The number of injured stood at 4,508, while 220 were still missing.",
      "Routinely in such earthquakes, the US can deploy up to 200 rescue workers and sniffer dogs along with specialist equipment, and is often the biggest and best equipment foreign response team on the ground.",
      "Last week, the state department said a US team of three advisers based in the region was being sent to disaster zone.",
      "Speaking to reporters at a Nato meeting in Brussels,  Rubio blamed the military regime in Myanmar for the lack of access, even though the state department said earlier this week the country had made a formal request for assistance.",
      "Former USAID officials say their work is seen as non-political, and they have previously accessed countries regarded as politically hostile.",
      "\"That would have impeded our response, no matter what,\" said Rubio.",
      "\"That said, we are willing to continue to help in the humanitarian crisis. Other countries need to do so as well. China is a very rich country. India is a rich country. There are a lot of other countries in the world, and everyone should pitch in.\"",
      "China and India were among the first to have teams on the ground in Myanmar, according to former American humanitarian officials.",
      "Rubio dismissed the accounts of humanitarian aid experts who said the inability to deploy a large US rescue team was due to the USAID cuts.",
      "\"These are people that make millions and hundreds of millions of dollars in these NGOs [non-governmental organisations] all over the world that stand up and they get flooded with the US taxpayer money, and then we have to spend 10 [or] 100 million dollars to get 10 million to people. We're not doing that anymore. Okay? We have stopped. We are no longer going to spend 10 million, 100 million dollars to get 10 million to recipients.",
      "\"We're not going to fund these global NGOs all over the world that are living off of this. We're not doing it.",
      "\"We are prepared to help and work with governments and appropriate NGOs on the ground that are delivering assistance. We will be there, and we will be helpful [but] there are a lot of other rich countries, they should also pitch in and help\u2026 we are going to do our part,\" Rubio added.",
      "As news of the Myanmar earthquake emerged, the White House had reportedly tried to deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) from the US - but could not do so because the Trump administration's cuts had cancelled logistics contracts and fired officials who oversaw such deployments, according to the former officials.",
      "The cuts to USAID had been led by Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) after President Trump targeted foreign assistance on his first day in office, calling it an \"industry\" that was in many cases \"antithetical to American values\".",

      "The court has faced similar challenges in the past and continues to function with broad international support.",
      "But Hungary's criticism of the ICC as \"politically biased\" and its decision to withdraw as Netanyahu visits may set a precedent for other nations to question or abandon their commitments to international justice based on political alliances or disagreements with specific rulings.",
      "The US, Russia, China and North Korea are among the nations that are not part of the ICC, and therefore do not recognise its jurisdiction.",
      "Israel is also not part of the treaty, but the ICC ruled in 2021 that it did have jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, because the UN's Secretary General had accepted that Palestinians were a member.",
      "Hungary now needs to send written notification to the UN Secretary General to leave the treaty, with the withdrawal taking effect one year later, according to article 127 of the Rome Statute, which established the ICC.",
      "ICC spokesman Fadi El-Abdullah told the BBC: \"On the visit of Mr Netanyahu, the court has followed its standard procedures, after the issuance of an arrest warrant. The court recalls that Hungary remains under a duty to cooperate with the ICC.\"",
      "Since the warrant was issued, Hungarian authorities should technically arrest Netanyahu and hand him over to the court in the Hague, although member states do not always choose to enforce ICC warrants.",
      "In Europe, some ICC member states said they would arrest the Israeli leader if he set foot in their country, while others, including Germany, announced that Netanyahu would not be detained if he visited.",
      "But Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Thursday Hungary's announcement was \"a bad day for international criminal law\".",
      "\"Europe has clear rules that apply to all EU member states, and that is the Rome Statute. I have made it clear time and again that no one in Europe is above the law and that applies to all areas of law,\" she added.",
      "On the other side of the Atlantic, the US has condemned the ICC's decision to issue warrants for Netanyahu's arrest and he has visited the country since it was issued in November. His visit to Hungary marks Netanyahu's first trip to Europe since then.",
      "Hungarian Defence Minister Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky, greeted Netanyahu on the tarmac of Budapest airport on Wednesday night, welcoming him to the country.",
      "Israel is appealing against the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and strongly rejects the accusations. It both denies the authority of the ICC and the legitimacy of the warrants.",
      "Netanyahu said at the time that it was a \"dark day in the history of humanity\", and that the ICC had become \"the enemy of humanity\".",
      "\"It's an antisemitic step that has one goal - to deter me, to deter us from having our natural right to defend ourselves against enemies who try to destroy us,\" he said.",
      "In the same ruling, ICC judges also issued a warrant against Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, who Israel says is dead. Hamas also rejected the allegations.",
      "The visit comes as Israel announced it was expanding its Gaza offensive and establishing a new military corridor to put pressure on Hamas, as deadly Israeli strikes continued across the Palestinian territory.",
      "The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed some 1,200 people and led to 251 hostages being taken to Gaza. Since then, Israeli military attacks have killed more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza say."

    "story": [
      "Social media influencers pose a \"new and increasing threat\" for uncontacted indigenous people, a charity has warned after the arrest of a US tourist who travelled to a restricted Indian Ocean island.",
      "Mykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov, 24, allegedly landed on North Sentinel Island in an apparent attempt to make contact with the isolated Sentinelese tribe, filming his visit and leaving a can of coke and a coconut on the shore.",
      "Survival International, a group that advocates for the rights of tribal people, said the alleged act endangered the man's own life and the lives of the tribe, calling it \"deeply disturbing\".",
      "The US said it was aware and \"monitoring the situation\".",
      "Andaman and Nicobar Islands' police chief HGS Dhaliwal told news agency AFP that \"an American citizen\" had been presented before the local court and was remanded for three days for \"further interrogation\".",
      "AFP, citing Mr Dhaliwal, said Mr Polyakov blew a whistle off the shore of the island in a bid to attract the attention of the tribe for about an hour.",
      "He then landed for about five minutes, leaving his offerings, collecting samples and recording a video.",
      "The police chief told AFP: \"A review of his GoPro camera footage showed his entry and landing into the restricted North Sentinel Island.\"",
      "It is illegal for foreigners or Indians to travel within 5km (three miles) of the islands in order to protect the people living there.",
      "According to police, Mr Polyakov has visited the region twice before - including using an inflatable kayak in October last year before he was stopped by hotel staff.",
      "On his arrest earlier this week, the man told police he was a \"thrill seeker\", Indian media reported.",
      "Survival International said the Sentinelese have made their wish to avoid outsiders clear over many years and underlined that such visits pose a threat to a community which has no immunity to outside diseases.",
      "Jonathan Mazower, spokesperson for Survival International, told the BBC they feared social media was adding to the list of threats for uncontacted tribal people. Several media reports have linked Mr Polyakov to a YouTube account, which features videos of a recent trip to Afghanistan.",
      "\"As well as all the somewhat more established threats to such peoples - from things like logging and mining in the Amazon where most uncontacted peoples live - there are now an increasing number of... influencers who are trying to do this kind of thing for followers,\" Mr Mazower said.",
      "\"There's a growing social media fascination with this whole idea.\"",
      "Survival International describes the Sentinelese as \"the most isolated Indigenous people in the world\" living on an island around the size of Manhattan.",
      "Mr Mazower told the BBC an estimated 200 people belong to the tribe, before adding it was \"impossible\" to know its true number.",
      "Few details are known about the group, other than they are a hunter-gatherer community who live in small settlements and are \"extremely healthy\", he said.",
      "He added that the incident highlighted why government protections for communities such as the Sentinelese are so important.",
      "The UN's Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention sets out obligations for governments to protect affected people's rights. India's government has an initiative focusing on tribal welfare, but the country has come under criticism in recent years for failing to protect against evictions.",
      "It is not the first time an outsider has attempted to make contact with the Sentinelese.",
      "In November 2018, John Allen Chau, also a US national, was killed by the tribe after visiting the same island.",
      "Local officials said the 27-year-old was a Christian missionary.",
      "Mr Chau was shot with bows and arrows upon landing. Reports at the time suggested he had bribed fishermen to take him to the island.",

    "summary": "The Spanish government is moving to make renting more affordable and boost the supply of homes.",
    "story": [
      "Blanca Castro puts on a builder's helmet before opening the door to her kitchen. Inside it, the ceiling has a large hole that is dripping water and it looks as if it could collapse at any moment.",
      "Because the kitchen is unusable, Blanca has to wash her dishes in the bathtub, and she has improvised a cooking area with a gas camping stove in a corner of her living room.",
      "Many of her fellow tenants in this apartment block near Madrid's Atocha railway station have similar problems. They say the company that owns the building has stopped responding to requests for basic maintenance in recent months, since informing them that it will not renew their rental contracts.",
      "\"The current rental bubble is encouraging a lot of big owners to do what they are doing here,\" says Blanca. \"Which is to get rid of the current tenants who have been here a long time, in order to have short-term tourist flats, or simply to hike up the rent.\"",
      "Blanca and her fellow tenants have vowed to stay in the building despite what they see as efforts to push them out by the owners, who were not available for comment for this article.",
      "The tenancy contracts last five years, during which time rent is fixed, but this area of central Madrid has seen housing costs soar in recent years.",
      "\"For another home like this [in this area], I'd have to pay double or more what I'm paying now,\" says Blanca. \"It's not viable.\"",
      "She and her neighbours are among millions of Spaniards who are suffering the consequences of a housing crisis caused by spiralling rental costs.",
      "While salaries have increased by around 20% over the past decade, the average rental in Spain has doubled during the same period. There has been an 11% increase over the last year alone, according to figures provided by property portal Idealista, and housing has become Spaniards' biggest worry.",
      "It's also generating anger, with Spaniards taking to the streets to demand action from the authorities to make housing more affordable. On Saturday, 5 April thousands of people are expected to protest in Madrid and dozens of other cities.",
      "A report by Spain's central bank found that nearly 40% of families who rent now spend more than 40% of their income on their accommodation.",
      "\"The current problem is a huge imbalance between supply and demand,\" says Juan Vill\u00e9n, of Idealista. \"Demand is very good, the economy is growing a lot, but supply is dwindling very fast.\"",
      "Mr Vill\u00e9n offers the example of Barcelona, where rental increases have become notorious. Whereas nine families were competing to rent each property in the city five years ago, that number has risen to 54. Rental costs during that time have increased by 60%, he adds.",
      "\"We need to build more properties,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"And on the rental side we need more people willing to rent their properties, or willing to buy properties, refurbish them and put them on the rental market.\"",

      "Spain looks to immigrants to drive economy",
      "M\u00e1laga tourism: 'People feel the city is collapsing'",
      "The central government has described the situation as \"a social emergency\" and agrees that a lack of supply is driving the crisis. Last year, the Housing Ministry estimated that the country needs between 600,000 and one million new homes over the next four years in order to meet demand.",
      "This need for more housing has been pushed up in part by the arrival of immigrants who have joined the workforce and are helping drive Spain's economic growth. The ministry also pointed to a lack of social housing, which at 3.4% of total supply, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "In 2007, at the height of a property-ownership bubble, more than 600,000 homes were built in Spain. But high building costs, lack of available land and a shortage of manpower have all been factors in restricting construction in recent years, with just under 100,000 homes completed in 2024.",
      "The government has taken measures to incentivise construction, apportioning land for the building of affordable homes, while trying to ensure that public housing does not end up in the private market, which has been a problem in the past.",
      "But the Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has also expressed a willingness to intervene in the market in order to bring rental prices under control.",
      "At a recent event to mark the opening of 218 low-rent flats in the southern city of Seville, he declared that Spaniards \"want us to act, they want the housing market to operate according to the law of reason, of social justice, not the law of the jungle; they want to ensure that vulture funds and speculators are not doing whatever they like\".",
      "The central government and a number of local administrations have identified short-term tourist accommodation as part of the problem. Last year, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and several cities on the mainland saw protests by locals against surging tourist numbers, with their impact on rental costs the main complaint.",
      "Several city halls have responded by announcing plans to restrict the granting of tourist-flat permits, while Barcelona is going further, revoking the licences of all of the city's 10,000 or so registered short-term apartments by 2028.",
      "The S\u00e1nchez government has also pushed through parliament a housing law, which includes a cap on rentals in so-called \"high-tension\" areas where prices are climbing out of control. Political resistance has meant that the legislation is so far only being implemented in the northern regions of the Basque Country, Navarre and Catalonia, and its success is open to debate.",
      "The Socialist-led regional and central governments have pointed to a 3.7% drop in rental costs in \"high-tension\" areas of Catalonia since the cap's introduction there a year ago, with Barcelona seeing a decrease of 6.4%.",
      "However, critics warn that the rental cap has spooked owners and caused thousands of properties to be withdrawn from the market.",
      "\"On the supply side, the problem is that all measures taken by the local or national governments are going against landlords,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"Even people that were doing build-to-rent new properties have been selling their properties because they don't want to get into the rental market.\"",
      "Another initiative proposed by the central government which has stirred up debate is a tax of up to 100% on properties bought by non-residents from outside the EU, on the grounds that such homes are often barely inhabited. This is a measure that, if rolled out, would heavily affect British buyers.",
      "The conservative opposition has accused the government of being too heavy-handed with its approach. However, as public anger builds over this issue, there are many others who would like the country's leaders to act much more stridently.",
      "Gonzalo \u00c1lvarez, of the Sindicato de Inquilinas e Inquilinos, an organisation that campaigns for tenants' rights, agrees that a shortage of available homes is a problem, but insists that building more is not the answer.",
      "\"There is a lack of housing because homes are being hijacked - on the one hand tourist flats, and on the other hand all the empty flats belonging to vulture funds and the banks,\" he says. \"So there's no need to build more, it's not necessary. But the housing we have has been hijacked.\"",
      "His organisation wants the government to impose drastic mandatory reductions in rent on owners and is threatening to orchestrate a nationwide strike by tenants that would see participants refuse to pay their rent.",
      "\"The [central and local] governments are not setting any limits,\" says Mr \u00c1lvarez. \"So who is going to? We will have to do it.\"",

On home soil in Turkey, he has been beaten by the police several times while taking pictures, he says - including on World Peace Day \u2013 and has been detained \"so many times\".",
      "But being arrested at home was a first.",
      "\"A chill fell over the house,\" he tells us. \"In my work, at the protests, I have seen a lot of violence, and tear gas, but having the police in my home, I felt more afraid.\"",

    "summary": "What impact will the introduction of hefty tariffs on countries in Asia have on Nike's iconic US shoe?",
    "story": [
      "The Nike Air Jordan 1 is, in some ways, the iconic US shoe. It's a popular sneaker line by a large American brand, created four decades ago for homegrown basketball legend Michael Jordan.",
      "But although Nike sells most of its products in the US, almost all of its shoes are made in Asia \u2013 a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs salvo against foreign countries he accuses of \"ripping off\" Americans.",
      "Nike's shares fell 14% the day after the tariffs announcement, on fears over the impact they could have on the company's supply chain.",
      "So what will all this mean for the price of Nike's shoe?",
      "It depends on how much of the cost increase Nike decides to pass on to customers, if any, and how long they think the tariffs will actually be in place for.",
      "'Competitive industry'",
      "Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes - between 32% to 54%.",
      "Hopes remain that Trump might be willing to negotiate those rates lower. On Friday, he said he had had a \"very productive\" call with the leader of Vietnam, helping Nike shares to recover some ground after their steep Thursday falls.",
      "But most analysts think the firm's prices will have to go up.",
      "Swiss bank UBS estimates that there will be a 10% to 12% increase in the prices of goods that come from Vietnam - where Nike produces half of its shoes.",
      "Meanwhile, Indonesia and China account for almost all of the balance of its shoe production.",
      "\"Our view is that, given how extensive the list of tariffs is, the industry will realize there are few ways to mitigate the impact in the medium term other than by raising prices,\" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note.",
      "David Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand.",
      "\"This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,\" he says.",
      "Many other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament.",
      "Nike is already facing a tight bottom line.",
      "It had around $51bn (\u00a339.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%.",
      "But that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense.",
      "By the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to roughly 11%.",
      "That's across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items.",
      "Rahul Cee, who set up the running shoe review website Sole Review, says there are other ways Nike could keep retail prices low.",
      "Mr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the shoe.",
      "\"So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),\" he says.",
      "Another option would be instead of bringing out a new design every one to two years, to refresh the design cycle every three to four years.",
      "Things could change fast",
      "Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, says most companies were looking at Wednesday's announcement as \"still far from the final conclusion\".",
      "\"I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,\" he says.",
      "Theoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: \"Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?\"",
      "Even before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes.",
      "Finance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence.",
      "And Nike relies heavily on US consumers, with the market contributing to roughly $21.5bn of its sales - almost everything it sells in its largest market of North America.",
      "Sentiment in the US is a \"significant concern\" for Nike as it directly affects demand for its footwear, says Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.",
      "China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing down",
      "How does it affect me if share prices fall?",
      "Nintendo pulls Switch 2 pre-orders in US over Trump tariffs",
      "But ultimately he says firms may be forced to pass the cost of the levies on to consumers.",

      "He adds: \"How US trading partners react against the reciprocal tariff policy will also have a major impact.\"",
      "China has already hit back with a 34% tariff of its own.",
      "Part of the rationale behind Trump's tariff policy is because he wants more companies to manufacture their goods in the US.",
      "However, Prof Lu does not see Nike, or other companies, significantly reshaping its supply chain any time soon \"due to the complexity involved in footwear manufacturing\".",

    "story": [
      "South Korea's president has been removed from office after the Constitutional Court voted unanimously to uphold his impeachment.",
      "Yoon Suk Yeol was suspended from duty in December after being impeached by parliament, following his failed attempt to impose martial law.",
      "The ruling on Friday was met with tears of joy and sadness among Yoon's critics and supporters, who had gathered in various parts of Seoul to watch the verdict live.",
      "A snap election to vote for Yoon's replacement must be held by 3 June.",
      "What next for South Korea?",
      "After months of anxiously waiting, South Koreans have some badly needed closure. The country can now start to repair and move forward, the first step being to elect a new leader.",
      "But the crisis Yoon has unleashed is far from over. Although his military takeover only lasted six hours, the political fallout has only intensified with each month that has passed.",
      "The night of 3 December, when Yoon ordered troops to storm parliament, changed something in South Korea's psyche. It reawakened the ghosts of the country's violent, dictatorial past, showing people that martial law was not, as most had assumed, consigned to history.",
      "Many are still upset by what happened that night, and afraid that the threat of martial law could be brandished again by future zealous politicians.",
      "Today's verdict therefore came as a relief to most, who cheered on the streets of Seoul as the verdict was read out. It is a victory for South Korea's democracy, that for a while looked as if it was on dangerous ground.",
      "The Constitutional Court was damning in its criticism of Yoon's authoritarian power grab, as all eight judges voted to remove him from office.",
      "Moon Hyung-bae, acting president of the bench, said Yoon's short-lived military takeover was not justified, and that he had \"[gone] against the people he was supposed to protect\".",
      "He added that the implementation of martial law \"damaged people's basic political rights\" and \"violated the principles of the rule of law and democracy\".",
      "Already, there are serious calls to change South Korea's constitution \u2013 to strengthen its institutions and limit the powers of the president - to guard against this happening again. However, it will take a particularly patriotic future president to sign off on reducing their own authority.",
      "South Korea more polarised than ever",
      "As Yoon leaves office, he leaves behind not just a shaken country, but a divided one. In the aftermath of that shocking December night, South Koreans were mostly united in their disgust for the president and what he had attempted to do.",
      "But Yoon showed no remorse. He dug in, fought his trial at every step, and continued to dangle the same unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that he used to justify his military takeover.",
      "He claimed that the country and his political opposition had been infiltrated by North Korean and Chinese spies, and that these \"anti-state forces\" had rigged past elections.",
      "Gradually more and more people believed him. To them Yoon is now a political martyr \u2013 the victim of an establishment that had been overrun by \"communists\".",
      "His conspiracy theories have firmly taken root, and far-right extremism is flourishing. Thousands protest every week in the centre of Seoul. They were on the streets on Friday, and will be there again Saturday, claiming the country's politicians and judges are corrupt and elections are rigged.",
      "And these are not fringe views.",
      "More than a third of people now say they do not trust the Constitutional Court which delivered Yoon's verdict; more than a quarter do not trust the voting system.",
      "Within this climate of distrust, South Korea must head to the polls. Yoon's successor needs to be chosen in the next 60 days. These days are sure to be fraught and even more divisive. Many may not accept the result that comes.",
      "Yet South Korea urgently needs a new leader who can advocate for the country as a whole, having been without one for months.",
      "It quickly needs to figure out how to deal with President Trump, having started on the backfoot. His 25% tariffs on cars and steel have dealt Seoul, and its ailing economy, an early a blow, but many believe worse is coming; that it is only time until Trump turns his gaze to the Korean peninsula, and when he does he will try to force South Korea to pay more for its defence and cut a deal with Seoul's arch enemy, Kim Jong Un.",
      "Yoon's legal team has accused the court of politicising the ruling.",
      "\"The whole process of this trial itself was not lawful and unfair,\" said one of his lawyers, Yoon Gap-geun.",
      "\"I feel regrettable that this completely is a political decision,\" he said.",
      "But politicians are calling for unity, asking everyone to accept the verdict, so South Korea can start to move on.",
      "Yoon's political party, the PPP, has conceded, but Yoon himself has not. In a statement he apologised to his supporters for his \"shortcomings\" without mentioning the ruling.",
      "\"I am truly sorry and regretful that I could not live up to your expectations,\" he said.",
      "\"It has been a great honor to serve the Republic of Korea. I am deeply grateful to all of you who supported and encouraged me, despite my many shortcomings,\" he said.",

      "How did we get here?",
      "In an unprecedented televised announcement on 3 December, Yoon said he was invoking martial law to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea.",
      "At the time, the embattled leader was in a deadlock over a budget bill, dogged by corruption scandals and several of his cabinet ministers were under investigation.",
      "Less than two hours after Yoon's declaration, 190 lawmakers who gathered, including some from Yoon's party, voted to overturn it.",

      "Those plans, to impose tariffs of between 10% and 50% on almost every country, have upended global trade and led to warnings that prices could soon rise for American consumers. Trump, meanwhile, has said the move will address unfair trade imbalances, boost US industry and raise revenue.",

    "story": [
      "If I was writing a Russian language course for 2025, Lesson One would definitely contain the phrase for rollercoaster: Amerikanskiye gorki.",
      "It means, literally, American Hills.",
      "How appropriate.",
      "After all, with President Donald Trump now operating the ride, and Vladimir Putin pressing some of the buttons, US-Russian relations have become one of late, with highs and lows and twists and turns.",
      "You never know quite where you are now.",
      "Analysing geopolitical trends is hard enough at the best of times. It's even harder careering along on the American Hills of the 47th US president.",
      "When Trump returned to the White House in January, his direction of travel was clear: he set out to repair relations with Russia.",
      "There were Trump/Putin phone calls, high-level US-Russia negotiations. At one point Washington voted with Moscow against a UN resolution that identified Russia as the \"aggressor\" in Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "Whenever the Trump administration exerted pressure, it was always on Kyiv, never on the Kremlin.",
      "But a week or so ago the rollercoaster ride began.",
      "After Vladimir Putin had proposed replacing President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration with \"external governance\" in Ukraine under the auspices of the UN, President Trump made it known that he was \"angry\" with Putin.",
      "\"I was disappointed in a certain way, some of the things that were said over the last day or two having to do with Zelensky,\" Trump commented on 30 March. \"Because when [Putin] considers Zelensky not credible, he's supposed to be making a deal with him. Whether you like him or you don't like him.\"",
      "After a day playing golf with Trump, the president of Finland, Alexander Stubb, told the Guardian newspaper: \"I think America, and my sense is also the president of the United States, is running out of patience with Russia.\"",
      "Trump threatened to impose secondary tariffs of up to 50% on Russian oil exports if Russia was found to be dragging its heels on a Ukraine peace deal.",
      "A bi-partisan group of US senators has gone even further.",
      "They've drawn up a bill that would impose 500% secondary tariffs on countries that purchase Russian oil, gas and other resources.",
      "Up to this point the Russian press had been welcoming the thaw in relations between Moscow and Washington. The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper last month ran a headline stating that US and Russian officials had \"started speaking the same language\".",
      "This week things changed.",
      "On Wednesday, Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper accused the Trump administration of \"administrative insanity\u2026 inexperience\u2026 immaturity\".",
      "It criticised the administration's \"bragging and arrogance\" and \"its desire to declare 'huge breakthroughs' when the first steps have barely been taken\".",
      "The same day, Komsomolskaya Pravda declared: \"On Ukraine talks, Donald's mood changes as often as the wind.\"",
      "Signs, perhaps, of a cold wind blowing between Moscow and Washington?",
      "And yet when Trump announced his sweeping tariffs this week, Russia wasn't on the list.",
      "Instead, US authorities had organised a sanctions waiver for a key Kremlin official: Putin's foreign investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev.",
      "Dmitriev flew into Washington for talks with the Trump administration.",
      "A sign, perhaps, of Russia and America getting on with the business of\u2026 getting along?",
      "But on Friday, another warning from Washington to Moscow. This time at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels.",
      "\"President Trump's not going to fall into the trap of endless negotiations about negotiations,\" said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "\"We will know soon enough, in a matter of weeks, not months, whether Russia is serious about peace or not.\"",
      "\"If they're not,\" he continued, \"then we'll have to re-evaluate where we stand and what we do moving forward about it.\"",
      "This followed criticism of Russia by America's Nato allies. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Putin \"continues to obfuscate, continues to drag his feet\".",
      "\"He could accept a ceasefire now, he continues to bombard Ukraine\u2026 We see you, Vladimir Putin, we know what you are doing.\"",
      "Earlier on Friday there were rumours that Trump and Putin were about to speak again on the phone. These were followed by more rumours: the White House had changed its mind.",
      "The Kremlin said that there were no plans for a conversation.",
      "But there are reports that American companies are planning to take part in this year's St Petersburg Economic Forum.",
      "Okay. Stop the ride. I need to get off.",
      "My conclusions from all of this.",
      "Trying to follow each twist and turn on the US-Russia rollercoaster can leave you giddy and confused.",
      "Sometimes it's better observing from a distance. It often helps in order to identify the bigger picture.",
      "Which is this: for months Donald Trump's team avoided criticising Putin and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Key White House officials, like special envoy Steve Witkoff, have repeatedly embraced and repeated Kremlin talking points. True, Washington says it's growing impatient with Russia and has threatened tougher sanctions on Moscow. But it hasn't imposed any. Not yet.",
      "Will it?",
      "Is the Trump administration prepared to pressure Moscow into ending the war? And would the Kremlin allow itself to be pressured into doing so?",
      "It's a key question as Russia's war on Ukraine continues.",

    "summary": "Israeli air strikes on bases in Syria are a warning to Turkey to keep its military assets away.",
    "story": [
      "A growing confrontation between Israel and Turkey over influence in Syria is posing a serious challenge for Syria's fragile new government.",
      "On Wednesday night, Israel bombed several military targets in Syria, including two airports \u2013 Hama military airport and the T4 base near Homs.",
      "Syria's foreign ministry said the bombardment virtually destroyed the Hama base.  A prominent Syrian human rights group said four defence ministry employees were killed, and a dozen other people injured.",
      "The air strikes hit Syria, but their real target was Turkey.",
      "Shortly afterwards, Israel's foreign minister accused Turkey of playing a \"negative role\" in Syria, and Israel's defence minister warned Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, that he would \"pay a very heavy price\" if he allowed \"hostile forces\" to enter his country.",
      "Ankara is currently negotiating a joint defence pact with Sharaa's new government, and there have been widespread reports that Turkey is moving to station aircraft and air defence systems at Syria's T4 and Aleppo airbases.",
      "Some analysts compared Israel's intense air strikes on Hama airport this week with the much lighter bombing on the edge of the T4 base, suggesting that Turkey may have already moved some equipment there and that Israel was calibrating its attack to avoid a full-blown escalation.",
      "Relations between Israel and Turkey have nose-dived since the Gaza war began in October 2023, with Ankara introducing trade restrictions and accusing Israel of genocide.",
      "That regional tension is now playing out on new ground in Syria.",
      "After the air strikes on Wednesday, Turkey's foreign ministry accused Israel of destabilising the region by \"both causing chaos and feeding terrorism\" and said it was now the greatest threat to the security of the region.",
      "But foreign minister Hakan Fidan told Reuters news agency that his country was not seeking confrontation with Israel, and that Syria could set its own policies with its southern neighbour.",
      "Syria's new leader has repeatedly signalled that he was not looking for confrontation with Israel.  Soon after sweeping President Bashar al-Assad from power last December, he told the BBC that Syria would not pose a threat to any country.",
      "He has even left the door open to normalising diplomatic relations with Israel in the future, telling the Economist last month that Syria wanted peace with all parties, but that it was too early to discuss such a sensitive issue.",
      "His top priority since taking power has been to unite a bitterly divided Syria, and pacify external relations with its neighbours, while he cements his power and control.",
      "But Israel has not made that easy. Its military interventions in Syria are fuelling conflict with both external powers like Turkey, and with internal groups like jihadists in the country's south.",
      "Once an implacable enemy of Syria's former president and his Iranian ally, Israel is also suspicious of Sharaa, a man who once led the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda and whose new government is backed by Turkey.",
      "Since he took power, Israel's military has repeatedly pounded Syrian weapons stores, airfields and other military sites left by the former regime, to avoid them falling into enemy hands, it says.",
      "It has also occupied a demilitarised buffer zone, set up after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and has sent forces onto the Syrian side of a nearby mountain, setting up nine bases across the area.",
      "Israeli troops are also making regular incursions into Syria's south-western provinces, vowing to prevent the presence of any armed groups or government forces there.",
      "Earlier this week, the local government in the southern city of Deraa said nine civilians were killed in an Israeli bombardment, during the deepest incursion there yet by Israeli forces.",
      "Another four people were killed in Israeli shelling near the village of Koya late last month, after local gunmen tried to stop the advance of Israeli forces there.",
      "Since then, mosques in both Deraa and Damascus have reportedly called for jihad against Israeli forces.",
      "Charles Lister, head of the Syria Programme at the US-based Middle East Institute, which studies the region, has counted more than 70 ground incursions into south-west Syria since February, describing this as \"an extraordinarily dangerous moment \u2013 and an unnecessary one\".",
      "Since the fall of Assad four months ago, he says, not one attack has targeted Israel from Syria and the country's security forces have intercepted \"at least 18 weapons shipments destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon, and dismantled at least eight formerly Iranian-linked rocket launch sites\".",
      "Many Syrians are disappointed by Israel's response to their new government. They watched for years as Israel targeted the Assad regime, and believed that Assad's fall would bring the chance for a less confrontational relationship with Israel.",
      "Some say that view is now changing.",
      "\"We used to believe that the Israeli army was only targeting Assad's regime forces,\" said Ismail, a restaurant owner in the west of the country.  \"But its continued, incomprehensible bombings are sadly making us think that Israel is an enemy of the Syrian people.\"",
      "Syria is vulnerable because its internal divisions are easily inflamed by regional and global interventions. The roots of sectarian conflict run deep here, nourished by decades of repressive rule by the Assad family, members of Syria's Alawite minority.",
      "Ahmed al-Sharaa's attempts to reassure the country's minorities were interrupted in early March by an explosion of violence in Syria's coastal region \u2013 a stronghold of the former regime.",
      "At least 1,000 Alawite civilians or disarmed fighters were massacred by pro-government forces, after government units were ambushed in a co-ordinated attack led by remnants of Syria's former armed forces.",
      "Those former armed forces were once backed by Iran.  Some analysts believe their remnants may still be receiving some support from Tehran.",
      "Syrians celebrated the fall of Bashar al-Assad as an end to their civil war, and a chance to unite.",
      "But outside powers helped fuel that civil war for more than a decade, and its neighbours are now eyeing the vacuum left by Assad. The risk is growing that Syria will again fall victim to the conflicts of outside powers, played out on Syrian soil."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27lg8vp41o",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 23:06:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Could the National Rally retaliate in parliament by attempting to bring down the fragile coalition government?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Andrew read this article",
      "Outrage is a precious political currency and France's far right has spent this week attempting, furiously and predictably, to capitalise on the perceived injustice of a court's decision to block its totemic leader, Marine Le Pen, from standing in the 2027 presidential election.",
      "The airwaves have been throbbing with indignation.",
      "\"Be outraged,\" said one of Le Pen's key deputies, on French television, in case anyone was in doubt as to what their reaction should be.",
      "But it remains unclear whether Le Pen's tough sentence will broaden support for her party, the National Rally (RN), or lead to greater fragmentation of the French far right. Either way, it has created a feverish mood among the nation's politicians.",
      "Le Pen and her allies have boldly declared that France's institutions, and democracy itself, have been \"executed\", are \"dead\", or \"violated\". The country's justice system has been turned into a \"political\" hit squad, shamelessly intervening in a nation's right to choose its own leaders. And Marine Le Pen has been widely portrayed, with something close to certainty, as France's president-in-waiting, as the nation's most popular politician, cruelly robbed of her near-inevitable procession towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.",
      "\"The system has released a nuclear bomb, and if it is using such a powerful weapon against us, it is obviously because we are about to win the elections,\" Le Pen fumed at a news conference, comparing herself to the poisoned, imprisoned, and now dead Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny.",
      "As France assesses its latest political tremors, an uneven pushback has begun.",
      "No clear frontrunner for president",
      "Nervous about the impact the judgement may have for the country's frail coalition government, the Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou has admitted to feeling \"troubled\" by Le Pen's sentence and worried about a \"shock\" to public opinion.",
      "But other centrist politicians have taken a firmer line, stressing the need for a clear gap between the justice system and politics.",
      "An early opinion poll appears to show the French public taking a calm line, bursting \u2013 or at least deflating \u2013 the RN's bubble of outrage. The poll, produced within hours of the court's ruling, showed less than a third of the country \u2013 31% - felt the decision to block Le Pen, immediately, from running for public office, was unjust.",
      "Tellingly, that figure was less than the 37% of French people who recently expressed an interest in voting for her as president.",
      "In other words, plenty of people who like her as a politician also think it reasonable that her crimes should disqualify her from running for office.",
      "And remember, French presidential elections are still two years away \u2013 an eternity in the current political climate.",
      "Emmanuel Macron is not entitled to stand for another term and no clear alternative to Le Pen, from the left or centre of French politics, has yet emerged. Le Pen's share of the vote has consistently risen during her previous three failed bids for the top job but it is premature, at best, to consider her a shoo-in for 2027.",
      "Le Pen's crime and punishment",
      "Anyone who followed the court case against her and her party colleagues in an impartial fashion would struggle to conclude that the verdicts in Le Pen's case were unreasonable.",
      "The evidence of a massive and coordinated project to defraud the European Parliament and its associated taxpayers included jaw-droppingly incriminating emails suggesting officials knew exactly what they were doing, and the illegality of their actions.",
      "That the corruption was for the party, not for personal gain, surely changes nothing. Corruption is corruption. Besides, other parties have also been found guilty of similar offences.",
      "Regarding the punishments handed out by the court, here it seems fair to argue that Le Pen and her party made a strategic blunder in their approach to the case.",
      "Had they acknowledged the facts, and their errors, and cooperated in facilitating a swift trial rather than helping to drag the process out for almost a decade, the judges \u2013 as they've now made clear \u2013 might have taken their attitude towards the case into consideration when considering punishments.",
      "\"Neither during the investigation nor at the trial did [Le Pen] show any awareness of the need for probity as an elected official, nor of the ensuing responsibilities,\" wrote the judges in a document explaining, often indignantly, why they'd delivered such a tough sentence.",
      "They berated Le Pen for seeking to delay or avoid justice with \"a defence system that disregards the uncovering of the truth\".",
      "Hypocrisy among the elite",
      "It is worth noting, here, the wider hypocrisy demonstrated by elites across France's political spectrum who have recently been muttering their sympathy for Le Pen. It is nine years since MPs voted to toughen up the laws on corruption, introducing the very sanctions - on immediately banning criminals from public office - that were used by the judges in this case.",
      "That toughening was welcomed by the public as an antidote to a judicial system stymied by an indulgent culture of successive appeals that enabled \u2013 and sometimes still enables - politicians to dodge accountability for decades.",
      "Le Pen is now being gleefully taunted by her critics online with the many past instances in which she has called for stricter laws on corruption.",
      "\"When are we going to learn the lessons and effectively introduce lifelong ineligibility for those who have been convicted of acts committed while in office or during their term of office?\" she asked in 2013.",
      "Reasonable people can reasonably disagree about the court's sentencing decisions in Le Pen's case. But the notion \u2013 enthusiastically endorsed by populist and hard-right politicians across Europe and the US \u2013 that she is a victim of a conspiratorial political plot has clearly not convinced most French people.",
      "At least not yet.",
      "Future of France's far right",
      "So where does this verdict \u2013 clearly a seismic moment in French politics \u2013 leave the National Rally and the wider far-right movement?",
      "The short answer is that no one knows. There are so many variables involved \u2013 from the fate of Le Pen's fast-tracked appeal, to the RN's succession strategy, to the state of France's precarious finances, to the broader political climate and the see-sawing appetite for populism both within France and globally \u2013 that predictions are an even more dubious game than usual.",
      "The most immediate question \u2013 given the slow pace of the legal appeal that Le Pen has vowed to initiate \u2013 is whether the RN will seek prompt revenge in parliament by attempting to bring down the fragile coalition government of Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou.",
      "That could lead to new parliamentary elections this summer and the possibility that the RN could capitalise on its victim status to increase its lead in parliament and perhaps, even, to push the country towards a deadlock in which President Macron might \u2013 yet another \"might\" \u2013 feel obliged to step down.",
      "One person who will now be facing extra scrutiny is Le Pen's almost but not quite anointed successor, 29-year-old Jordan Bardella, who could be drafted in as a replacement presidential candidate if Le Pen's own \"narrow path\" towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e remains blocked on appeal.",
      "If social-media-savvy Bardella's popularity among French youth is any indication of his prospects, he could well sweep to victory in 2027. He has found a way to tap into the frustrations of people angry about falling living standards and concerns about immigration.",
      "But turning youthful support into actual votes is not always straightforward, and other, more experienced and mainstream figures on the right may well be sensing an opportunity too.",
      "The Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, is widely seen to be emerging as a potential contender. Some even wonder if the provocative television personality, Cyril Hanouna, might become a serious political force on the right of French politics.",
      "Meanwhile, Bardella, like the RN in general, has been on a highly disciplined mission to detoxify the party's once overtly racist and antisemitic brand. In February, for instance, he abandoned plans to speak at America's far-right CPAC event after Donald Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon made a Nazi salute.",
      "But this week's events have revealed that the RN is enthusiastically committed to the distinctly Trump-ian and populist strategy of blaming its misfortunes on a \"swamp\" of unelected officials. Bardella, meanwhile, complained about the recent closure of two right-wing media channels alongside his party's own legal struggles.",
      "\"There is an extremely serious drift today that does not reflect the idea we have of French democracy,\" he said.",
      "It's the sort of language that goes down well with the RN's core constituency, but its broader appeal may be limited in a country that remains, in many ways, deeply attached to its institutions.",
      "To frame it another way, will French voters be more motivated by the belief that Le Pen was unfairly punished, or by concern that the judges involved have since been the victims of death threats and other insults?",
      "As for Marine Le Pen, she has vowed that she will not be sidelined. But her destiny is not entirely in her own hands now. At the age of 56 she has become a familiar figure, fiery at times, but personally approachable, warm and, in political terms, profoundly influential and disciplined. So what next for her?",
      "France has had one Le Pen or other (Marine's father, Jean-Marie ran four times) on their presidential ballot paper since 1988. Always unsuccessfully.",
      "History may well look back on this week as the moment Marine Le Pen's fate was sealed, in one of three ways: as France's first female and first far-right president, swept to power on a tide of outrage. As the four-time loser of a French presidential election, finally denied power by the taint of corruption. Or as someone whose soaring political career was brought to an early and shuddering halt by her own miscalculations over a serious embezzlement scandal.",

    "summary": "Big in Asia, live shopping involves brands putting on live shows to sell direct to shoppers.",
    "story": [
      "After graduating college Kelsey Krakora worked full time in a steakhouse, bartending and serving meals.",
      "She had dabbled with selling clothes online, but only part-time.",
      "But in 2021 that all changed for Cleveland-based Ms Krakora.",
      "She switched to selling clothes on Whatnot and then Poshmark - online marketplaces where people can also use live video to sell items.",
      "\"My first live show with Poshmark was 27th November 2022. I sold zero things on my first show... but that didn't last long!\"",
      "Now she sells around 100 items per show, worth about $1,000 in sales (\u00a3773).",
      "Her shows are on average three hours long and she does between two and three a week.",
      "\"These events are inclusive, welcoming, you can shop in your PJs, and there's no need to head to the shopping mall,\" says Ms Krakora.",
      "Live shopping has been popular in the Asia-Pacific region for some time, where social networks such as China's Douyin regularly host live shopping streams, but now European and US brands are experimenting with this new way of selling their products.",
      "Live shopping is a close relative to shopping channels like QVC, where viewers are urged to call in and buy the products demonstrated by presenters.",
      "But live shopping acts as a quicker shortcut from buyer to product, especially in the era of one-click purchases, made popular by online retailers such as Amazon.",
      "Also, as younger generations increasingly cut the cord and can't access cable TV, shopping channels don't hold the same relevance as they once did.",
      "It's estimated the live shopping market has reached $32bn, with the most active sectors being fashion, cosmetics and collectibles.",
      "A 2024 survey from digital commerce platform VTEX found that 45% of US consumers have browsed or purchased from live shopping events in the past 12 months.",
      "Guillaume Faure, chief executive of LiveMeUp, which provides live shopping video software, remembers when interest in live shopping surged.",
      "\"When Instagram introduced Reels, and when YouTube launched Shorts, we saw live shopping really take off.\"",
      "He's noticed the popularity of tutorials and how-to videos in live shopping events, such as how hosts can teach shoppers how to apply a certain type of make-up, or arrange a variety of flowers to deliver the most evocative bouquet.",
      "However, some analysts think that live shopping is likely to have a limited appeal.",
      "\"Many companies have tried live shopping but it simply doesn't scale,\" says Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research.",
      "\"Maybe it works in China where they don't have the same kind of store density we have in the US, where it's better for consumers to go and try something on rather than watch a host try on a piece of clothing,\" she adds.",
      "Jonathan Reynolds,  academic director of the Oxford Institute of Retail Management, University of Oxford, also highlights that the Chinese market is different.",
      "\"In China, so-called key opinion leaders (KOLs) like Li Jiaqi, the so-called 'Lipstick King, are well established,\" he says.",
      "\"Li has carefully built his personal brand to demonstrate his expertise and build consumer trust. KOLs are also working within much more sophisticated platform ecosystems,\" Mr Reynolds explains.",
      "Even Ms Krakora admits that not all products work on a live shopping stream.",
      "For example, she prefers to shop for jeans in-person. \"I'm tall, and I have specific cuts of jeans that I wear,\" she says, \"and there are tried-and-true styles and brands I like.\"",
      "Bruce Winder, a retail analyst in Toronto, also says that for some shoppers, the convenience of live shopping might be too attractive.",

      "A unilateral attack - that was the view of Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron called them brutal, unfounded and certain to have a \"massive impact\" on the European economy.",
      "He convened an emergency meeting with representatives of French businesses most affected by the newly announced 20% tariffs on EU goods sold to the US and issued a call to arms to European business \"not to invest in America for some time until we have clarified things\".",
      "\"What message would we send by having major European players investing billions of euros in the American economy at a time when [the US] is hitting us?\" he said.",
      "For France it's wine, champagne and the aeronautical industry, for Germany it's cars, and for Italy it's luxury goods. It's well known these sectors sell well abroad and now risk being clobbered by US import taxes.",
      "Overall, the chemicals, machinery and equipment industries in the EU are seen as the most vulnerable to the tariffs.",
      "But dig a little deeper and there are other EU sectors, reliant on the US market, that could come as a bit of a surprise.",
      "French cognac, generally dismissed as an old person's tipple in Europe, is the booze of choice for many American rappers, playing a prominent role in the music and lifestyle of stars like Jay-Z, 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg. More than 40% of French brandy is exported to the US.",
      "Spain exports a lot of gas turbines to the US, alongside tonnes of olive oil.",
      "Which EU countries are most exposed?",
      "When we look at which EU countries are most exposed to the US in terms of GDP, the picture is also not quite what you might imagine.",
      "Ireland is highly dependent on the US in terms of goods and services. Those exports - a lot linked to the pharmaceutical industry (which is currently exempt from the 20% tariffs, until the US boosts its own production) and also tech - make up a fifth of Ireland's GDP.",
      "Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are more exposed than the EU average in terms of services exports.",
      "Belgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia are in a similar position when it comes to goods.",
      "Germany has a greater exposure to the US than the other major EU economies, at over 5% of GDP, followed by Italy (about 4%), France (3%) and Spain (just over 2%). These figures were collated in 2024 by CaixaBank research based on Eurostat figures for the previous year.",
      "Will the EU retaliate?",
      "The response to the new US tariffs is being coordinated at EU HQ in Brussels. The European Commission deals with all overarching trade matters for the bloc's members.",
      "Commission President Ursula von der Leyen claims they hold \"a lot of cards\", including the strength to negotiate and the power to push back.",
      "The US economy is mighty. It makes up 25% of global GDP.",
      "But the EU single market of 450 million people (the biggest single market in the world) stands very close in size at 22% of global GDP.",
      "So, yes, the EU can bite - hard - as well as bark when it comes to retaliating against Donald Trump's tariffs. Especially if, as EU figures have suggested, the bloc targets US services like Big Tech, possibly including Apple, Meta, Amazon and even Elon Musk's platform X.",
      "But that risks a new backlash by the Trump administration. And the EU wants to avoid upping the ante.",
      "If you take politics into account, not just economics, the EU has less room for manoeuvre than you might think.",
      "Take energy supplies, the EU has been buying US liquified natural gas (LNG) after it weaned itself off Russian gas following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Tricky to reduce or heavily tax those imports. That would badly impact EU consumers, not only US industry, and it would worsen already dismal relations with the US.",
      "Think of all the recent rows over defence spending and Ukraine. Aside from the economic hell the EU sees and hopes to avoid in the new Trump tariffs, the bloc also really wants to sidestep a trade war with the country that used to be Europe's best friend.",
      "So, the Brussels plan is: threaten heavy retaliation, hope Donald Trump is persuaded to negotiate, then pray he'll stage a U-turn on tariffs.",
      "The EU's trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, says he's speaking to his US counterparts on Friday. It's an opening gambit. The EU is in no rush to retaliate.",

      "The Trump administration has ruled out any country negotiating its way out of the new tariffs before they become live this weekend. But after that, what could the EU offer the US president to persuade him to back down?",
      "Trump is incandescent about the EU's massive trade surplus. It sells far more goods than it buys from the US. The surplus for 2024 was around $200bn (\u20ac180bn; $153bn).",
      "It's the other way round when it comes to services - the US sells far more to the EU than the other way round. That is why the EU thinks its main retaliatory leverage against the US would lie in services, like banks and big tech.",
      "To redress the goods imbalance, the EU could offer to buy more LNG from the US, or more military equipment, following its pledge to Washington to do more for its own security.",
      "But that would break a different EU promise - to boost withering European arms industries by trying to buy EU when re-arming EU countries. It is something the US has already objected to, so that's tricky.",
      "Brussels could also cut direct and indirect tariffs on US goods. It could lose quotas on US agricultural produce.",
      "It would be hugely reluctant to comply with another US ask: to water down its much-trumpeted digital regulations, aimed at limiting monopolies and placing restrictions on speech and content in the EU.",
      "How bad can this all get?",
      "How do you price in the possible collapse of the international trading system, EU officials ask.",
      "European firms fret about their markets being flooded by cheap goods from non-EU countries that are also hit by Trump tariffs and seeking to sell elsewhere.",

      "Would the EU have to ratchet up its import duties on Chinese goods to protect itself and could that lead to an unintended trade war with China?",
      "These are anxious and hugely uncertain economic times.",
      "Which is why the European Commission says it also wants to focus on matters it can control - if EU capitals agree - and that is reducing internal barriers within the EU single market.",
      "Those barriers, such as tax regimes, vary from country to country and impact the EU's overall economic growth and competitiveness.",
      "The IMF calculates they're equivalent to a 45% tariff on EU manufacturing; 110% when it comes to services.",
      "That is far higher than the tariffs now imposed on the EU by Donald Trump.",
      "EU countries say they're united in combating those. So far they've been divided over completing their own internal market."

      "If they do get put in place \u2013 and remain \u2013 there is likely to be a serious dent to the amount bought by Americans, still the world's biggest shoppers, from the rest of the world.",
      "And those who are prepared to fork out for higher prices due to tariffs will have less to spend on other things.",
      "In the event of the retaliation threatened by other countries, American exporters will suffer \u2013 hence the concern that not just the US but the whole global economy, so reliant on trade flows, could slow.",
      "But as you say, the natural inclination is for countries hardest hit \u2013 toymakers from China to apparel manufacturers in Vietnam - to boost sale in other markets.",

      "Mike Heafield, 60, in Preston, asks Senior Technology reporter, Graham Fraser, What happens to products - like the iPhone - that are made in China by US companies?",

      "The US tech giant has large manufacturing bases in some of the countries hit hardest by President Trump's policy - notably China, which faces tariffs of 54%, and Vietnam (46%).",
      "In 2019, when Trump was first in the White House, Apple was given Chinese tariff exemptions. Apple bosses will be hoping to work out a similar deal this time.",
      "The global investment bank Citi said: \"If Apple cannot get exempted this time and assuming Apple gets hit by the accumulative 54% China tariffs and does not pass it through, we estimate about 9% negative impact to the company's total gross margin.\"",
      "In February, Apple committed to invest more than $500bn (\u00a3396bn) in the US over the next four years. At the time, Trump claimed Apple's support for US manufacturing was partially a response to his trade policies, including tariffs.",

      "We saw that in the president's first term, when the likes of Vietnam and Malaysia took advantage of the tariffs he imposed on China to increase the amount they sold to America.",
      "Ironically, they consequently are in the firing line now - and so will likely be vying to sell more to the UK \u2013 good for consumers, less so for competing businesses",
      "Already, many producers are turning their sights beyond established customers \u2013 think whisky makers looking towards Asia. That is likely to intensify.",

      "Jock Scott, from Nuneaton, asks Business reporter Nick Edser if the US tariffs have an effect on the UK's cost of living.",
      "As ever when looking at the implications of the tariffs, there's a lot of uncertainty over this. In some circumstances UK prices could go up, in others they could fall.",
      "The tariffs announced by Trump on Wednesday will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US. This means the initial impact of price rises is likely to be on US consumers, if American firms pass on the extra costs.",
      "However, some economists think the tariffs could strengthen the value of the dollar against other currencies. If the pound weakens against the dollar, then UK firms importing goods from the US will face higher costs. This could then lead to higher prices of these goods in UK shops if companies cannot absorb the increased costs themselves.",
      "Also, if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on the extra costs to customers.",
      "However, some economists have suggested prices could also fall as a result of the tariffs.",
      "Swati Dhingra, an economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US may instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods.",
      "What does this mean for my pension?",
      "Robert Jones, from Cardiff, asks Kevin Peachey, Cost of living correspondent, about the impact of tariffs on our pension investments.",
      "There is little doubt Trump's announcement on tariffs has led to immediate moves in share prices and are also likely to have a longer-term economic impact.",
      "Robert and Stephen have mentioned the drop in the value of their pension investments, and the situation will be unsettling for millions of people with any kind of investments.",
      "Experts say that investors have always had to ride economic shocks. Investments, by definition, require a long-term outlook and strategy. So, they are urging people not to panic or make knee-jerk decisions.",
      "That said, for those about to draw on investments, it may be more worrying, albeit that most pension savings are moved into safer holdings like cash or bonds as people approach retirement age. The state pension is unaffected.",

      "Paul Naldrett from Windsor asks Business correspondent Marc Ashdown if the UK's position outside of the European Union is actually an opportunity as the EU is given 20% tariffs.",
      "Some are referring to a \"Brexit benefit\" because the UK is only subject to 10% tariffs rather than the 20% being slapped on the EU.",
      "Not only will that limit the pain felt by British businesses compared to their European neighbours, but it could present trading opportunities.",
      "UK exporters to America could have a competitive edge, with US importers only facing half the tax by dealing with UK businesses instead of EU businesses.",
      "British firms - and consumers - could also benefit from cheaper goods finding their way here instead of America if the extra costs prove insurmountable.",
      "But, there are concerns about the impact that could have on homegrown industries if cheap products, possibly with lower standards, flood the UK market."

      "Dividing 295 by 440 gets you to 67% and you divide that by two and round up. Therefore the tariff imposed on China is 34%.",

      "But the White House's official methodology document makes clear that they have not calculated this for all the countries on which they have imposed tariffs.",
      "Instead the tariff rate was calculated on the basis that it would eliminate the US's goods trade deficit with each country.",

      "In total, more than 100 countries are covered by the new tariff regime.",

      "But will this new tariff regime achieve the desired outcome?",
      "BBC Verify has spoken to a number of economists. The overwhelming view is that while the tariffs might reduce the goods deficit between the US and individual countries, they will not reduce the overall deficit between the US and rest of the world.",
      "\"Yes, it will reduce bilateral trade deficits between the US and these countries. But there will obviously be lots of broader impacts that are not captured in the calculation\", says Professor Jonathan Portes of King's College, London.",
      "That's because the US' existing overall deficit is not driven solely by trade barriers, but by how the US economy works.",
      "For one, Americans spend and invest more than they earn and that gap means the US buys more from the world than it sells. So as long as that continues, the US may continue to keep running a deficit despite increasing tariffs with it global trading partners.",
      "Some trade deficits can also exist for a number of legitimate reasons - not just down to tariffs. For example, buying food that is easier or cheaper to produce in other countries' climates.",
      "Thomas Sampson of the London School of Economics said: \"The formula is reverse engineered to rationalise charging tariffs on countries with which the US has a trade deficit. There is no economic rationale for doing this and it will cost the global economy dearly.\"",

      "Trump has imposed new tariffs on Chinese imports since returning to the White House in January, ratcheting up levies to 20%.",
      "In less than a week, these tariffs will jump to 54%, apart from on products like cars, steel and aluminium, which will be subjected to lower tariffs.",
      "Beijing has also been on the receiving end of other Trump trade salvos.",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, the President signed an executive order to end a provision for low-value parcels from China.",
      "This had allowed Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu to ship packages with a retail value of under $800 (\u00a3617) to the US, without taxes and inspections.",
      "Close to 1.4 billion shipments entered the US under the provision in the last financial year, according to customs data.",
      "The removal of the exemption could force some Chinese firms to pass the extra cost on to customers, making their goods less competitive in the US.",
      "When taken together, this is a worrying picture for Beijing, said Deborah Elms from the Hinrich Foundation consultancy.",
      "\"I don't think the new tariffs are necessarily aimed at China. But when the United States stacks tariffs on top of each other, specifically towards China, the numbers become eye-watering quite quickly.\"",
      "\"China and the Chinese will have to retaliate. They are not going to be able to sit back and watch this,\" she said.",
      "Supply chain hit",
      "Trump also imposed heavy tariffs, ranging from 46% to 49%, on Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.",
      "This represents \"a full-frontal assault on Beijing's extended supply chain,\" said Stephen Innes from investment firm SPI Asset Management.",
      "\"Vietnam... and others in the periphery are collateral damage in what is shaping up to be the most aggressive realignment of US trade policy in a generation,\" he added. \"This isn't tit-for-tat - it's strategic containment via tariff warfare.\"",
      "Laos and Cambodia, which are among the poorest countries in the region, are heavily dependant on Chinese investment in supply chain infrastructure. The high tariff rates are expected to hit both countries hard.",
      "China is Vietnam's largest trading partner. It was one of the key beneficiaries of US-China tensions during Trump's first term.",
      "In 2018, Trump hit China with tariffs, causing some businesses to rethink where they made their products. Some chose to shift manufacturing to Vietnam.",
      "This has led to an increase of exports from Vietnam to the US, with Chinese companies that have moved production there contributing to that figure.",
      "\"Vietnam was clearly targeted [by Trump] due to its role as a conduit for China's circumvention of previous tariffs\", former US trade negotiator Stephen Olson told the BBC.",
      "While the US remains Vietnam's biggest export market, China is its largest supplier of goods, accounting for more than a third of imports, according to the latest official data.",
      "Chinese firms were also behind nearly one in every three new investments in Vietnam last year.",
      "Pushan Dutt, a professor at the INSEAD business school, said the new taxes on South East Asia will be \"prohibitive\" for China.",
      "\"China has a problem with demand and in the last Trump administration their firms had nimbly reacted to tariffs by rejigging supply chains and moving them to [South East Asian nations]. This door has been slammed shut,\" he added.",
      "But Trump's taxes on the region will also impact US companies that manufacture goods in South East Asia.",
      "For instance, American businesses including technology giants Apple and Intel, and sportswear giant Nike have large factories in Vietnam.",
      "A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam found that most US manufacturers there expect to lay off staff if tariffs are imposed.",
      "'Tough choices' ahead",
      "There is the question of what China can do to respond to the new tariffs, given it only has days before they are due to take effect.",
      "Mr Olson said he expects Beijing to have a \"forceful\" response with tariffs and other measures making it more difficult for US companies to operate in China.",
      "With the Chinese economy already facing challenges, Beijing faces \"tough choices\" in the days ahead, said Professor Dutt.",
      "\"Exporting to other regions threatens de-industrialisation in these destinations - and political leaders there are unlikely to accept this. That means China has to finally unleash domestic demand and the Chinese household,\" he added.",
      "The tariffs could also push China to try and build alliances with other Asian nations who have been on the receiving end of the tariffs.",
      "Wang Huiyao, a former China Communist Party member who works with the Center for China and Globalisation think tank, called on Asian countries to \"work together to go through this difficult time and fight protectionism\".",
      "\"In the end, the US could be losing all the influence and isolate itself,\" he added.",
      "Some discussions are already underway. China, South Korea and Japan recently held their first economic talks in five years.",
      "They agreed to speed up talks for free trade agreement - which was first proposed over a decade ago.",
      "The new tariffs could give them added incentive to do so.",
      "However, Beijing could face some short-term pain while talks with Washington take its course.",
      "\"Ultimately, the US and China are headed for a negotiating table where they'll try to reach some type of a grand bargain on a wide range of issues,\" Mr Olson said.",
      "\"That won't necessarily happen soon and I expect things to get worse before they get better,\" he added."

    "story": [
      "Warning: This article contains details and images that some readers may find distressing",
      "Driving into Mandalay, the massive scale of the destruction from last Friday's earthquake revealed itself bit by bit.",
      "In nearly every street we turned into, especially in the northern and central parts of the city, at least one building had completely collapsed, reduced to a pile of rubble. Some streets had multiple structures which had come down.",
      "Almost every building we saw had cracks running through at least one of its walls, unsafe to step into. At the main city hospital they're having to treat patients outdoors.",
      "Myanmar's military government has said it's not allowing foreign journalists into the country after the quake, so we went in undercover. We had to operate carefully, because the country is riddled with informers and secret police who spy on their own people for the ruling military junta.",
      "What we witnessed was a people who had very little help coming their way in the face of this massive disaster.",
      "\"I have hope that he's alive, even if it's a small chance,\" said Nan Sin Hein, 41, who's been waiting on the street opposite a collapsed five-storey building, day and night for five days.",
      "Her 21 year-old-son Sai Han Pha is a construction worker, renovating the interiors of the building, which used to be a hotel and was being turned into an office space.",
      "\"If they can rescue him today, there's a chance he'll survive,\" she says.",
      "When the 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck, the bottom of the building sank into the ground, its top lurching at an angle over the street, looking like it could tip over at any minute.",
      "Sai Han Pha and four other workers were trapped inside.",
      "When we visited, rescue efforts had not even begun at the building and there was no sign they would start soon. There just isn't enough help available on the ground - and the reason for that is the political situation in the country.",
      "Even before the earthquake Myanmar was in turmoil - locked in a civil war that has displaced an estimated 3.5 million people. Its military has continued operations against armed insurgent groups despite the disaster.",
      "This means that security forces are too stretched to put their full might behind relief and rescue operations. Except in some key locations, we didn't see them in large numbers in Mandalay.",
      "The military junta has put out a rare appeal for international aid, but its uneasy relations with many foreign countries, including the UK and the US, has meant that while these countries have pledged aid, help in the form of manpower on the ground is currently only from countries like India, China and Russia, among a few others.",
      "And so far those rescue efforts appear to be focused on structures where masses of people are feared trapped \u2013 the high-rise Sky Villa condominium complex which was home to hundreds of people, and U Hla Thein Buddhist academy where scores of monks were taking an examination when the earthquake struck.",
      "Neeraj Singh, who is leading the Indian disaster response team working at the Buddhist academy, said the structure had collapsed like a \"pancake\" - one layer on top of another.",
      "\"It's the most difficult collapse pattern and the chances of finding survivors are very low. But we are still hopeful and trying our best,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Working under the sweltering sun, in nearly 40C, rescuers use metal drills and cutters to break the concrete slabs into smaller pieces. It's slow and extremely demanding work. When a crane lifts up the concrete pieces, the stench of decaying bodies, already quite strong, becomes overwhelming.",
      "The rescuers spot four to five bodies, but it still takes a couple of hours to pull the first one out.",
      "Sitting on mats under a makeshift tent in the compound of the academy are families of the students. Their faces are weary and despondent. As soon as they hear a body has been recovered, they crowd around the ambulance it is placed in.",
      "Myanmar earthquake: What we know",
      "Others gather around a rescuer who shows them a photo of the body on his mobile phone.",
      "Agonising moments pass as the families try to see if the dead man is a loved one.",
      "But the body is so disfigured, the task is impossible. It is sent to a morgue where forensic tests will have to be conducted to confirm the identity.",
      "Among the families is the father of 29-year-old U Thuzana. He has no hope that his son survived. \"Knowing my son ended up like this, I'm inconsolable, I'm filled with grief,\" U Hla Aung said, his face crumpling into a sob.",
      "Many of Mandalay's historical sites have also suffered significant damage, including the Mandalay Palace and the Maha Muni Pagoda, but we could not get in to see the extent of the damage.",
      "Access to everything - collapse sites, victims and their families - was not easy because of the oppressive environment created by the military junta, with people often fearful of speaking to journalists.",
      "Close to the pagoda, we saw Buddhist funeral rituals being held on the street outside a destroyed house. It was the home of U Hla Aung Khaing and his wife Daw Mamarhtay, both in their sixties.",
      "\"I lived with them but was out when the earthquake struck. That's why I survived. Both my parents are gone in a single moment,\" their son told us.",
      "Their bodies were extricated not by trained rescuers, but by locals who used rudimentary equipment. It took two days to pull out the couple, who were found with their arms around each other.",
      "Myanmar's military government says 2,886 people have died so far, but so many collapse sites have still not even been reached by the authorities, that that count is unlikely to be accurate. We may never find out what the real death toll of the earthquake was.",
      "Parks and open spaces in Mandalay have turned into makeshift camps, as have the banks of the moat that runs around the palace. All over the city we saw people laying out mats and mattresses outside their homes as evening approached, preferring to sleep outdoors.",
      "Mandalay is a city living in terror, and with good reason. Nearly every night since Friday there have been big aftershocks. We woke up to an aftershock of magnitude 5 in the middle of the night.",
      "But tens of thousands are sleeping outdoors because they have no home to return to.",
      "\"I don't know what to think anymore. My heart still trembles when I think of that moment when the earthquake struck,\" said Daw Khin Saw Myint, 72, who we met while she was waiting in a queue for water, with her little granddaughter by her side. \"We ran out, but my house is gone. I'm living under a tree. Come and see.\"",
      "She works as a washerwoman and says her son suffers from a disability which doesn't allow him to work.",
      "\"Where will I live now? I am in so much trouble. I'm living next to a rubbish dump. Some people have given me rice and a few clothes. We ran out in these clothes we are wearing.",
      "\"We don't have anyone to rescue us. Please help us,\" she said, tears rolling down her cheeks.",
      "Another elderly woman chimes in, eyes tearing up, \"No one has distributed food yet today. So we haven't eaten.\"",
      "Most of the vehicles we saw pulling up to distribute supplies were small vans with limited stocks - donations from individuals or small local organisations. It's nowhere near enough for the number of people in need, leading to a scramble to grab whatever relief is available.",
      "Parts of Mandalay's main hospital are also damaged, and so in an already difficult situation, rows and rows of beds are laid out in the hospital compound for patients.",
      "Shwe Gy Thun Phyo, 14, has suffered from a brain injury, and has bloodshot eyes. She's conscious but unresponsive. Her father tries to make her as comfortable as possible.",
      "There were very few doctors and nurses around to cope with the demand for treatment, which means families are stepping in to do what medical staff should.",
      "Zar Zar has a distended belly because of a serious abdominal injury. Her daughter sits behind her, holding her up, and fans her, to give her some relief from the heat.",
      "We couldn't spend a lot of time at the hospital for fear of being apprehended by the police or military.",
      "As the window to find survivors of the earthquake narrows, increasingly those being brought into the hospital are the dead.",
      "Nan Sin Hein, who is waiting outside the collapsed building where her son was trapped, was initially stoical, but she now looks like she is preparing to face what seems like the most likely outcome.",
      "\"I'm heartbroken. My son loved me and his little sisters. He struggled to support us,\" she says.",
      "\"I am just hoping to see my son's face, even if he is dead. I want to see his body. I want them to do everything they can to find his body.\""

      "\"I've talked to a few people now that were part of the rescue efforts in both Sagaing and Mandalay, and they said that [the military] imposed a curfew\u2026 the roads were blocked, the checkpoints were really long, and there was a huge checking of goods and services going in and a lot of questioning,\" John Quinley, director of international human rights group Fortify Rights, told the BBC.",
      "\"It could have just been a lot easier to allow those people in,\" he added. \"Obviously the Myanmar junta said it was for safety reasons, but I don't believe that's totally legitimate.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the golden window closed.",

      "The convoy was traveling toward Mandalay when it was fired upon by soldiers with machine guns, forcing it to turn back, the TNLA said in a Telegram post late on Tuesday.",

      "But this is not the first time the junta has attacked aid workers, Mr Quinley said.",
      "\"They pick and choose when aid can go in, and if they can't monitor it and they can't use it how they want, they restrict it,\" he said. \"They definitely also, on top of that, actively target humanitarian workers.\"",
      "The junta, which began fighting a civil war with resistance forces in Myanmar after it seized control of the country in 2021, has a history of weaponising aid and humanitarian assistance: funnelling it towards areas that are under its control and restricting it in areas that are not.",
      "The BBC assessed the power balance in more than 14,000 village groups as of mid-November last year, and found the military only has full control of 21% of Myanmar's territory, nearly four years on from the start of the conflict.",
      "In previous natural disasters, such as Cyclone Mocha in 2023 and Typhoon Yagi in 2024, which left hundreds dead, the military obstructed relief efforts in resistance-held areas by refusing to release supplies from customs, authorise travel for aid workers or relax restrictions on lifesaving assistance.",
      "\"It's a worrying trend that happens in times of crisis, like the earthquake,\" Mr Quinley said. \"The junta is blocking any aid to what they see as groups that are aligned with the broader resistance.\"",
      "James Rodehaver, head of the Myanmar team at the Office for the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, further suggested that the junta deprives Myanmar's population of aid as a form of punishment.",
      "\"They do that because the local population, by and large, does not support them, so by depriving them of humanitarian aid, they are both punishing them but also cutting off their ability to support themselves and be resilient,\" he told the BBC.",
      "There are already signs the junta may be repeating this tactic in Sagaing.",
      "Although central Myanmar, which includes the cities of Sagaing and Mandalay, is nominally run by the junta - meaning aid can only be delivered to the area with their co-operation - large parts of the broader Sagaing and Mandalay regions are considered resistance strongholds.",
      "The likelihood that the junta might tactically deprive these areas of aid has prompted outcry from hundreds of human rights and civil society organisations, who have urged the international community to ensure relief efforts get to where they're most needed, and aren't channelled through the military government.",
      "One such statement, signed by 265 civil society organisations and released on Sunday, notes that most of the worst-hit areas are under the effective control and administration of pro-democracy resistance groups.",
      "\"Myanmar's history provides stark warnings about the dangers of channelling aid through the military junta,\" it reads.",
      "In Sagaing, the impact of aid shortfalls can already be seen in troubling ways, according to relief agencies.",
      "They speak of shortages of food, water and fuel, while trucks carrying aid are stranded at military checkpoints around the city. Hundreds of residents, suddenly homeless, are sleeping outside on the street. Rescue volunteers who were forced to dig through the rubble with their bare hands have run out of body bags for those they couldn't save.",
      "Other community members seeking to respond to the earthquake are being forced to get authorisation from junta authorities by submitting lists of volunteers and items to be donated, local media reported.",
      "This tactic \u2013 of bombarding responders with lengthy bureaucratic checklists and processes \u2013 is routinely deployed by the junta to restrict the activities of international aid organisations in Myanmar, humanitarian sources told the BBC.",
      "According to a registration law imposed in 2023, such organisations must attain a registration certificate, and often sign a memorandum of understanding with relevant government ministries, to legally operate inside the country.",
      "One source, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said aid groups are often required to remove certain activities, areas or townships from their proposals, with no room for negotiation. Areas where the junta doesn't have oversight or control over the aid work are typically those that are disallowed, they added.",
      "Aid agencies have found ways to navigate the junta's restriction, however: a lot of humanitarian assistance in Myanmar happens underground, via local groups that can bypass checkpoints and distribute aid without attracting the attention of the authorities.",
      "Many financial transactions in humanitarian aid also happen outside of Myanmar's banking system, so that actors can avoid scrutiny and potential investigation from the country's central bank, a source told the BBC. In some cases, humanitarian organisations open bank accounts in Thailand so that they can privately receive aid funds, then carry the money over the border into Myanmar in cash.",
      "Such covert methods take time, however, and could lead to potentially fatal delays of days or weeks.",
      "Some aid workers are hopeful that, given the scale of Friday's earthquake and the international appeal for assistance by Min Aung Hlaing, it may be easier to overcome barriers and provide aid more efficiently.",
      "\"In the past we have faced some challenges,\" said Louise Gorton, an emergency specialist based in Unicef's East Asia and Pacific Regional Office.",
      "\"The scale of this emergency, though, is significantly higher\u2026 I think there will be pressure on the regime to ensure unfettered and unimpeded humanitarian access - and we'll continue to repeat the same need and find ways, sometimes low-key ways, to deliver aid.\"",
      "Another aid worker, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that while it's too early to tell whether the junta will truly \"open all ways for foreign aid\", their team is prepared to navigate the complex humanitarian situation to deliver assistance.",
      "\"It's certainly a concern that they [the military] may direct the aid in specific places, and not based on need.\"",
      "\"But as humanitarian actors [our organisation] works under a humanitarian mandate, and will be very focused on getting aid to the places it needs to go - to the hardest-hit areas, regardless of who controls them.\"",
      "Early indications suggest that, despite Min Aung Hlaing's plea to the international community, the embattled junta leader is unlikely to prioritise the unfettered flow of humanitarian aid.",
      "Shortly after the earthquake, military jets launched a series of airstrikes on affected areas, killing more than 50 civilians, according to the National Unity Consultative Council (NUCC).",
      "Then, on Tuesday, Min Aung Hlaing rejected ceasefire proposals that were put forward by resistance groups in a bid to facilitate aid. Military operations would continue as \"necessary protective measures\", he said.",
      "The junta changed its mind a day later, agreeing to a 20-day ceasefire to help relief efforts. But it remains to be seen whether the pause in hostilities will hold. The military stressed it would \"respond accordingly\" if rebels launched attacks.",
      "For many onlookers, this seeming contradiction - of asking for aid with one hand while conducting military strikes with the other - chimes with Min Aung Hlaing's history of duplicity.",
      "John Quinley, from Fortify Rights, noted that the junta leader has \"lied on numerous occasions\" - and suggested that the recent appeal for foreign aid is more likely an appeal for international recognition.",
      "Against that backdrop, Mr Quinley added, it's critical to ensure earthquake relief gets to where it is most needed.",
      "\"I think as a human rights group we need to monitor: OK, [Min Aung Hlaing] allows aid in - but is it actually reaching people in need? Or is he weaponising the aid? Is he blocking the aid from getting to communities in need?\" he said.",

      "A two-month long truce, which started on 19 January, saw the return of 33 Israeli hostages - eight of them dead - in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and a big surge in humanitarian aid entering the devastated territory.",
      "Aid agencies are now calling for world powers to force Israel to allow essential goods into Gaza - including food, medicines, hygiene products and fuel - pointing to the country's obligations under international humanitarian law.",

      "Nintendo has announced a June 5 launch date for its latest gaming console, the Switch 2, which will introduce interactive chat and screenshare functions to connect gamers. Pre-orders in the U.S., however, will not start April 9 as expected \"in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,\" Nintendo said, promising to update timing soon.",
      "At its 60-minute Nintendo Direct presentation, the company revealed a more vibrant display on the Switch 2, a larger screen and several games that will launch with the console.",
      "Central to its updated system is a new \"C\" button on its Joy-Con controller, which will launch a new \"GameChat\" feature that allows you to \"communicate with friends and family while playing a game\" and lets you share your game screen with other players. A built-in microphone will also allow you to chat with other gamers. The \"GameChat\" feature requires a subscription to Nintendo's Switch online service.",
      "\"When you think about some of the biggest titles on (the Nintendo Switch), it's like Mario Kart, Super Mario Jamboree, even though that's quite a new title, has cracked the top 10 of most play games on the console. So, it does make a lot of sense that the sort of headline feature is geared primarily towards that sort of use,\" said Hannah Cowton-Barnes, a London-based video game industry expert for Tech Advisor.",
      "Perhaps the most contemporary function yet for the Switch 2 is the ability to use the Joy-Con controllers like a computer mouse. The developer displayed multiple ways to use the new function in games, such as angling a club in a golf game.",
      "The new portable console features a 7.9 inch LCD screen that displays in 1080p. Nintendo also revealed in the live stream that, when docked, the system will be able to support 4K resolution for compatible games.",
      "Wednesday's presentation started off with an extended look at \"Mario Kart World\" \u2014 the console's launch bundle game \u2014 which adds a bit of flair to the series with in-game characters doing tailwhips, flips, rail grinds and other tricks.",
      "The developer also unveiled a new James Bond game, dubbed \"Project 007,\" revisiting a classic Nintendo 64 console hit revered by many first-person shooter fans.",
      "Nintendo also announced two more Switch 2 exclusives featuring its marquee characters. \"Donkey Kong Bananza,\" a 3D adventure with the big ape punching his way through a huge underground world, arrives July 17. \"Kirby Air Riders,\" a racing game from the director of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, is due later in the year.",
      "Third-party exclusives likely to create some buzz include Koei-Tecmo's \"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,\" a hack-and-slash prequel to \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,\" coming this winter. From Software's \"The Duskbloods,\" a baroque multiplayer title from the creators of Elden Ring, is scheduled for 2026.",
      "Miss the GameCube? Nintendo said Switch Online subscribers will be able to access a limited selection of GameCube titles such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\" and \"F-Zero GX.\"",
      "The new console will be backwards compatible \u2014 able to play physical and digital Switch games \u2014 but users will need to purchase a microSD express memory card for the Switch 2. The presentation revealed that normal SD cards will not be compatible with the system. However, data from the original Switch can be transferred to the new console using a transfer feature.",
      "The original Switch, released in 2017, is \"one of the most popular game consoles of all time,\" Scott Stein, editor-at-large at CNET,\u00a0told CBS News Boston in January.",
      "It became popular in part because of its unique design. Resembling a tablet, the device has detachable pieces on each side that can be used to control game play. It also allows users to continuing playing a game on a television screen when docked on a charging station, a first-of-its-kind feature at the time.",
      "But the original has aged, leading to some of the excitement for the new version, Stein said.",
      "\"There's a lot of stuff it does well but there's a lot of stuff that people I think want it to do better for playing games they can play elsewhere,\" he said, noting the ability to take it on the go differentiates it from other gaming consoles.",
      "How much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?",
      "Nintendo will retail the Switch 2 for $449.99 at launch, which is significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. A separate bundle that includes the new \"Mario Kart World\" game will also be available for $499.99.",
      "Gene Park, a Washington Post reporter covering video games and gaming culture, told CBS News the console is \"a little pricey, but it is a more powerful system.\"",
      "He noted that the \"Mario Kart World\" game itself is priced at $80.",
      "\"It's a little eyebrow-raising. It's really the first Nintendo game to broach $80, and there's a lot of talk about video games becoming $100 right now,\" Park said.",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have hit the video game console industry at a fragile moment, said Joost van Dreunen, author of \"One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.",
      "\"At the beginning of a new hardware cycle, all of a sudden we're looking at this price hike,\" said van Dreunen, a games industry researcher. \"I had originally predicted that the Switch 2 would be $400. Now it's announced that it's $450. That $50 difference is a Trump tax.\"",
      "The tariffs, he said, impact games hardware because console devices are manufactured and shipped from China and that region at large.",
      "The early stages of a hardware life cycle are already very low margin, or usually a loss for hardware manufacturers, van Dreunen said. Those manufacturers typically eat the margin in order to get the devices out to stores.",
      "\"But with an increased tariff, that means that margin is probably even worse than it historically is. But their hands are kind of tied. They can't not progress. They can't not launch a new hardware generation. So for the consumer base, people are just going to pay more.\"",
      "The Consumer Technology Association also predicted President Trump's tariffs would drive up prices of video game consoles, and retailers like Best Buy have warned they may have to raise prices due to the tariffs.",
      "Nintendo plans to host \"Switch 2 Experience\" events in several countries, where gamers can get a hands-on experience with the new system. Those events are planned for cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris beginning this month.",

      "The smoldering intensity of actor Val Kilmer (Dec. 31, 1959-April 1, 2025) radiated off movie screens with his memorable turns as brooding artists, obsessive criminals, doomed lawmen, and a fighter jock nicknamed Iceman. He starred in such films as \"Top Gun,\" \"Heat,\" \"Tombstone\" and \"The Doors.\"",
      "While attending New York City's Juilliard School (he was admitted at age 17), Kilmer co-wrote and appeared in the play \"How It All Began.\" In 1983 he starred on Broadway in the play \"Slab Boys,\" opposite Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn. He made his movie debut in the 1984 spoof \"Top Secret!\" (from the creators of \"Airplane!\"), followed by \"Real Genius.\"",
      "One of his most memorable characters, that of pilot Tom Kazansky in 1986's \"Top Gun,\" almost didn't happen. Kilmer wrote in his 2020 memoir, \"I'm Your Huckleberry,\" that he initially turned down the role: \"I didn't want the part. I didn't care about the film. The story didn't interest me.\" Script changes led to his signing up.",
      "As a charismatic leading man, Kilmer commanded the screen playing Doc Holliday in the western \"Tombstone,\" a demolition expert in the bank heist film \"Heat,\" and rock idol Jim Morrison in \"The Doors.\" \u00a0Other films included \"Willow,\" \"Thunderheart,\" \"True Romance,\" \"The Ghost and the Darkness,\" \"The Saint,\" \"Alexander,\" \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,\" \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu,\" \"Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans,\" \"Joe the King,\" \"Spartan,\" \"Twixt,\" and \"Wonderland.\"",
      "Kilmer wrote, directed and starred in a one-man stage show in which he played humorist Mark Twain, titled \"Citizen Twain.\" He also published two books of poetry. Following treatments for cancer, Kilmer repeated the role of Iceman in the 2022 sequel, \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"",
      "A low point may have been when he donned the Batman costume to star in the 1995 film \"Batman Forever.\" He explained in the documentary \"Val\" that the suit constricted his performance: \"It was frustrating until I realized that my role in the film was just to show up and stand where I was told to.\"",
      "Kilmer's reputation for being difficult on set would dog him (John Frankenheimer, who replaced the fired director of \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" told Entertainment Weekly that there were two things he would never do: \"Climb Mount Everest, and work with Val Kilmer again\"). But he was also praised by fellow actors for his immersion into his characters.",
      "In a tribute to Kilmer, actress Jennifer Tilly recalled\u00a0the audition process for Oliver Stone's \"The Doors\": \"It was kind of a cattle call. They paired together potential Jims with potential Pamelas. And they were running behind so we were spilling out of the casting office, sitting on the porch, the lawn, and the driveway. All of a sudden, a sixties convertible came screeching up, blaring Doors Music at top volume. And a guy jumped out and strode inside: He had wild hair and he was barefoot, shirtless, and wearing nothing but a pair of tight leather pants. We all looked at each other like\u2026 Who is this guy? We were more than a little shook by the sheer audacity of his entrance. Well of course it was Val Kilmer and from that minute on, nobody else stood a chance.\""

Beginning with \"Top Gun\" alongside Tom Cruise in 1986, he turned in one iconic performance after another \u2014 able to transition effortlessly between leading man and supporting roles.",
      "There was his turn as Jim Morrison in the 1991 Oliver Stone classic \"The Doors,\" and as the quick-witted Doc Holliday in the 1993 Western \"Tombstone.\" He followed that up in 1995 as Batman in \"Batman Forever\" and played a bank robber in Michael Mann's 1995 crime thriller \"Heat.\"",

I deny none of this and have no regrets because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed. And I am blessed.\"",
      "Kilmer, who attended the prestigious Juilliard School, experienced the ups and downs of fame more dramatically than most. His break came in 1984's spy spoof \"Top Secret!\" followed by the comedy \"Real Genius\" in 1985. Kilmer would later show his comedy chops again in films including \"MacGruber\" and \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.\"",

      "The actor - who took part in the Method branch of Suzuki arts training - threw himself into parts. For his role in \"Tombstone,\" he filled his bed with ice for the final scene to mimic the feeling of dying from tuberculosis. To play Morrison, he wore leather pants all the time, asked castmates and crew to only refer to him as Jim Morrison and blasted The Doors for a year.",
      "That intensity also gave Kilmer a reputation that he was difficult to work with, something he grudgingly agreed with later in life, but always defending himself by emphasizing art over commerce.",
      "\"In an unflinching attempt to empower directors, actors and other collaborators to honor the truth and essence of each project, an attempt to breathe Suzukian life into a myriad of Hollywood moments, I had been deemed difficult and alienated the head of every major studio,\" he wrote in his memoir, \"I'm Your Huckleberry.\"",
      "One of his more iconic roles - as hotshot pilot Kazansky opposite Cruise - almost didn't happen. Kilmer was courted by director Tony Scott for \"Top Gun\" but initially balked. \"I didn't want the part. I didn't care about the film. The story didn't interest me,\" he wrote in his memoir.

      "Janet Maslin in The New York Times said Kilmer was \"hamstrung by the straight-man aspects of the role,\" while Roger Ebert deadpanned that he was a \"completely acceptable\" substitute for Keaton. Kilmer, who was one and done as Batman, blamed much of his performance on the suit.",
      "\"When you're in it, you can barely move and people have to help you stand up and sit down,\" Kilmer said in \"Val.\" \"You also can't hear anything and after a while people stop talking to you, it's very isolating. It was a struggle for me to get a performance past the suit, and it was frustrating until I realized that my role in the film was just to show up and stand where I was told to.\"",
      "His next projects were the film version of the 1960s TV series \"The Saint\" - fussily putting on wigs, accents and glasses - and \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" with Marlon Brando, which became one of the decade's most infamously cursed productions.",
      "David Gregory's 2014 documentary \"Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau,\" described a cursed set that included a hurricane, Kilmer bullying director Richard Stanley, the firing of Stanley via fax (who sneaked back on set as an extra with a mask on) and extensive rewrites by Kilmer and Brando. The older actor told the younger at one point: \"'It's a job now, Val. A lark. We'll get through it.' I was as sad as I've ever been on a set,\" Kilmer wrote in his memoir.",
      "In 1996, Entertainment Weekly ran a cover story about Kilmer titled \u2033The Man Hollywood Loves to Hate.\u2033 The directors Schumacher and John Frankenheimer, who finished \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" said he was difficult. Frankenheimer said there were two things he would never do: \u2033Climb Mount Everest and work with Val Kilmer again.\u2033",
      "Other artists came to his defense, like D. J. Caruso, who directed Kilmer in \u2033The Salton Sea\u2033 and said the actor simply liked to talk out scenes and enjoyed having a director's attention.",
      "\u2033Val needs to immerse himself in a character. I think what happened with directors like Frankenheimer and Schumacher is that Val would ask a lot of questions, and a guy like Schumacher would say, 'You're Batman! Just go do it,'\u2033 Caruso told The New York Times in 2002.",
      "After \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" the movies were smaller, like David Mamet human-trafficking thriller \"Spartan\"; \u2033Joe the King\u2033 in 1999, in which he played a paunchy, abusive alcoholic; and playing the doomed '70s porn star John Holmes in 2003's \"Wonderland.\" He also threw himself into his one-man stage show \"Citizen Twain,\" in which he played Mark Twain.",
      "\"I enjoy the depth and soul the piece has that Twain had for his fellow man and America,\" he told Variety in 2018. \"And the comedy that's always so close to the surface, and how valuable his genius is for us today. Still, we battle racism and greed. The same country, it's greatness and it's tragedy.\"",
      "Kilmer's early years",
      "Kilmer spent his formative years in the Chatsworth neighborhood of Los Angeles. He attended Chatsworth High School alongside future Oscar winner Kevin Spacey and future Emmy winner Mare Winningham. At 17, he was the youngest drama student ever admitted at the Juilliard School in 1981.",
      "Shortly after he left for Juilliard, his younger brother, 15-year-old Wesley, suffered an epileptic seizure in the family's Jacuzzi and died on the way to the hospital. Wesley was an aspiring filmmaker when he died.",
      "\u2033I miss him and miss his things. I have his art up. I like to think about what he would have created. I'm still inspired by him,\u2033 Kilmer told the Times.",
      "While still at Juilliard, Kilmer co-wrote and appeared in the play \"How It All Began\" and later turned down a role in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Outsiders\" for the Broadway play, \"Slab Boys,\" alongside Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn.",
      "Kilmer published two books of poetry (including \"My Edens After Burns\") and was nominated for a Grammy in 2012 for spoken word album for \"The Mark of Zorro.\" He was also a visual artist and a lifelong Christian Scientist.",
      "He dated Cher and married and divorced actor Joanne Whalley.",
      "He is survived by their two children, Mercedes and Jack.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump is taking center stage at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. \"We are going to make a lot of changes,\" he said earlier this month, \"including the seats, the decor, pretty much everything. It needs a lot of work.\"",
      "He's directing many of those changes as the new chairman of the board. Out are all of President Joe Biden's appointees, replaced with Trump allies.",
      "The Trump White House says an overhaul is needed because the marquee arts center is, in their words, \"woke \u2026 and broke.\"",
      "Last month, Deborah Rutter was fired as president of the Kennedy Center after serving for more than a decade. Asked whether the arts institution is broke, Rutter replied, \"The Kennedy Center has the most complicated financial model, and that is true of every nonprofit arts organization.\"",
      "It has a budget of $268 million, with $43 million coming from the federal government. In 2023, the Kennedy Center had a $6 million surplus, even though it is not supposed to be a money-making enterprise. \"We're a nonprofit organization,\" Rutter said. \"It's not intended to make money.\"",
      "Its budget comes mostly from donations. Billionaire businessman and former chairman David Rubenstein has given more than $100 million. He, too, was fired last month. Rutter said, \"To have us both leaving at the same time does cause me some worry, because of the sense of understanding of structure, decision-making, how we go about interpreting our mission, all of those kinds of things.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was founded in 1971 as a national cultural center and memorial to President John F. Kennedy. Its annual honors ceremony, which airs on CBS, features the best in music, theater and dance.",
      "But now, conservatives charge the center is \"too liberal,\" highlighting three drag events last year, including a \"Broadway Drag Brunch.\"",
      "Asked whether it was a mistake to host drag shows, Rutter replied, \"I don't think so. I believe that everybody in America has the opportunity to be seen, and to be seen at your national cultural center.\"",
      "She pointed out that the shows Trump referred to in a social media post (\"THIS WILL STOP,\" he promised) represented just three of the 2,000 performances that took place at the Kennedy Center last year.",
      "Asked why the focus was on three drag shows, Rutter replied, \"I can't actually imagine. Drag has been around for centuries. Shakespeare performed in drag, the original Shakespeare.\"",
      "President Trump boycotted the Kennedy Center Honors during his first term, after criticism from honorees like Norman Lear. So, what does the new chairman have planned now? In audio obtained by \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" he suggests a new host \u2013 himself:",
      "\"The king of ratings, right? Whether we like it or not, the king of ratings! So, if I was the host of the Honors, and we'll go slightly more conservative, if you don't mind, with some of the people\u2026\"",
      "So, what kind of people does President Trump want to honor? Paolo Zampolli, a longtime friend of the president who has been on the board since 2020, said, \"There were mentioned a list of people, I remember the name of Pavarotti. I remember the name of Andrea Bocelli. They wanted to do something about Elvis Presley.\"",
      "Zampolli has suggested changes to make the Kennedy Center \"better\": \"We're on the Potomac River. We could have a little marina where in the weekend boats can come, and nice cafes, nice location where they can spend the weekend there and make it like a destination. Other things that I suggested is branch franchises around the world.\"",
      "Another idea? Sending art to the International Space Station. \"My idea was to have, not Michelangelo, not Picasso, but you know, living contemporary artists to create very small pieces of art,\" Zampolli said, \"One that can be displayed inside the ISS. One can be thrown in LEO, low orbit, that can circulate in the orbit. And one can be auctioned on the ground of the Kennedy Center, because they need to raise money.\"",
      "Some artists (including those who are LGBTQ) have expressed the belief that they won't be welcome at the Kennedy Center. But Zampolli said, \"I don't think the president have anything against these kind of people. I don't understand what is things 'inclusion' or this 'woke.' The Kennedy Center is accessible for everybody, and has to represent the agenda of America.\"",
      "Not everyone agrees. One thing you won't see at the Center is the musical \"Hamilton.\" Producers cancelled shows after President Trump became chairman. The president's response? \"I never liked 'Hamilton' very much. I never liked it.\"",
      "There have been several other high-profile cancellations and resignations; and Vice President JD Vance was boo-ed at a recent performance.",

      "Asked whether there was any political involvement then, Folds replied, \"Never saw anything like this. This is new, and it was quite sudden. Let's say I get in an artist that has different views than the president. Do they feel safe being themselves? Do they feel safe saying what they believe? They're not political shows, but you can express what you'd like to.\"",
      "And is that no longer the case? \"Well, I suspect it's no longer the case,\" Folds said. \"There is an instinct, an authoritarian instinct, that is true in all authoritarian times in history: Take control of the culture, take control of the arts early on.\"",

      "Now, Rutter says she hopes the institution's founding message isn't forgotten. \"I often go back to Eisenhower's words, and then Kennedy's words, to think about, who are we? What do we do? We believe that all of Americans should be seen and should feel welcome at the Kennedy Center.\"",

    "summary": "To young Brandi Carlile, a girl coming of age and struggling with her own sexuality, Elton John was a flicker of hope in a confusing world. Today, the two music superstars are friends and collaborators, recording an album together, \"Who Believes in Angels?\"",
    "story": [
      "Sir Elton John has millions of fans all over the world, but few of them as devoted as a young girl who first heard his music more than 30 years ago.",
      "In 1992, Brandi Marie Carlile was a kid living in a single-wide trailer in rural Washington State, and to her, Elton John was everything. Young Brandi collected everything about him she could get her hands on \u2013 records, photos, even an Elton John book she borrowed from a library 33 years ago, and kept(!). \"The date is still on here. Boulevard Park Library, May 10, 1992. It's all time stamped. And they're gonna have to come and get it!\"",
      "Little Brandi is now music superstar Brandi Carlile, but to a young girl coming of age and struggling with her own sexuality, Elton John was a flicker of hope in a confusing world. She loved him, and said so in writing, covering an entire page front to back with \"I love Elton John.\" \"It's insane,\" she said. \"I look at it now. I just can't believe what happened in my life to get me to where I am now. It's such a strange thing. It makes you wonder, it just makes you wonder. I do love Elton John!\"",
      "As a kid, she never dreamed she'd get to actually meet him one day, but sometimes dreams have a funny way of coming true. Now they're not only friends, but collaborators. It started a few years back when Carlile wrote to John out of the blue, and asked him to play piano on her new record.\u00a0 Long story short, he said yes, and they grew to be the best of friends \u2013 appearing together, performing together, even vacationing together with their families.",
      "And now, they're about to release an album they made together, recorded at Sunset Sound in Hollywood. It's Brandi Carlile's eighth studio album, and Elton John's 33rd.",
      "So, why did they decide to do an entire album together? John said, \"She's someone I wanted to work with for so long because I know how great she is. I know how her voice is, and I knew what she's capable of, and I wanted to push her more. And I wanted her to push me more. So, I wanted to make a record that was full of energy and great songs. And it turned out really brilliantly.\"",
      "There were cameras in the studio to capture all the highs, and a few of the lows. \"I didn't even think of them being there,\" John said.",
      "\"Yeah, I never saw one,\" Carlile said.",
      "It got tense at times (John admits, \"I haven't really seen the footage, but a lotta people say it's really, really very moving. And all of my behavior is not so moving!\"), but for Brandi, it was still the greatest show on Earth. \"It really felt like I was watching Mozart or, like, one of the great composers,\" she said. \"Stream of consciousness through their entire body, create music in a way that I've never seen. And I was so close. I had a front-row seat.\"",
      "John called it \"one of the greatest musical experiences of my life.\"",
      "Elton John and Brandi Carlile perform \"Swing For The Fences\":",
      "The fact that John got through the recording process at all is remarkable. For the past year, he's been fighting a severe eye infection that's left him nearly blind. But he says that, all things considered, he's doing all right. \"Medically, I'm fit as I've ever been,\" he said. \"I have checkups every month. But the eyesight thing is a bit of a bind, because I haven't been able to watch anything for about seven months. I haven't been able to read. I haven't been able to watch television or anything.",
      "\"But you know what? I've come to the conclusion that if we can't find a solution to it, and this is what it's like for the rest of my life, then I'm okay,\" he said. \"I can still play the piano. I can still sing, which is a gift. My life's fantastic. It's still the greatest gift that anyone could have.\"",
      "These days, John, who turned 78 this past week, is counting his blessings. But the final track on the album really struck a nerve: \"When This Old World Is Done With Me,\" co-written by longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin.",
      "He got very emotional in the studio while recording it: \"Well, I started singing, and I thought the verse was really beautiful. But then I had no idea what was coming. And when I got to the chorus, I realized what was coming, and I just broke down. And I sobbed, and I sobbed, and I sobbed, because it's about my death, basically. And when you get to my age, and a certain age, you think about mortality, because I wanna spend so much time with my children and David and my friends, that you want every single moment to count. And so, this was a song about I don't want to die. I wanna be with my children. I wanna be with David forever. And so, it really got to me.\"",
      "David is husband David Furnish. The two were married in 2014. They have two sons, Zachary and Elijah.",
      "Dad might be a global superstar, but there's no doubt where his heart is. Asked what he is most proud of, John replied, \"Yeah, my kids. My husband. That's it. All I want on my gravestone is, 'He was a great dad.' Nothing to do with music. 'He was a great dad.' That's all I care about.\"",
      "Their new album will be released this week, and for Carlile, it's still a little hard to believe: \"Yeah, it's so weird. Is it not? It's brilliant. Like, it's a wonderful thing. I hope everybody can take some hope and beauty and mysticism from the fact that this has happened. If it could happen to 11-year-old single-wide mobile home Brandi Carlile, it could really happen to anyone.\"",
      "Turns out these two friends don't just lean on each other; they push each other to new heights. The title track of their album is \"Who Believes In Angels?\" But maybe Elton John and Brandi Carlile are angels for each other.",
      "Elton John and Brandi Carlile perform \"Who Believes In Angels?\":",
      "John said, \"God, it was a challenge. But that's what life's all about. If you don't have a challenge at 76, then never give up. Never coast. There are so many artists that coast that don't make new songs. They just go around and play their hits, like I did. I didn't wanna do it with this record. I wanted a new start. I want a fresh start.",
      "\"And she gave it to me.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 03 Apr 2025 21:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Multiple FDA labs were cut amid Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs this week.",
    "story": [
      "Some of the Food and Drug Administration's efforts to support testing for the ongoing bird flu outbreak have been disrupted due to steep layoffs at the agency, multiple officials told CBS News Thursday, in the latest fallout from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s cuts to the nation's federal health agencies.",
      "In one example, a planned FDA exercise with a network of veterinary testing labs around the country to ensure they are able to detect the virus in milk has been suspended, due to the elimination of the agency's food safety lab in Illinois, two federal health officials said.",
      "Officials had planned the exercise for 40 laboratories across the FDA-backed Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, as well as additional government-backed and private labs, which are using different methods to test for the virus.",
      "\"Unfortunately, significant Reductions In Force (RIF), including a key quality assurance officer, at FDA's Human Food Program Moffett Center has caused immediate and significant impact on the Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network,\" read an email sent Thursday to members of the laboratory network, obtained by CBS News.",
      "News of the disruption to the FDA exercise was first reported by Reuters.",
      "The effort \"would have been critical to ensure confidence in the laboratory methods for food safety and animal health,\" the email read.",
      "Labs are testing milk both to detect the virus in sick cattle as well as for food safety purposes, an official said.",
      "The department has laid off some 10,000 workers under a plan drawn up by Kennedy and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting task force. The FDA lost around 3,500 full-time employees due to the layoffs, including staff supporting the agency's food and drug safety inspectors.",
      "\"This overhaul is about realigning HHS with its core mission: to stop the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again. Despite spending $1.9 trillion in annual costs, Americans are getting sicker every year, and we must shift course,\" an HHS official said in a statement.",
      "The official said that HHS layoffs \"focused personnel cuts on redundant or unnecessary administrative positions.\"",
      "\"HHS also reduced its regional footprint by moving out of the highest cost cities, shuttering offices in Boston, Chicago, NYC, San Francisco, and Seattle,\" the statement said.",
      "Other federal labs have been gutted due to Kennedy's cuts, including U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention labs investigating STD and hepatitis outbreaks.",
      "Another disrupted bird flu effort was at the FDA's San Francisco-area food safety testing lab, two officials said.",
      "That lab is responsible for food safety testing for both humans and animals, officials said. One official said the lab had been setting up to begin testing pet food for bird flu, as part of the agency's regulatory response to outbreaks.",
      "Now the lab has been closed, with staff also completely eliminated as part of Kennedy's cuts on Tuesday. It is unclear whether the agency's remaining labs will be able to fill the gap.",
      "Several multistate recalls of pet food for bird flu contamination have been announced by health authorities in recent months, after cats and other animals were sickened. The virus has been especially lethal to pet cats.",
      "In the final days of the Biden administration, the FDA's veterinary center called on pet food manufacturers to take additional steps to ensure their products were free of the virus.",
      "Through the center, the FDA has oversight over the safety of drugs and food given to animals, including pets.",

    "story": [
      "Senior Food and Drug Administration leaders are planning for cutbacks to the number of routine food and drug inspections conducted by the agency, multiple officials say, due to steep layoffs this week in support staff.",
      "Around 170 workers were cut from the FDA's Office of Inspections and Investigations, according to two federal health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services has said layoffs ordered\u00a0by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with some 10,000 workers let go from the department, would not directly cut FDA's inspections staff. But in meetings among federal health officials, the agency's remaining leaders have grappled with how to deal with major delays and disruptions caused by the loss of administrative and management staff who had supported the agency's inspectors, according to two FDA officials.",
      "\"These administrative functions are being streamlined as part of HHS' transformation initiative to make the agency more efficient and responsive. FDA inspectors were not impacted and this critical work will continue,\" an HHS spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The inspections and investigations office will now need to work with FDA's drug, device and food centers to reprioritize their workload for the rest of the year, one official said. That will mean trimming routine \"surveillance inspections\" for more urgent tasks, the official said, like inspections of firms where the agency has been alerted to a safety risk or follow-up visits to ensure that drugmakers or food producers have fixed previous violations.",
      "One of the biggest immediate impacts on the agency's inspectors stems from the elimination of the office's travel operations division, one official said. The team's work ranged from booking flights to coordinating with the State Department to secure translators needed for inspections of drugmakers and food producers abroad.",
      "\"As of yesterday, all front-line investigators will now be spending significant time processing their own travel and related administrative requirements, rather than spending that time in firms ensuring the American consumer is protected,\" one FDA official told CBS News.",
      "A pilot program of unannounced foreign inspections has also been paused due to the cuts, an official said, because of the loss of staff that had been tasked with quickly securing translators around the world.",
      "The FDA has long struggled to meet its own inspection goals, which was worsened by a backlog created during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a January report by the Government Accountability Office, the FDA was facing a swelling list of food safety inspections that were on track to miss deadlines mandated by Congress, as they struggled to hire and retain qualified inspectors.",
      "While current inspections are still taking place, multiple FDA officials said that cuts are likely to worsen delays caused by other challenges introduced by the Trump administration's efforts to cut spending in recent months.",
      "As one example, multiple officials said that field operations have been hampered by a new government-wide $1 limit on spending cards. Any spending above that limit requires a cumbersome approval process.",
      "Inspectors had already been asked to plan their inspections a month in advance due to the delays caused by the spending limit, one official said.",

    "summary": "Stocks continued to tumble in the U.S. Friday as financial markets suffered their biggest two-day drop since 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Financial markets ended a tumultuous week with a thud, as stocks tumbled for a second straight day on concerns about the economic fallout from new U.S. tariffs and the prospects of a global trade war.",
      "President Trump's announcement of steep tariffs on Wednesday shocked investors and sent economists scurrying to revise downward their forecasts for U.S. economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also warned that the levies \u2014 which include a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nearly 90 countries \u2014 are likely to dent the economy.",
      "\"While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,\" Powell\u00a0said in a speech Friday in Arlington, Virginia. \"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\"",
      "The S&P 500 fell 322 points, or nearly 6%, to close at 5,074 \u2014 the largest one-day slump in the broad-based index since March 16, 2020, when it lost 12%. Today's plunge erased $2.7 trillion in market value from the index. The decline wipes out more than a year of stock market gains, taking the S&P 500 back to its levels in February 2024.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2,231 points, or 5.5%, and is down 14% since peaking in February. The Nasdaq Composite slid 963 points, or 5.8%. That means the the tech-heavy index is now in a bear market, or when stocks drop at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "Tech stocks have flailed this week because of concerns that American tariffs on China \u2014 along with countermeasures from Beijing \u2014 will hurt the high-tech sector, which has been key to driving corporate profits.",
      "\"The economic pain that will be brought by these tariffs [is] hard to describe and can essentially take the U.S. tech industry back a decade in the process while China steamrolls ahead,\" Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said in a report.",
      "Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, told clients that the U.S. could tip into a recession later this year unless the U.S. moves to ease tariffs.",
      "\"In the near term, we believe the effective tariff rates could be higher still, and without President Trump taking active steps to reduce tariffs over the next three to six months, we are likely to enter a downside scenario, including a meaningful U.S. recession and lower equity markets,\" he said in a research note.",
      "The free-fall amounts to the biggest two-day drop for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since March 2020, when the pandemic began, and has wiped out trillions of dollars in investor wealth.",
      "Drops of this magnitude aren't unheard of on Wall Street, but they're rare. Over the last 25 years, the S&P 500 has fallen 4% in a single day 38 times, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for brokerage firm LPL Financial.",
      "Overseas markets also slid Friday. In overnight trading in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 dropped 2.8%, while South Korea's Kospi sank 0.9%. In European trading, Germany's DAX lost 2%, France's CAC 40 in Paris dipped 1.6% and Britain's FTSE 100 shed 1.7%.",
      "U.S. growth downgraded",
      "Economists have downgraded their outlook for U.S. economic growth this year as Mr. Trump piles tariffs on a growing list of countries, warning that the levies are likely to boost inflation. That could reduce consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, as well as crimp business investment.",
      "Import taxes are largely borne by businesses, which typically pass on part or much of those added costs to consumers. As a result, Americans could face higher prices for electronics, household appliances, cars, clothing, furniture, and food such as coffee and chocolate, according to economists.",
      "\"Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters,\" Powell said\u00a0Friday.",
      "According to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research firm, the Trump administration's tariffs could cost U.S. households more than $1,900 this year.",
      "David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, thinks U.S. trade officials will eventually lower tariff rates as they negotiate with their counterparts abroad. But that process is likely to take time, and the investment bank doesn't expect a speedy reversal in U.S. tariffs. As a result, UBS economists have lowered their forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to less than 1%.",
      "China strikes back",
      "Investors are also nervously watching as the barrage of U.S. tariffs prompts retaliation from key trading partners. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014 materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose trade sanctions on 27 additional U.S. companies.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "In more upbeat news for financial markets, U.S. employers added 228,000 jobs in March, far exceeding analyst forecasts. The nation's unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, versus 4.1% in February.",
      "Yet while job growth was robust last month, experts say the government's latest hiring numbers don't reflect the impact of the Trump administration's trade policies on the economy.",
      "\"For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,\" Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, said of this week's downdraft in stocks.",

      "When announcing his latest round of tariffs on April 2, President Trump veered into the subject of eggs, noting that prices \"dropped now 59%, and they're going down more, and the availability is fantastic.\"",
      "Wholesale egg prices \u2014 or the price paid by large buyers like grocery stores \u2014 have declined 43% since year start, with much of the decline occurring since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. While retail data for March isn't yet available, grocery stores tell CBS MoneyWatch that lower prices are now starting to trickle down to consumers, and that there should be plenty of eggs available for Easter and Passover later this month.",
      "Lower egg prices may represent a bright point for consumers at a time when inflation remains sticky, and\u00a0may reignite\u00a0this year due Mr. Trump's tariffs, economists say. The new levies are set to hit all imports from food products to automobiles. Egg prices have declined partly due to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's five-point plan to tackle the issue, which includes battling the bird flu and importing eggs\u00a0from nations including Turkey and South Korea.",
      "Egg prices at Northeast grocery chain Stew Leonard's have declined recently, with conventional eggs now down to to about $5.99 a dozen from $10 a dozen at their peak in December, said Andrew Hollis, director of sales.",
      "\"We're definitely back to low price eggs again \u2014 there's lot of relief and plenty of supply,\" Hollis told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our demand will go up 40% for Easter, so we're not worried at all and feel like we'll have plenty of eggs on the shelf.\"",
      "Demand for eggs also fell due to the high retail prices at the end of 2024, which caused some households to cut back on buying them, Hollis added. That's allowed farmers to rebuild their supply, he said.",
      "Walmart, one of the nation's biggest grocers, also said that its egg prices have declined in recent weeks, although it didn't specify the decline. A dozen eggs are retailing for about $5 a dozen, according to Walmart's website.",
      "After months of the bird flu impacting egg supplies and prices, egg losses\u00a0due to the disease declined in March, according to a release last week by USDA.",
      "But one issue that could pose a threat to egg prices are Mr. Trump's new tariffs, which will apply import taxes to products from all nations, including Turkey and South Korea, where the U.S. has an agreement to source additional eggs. The nations will face tariffs of 10% and 25%, respectively. Those taxes are likely to be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Friday said he would sign another executive order to delay enforcement of a law that effectively bans TikTok, amid talks about a possible deal to sell the widely popular platform.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0signed an executive order on his first day directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days. The order instructed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against \"any entity for any noncompliance.\" The executive order expires Saturday, April 5.",
      "Mr. Trump said Friday he wouldn't enforce the law for at least another 75 days.",
      "\"My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed,\" the president wrote. \"We do not want TikTok to 'go dark.' We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal.\"",
      "A deal had been reached Wednesday between investors, TikTok's Beijing-based parent company ByteDance and the U.S. government that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, according to a source familiar with the plans. The deal allowed ByteDance to keep a minority stake, and Mr. Trump planned to sign an order approving the deal and allowing for a 120-day closing period.",
      "But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House on Thursday that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, ByteDance, originally had until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services.",
      "TikTok\u00a0briefly and voluntarily shut down before the January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action.",
      "Apple and Google did not\u00a0restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores for nearly a month after Mr. Trump issued the first directive.",
      "Even though Mr. Trump has declined to enforce the ban, the law is still on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. But the law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok in the event of a sale.",
      "When TikTok challenged the law last year, it argued that it never had a choice between divestment or a ban because a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\" The Chinese government previously vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user.",
      "In a statement after Mr. Trump's announcement Friday, a ByteDance spokesperson acknowledged the company has been in discussions with the U.S. government about \"a potential solution.\"",
      "\"An agreement has not been executed. There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested last month he could ease tariffs on the Chinese if they approved the deal.",
      "\"Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,\" the president said on March 27. \"Every point in tariffs is worth more than TikTok.\"",
      "But on Wednesday he announced he would impose a 34% additional tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S.",
      "Lawmakers, however, are likely to be dissatisfied if any deal does not fully sever ties between ByteDance and TikTok.",
      "\"If ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal \u2014 plain and simple,\" Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China Committee, said last month.",
      "He said a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. while using ByteDance's algorithm runs afoul of the law because ByteDance would still have access to user data.",
      "\"This setup reeks of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2014 in 2023, through the failed Project Texas, ByteDance tried to create the illusion of better data privacy by storing Americans' data on U.S. servers, all while ByteDance kept its grip on the platform. On the surface, shifting data storage to the United States might have seemed like a reasonable fix, but it ignored the real issue: ByteDance's control over TikTok,\" Moolenaar\u00a0wrote in an opinion piece in the National Review last month.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. But the Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Moolenaar and Republican members of the China committee said in a statement Friday that they \"stand firm\" in their position.",
      "\"Any resolution must ensure that U.S. law is followed, and that the Chinese Communist Party does not have access to American user data or the ability to manipulate the content consumed by Americans,\" they said. \"We remain committed to enforcing the framework established by Congress to safeguard the American people.\"",
      "During a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last year, then-Sen. Marco Rubio, who's now secretary of state, explained that U.S. officials viewed TikTok as a national security threat because the algorithm that powers the platform is controlled by a China-based company. The Chinese government, he said, could force TikTok to give it access to the data it collects on tens of millions of Americans or use it to push propaganda to them.",
      "\"TikTok does not work without that algorithm, and that algorithm is controlled by a company that's controlled by the Chinese Communist Party under the law of China,\" Rubio said.",
      "Three Democratic senators\u00a0wrote to Mr. Trump in March asking him to work with Congress to find a long-term solution to TikTok's survival. The senators \u2014 Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Cory Booker of New Jersey \u2014 said they opposed a TikTok ban, but called it \"unacceptable and unworkable\" for the Trump administration \"to continue ignoring the requirements in the law.\"",
      "TikTok challenged the law in court, but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court days before it took effect. The Supreme Court's decision said the divest-or-ban law does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S., agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans.",

      "The Trump administration's expansive new tariffs will likely lead to higher inflation and slower growth, and the Federal Reserve will focus on keeping price increases temporary, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday.",
      "The Fed chair's remarks come two days after Trump unveiled\u00a0sweeping tariffs that have upended the global economy and sent stock prices in the U.S. and overseas plunging, with investors nervously watching as key trading partners retaliate. China on Friday said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, the day after Mr. Trump's new tariffs go into effect.",
      "In written remarks delivered in Arlington, Virginia, Powell said that the tariffs and their impacts on the economy and inflation are \"significantly larger than expected.\" He also said that the import taxes are \"highly likely\" to lead to \"at least a temporary rise in inflation,\" but added that \"it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent.\"",
      "\"Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters,\" Powell said. \"Our obligation is to ... make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,\" he added.",
      "Powell's focus on inflation suggests that the Fed will likely keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at about 4.3% in the coming months. That is likely to disappoint Wall Street investors, who now expect five interest rate cuts this year, a number that has increased since President Donald Trump announced the tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Trump on Friday, in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, urged Powell to cut rates, writing that now would be the \"PERFECT time\" to do it. The president went on to criticize the Fed chair as \"always 'late,'\" adding that \"he could now change his image, and quickly.\"",
      "Economists forecast that the tariffs will weaken the economy, possibly threaten hiring, and push up prices. In that scenario, the Fed could cut rates to bolster the economy, or it could keep rates unchanged \u2014 or even hike them \u2014 to combat inflation. Powell's comments suggest the Fed will mostly focus on inflation.",
      "\"At the Fed, we are squarely focused on achieving the dual-mandate goals Congress has given us of maximum employment and stable prices,\" said Powell. \"While uncertainty is high and downside risks have risen, the economy is still in a good place. The incoming data show solid growth, a labor market in balance, and inflation running much closer to, but still above, our 2% objective.\"",
      "Tricky combination",
      "Weaker growth and higher prices are a tricky combination for the Fed. Typically the central bank would reduce its key interest rate to lower borrowing costs and spur the economy in the event of slower growth, while it would raise rates \u2014 or keep them elevated \u2014 to slow spending and combat inflation.",
      "\"We are closely watching this tension between the hard and soft data,\" said Powell. \"As the new policies and their likely economic effects become clearer, we will have a better sense of their implications for the economy and for monetary policy.\"",
      "Some positive news arrived Friday when the government reported that hiring accelerated in March, with\u00a0228,000 jobs added, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, from 4.1%.",
      "Yet those figures measure hiring in mid-March, before the scope of the duties became clear. The tariffs have also raised uncertainty about how the economy will fare in the coming months, which could limit businesses' willingess to invest and hire.",

    "summary": "Economists say that President Trump's wide-ranging new tariffs raise the risk of a recession or stagflation.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is promising that his April 2 \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0volley of tariffs will \"make America wealthy again\" by repatriating manufacturing jobs and reviving demand for American-made products. But many economists are taking a different view, warning that the tariffs could lead to more dire economic scenarios, including a recession or stagflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has said the two new tariffs he unveiled Wednesday \u2014 a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and so-called\u00a0reciprocal tariffs\u00a0applied to imports from about 90 nations \u2014 will revitalize American manufacturing, create jobs and generate federal revenue.",
      "But economists are ringing alarm bells as they digest the impact of the wide-ranging tariffs, which they forecast will accelerate inflation and dampen U.S. economic growth. That's because Mr. Trump's tariffs will be paid by U.S. businesses that import goods and materials from other countries, and they are likely to pass on some or all of those costs to consumers through higher prices.",
      "As a result, experts say, inflation is likely to reignite, which could cause some U.S. households to back on spending. Because consumer spending accounts for about 70 cents of every $1 in GDP, economic growth could slow.",
      "Together, those outcomes could create \"stagflation,\" a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that describes periods when economic growth falters even as prices remain painfully high.",
      "The risks of recession\u00a0\u2014 a downturn that includes at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the nation's gross domestic product \u2014 are also rising due to Mr. Trump's latest tariffs, according to new estimates from several Wall Street economists.",
      "If the fresh U.S. tariffs spur retaliatory measures from other nations, \"serious recessions\" could emerge both in the U.S. and globally, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. A U.S. recession would likely reduce GDP by 2% and boost unemployment next year to 7.5%, up from its current rate of 4.1%, he estimated.",
      "On Friday, China announced it would implement a 34% retaliatory tariff on U.S. imports beginning April 10, a day after Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs are slated to go into effect.",
      "Still, for now that scenario remains unlikely, with Zandi assigning it a 15% probability. If the Trump administration drops some tariffs and offers exemptions for some products or nations, a recession would be more mild, with unemployment topping out at 5.5%, he added. Zandi said he is giving a 35% probability to this outcome.",
      "To be sure, while many economists are raising the likelihood of a recession, they also say the economy remains relatively strong, with low unemployment and steady growth. Much depends on whether the Trump administration sticks with its tariffs or eases up on some policies.",
      "Brace for higher inflation",
      "More certain is that Mr. Trump's tariffs will boost inflation, noted Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. Consumer prices could accelerate by 1 percentage point by year-end, he added, which would boost the inflation rate close to 4% from its current level.",
      "That could prove painful for many Americans, including for supporters of Mr. Trump who backed his candidacy because of his promises to \"end the inflation nightmare\" of the post-pandemic years. According to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll,\u00a0 most Americans said the president has focused too much on\u00a0tariffs, which they fear could end up raising prices, and not enough on lowering consumer costs.",
      "A hike in inflation from Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs could add $1,000 in annual costs for low-income households, Daco estimated. Products ranging from Apple's iPhones, which are largely manufactured in China, to clothing made in Vietnam could spike in price due to the reciprocal tariffs, with those nations facing rates of 34% and 46%, respectively.",
      "However, other estimates predict a bigger hit to Americans' budgets, with the Yale Budget Lab forecasting that the April 2 tariffs will cost a typical household about $2,148.",
      "\"With the most significant tariff increases targeting countries central to the U.S. supply chain for consumer goods \u2014 China, Vietnam, Taiwan and Cambodia \u2014 households should expect higher prices across a wide range of everyday items,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.",
      "Here's what other top economists are predicting",
      "Oxford Economics: \"[T]he announced tariffs will significantly raise the effective U.S. tariff rate to slightly less than 30%, matching levels not seen since the 1930s .... Oxford Economics' Global Economic Model [forecasts] U.S. GDP growth at 1.4% and core inflation rising to 3.9% this year.\" \u2014Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist",
      "PNC Financial Services: \"The U.S. economy is in good shape at the start of the second quarter, but the ongoing trade war has increased the risk of near-term recession dramatically.\" \u2014Economist Ershang Liang",
      "Nationwide: \"[W]e revise down our real GDP growth estimate to a range of zero \u20130.5% Q4/Q4 2025 (previously we forecast 1% \u2013 1.5% growth, while significant retaliation by our trading partners could tip GDP growth negative and result in a recession.\" \u2014Chief economist Kathy Bostjancic",
      "Capital Economics: \"[W]e see U.S. GDP growth slowing to around 1.5% annualized, but the risks are to the downside and we would put the odds of a recession at about 30%. U.S. CPI inflation now looks set to jump to around 4.5% later this year.\" \u2014Its global economics team",
      "Deutsche Bank: \"[T]hese actions could potentially shave 1 - 1.5 [percentage points] from growth this year and add a broadly similar amount to core PCE inflation .... Recession risks will likely rise materially if these tariffs are sustained.\" \u2014Economics team",
      "Morningstar: \"The tariff hikes announced April 2, if maintained, represent a self-inflicted economic catastrophe for the U.S. .... We haven't yet published a full update, but we'll likely be reducing our U.S. real GDP growth forecast for 2025 and 2026. The upward impact on inflation will likely be of a similar magnitude.\" \u2014Chief US economist Preston Caldwell",

Pre-orders in the U.S., however, will not start April 9 as expected \"in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,\" Nintendo said, promising to update timing soon.",
      "At its 60-minute Nintendo Direct presentation, the company revealed a more vibrant display on the Switch 2, a larger screen and several games that will launch with the console.",
      "Central to its updated system is a new \"C\" button on its Joy-Con controller, which will launch a new \"GameChat\" feature that allows you to \"communicate with friends and family while playing a game\" and lets you share your game screen with other players. A built-in microphone will also allow you to chat with other gamers. The \"GameChat\" feature requires a subscription to Nintendo's Switch online service.",
      "\"When you think about some of the biggest titles on (the Nintendo Switch), it's like Mario Kart, Super Mario Jamboree, even though that's quite a new title, has cracked the top 10 of most play games on the console. So, it does make a lot of sense that the sort of headline feature is geared primarily towards that sort of use,\" said Hannah Cowton-Barnes, a London-based video game industry expert for Tech Advisor.",
      "Perhaps the most contemporary function yet for the Switch 2 is the ability to use the Joy-Con controllers like a computer mouse. The developer displayed multiple ways to use the new function in games, such as angling a club in a golf game.",
      "The new portable console features a 7.9 inch LCD screen that displays in 1080p. Nintendo also revealed in the live stream that, when docked, the system will be able to support 4K resolution for compatible games.",
      "Wednesday's presentation started off with an extended look at \"Mario Kart World\" \u2014 the console's launch bundle game \u2014 which adds a bit of flair to the series with in-game characters doing tailwhips, flips, rail grinds and other tricks.",
      "The developer also unveiled a new James Bond game, dubbed \"Project 007,\" revisiting a classic Nintendo 64 console hit revered by many first-person shooter fans.",
      "Nintendo also announced two more Switch 2 exclusives featuring its marquee characters. \"Donkey Kong Bananza,\" a 3D adventure with the big ape punching his way through a huge underground world, arrives July 17. \"Kirby Air Riders,\" a racing game from the director of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, is due later in the year.",
      "Third-party exclusives likely to create some buzz include Koei-Tecmo's \"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,\" a hack-and-slash prequel to \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,\" coming this winter. From Software's \"The Duskbloods,\" a baroque multiplayer title from the creators of Elden Ring, is scheduled for 2026.",
      "Miss the GameCube? Nintendo said Switch Online subscribers will be able to access a limited selection of GameCube titles such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\" and \"F-Zero GX.\"",
      "The new console will be backwards compatible \u2014 able to play physical and digital Switch games \u2014 but users will need to purchase a microSD express memory card for the Switch 2. The presentation revealed that normal SD cards will not be compatible with the system. However, data from the original Switch can be transferred to the new console using a transfer feature.",
      "The original Switch, released in 2017, is \"one of the most popular game consoles of all time,\" Scott Stein, editor-at-large at CNET,\u00a0told CBS News Boston in January.",
      "It became popular in part because of its unique design. Resembling a tablet, the device has detachable pieces on each side that can be used to control game play. It also allows users to continuing playing a game on a television screen when docked on a charging station, a first-of-its-kind feature at the time.",
      "But the original has aged, leading to some of the excitement for the new version, Stein said.",
      "\"There's a lot of stuff it does well but there's a lot of stuff that people I think want it to do better for playing games they can play elsewhere,\" he said, noting the ability to take it on the go differentiates it from other gaming consoles.",
      "How much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?",
      "Nintendo will retail the Switch 2 for $449.99 at launch, which is significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. A separate bundle that includes the new \"Mario Kart World\" game will also be available for $499.99.",
      "Gene Park, a Washington Post reporter covering video games and gaming culture, told CBS News the console is \"a little pricey, but it is a more powerful system.\"",
      "He noted that the \"Mario Kart World\" game itself is priced at $80.",
      "\"It's a little eyebrow-raising. It's really the first Nintendo game to broach $80, and there's a lot of talk about video games becoming $100 right now,\" Park said.",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have hit the video game console industry at a fragile moment, said Joost van Dreunen, author of \"One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.",
      "\"At the beginning of a new hardware cycle, all of a sudden we're looking at this price hike,\" said van Dreunen, a games industry researcher. \"I had originally predicted that the Switch 2 would be $400. Now it's announced that it's $450. That $50 difference is a Trump tax.\"",
      "The tariffs, he said, impact games hardware because console devices are manufactured and shipped from China and that region at large.",
      "The early stages of a hardware life cycle are already very low margin, or usually a loss for hardware manufacturers, van Dreunen said. Those manufacturers typically eat the margin in order to get the devices out to stores.",
      "\"But with an increased tariff, that means that margin is probably even worse than it historically is. But their hands are kind of tied. They can't not progress. They can't not launch a new hardware generation. So for the consumer base, people are just going to pay more.\"",
      "The Consumer Technology Association also predicted President Trump's tariffs would drive up prices of video game consoles, and retailers like Best Buy have warned they may have to raise prices due to the tariffs.",

      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations will face only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries will be charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports will face the baseline rate of 10%, while China will face a 34% tariff.",

      "Asian nations will face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic. On top of China's 34% reciprocal tariff, imports from that nation will also face previously announced 20% tariffs, bringing that nation's total rate to more than 60%, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",

      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",

    "story": [
      "Stocks cratered in the U.S. on Thursday as anxious investors tried to assess the potential economic impact of the latest round of Trump administration tariffs.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1,679 points, or 4%, to close at 40,546. The S&P 500 sank 274 points, or 4.8%, its biggest one-day drop since Covid-19 torpedoed financial markets in 2020. That amounts to a loss of roughly $2 trillion, according to data from FactSet.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq also suffered its worst session since the pandemic, dropping more than 1,050 points, or nearly 6%. That nosedive reflects investor concerns about how steep tariffs on China, Taiwan, Vietnam and other manufacturing hubs could impact technology companies, analysts said.",
      "Futures trading overnight pointed to more deep declines at the opening. As of 6:45 a.m. EDT, the Dow was down a whopping 1.053 points, the S&P 142 points \u00a0and the Nasdaq 531.50 points, according to Bloomberg.",
      "Asian stocks fell further Friday, though markets in Shanghai, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia were closed for holidays, limiting the extent of the day's declines, The Associated Press reported. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 2.8% while South Korea's Kospi sank 0.9%.",
      "European markets lost more ground, the AP said. Germany's DAX fell 2%. The CAC 40 in Paris was off 1.6%. And Britain's FTSE 100 declined 1.7%.",
      "Shares of Apple, which has diversified its international supply chains in recent years but which still makes most of its iPhones in China, dropped nearly 10% Thursday. The new duties raise the nominal U.S. tariff rate on China to 54%.",
      "\"Investor psychology has been destroyed, and dip buyers are nowhere to be seen,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a research note. \"All the efforts to spin recent events positively are increasingly falling flat.\"",
      "Highlighting the extent of the losses: Nearly every major industrial sector suffered declines, with tech players, banks, retailers, apparel makers and airlines among the hardest hit. Best Buy shares sank roughly 18%, United Airlines fell 16% and Nike slid 16%, while even AI powerhouse Nvidia saw its stock drop nearly 8%.",
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. trading partners and increased levies on dozens of countries that charge higher taxes on American exports. Mr. Trump has said the goal is to make global commerce more fair, spur companies to expand in the U.S. and generate federal revenue.",
      "Experts warn that sharply ramping up tariffs on imports, coupled with any retaliatory measures from other nations, could drive up inflation, dampen spending by consumers and businesses, and hurt economic growth.",
      "\"Market uncertainty is likely to remain elevated in the weeks ahead, as investors consider likely downgrades to consensus U.S. economic and earnings growth forecasts, the risk of a tit-for-tat escalation in tariffs and the potential scope for tariffs announced to be negotiated down,\" Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to investors.",
      "Appearing on CNN Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt expressed confidence that the Trump administration's economic policies would pay off. Commenting on global financial markets sliding overnight, she said, \"To anyone on Wall Street this morning, I would say trust in President Trump.\"",
      "Souring sentiment",
      "Financial markets surged after Mr. Trump was re-elected in November, with Wall Street counting on lower taxes and deregulation to fuel corporate profits. Other investors bet on the Trump administration threatening tariffs mostly as a way to pressure other countries into making concessions on trade, rather than a full-fledged push to change the terms of global commerce.",
      "But after hitting all-time highs in February, stocks have turned tail as the White House makes clear it wasn't bluffing. Indeed, investors have been left stunned by the speed and scale of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "In contrast to his first term, when he implemented levies on roughly $380 billion worth of goods over four years, Mr. Trump has imposed more than $3 trillion in tariffs in the less than three months since his return to power, according to the Economic Policy institute, a left-leaning think tank.",
      "\"Markets may actually be underreacting, especially if these rates turn out to be final, given the potential knock-on effects to global consumption and trade,\" said Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment management.",
      "Including its Thursday dive, the S&P 500 is now down 8.2% this year, the Dow has sunk 4.7% and the Nasdaq has tumbled 14.3%.",
      "Despite the angst on Wall Street, economists note that the U.S. continues to grow, and most still put relatively low odds on a recession. Hiring around the U.S. also remains healthy, with the nation's unemployment rate hovering around 4%.",
      "For borrowers, meanwhile, further signs the economy is at risk of stalling could encourage the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark interest rate. The central bank last cut rates in December of 2024, but has kept them steady since then as policy makers seek to douse inflation.",

      "Amazon has told the White House it is interested in buying TikTok ahead of a key deadline by which its parent company, China-based ByteDance, must either sell the popular social media app or face a ban in the U.S., CBS News has learned, according to two people familiar with discussions.",
      "Amazon has submitted a bid for the app, the\u00a0New York Times reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter. Another plan under consideration is for a new entity backed by U.S. companies like BlackRock and Oracle to lease TikTok's algorithm from ByteDance, according to a source familiar with the situation.",
      "Both Amazon and TikTok declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the New York Times reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",
      "He added that he'd \"like to see TikTok remain alive.\"",
      "The U.S. government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because its vast trove of customer data, including browsing patterns, locations and biometric information, could end up in the hands of the Chinese authorities.",
      "Ahead of the initial divestiture deadline, ByteDance earlier this year briefly shut down TikTok in the U.S. Mr. Trump quickly paused the ban and the service was restored.",
      "The ban does not target TikTok's U.S. users. But the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, signed into law in 2024 under former President Biden, would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores and web-hosting services to distribute or service TikTok.",

We are focused on taking responsible actions that are in the best interests of our customers, our business partners and you, our employees \u2013 wherever you work.\"",
      "In response to the layoffs, UAW President Shawn Fain said, \"Stellantis continues to play games with workers' lives. As we've shown time and again, they've got the money, the capacity, the product, and the workforce to employ thousands more UAW members in Michigan, Indiana, and beyond. These layoffs are a completely unnecessary choice that the company is making. It's more of the same, and everything that's wrong with our broken trade system. Companies like Stellantis use workers as collateral damage to pay the price for management's poor decisions, and it's unacceptable.\"",

      "Inflation-weary Americans may soon find they're paying more for a host of products after President Trump announced two new types of tariffs on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day\" because he believes the measures will erase trade imbalances between the U.S. and other nations.",
      "While Mr. Trump characterizes tariffs as paid by other nations, they are in fact paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart or Amazon. Because the tariffs create higher costs for those businesses, they typically pass on all or some of the tariffs to consumers through price hikes.",
      "The new tariffs introduced by Mr. Trump on Wednesday include a 10% universal tariff, as well as so-called reciprocal tariffs on more than 60 countries that are trade partners with the U.S. The tariffs will be additive, meaning that imports will face both the universal tariff of 10% plus the specific reciprocal import levies targeting each nation.",
      "During his announcement, Mr. Trump's said the tariffs will would eventually lower prices for Americans, an issue on which voters say they want him to focus. But economists are predicting instead that consumers and businesses will likely encounter higher inflation, with price hikes on everything from food imports like coffee and chocolate to iPhones and other electronics manufactured outside the U.S.",
      "\"For all of President Trump's talk of a new 'golden age,' this huge tax increase will inevitably result in higher prices for American families, lower growth and business investment, and diminished exports and manufacturing output as the country's factories face retaliation abroad and costlier inputs (roughly half of all imports) at home,\" said Scott Lincicome and Colin Grabow, trade experts at the Cato Institute, in an email.",
      "They added, \"With today's announcement, U.S. tariffs will approach levels not seen since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which incited a global trade war and deepened the Great Depression.\"",
      "The Trump administration said there are some exclusions to the tariffs, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals, although it added that these products might be subject to tariffs at a later time.",
      "Which products will become more expensive with tariffs?",
      "Because of the 10% universal tariff on imports, any imported good is likely to become more expensive in the coming weeks and months as American companies digest the import duties and adjust their prices in response.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of an appliance jumped more than 11%, adding about $86 to the cost of a new unit,\u00a0according\u00a0to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "Electronics like iPhones and TVs",
      "Among the nations targeted by Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs are China, Taiwan and South Korea, who are top exporters of electronics to the U.S., from Apple iPhones to television sets.",
      "The Trump administration plans to hit China with a reciprocal tariff of 34%, which means that products manufactured there and imported into the U.S. could see higher prices soon after the levies go into effect on April 9.",
      "Almost all iPhones are still manufactured in China, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, although Apple has shifted some of its iPhone fabrication to India. However, the Trump administration will also be adding a 26% reciprocal tariff to Indian imports, it said on Wednesday.",

      "Chocolate is another major Latin American import, given that the U.S. climate is by and large unsuited to growing cocoa beans. Among the nations that export cocoa beans to the country are Cote d'Ivoire and Ecuador, according to the USDA. Those nations will face reciprocal tariffs of 21% and 10%, respectively.",

      "The president, who signed an executive order to impose the tariffs, insisted the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of are \"over.\" The reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump said, will amount to roughly half the tariff rate those countries impose on U.S. exports, or less. Countries that will see tariffs higher than 10% include the European Union, China and Israel.",
      "Senior administration officials said the 10% worldwide tariffs take effect April 5 at 12:01 a.m., and the higher reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9 at 12:01 a.m.",
      "\"In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" the president said in a White House Rose Garden announcement. \"And for these reasons, starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\"",
      "\"For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating, and because we are being very kind, we're a kind people, very kind,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're not so kind when you're ripped off\u2026 We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.\"",
      "As he spoke, the president proudly held up a chart showing the new tariff rates the U.S. will begin to impose on allies, foes and everyone in between,",
      "Countries that will see \"discounted reciprocal rates,\" according to a sheet handed out by the White House, include China at a rate of 34%, on top of the tariffs the U.S. already imposes on China; 20% on goods from the European Union; 32% on Taiwan; 25% on South Korea and 17% on Israel.",
      "Canada and Mexico are not subject to these tariffs for now, senior administration officials said, but tariffs the president has already imposed, citing fentanyl and migration issues, persist.",

      "\"It's our declaration of economic independence,\" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Trump labeled Wednesday \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "The president lamented that the U.S. imports phones and other electronics, as well as pharmaceuticals, saying that if there's a war, the U.S. would struggle. He said his moves Wednesday are also standing up for U.S. farmers and ranchers who have been \"brutalized\" by other countries, specifically blasting Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump said the Americans \"subsidize\" a lot of other countries, calling out the European Union, China, South Korea and Australia for their trade practices.",
      "\"They've taken so much of our wealth away from us,\" Mr. Trump said of other countries.",
      "The president said he expects complaints from \"globalists,\" \"outsourcers,\" \"special interests,\" and \"fake news\" in the days ahead, but insisted those groups have been wrong about trade before.",
      "\"In the first term, they said tariffs would crash the economy,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Instead, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.\"",
      "In the audience for the president's announcement were rank-and-file steelworkers and auto workers, House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as most of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, including Vice President JD Vance.",
      "What new tariffs did Trump announce today?",
      "The president says his plan will place a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on all countries, with reciprocal tariffs on many trading partners that have their own tariffs placed on the U.S. The 25% tariffs the president previously announced on foreign cars and foreign auto parts are set to go into effect at midnight.",
      "A White House official said the reciprocal tariffs are additive, meaning they will be imposed in addition to any previous tariffs already in place, unless a specific good is exempt under Section 232 of the Tariffs Act, which carries a flat 25% rate on certain things like steel and aluminum.",
      "Here are some of the tariff rates that Mr. Trump announced:",

      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday that tariffs are one tool to get companies to bring jobs back to the U.S.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and- and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here,\" Fain said. \"And, you know, invest in the American workers. The American working class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it.\"",
      "What are tariffs, exactly?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S.\u00a0The most common type of tariffs are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value\"), which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of a product. The 25% auto tariffs are these types of tariffs.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, and \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold.",
      "What do financial experts say about tariffs?",
      "Economists and taxpayer advocacy groups have their doubts, and are warning tariffs could upset economic growth and will almost surely contribute to higher prices for American consumers. Some automakers have already announced higher car prices, after the president announced tariffs on foreign cars and parts.",
      "More than a dozen leaders at think tanks and taxpayer advocacy groups, including at the National Taxpayers Union, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, on Tuesday sent a joint letter to congressional leaders and the commerce and treasury secretaries, urging them to consider how tariffs on steel, lumber, energy, pharmaceutical and medical supplies and cars and car parts will increase prices.",
      "\"We encourage you to consider whether tariffs may, in many cases, undermine President Trump's broader long-term economic goals by increasing the cost of goods subject to tariffs,\" they wrote. \"We are especially concerned about tariffs on inputs needed by U.S. manufacturers that make it harder to compete with finished goods made abroad and tariffs that increase the price of necessities like food and housing.\"",
      "Alex Jacquez, who worked on the Biden White House National Economic Council, said that although it's hard to know the exact impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs without knowing all the details, CEOs are telling investors and shareholders they will be hiking prices.",
      "\"What the major retailers and companies who may be affected by tariffs are planning to do and they're planning out in public here is pass these costs along to consumers as much as they possibly can,\" Jacquez, now the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "Colin Grabow, associate director at the libertarian Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, wrote in a USA Today op-ed that \"tariffs are a costly and inefficient tax usually borne by the importing country's customers.\"",
      "\"Americans may have voted for lower prices in November, but under the guise of tariff reciprocity, the Trump administration is set to deliver something very different,\" Grabow wrote.",
      "A reporter on Tuesday asked Leavitt if the president is thinking about seniors on fixed income who are stressed about the recent swings in the stock market, swings partly attributed to the president's tariff announcements. Stocks have struggled as Wall Street braces for the next round of tariffs.",
      "\"Well certainly, they are legitimate concerns and the president takes those concerns very seriously,\" Leavitt said. \"And he's addressing them every single day. And tomorrow's announcement is to protect future generations of the senior citizens you mentioned. It's for their kids and their grandkids, to ensure that there are jobs here in the United States of America for their children to live the American dream, just like they presumably did.\"",
      "And the president told NBC News he \"couldn't care less\" if his tariffs lead to automakers raising their prices.",

      "Mr. Trump, who announced the tariffs in the White House's Rose Garden on Wednesday afternoon, said his plans reflect \"one of the most important days in American history; it's our declaration of economic independence.\" Even so, economists say the tariffs will boost prices on many products purchased by American consumers, at a time when inflation still remains elevated.",
      "An overview of Mr. Trump's new \"Liberation Day\" tariffs",
      "The first tariff will be a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S.",
      "The second tariff, reciprocal tariffs, will be applied to imports from 60 countries and are aimed at equalizing the trade imbalances between the U.S. and those nations. Mr. Trump said that reciprocal tariffs \"means they do it to us, and we do it to them.\"",
      "He added, \"It can't get any simpler than that.\"",
      "One example provided by Mr. Trump is that the U.S. charges a 2.5% tariff on automobile imports, while adding that the European Union charges a 10% tariff on American car exports to EU nations.",
      "\"Such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base,\" he added.",
      "What is a reciprocal tariff?",
      "At the moment, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges on German vehicle imports.",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would apply the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries place on American exports on a product-by-product basis. By charging countries only 50% of what they charge U.S. products, Mr. Trump said he is imposing \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump said that the reciprocal tariffs will also include calculations to cover non-monetary trade barriers, such as when nations devalue their currencies to help boost demand for their products from other nations.",
      "When do the tariffs go into effect?",
      "The baseline 10% tariff will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5, while the reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9.",
      "Why is Trump imposing these new tariffs?",
      "During his announcement, Mr. Trump said the goal was to revitalize the industrial and manufacturing base of the U.S., promising that doing so will \"make America wealthy again.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariffs will help convince foreign businesses to relocate their factories to the U.S. The president also promised that the tariffs would lead to lower prices for Americans, although most economists are projecting that Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to boost inflation and lead to higher costs for the typical U.S. household.",
      "For instance, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index \u2014 an inflation measure closely tracked by the Federal Reserve \u2014 could rise 0.5 percentage points to 3.5% by year end, according to a March 30 Goldman Sachs report. The core PCE rose 2.8% in February on an annual basis, reflecting a slight increase from the prior month.",
      "That estimate is based on Mr. Trump's previously announced tariffs, including his 25% import duty on\u00a0auto imports, as well as Goldman's expectation for reciprocal tariffs that would average about 15%.",

      "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump\u00a0announced on Wednesday \u2014 a planned import tax blitz he has referred to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 are so-called reciprocal tariffs.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his Wednesday news conference, touting such levies as a way to boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products.",
      "But some economists say that tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners could be hard to structure, while also roiling global commerce and driving up costs\u00a0for U.S. consumers and businesses. Here's what to know about reciprocal tariffs.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product-by-product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.",
      "Currently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges for German vehicle imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That would be administratively complex given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products.",
      "\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Other experts suggest the goal is less about driving companies to shift their production to the U.S. or generating federal revenue than about pressuring other nations to strike trade deals that the Trump administration is comfortable with.",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs the same as country-based tariffs?",
      "Rather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs, the White House announced country-specific tariff rates calibrated to the their trade imbalance with the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said his administration will impose reciprocal tariffs at roughly half the rate of duties charged by other nations. The White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers.",
      "For example, the U.S. will match China's 67% rate with a 34% tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "\"They will probably come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods,\" said Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration.",
      "That approach could result in the U.S. taxing other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours.",
      "\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"",
      "Who are the \"Dirty 15\"?",
      "Trump administration officials have singled out a group of nations they dubbed the \"Dirty 15,\"\u00a0 a reference to the 15% of countries expected to be hit hardest by the new reciprocal tariffs given their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Those nations account for \"a huge amount of our trading volume,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 18, without naming the trade partners. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also told Fox News that the White House is targeting 10 to 15 nations with the biggest trade surplus with the U.S. Like Bessent, he also refrained from naming those nations.",

      "President Trump has argued that some of the tariffs he's imposing this week could help the government raise over $1 trillion in the next year or so, helping to reduce the national debt and even potentially offset some income taxes.",
      "But economists are skeptical that these tariffs can bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods when prices go up.",
      "Tariffs are often charged as a percentage of the price that importers pay foreign sellers. They aren't paid by foreign nations, but by U.S. companies who often pass the cost to American consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"You're going to see billions of dollars, even trillions of dollars coming into our country very soon in the form of tariffs,\" the president said last week.",
      "While economic analyses indicate Mr. Trump's tariffs could meaningfully increase annual tariff revenue, the president's trillion-dollar estimates are significantly higher than those provided by think tanks and even some of his own officials.",
      "How much Trump's new auto tariffs could generate",
      "In a recent news conference, White House staff secretary Will Sharf estimated that Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could raise \"roughly $100 billion in new revenue.\" At the same news conference, Mr. Trump claimed moments later \"anywhere from $600 billion to $1 trillion will be taken in over the relatively short-term period, meaning a year from now.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request to clarify the source of the discrepancy.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan think tank, has estimated that the auto tariffs could raise roughly $600 billion to $650 billion over a period of 10 years \u2014 not in a single year, as Mr. Trump suggested.",
      "\"On an annual basis on average that's $60 to 65 billion. We're not even close to trillions,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab.",

      "The same researchers found Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which are slated to go into effect this week, along with the additional 20% tax on Chinese imports that the president has already put in place, could generate roughly $150 billion annually, or up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years. They also found the average household could lose $1,600 to $2,000 each year in inflation-adjusted disposable income as a result of higher prices.",
      "Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs previously made higher estimates that Trump's increased tariffs on these countries could generate roughly $300 billion in new income per year.",
      "Either would be a meaningful increase over the $88 billion in customs duties collected at ports of entry in 2024.",
      "However, economists argue there's a ceiling to tariff revenue that remains below $1 trillion per year.",
      "The U.S. imported about $3.3 trillion in foreign goods last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Peterson Institute of International Economics estimated that even if Mr. Trump were to apply a 50% tariff to foreign imports from every country \u2014 which exceeds his stated plans \u2014 it would generate at most about $780 billion annually.",
      "\"If you make something 50% more expensive, you don't expect people to buy the same amount,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",
      "Could tariff revenue replace income taxes?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of using his tariff agenda to offset or even replace income taxes.",
      "\"Under the American first economic model, as tariffs on other countries go up, taxes on American workers and businesses will come down,\" Trump said in a speech to the House GOP in January.",
      "Income taxes generate over $2 trillion per year, according to the Department of the Treasury. Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all imports, the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute.",
      "\"The problem is it can't raise anywhere near the amount of revenue you'd need to scuttle the income tax. And that's the really, I think, ironclad point,\" said Scott Lincicome, a vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian think tank.",
      "Historians on U.S. trade note that tariffs have not been viewed as a primary way to raise revenue since income taxes were introduced in 1913.",

    "summary": "Here's what to know about tariffs ahead of President Trump's plans to announce new import duties on April 2.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to impose a round of fresh tariffs on April 2, a day President Trump has dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" The announcement is viewed by economists as the culmination of his \"America First Trade Policy,\" an\u00a0executive order he signed on his first day in office aimed at revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to his April 2 tariff announcement as \"the big one,\" suggesting that the plans may be more far reaching than the import levies he's already unleashed on goods from other nations, such as his March 26 declaration of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S.",
      "\"For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\" Trump said about his April 2 plans in a post\u00a0earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump will announce his administration's plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, at an event in the White House Rose Garden, the White House said. He deems the levies necessary to erase trade imbalances with nations that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from America. But the addition of broad-based tariffs to a host of imports is likely to heat up a global trade war that could, at least in the short term, boost prices for U.S. consumers and juice inflation.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and research shows that that majority gets passed along to consumers,\" Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump administration's goal is to increase prices on imports to the point where it's economically favorable for companies to relocate their manufacturing to the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"If prices don't go up, it doesn't deter imports, and therefore there is no reason to set up shop in the U.S.,\" Grabow explained. \"Part of the logic is premised on prices going up, otherwise they are not going to accomplish their goal.\"",
      "Economists say that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including the uncertainty surrounding it, could drag down U.S. GDP by depressing financial markets and consumer sentiment.",
      "\"The main channel from trade policy uncertainty to GDP is via business investment. Under higher trade policy uncertainty, future revenue streams of an investment become more uncertain, raising the option value of delaying investment decisions until the situation is clearer,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "What tariffs will Trump announce April 2?",
      "Mr. Trump teased his April 2 announcement last week when he announced his new 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts. \"That's Liberation Day, that's gonna be on the 2nd, and that's gonna be reciprocal, and I think people will be impressed,\" the president said.",
      "Reciprocal tariffs are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan public policy think tank. According to a White House memo from Feb. 13, the U.S. faces additional trade barriers aside from tariffs such as regulatory requirements that can make it more difficult for American exports to reach other nations.",
      "While the size and scope of the reciprocal tariffs that Mr. Trump plans to announce are still unknown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously said the administration's reciprocal tariffs would target countries with the biggest trade surpluses, as well as those which have imposed the highest tariffs plus non-tariff trade barriers on U.S. goods.",
      "Multiple nations run large annual trade surpluses with the U.S., including Germany, Ireland and Italy in the European Union, as well as Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. The U.S. also has a large trade deficit with China, although Mr. Trump has already imposed new tariffs on that nation.",
      "\"It'll be in many cases less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades ... I think we're trying to keep it somewhat conservative,\" Mr. Trump said on March 26.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he'll introduce a reciprocal tariff policy on \"all countries,\" which he said would be \"very lenient.\"",
      "On Sunday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that there are 15 countries \"that we have massive, massive trade deficits with,\" but that Mr. Trump will ultimately decided how many countries will be subject to new tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Hassett also promoted tariffs as an effective tool for reshoring manufacturing to the U.S., saying \"it's going to be a boom,\" referring to auto manufacturing in particular.",
      "Meanwhile, additional tariffs are also slated to go into effect on April 2, with Mr. Trump's one-month delay on 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports set to expire that day. The 25% auto tariff announced by the president on March 26 is also scheduled to take effect on April 2.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Reciprocal tariffs enacted by the U.S. would match foreign nations' levies and other trade policies on American goods.",
      "A reciprocal tariff policy would include calculating a country-specific number that the Trump administration deems representative of all trade barriers. But import restrictions other than tariffs, such as regulatory requirements, could be hard to quantify, economists say.",
      "\"There are a lot of intangibles, like testing regulations for different products in countries, or perceived openness to business with American companies,\" Simon Macadam, deputy chief global economist at Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These are things you can't easily put a number on.\"",
      "Because of this complexity, some experts expect Trump's reciprocal tariffs could be more limited in scope, and might not be truly \"reciprocal\" because they may not exactly match other countries' levies.",
      "\"We shouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff is rolled back, or not as sweeping as maybe originally talked about, because logistically, from a practical perspective, running the calculations and coming up with a number is extremely time consuming,\" Grabow of the Cato Institute said.",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the first Trump administration, agreed that a truly reciprocal tariff policy would be \"very complicated to get to work.\"",
      "\"If you were literally going to be reciprocal, you would put the same tariff on a product that comes into the U.S. as that country charges on products from the U.S.,\" he said. \"But the problem is you'd be charging a different tariff on the same item from different countries.\"",
      "That would create loopholes for exporters to ship products through lower-tariffed countries to the U.S., Ross added. \"It would make it easy for people to game the system,\" he said.",
      "What does Trump want to achieve?",
      "Through his \"Fair and Reciprocal Plan\" on trade, Mr. Trump is aiming to bring about three outcomes: Boost U.S. manufacturing jobs; close the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit; and gain leverage over U.S. trade partners.",
      "But experts say that trade barriers such as tariffs may not be enough to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs, which have fallen sharply over the last few decades. Fewer than 13 million people are employed in manufacturing today, down from a peak of 19.6 million in 1979,\u00a0according to federal data.",
      "\"To a large extent, and particularly in low- and medium-tech industries, the economics of production will not be significantly altered by a 10-20% tariff,\" Macadam said. \"When labor costs in hubs like Mexico are one-fifth of what they are in the U.S., in order to induce companies to seriously relocate a lot of production back to the U.S. a 20% tariff isn't going to cut it.\"",
      "There's also the unknown of how long any new tariffs announced by Mr. Trump will remain in place. Such uncertainty could deter American or foreign businesses from investing heavily in re-shoring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"Even if for some companies it gets to the point where it seems to make financial sense to move back to the U.S., there's the question of, 'Are these tariffs actually going to last a long time?'\" Macadam said. \"If you think the tariff is going to be there forever, then yeah, absolutely relocate. But if it's reversed or rates are lowered, then it would have been silly to relocate.\"",
      "What will tariffs mean for consumers?",
      "Consumers typically pay the price for tariffs, as companies have said they plan on passing off much of the costs to their customers.",
      "As a result, a round of fresh tariffs could boost inflation, economists say. According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, if the effective tariff rate on imports into the U.S. rises from their 2024 level of 2.5% to 10% in April, which is what Oxford Economics expects, prices in aggregate would rise by half a percentage point.",
      "\"Inflation was on trend to fall \u2014 now we expect it to rise,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla said its delivery of vehicles in the first three months of 2025 fell nearly 13% as demand for the automaker's electric cars continued to weaken, with deliveries falling well short of analysts' expectations.",
      "The company said on Wednesday that it shipped 336,681 vehicles in the first quarter, down from the 386,810 in the year ago period. The latest deliveries fell short of expectations that the EV maker had likely shipped about 350,000 vehicles during the period, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in an April 2 research note.",
      "The decline comes amid protests held at Tesla dealerships both in the U.S. and Europe over CEO Elon Musk's work with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Under Musk's leadership, DOGE has pushed the Trump administration to shutter\u00a0federal agencies, slashing tens of thousands of jobs, as he seeks to cut government spending.",
      "\"[T]his delivery number was a disaster for the bulls with continuous negativity around the TSLA brand,\" Ives said in his note. \"We are not going to look at these numbers with rose-colored glasses ... they were a disaster on every metric.\"",
      "Ives, who said earlier said he had expected Tesla to report it had delivered as many as 360,000 vehicles during the first quarter, added that he believes Musk \"needs to stop this political firestorm and balance being CEO of Tesla with DOGE.\"",
      "Shares of Tesla slumped $12.77, or 4.8%, to $255.69 in early trading. The stock has plunged about 44% since hitting a high of $479 per share in December, when the stock soared on expectations that Musk's advisory role with the Trump administration would help the business through lower regulations and other benefits.",
      "Tesla's problems extend beyond the backlash over Musk's work with DOGE, however. The company's aging lineup is failing to attract buyers, although the automaker is expected to roll out a new lower-cost model later this year.",
      "In the meantime, some EV buyers are choosing to buy vehicles from rival automakers, with competitors from BMW to Toyota now offering a range of electric, hybrid or plug-in hybrid options. To some extent, Tesla's woes predate Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, with the company's revenue slipping 1%\u00a0last year, partly due to sluggish sales in the first six months of 2024.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's sweeping cuts to the federal bureaucracy have included slashing a little-known government agency that channels grant money to America's libraries \u2014 a potentially crippling interruption to a funding lifeline for libraries around the country.",
      "One staff member at the Institute of Museum and Library Services sent grant coordinators a chilling email, obtained by CBS News, warning the agency would \"not be able to work or respond to your emails\" and that there was no \"information about future timelines related to this action.\"",
      "\"You call and the phone just keeps ringing, you know, there's nobody home,\" Mandy Knapp, the Ohio state librarian and executive director, said in an interview with CBS News.",
      "On March 20, teams from DOGE \u2014 the budget-cutting army led by billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 descended on the Institute, a tiny federal department that was created by Congress in 1996 to oversee grants for museums and libraries around the nation. Late Wednesday night, organizations that receive Institute funding \"began receiving notification that their grants were being terminated, effective immediately,\" according to a local branch of the American Federation of Government Employees union.",
      "Wednesday night, word came that more than a dozen Institute grants were terminated \u2014 \"seemingly at random,\" the union said. Three states, California, Connecticut and Washington, received the first termination notices for their state library grants, according to a statement from the union.",
      "The notification could not have come at a worse time, library officials told CBS News. Washington's Deputy Secretary of State Randy Bolerjack says that the funding they received through the program helped support 32 positions at the Washington State Library, which have statewide impact and benefit public, tribal, K-12, and community college libraries.",
      "The Institute has previously cited its \"Grants to States\" program as the largest source of federal funding support for library services in the U.S. With over $160 million allocated to the program annually. The grants are formulated based on population and give state libraries complete oversight as to how funding is allocated to their local branches. In states like Ohio and South Carolina, officials told CBS News that this funding has been critical to keeping libraries in rural areas on par with those in larger cities.",
      "Breanne Smith, associate deputy director at South Carolina's state library, told us that public libraries in the state saw over 10 million visits last year alone. She says in rural communities especially, libraries are more than just a place to check out books.",
      "\"People go to their library for not even just the library services, they just go there for wifi, to use a computer. Libraries are really a community anchor,\" Smith said.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS, notice of the cuts to Washington's state library came from the Institute's acting director, Keith Sonderling, who is a deputy director at the Labor Department. Union officials said they were told that the Trump administration cuts were made because they were not aligned with the Institute's priorities. The deputy director at the South Carolina state library, Chris Yates, says he finds their rationale \"puzzling.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Labor Department for comment, but has not received a reply.",
      "Yates also expressed that the sporadic cuts have left state library staff in a state of uncertainty. The funds South Carolina receives support public libraries in all 43 counties, which serve over 5.4 million residents.",
      "\"Everyone, I think, is just in a holding pattern to see if they're gonna receive a letter or not.\", Yates told CBS News.",
      "Knapp says their funding does more than support libraries \u2014 it also funds summer reading programs, special access to materials for those with visual impairments, and offers access to state-of-the-art technology and the internet in rural communities. Their \"vital\" summer reading program has already been put on pause, Knapp said.",
      "In a letter sent to the White House yesterday, 127 Democratic members of Congress urged the administration to reconsider its decision to shutter the agency. \"Eliminating the [the Institute] would not only jeopardize these essential services but also dismiss the everyday needs of millions of Americans who rely on libraries and museums for learning, job opportunities, and community engagement,\" the letter says.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, told CBS News that the cuts will only undermine Americans' access to library resources, which he considers vital to bringing communities together.",
      "\"Trump's plan to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services would barely make a dent in the federal budget, but it would be devastating for communities across the country,\" Murphy said.",
      "In addition to congressional support, four major publishing houses have also sent a letter to Congress outlining concerns, saying, \"libraries are essential community hubs that provide free access to these valuable tools and resources. Defunding libraries would result in mass closures and the destruction of a system that today benefits millions of Americans.\"",

    "summary": "Votes are expected to last through the night before a final vote on the budget resolution.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans on Friday night began a marathon series of votes \u2014 known as a \"vote-a-rama\" \u2014 as Congress inches closer to enacting President Trump's agenda.",
      "Senate Republicans unveiled a new 70-page budget blueprint Wednesday that lays out a path toward implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities. The resolution aims to make tax cuts that were enacted during Mr. Trump's first term permanent while also authorizing $1.5 trillion in additional tax cuts and raising the debt ceiling by as much as $5 trillion.",
      "The Senate cleared a procedural hurdle Thursday with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky as the only Republican defection, an indication that the party has the votes needed for final approval some time this weekend.",
      "During the vote-a-rama, Democrats can offer an unlimited number of amendments and force the majority party to cast vote after vote through the night on highly charged political issues, including Medicaid and tariffs. After the Senate exhausts all amendment votes, lawmakers will take a final vote on the budget resolution, teeing it up for a vote in the House as soon as next week.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday said it would be \"a long few days for Senate Republicans.\"",
      "\"You're going to see a whole lot of amendments going after Donald Trump and the Republicans on a whole bunch of issues where they are favoring billionaires and against families,\" Schumer, a New York Democrat, said.",
      "The Republican blueprint is just the first step in the complicated reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance legislation in the Senate. Taking this route allows Republicans to pass the bill without help from Democrats. Both chambers must adopt identical budget resolutions that direct committees to submit their proposed spending plans before ultimately passing a bill with Mr. Trump's priorities. The entire process is expected to take months.",
      "The compromise resolution comes after Republicans in the House and Senate forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year, before coming together on the path forward. Still, differences exist over where and how to make spending cuts, as leaders have opted to push some of the lingering disagreements down the line.",
      "The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for a number of committees, at just a few billion dollars, while it calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over a 10-year period in the House. The Senate is expected to find far more than the floor outlined in the resolution, but the figures are aimed at giving them flexibility moving forward.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune defended the resolution on Thursday as laying the groundwork for \"transformational investment\" in border security, national defense and the energy sector.",
      "The South Dakota Republican criticized Democrats, whom he said are \"losing their minds\" over the measure, for claiming the tax relief is \"about handouts to billionaires.\" He said Democrats' \"latest hysteria\" centers on an accounting tactic known as a \"current policy baseline,\" which makes it appear as if making the tax cuts permanent costs nothing.",
      "\"Using the current policy baseline is not some bizarre new gimmick,\" Thune said, adding that \"Democrats' sudden concern for saving money and protecting the character of the Senate is touching.\"",
      "But Congress usually uses a \"current law baseline\" for budget measures, as required under the 1974 Budget Control Act. This takes into account the expiration of spending provisions. So, current policy would treat the extension of the Trump tax cuts, which are expiring this year, as a policy that will continue indefinitely and won't cost any new taxpayer dollars. But the tax cuts were passed in accordance with a current law baseline, which set an expiration date. So extending the cuts would mean incurring new costs, in this case, about $4.5 trillion over the next decade.",
      "Schumer said Thursday that \"Republicans, in essence, want to pretend like their trillion dollar tax cuts are free \u2014 like magic.\"",
      "\"Middle school math students would tell you this is ridiculous,\" Schumer said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the way for the Trump administration to cancel millions of dollars in federal education grants because it said they funded programs that involve diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "The high court split 5-4 in granting a request from the Justice Department to pause a federal district court order that required the Department of Education to reinstate the grants that had been awarded to universities and nonprofit organizations in eight states. The court said in an unsigned opinion that its stay will remain in place while legal proceedings move forward.",
      "\"Respondents have represented in this litigation that they have the financial wherewithal to keep their programs running. So, if respondents ultimately prevail, they can recover any wrongfully withheld funds through suit in an appropriate forum,\" the court said. \"And if respondents instead decline to keep the programs operating, then any ensuing irreparable harm would be of their own making.\"",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts joined with the three liberal justices in dissent.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan called the court's move a \"mistake,\" and said the Trump administration did not defend the legality of canceling the education grants at issue in the case. In a dissent joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said it is \"beyond puzzling\" that a majority of the court viewed the Justice Department's request for intervention as an emergency.",
      "\"The harms that will result from permitting the department to reinstate these terminations are directly contrary to Congress's goals in enacting the TQP and SEED programs and in entrusting the department with their implementation,\" Jackson wrote. \"It boggles the mind to equate the devastation wrought from such abrupt funding withdrawals with the mere risk that some grantees might seek to draw down previously promised funds that the department wants to yank away from them.\"",
      "Jackson called the court's decision to grant the Trump administration relief \"unprincipled and unfortunate,\" as well as \"entirely unwarranted.\"",
      "In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi called the ruling \"a significant victory for President Trump and the rule of law.\"",
      "Bondi said the ruling \"vindicates what the Department of Justice has been arguing for months: local district judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of taxpayer dollars, force the government to pay out billions, or unilaterally halt President Trump's policy agenda.\"",
      "The legal battle over the administration's decision to cut off the grants is the latest challenging President Trump's second-term policies to reach the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority. The Trump administration has sought to cut off federal assistance funding and foreign aid, but has so far been rebuffed by the courts.",
      "There are three other requests for relief from the Justice Department that are still awaiting action from the Supreme Court, though more emergency appeals are expected to reach the justices as the president faces a slew of lawsuits targeting his second-term agenda.",
      "At issue in this dispute over Education Department funds is up to $65 million in grants awarded through the Teacher Quality Partnership program and the Supporting Effective Educator Development program, which support teacher recruitment and training.",
      "In early February, the acting secretary of education directed an internal review of the department's grant awards to ensure they did not fund programs with DEI practices, which the Trump administration has claimed are discriminatory.",
      "The Education Department ultimately decided 104 grants should be terminated because they did not align with its policy objectives, according to the Justice Department. Five grants were left in place, the department said.",
      "Following the grant cancellations, a group of eight states sued the Trump administration and asked a federal district court to issue temporary relief while the case moved forward. The states \u2014 California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Wisconsin \u2014 said organizations within their states received the grants and argued the terminations violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "U.S. District Judge Myong Joun agreed to grant a temporary restraining order, in place until April 7, that required the government to reinstate the grants to recipients in the eight states. The court also temporarily blocked the government from reinstating the terminations, or cancelling any other awards for organizations in the states.",
      "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to pause that order while proceedings continue, which it declined to do. The Justice Department then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "In filings with the justices, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the district court's order is one of several that raise the question of whether a district court judge can force the government to pay out millions in taxpayer dollars.",
      "\"Unless and until this court addresses that question, federal district courts will continue exceeding their jurisdiction by ordering the executive branch to restore lawfully terminated grants across the government, keep paying for programs that the executive branch views as inconsistent with the interests of the United States, and send out the door taxpayer money that may never be clawed back,\" she wrote.",
      "Harris urged the Supreme Court to \"put a swift end to federal district courts' unconstitutional reign as self-appointed managers of executive branch funding and grant-disbursement decisions.\"",
      "In a separate case, the high court rejected an earlier bid from the Trump administration to pause an order that required it to pay out an estimated $2 billion in foreign-aid funding to groups that received money from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, lawyers for the states argued that the issue for the Justice Department is with other cases elsewhere, where courts are dealing with a slew of legal disputes arising out of Mr. Trump's executive actions.",
      "\"Those concerns are properly litigated in the context of those other cases,\" the states said in a filing. \"They provide no basis for this court to grant emergency relief here, where the district court appropriately granted a narrow and time-limited restraining order to preserve the status quo while it adjudicates the preliminary-injunction motion that was argued earlier today.\"",
      "Lawyers for the states said that the grant recipients are providing a pipeline of qualified teachers for local schools within their states, and warned that if the awards could be cancelled, programs that they fund will have to be scaled back or shut down entirely.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Friday said he would sign another executive order to delay enforcement of a law that effectively bans TikTok, amid talks about a possible deal to sell the widely popular platform.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0signed an executive order on his first day directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days. The order instructed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against \"any entity for any noncompliance.\" The executive order expires Saturday, April 5.",
      "Mr. Trump said Friday he wouldn't enforce the law for at least another 75 days.",
      "\"My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed,\" the president wrote. \"We do not want TikTok to 'go dark.' We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal.\"",
      "A deal had been reached Wednesday between investors, TikTok's Beijing-based parent company ByteDance and the U.S. government that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, according to a source familiar with the plans. The deal allowed ByteDance to keep a minority stake, and Mr. Trump planned to sign an order approving the deal and allowing for a 120-day closing period.",
      "But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House on Thursday that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, ByteDance, originally had until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services.",
      "TikTok\u00a0briefly and voluntarily shut down before the January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action.",
      "Apple and Google did not\u00a0restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores for nearly a month after Mr. Trump issued the first directive.",
      "Even though Mr. Trump has declined to enforce the ban, the law is still on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. But the law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok in the event of a sale.",
      "When TikTok challenged the law last year, it argued that it never had a choice between divestment or a ban because a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\" The Chinese government previously vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user.",
      "In a statement after Mr. Trump's announcement Friday, a ByteDance spokesperson acknowledged the company has been in discussions with the U.S. government about \"a potential solution.\"",
      "\"An agreement has not been executed. There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested last month he could ease tariffs on the Chinese if they approved the deal.",
      "\"Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,\" the president said on March 27. \"Every point in tariffs is worth more than TikTok.\"",
      "But on Wednesday he announced he would impose a 34% additional tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S.",
      "Lawmakers, however, are likely to be dissatisfied if any deal does not fully sever ties between ByteDance and TikTok.",
      "\"If ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal \u2014 plain and simple,\" Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China Committee, said last month.",
      "He said a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. while using ByteDance's algorithm runs afoul of the law because ByteDance would still have access to user data.",
      "\"This setup reeks of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2014 in 2023, through the failed Project Texas, ByteDance tried to create the illusion of better data privacy by storing Americans' data on U.S. servers, all while ByteDance kept its grip on the platform. On the surface, shifting data storage to the United States might have seemed like a reasonable fix, but it ignored the real issue: ByteDance's control over TikTok,\" Moolenaar\u00a0wrote in an opinion piece in the National Review last month.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. But the Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Moolenaar and Republican members of the China committee said in a statement Friday that they \"stand firm\" in their position.",
      "\"Any resolution must ensure that U.S. law is followed, and that the Chinese Communist Party does not have access to American user data or the ability to manipulate the content consumed by Americans,\" they said. \"We remain committed to enforcing the framework established by Congress to safeguard the American people.\"",
      "During a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last year, then-Sen. Marco Rubio, who's now secretary of state, explained that U.S. officials viewed TikTok as a national security threat because the algorithm that powers the platform is controlled by a China-based company. The Chinese government, he said, could force TikTok to give it access to the data it collects on tens of millions of Americans or use it to push propaganda to them.",
      "\"TikTok does not work without that algorithm, and that algorithm is controlled by a company that's controlled by the Chinese Communist Party under the law of China,\" Rubio said.",
      "Three Democratic senators\u00a0wrote to Mr. Trump in March asking him to work with Congress to find a long-term solution to TikTok's survival. The senators \u2014 Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Cory Booker of New Jersey \u2014 said they opposed a TikTok ban, but called it \"unacceptable and unworkable\" for the Trump administration \"to continue ignoring the requirements in the law.\"",
      "TikTok challenged the law in court, but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court days before it took effect. The Supreme Court's decision said the divest-or-ban law does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S., agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans.",

    "summary": "Trump hit the small African kingdom of Lesotho with his highest tariff this week at 50%, fueling urgent efforts by the country to seek a deal, and new trade partners.",
    "story": [
      "Maseru, Lesotho \u2014 President Trump in March described Lesotho as a place \"nobody has ever heard of,\" and then this week he hit the tiny African kingdom with the highest of his \"reciprocal\" trade tariffs for any single nation.",
      "Mr. Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs included a whopping 50% levy on the small, impoverished nation's imports, and the Lesotho government quickly said it would send a delegation to Washington.",
      "\"We need to urgently travel to the U.S. to engage with its executives and plead our case,\" Trade Minister Mokhethi Shelile told reporters Thursday. \"My biggest concern was the immediate closure of factories and job losses.\"",
      "Lesotho's annual gross domestic product of $2 billion is highly reliant on exports, mostly of textiles, including jeans.",
      "\"There are 11 factories in the country, most of which export goods to the U.S. and provide employment to 12,000 workers,\" Shelile said. \"Goods currently in production will be affected by these tariffs and will not be exported to the U.S.\"",
      "He said he'd asked factories to continue operating \"while we work on solutions,\" and added that the U.S. action showed his country needed to \"diversify\" its trade relationships, which he said it had already started exploring.",
      "\"We cannot rely solely on the U.S.,\" he said. \"While this transition will take time, the process is already underway.\"",
      "To determine the rates of its new tariffs, the White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers. Economists have questioned the methodology, and many\u00a0foreign governments have complained\u00a0the levies are unfair and misrepresent their trade imbalances with the U.S.",
      "The White House claims, by way of that formula, that Lesotho imposes 99% tariffs and other barriers on U.S. imports.",
      "Below is a look at the small kingdom, sometimes called \"the Switzerland of Africa\" thanks to its mountainous landscape. It took a bigger tariff hit from the White House this week than any other country.",
      "Where is the Lesotho?",
      "Completely surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho is the largest of only three enclaved states in the world, but it is far bigger than San Marino or Vatican City, both of which are within Italy's borders.",
      "At about 11,720 square miles, it is about the same size as Belgium but has a population of roughly 2.3 million, compared to Belgium's nearly 12 million.",
      "Lesotho is known for the beauty of its mountainous terrain and styles itself the \"Kingdom in the Sky.\"",
      "More than 80% of the country sits 5,900 feet above sea level and it is home to southern Africa's only ski resort. Its highest peak is Mount Thabana Ntlenyana, with an altitude of 11,424 feet.",
      "A constitutional monarchy like Britain, it is ruled by 61-year-old King Letsie III, who has no formal power. The government is led by a prime minister selected through national parliamentary elections.",
      "What is Lesotho's economy like?",
      "With an annual gross domestic product of just over $2 billion, Lesotho is largely dependent on South Africa \u2014 it biggest trading partner \u2014 from which it imports most of its food, selling water in return.",
      "The economy has been heavily reliant on textile exports bound for the United States through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade deal, which provides duty-free access to the U.S. market for some African products. The Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on African nations has raised questions over how likely the White House is to renew the AGOA pact when it expires in September.",
      "Its traditional Basotho blankets are a national symbol and renowned for their vibrant patterns and woolen warmth. They are often loaded with meaning, from celebrating life and nationality, to fertility and royalty, peace, love and courage.",
      "Lesotho ranks among the world's poorest countries despite huge mineral reserves. British mine company Gem Diamonds said in 2018 that it had discovered a 910-carat stone in one of its several Lesotho diamond mines.",
      "The country also pioneered the growing of cannabis for medical use in Africa.",
      "Unemployment has remained stubbornly high, hitting nearly 25% in 2023, according to the World Bank.",
      "\"Poverty and inequality remain significant challenges,\" the World Bank says. \"Despite efforts to improve living standards, a significant portion of Lesotho's population lives below the poverty line, with rural areas being particularly affected. Access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and clean water remains limited, contributing to poor health outcomes and educational attainment. High rates of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis further strain the healthcare system, reducing the workforce and increasing the dependency ratio.\"",
      "A link to Prince Harry through charity, until recently",
      "A charity co-founded by Prince Harry in Lesotho to help people living with HIV ran into turbulence this month after a bitter boardroom row led King Charles III's younger son to step down as patron.",
      "Its Zimbabwe-born chairperson, Sophie Chandauka, publicly accused the prince of \"bullying\" and being involved in a \"cover up,\" accusations the former royal has dismissed as lies.",
      "Harry founded the charity in 2006 with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, before it expanded to Botswana.",
      "The charity's name, Sentebale, is a tribute to his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997 when he was just 12.",

    "summary": "President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on about 90 countries, including China and the European Union. Here's the list.",
    "story": [
      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations will face only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries will be charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports will face the baseline rate of 10%, while China will face a 34% tariff.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his\u00a0Wednesday remarks.",
      "Asian nations will face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic. On top of China's 34% reciprocal tariff, imports from that nation will also face previously announced 20% tariffs, bringing that nation's total rate to more than 60%, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Full list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country",
      "When will these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries likely to retaliate against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "For now, other countries are taking a more measured approach in their response. European Union trade chief Maros Sefcovic is scheduled to meet with U.S. officials on Friday after Mr. Trump hit the 27-nation bloc with a 20% tariff.",
      "Sefcovic told AFP Thursday the EU would act in \"a calm, carefully phased, unified way\" and allow time for talks, but he also warned the bloc \"won't stand idly by, should we be unable to reach a fair deal\".",

      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams will skip the Democratic primary and run for reelection as an independent, he announced Thursday.",
      "The news came a day after\u00a0his federal corruption case was dismissed\u00a0by a judge.",
      "Adams confirmed his 2025 campaign in a six-minute video\u00a0posted on social media.",
      "\"Although I am still a Democrat, I am announcing that I will forgo the Democratic primary for mayor and appeal directly to all New Yorkers as an independent candidate in the general election,\" Adams said, adding, \"There isn't a liberal or conservative way to fix New York, but there is a right way and a wrong way and true leaders just know the right path [if] they have the guts to take it.\"",
      "Adams will bypass the crowded Democratic primary, which includes former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.",
      "There is precedent to win as an independent",
      "Mayors have run and won as independents in New York City. In 1965, John Lindsay got reelected as an independent after losing the Republican primary, and Michael Bloomberg won a third term as an independent after running as both a Republican and a Democrat.",
      "Adams said he knows he has work to do to regain the public's trust.",
      "\"I know that the accusations leveled against me may have shaken your confidence in me, and that you may rightly have questions about my conduct. And let me be clear: Although the charges against me were false, I trusted people I should not have, and I regret that, but the issues I face are nothing compared to yours -- rising costs, public safety concerns, deep concerns about the future,\" Adams said.",
      "\"This is a complete circus\"",
      "A poll released last week showed Adams was trailing Cuomo, state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and City Comptroller Brad Lander among Democratic primary voters. It gave him a slight edge over former Comptroller Scott Stringer, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, state Sen. Jessica Ramos, former Assemblyman Michael Blake and activist Whitney Tilson.",
      "Adams' decision perplexed some of the candidates in the Democratic primary.",
      "\"If you're reading the news this morning, you're watching television [and] you're scratching your head and saying, 'What the hell is going on,' you are not alone. I'm asking myself the same question. This is a complete circus,\" Myrie said.",
      "\"He's going to lose whatever election he runs in. If he runs in the Democratic primary, he'd lose there. If he runs in the general election, he'd lose there. He can't face accountability from the New Yorkers that he sold out,\" Lander said.",
      "\"The people voted for this man as a Democrat and he made it very clear he doesn't care about us anymore, and so, it's incredibly disappointing, but it's not surprising,\" Blake added.",
      "\"Eric Adams hasn't been a Democrat for a very long time,\" Stringer said.",
      "\"It's ironic to hear the mayor describe himself as an independent when his record has shown him anything but that,\" Mamdani said.",
      "Cuomo took the high road.",
      "\"They call it democracy. Mayor Adams can run as an independent if he chooses. He can run in the Democratic primary if he chooses. That's up to Mayor Adams,\" Cuomo said.",
      "Perhaps the happiest about the mayor's switch is Republican frontrunner Curtis Sliwa.",
      "\"There's no doubt that Eric Adams being an independent helps me,\" he said.",
      "When asked Thursday, the mayor brushed that theory off.",
      "\"He had no chance to win the Democratic primary\"",
      "Political experts say Adams made a smart choice because he avoids the slings and arrows that were sure to come his way in the Democratic primary and can use the power of incumbency to make his case directly to the people.",
      "\"It's a tough needle to thread. It is not going to be easy, but you have campaigns in threes. He has a record to run on. He now has a future to plan. He gets to pick the issues he wants to run on and make it the third one. It's not going to be easy, but he had no chance to win the Democratic primary,\" political consultant O'Brien Murray said.",
      "With Adams out of the primary, Murray says Cuomo is expected to become the focus of attacks by the other candidates. If Cuomo navigates that storm successfully, it will set up a possible showdown between him and Adams in November's general election.",
      "Though Adams' poll numbers are low, Murray said running as an independent gives the mayor a better shot at keeping his job.",
      "\"The Democratic primary is about 80 days away, early voting and so forth. You have 80 days to remake your image and get the message out there after distractions of the court case. Now, you've got over 200 days to go between now and November. You also have to get away from the clutter of a very crowded field in a Democratic primary,\" Murray said.",
      "Adams supporters say he will bounce back",
      "The mayor certainly has his supporters.",
      "\"Regardless of what party he's affiliated with, he's got a very good chance of coming ahead,\" said Ishmael Sanchez of the Bronx.",
      "\"There's a lot of damage that has been done. It's a shame because he's the second African-American mayor and he was set up, but he will bounce back,\" Bishop Erick Salgado said.",
      "The mayor later said in an interview on Fox that he has to rebuild trust among a voter base that may be \"fatigued\" by the political process.",
      "\"We're all fatigued. We're fatigued about affordability in our city. We're fatigued about the concerns of raising healthy children. We're all fatigued with that fatigue. We're going to turn it into the fighting spirit of New York,\" Adams said.",
      "Judge dismisses Adams' federal corruption case",
      "Judge Dale Ho on Wednesday agreed to the\u00a0U.S. Department of Justice's request to drop charges\u00a0against Adams. The judge dismissed the case with prejudice, which means the charges cannot be brought again at a later time.",
      "\"The case against Eric Adams should have never been brought in the first place\u2014and finally today that case is gone forever. From Day 1, the mayor has maintained his innocence and now justice for Eric Adams and New Yorkers has prevailed,\"\u00a0Adams' attorney Alex Spiro said.",
      "Adams was charged in 2024 with abusing his power for almost a decade. A\u00a057-page indictment\u00a0accused him of receiving undisclosed gifts -- including luxury travel -- worth more than $100,000 in return for political favors. He allegedly solicited illegal campaign donations from wealthy foreigners and corporations, including a Turkish government official.",
      "In arguing for the case to be dismissed, DOJ prosecutors said it would have interfered with Adams' 2025 mayoral campaign and hinder his ability to cooperate with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. The initial request to drop the charges noted it was not based on \"the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based.\"",

      "Amazon has told the White House it is interested in buying TikTok ahead of a key deadline by which its parent company, China-based ByteDance, must either sell the popular social media app or face a ban in the U.S., CBS News has learned, according to two people familiar with discussions.",
      "Amazon has submitted a bid for the app, the\u00a0New York Times reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter. Another plan under consideration is for a new entity backed by U.S. companies like BlackRock and Oracle to lease TikTok's algorithm from ByteDance, according to a source familiar with the situation.",
      "Both Amazon and TikTok declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the New York Times reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",
      "He added that he'd \"like to see TikTok remain alive.\"",
      "The U.S. government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because its vast trove of customer data, including browsing patterns, locations and biometric information, could end up in the hands of the Chinese authorities.",
      "Ahead of the initial divestiture deadline, ByteDance earlier this year briefly shut down TikTok in the U.S. Mr. Trump quickly paused the ban and the service was restored.",
      "The ban does not target TikTok's U.S. users. But the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, signed into law in 2024 under former President Biden, would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores and web-hosting services to distribute or service TikTok.",

    "story": [
      "The Pentagon inspector general's office said in a memo Thursday it will evaluate Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of Signal to discuss strikes against the Houthis in Yemen last month.",
      "\"The objective of this evaluation is to determine the extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of a commercial messaging application for official business,\" Acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins said in a memo.",
      "\"Additionally, we will review compliance with classification and records retention requirements.\"",
      "The chairman and Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee requested that the inspector general investigate the use of the Signal chat to discuss the strikes.",
      "The messages posted by The Atlantic show that Hegseth texted the group specific weapons systems and launch times before strike operations were scheduled to start on March 15, 2025. The Atlantic reported that the messages in the chat were set to disappear after one week for some users, raising questions about whether or not the chat complied with records preservation regulations.",
      "\"Nobody's texting war plans,\" Hegseth said last week after The Atlantic published the messages. \"There's no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information.\"",
      "But some lawmakers and experts have questioned the claim that the information wasn't classified because the messages included the timing of strikes before they took place.",
      "The Inspector General Act of 1978, as the memo notes, authorizes inspectors general to have access to personnel and materials to perform their oversight function. Stebbins took over as the Pentagon's acting inspector general after President Trump, upon taking office, fired a number of department watchdogs, including the Defense Department's inspector general, Robert Storch.",
      "Some Democrats have called for Hegseth's resignation over his use of Signal to disclose sensitive strike information.",

    "summary": "ICE agents took Turkish Ph.D. student Rumeysa Ozturk into custody near Tufts, revoked her visa and moved her to a detention center in Louisiana last week.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Boston considered Thursday a case involving a Tufts University Ph.D. student taken into custody in Massachusetts and moved by Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities to Louisiana last week.",
      "The government claimed in a filing Tuesday that Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student and Fulbright Scholar, had already been removed from Massachusetts before a judge issued an order for her to stay in the state, which prosecutors said strips the district court in Massachusetts of jurisdiction to hear the case.",
      "The Justice Department said in its filing that Ozturk had already been transferred to an ICE detention center in Basile, Louisiana.",
      "Attorneys for Ozturk had filed a habeas petition to block her removal from Massachusetts, as well as from the United States, and U.S. District Judge Denise Casper issued a new order several days after Ozturk was detained barring her removal from the U.S. to allow her to resolve the jurisdictional questions.",
      "Casper probed Ozturk's lawyers and the Justice Department about whether the habeas petition was filed in the appropriate venue, the court in Massachusetts, or whether the case should be transferred to Louisiana, where Ozturk is now being held. The student's lawyers are seeking an order that requires immigration officials to return Ozturk to Massachusetts and immediately release her while proceedings continue.",
      "She did not issue a decision on whether Ozturk's case should be moved, instead saying she was \"inclined to wrestle\" with the question.",
      "An attorney for the student argued that her whereabouts remained unknown to her lawyers in the hours after her arrest, and said not even the government's lawyers knew where she was, a situation Ozturk's attorney said it \"quite unusual.\"",
      "She accused immigration officials of ignoring the initial order preventing Ozturk's immediate removal out of Massachusetts and for failing to disclose her location to her lawyers.",
      "\"Here, we have a situation where it's the government that is forum shopping, that is whisking away a petitioner to its forum of choice and doing everything in its power to ensure that a habeas petition cannot be filed,\" the lawyer said.",
      "An acting Homeland Security Department official filed a sworn statement saying Ozturk was arrested on March 25 in Somerville, Massachusetts, where Tufts is located, and then moved to Lebanon, New Hampshire, then to St. Albans, Vermont, overnight. She was again moved at 4 a.m. on March 26 to Burlington, Vermont, before she was finally transferred to the ICE detention center in Basile. The court's order blocking her removal from Massachusetts was issued while Ozturk was in Vermont, and Ozturk's lawyers said her case could also be transferred there.",
      "A Justice Department lawyer sought to draw a distinction between Ozturk's lawyers not knowing where their client was, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement not being forthcoming about her location. He asked the court to dismiss Ozturk's petition outright or remove the case to Louisiana.",
      "\"ICE was still in the process of transferring her through Vermont at the time that the petition was filed,\" he said.",
      "The Justice Department said the decision to move Ozturk to Louisiana was made before she was taken into custody because there is no detention center in Massachusetts for a female detainee.",
      "Ozturk, who's in the U.S. on a student visa, was detained on her way to a Ramadan Iftar dinner on March 25. Surveillance footage showed six plainclothes ICE agents who appeared to be wearing masks stopping Ozturk on the street and taking her into custody.",
      "She's one of several students at American universities whose visas were revoked after they expressed support for Palestinians during the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Ozturk's attorneys argue her detention violates her constitutional rights to free speech and due process, and have asked for her immediate return to Massachusetts and for her to be freed from government custody.",
      "On Wednesday, Tufts president Sunil Kumar submitted a declaration defending Ozturk and supporting her motion regarding her release and return to Massachusetts. Kumar said the university \"has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention.\"",
      "He said that on March 26, the university received a notice stating that Ozturk was a \"'non-immigrant status violator'\" and citing the Immigration and Naturalization Act, it said \"the United States believed that her presence in the country would result in 'potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.'\"",
      "Ozturk was one of four students at Tufts University who co-authored an op-ed in the Tufts Daily college paper in March 2024 urging the university to \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\" and \"divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.\" There is no mention of Hamas in the article. Kumar said the op-ed was consistent with the university's free speech policies and there were \"opinions that were shared just as strongly\" on other sides of the issue.",
      "\"The University has no further information suggesting that she has acted in a manner that would constitute a violation of the University's understanding of the Immigration and Naturalization Act,\" Kumar wrote. He asked that Ozturk \"receive the due process rights to which she is entitled,\" so she can return to Tufts to finish her studies and her degree.",
      "At the time of Ozturk's detention, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said Ozturk \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas,\" but did not provide details about her alleged activities. The government's filing Tuesday also contained no details about alleged ties to Hamas.",
      "The Justice Department's argument regarding jurisdiction \u2014 that the habeas petition arguments should be held where the person is being detained \u2014 has been used by the government in other court cases involving the Trump administration's deportation efforts, including in the case of former Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil and in the cases of five Venezuelan men who sued to block their deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has touted the administration's cancellation of more than 300 student visas so far and said that student visas are meant to encourage studying and getting degrees, \"not to become a social activist\" and \"tear up our university campuses.\"",

      "On Air Force One on Thursday, Mr. Trump told reporters Musk can stay \"as long as he'd like.\" Asked if he would potentially appoint Musk to another post, Mr. Trump said he would, but added that Musk has a \"number of companies to run.\" Mr. Trump said there's a point when \"Elon's gotta have to leave.\" Asked when that might be, the president said he thinks a \"few months.\"",
      "The White House says Musk isn't officially in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), although he has been heavily involved and the president and Vance speak of Musk and DOGE in tandem. By law, Musk, designated a special government employee, may only formally work for the government for 130 days, or a little over four months. That time would run out in late May or early June. Vance said Musk was told that the administration needed him to cut government and make it more efficient, a task Musk was told would take about six months.",
      "\"And that's what Elon signed up for,\" Vance said in an interview with Fox News' Lawrence Jones. \"But of course, he's going to continue to be an adviser. And by the way, the work of DOGE is not even close to done. The work of Elon is not even close to done.\"",
      "Vance touted the work Vance and DOGE have done, including unearthing grants the White House deems wasteful or fraudulent.",
      "\"And yeah, that work's gonna continue after Elon leaves, but fundamentally, Elon is going to remain a friend and an adviser of both me and the president, and he's done a lot of good things,\" Vance said. \"People don't realize how vast and uncontrolled the bureaucracy was. We've started to chip away at it but there's a lot of work to do. It's not going to happen all in six months, it's going to take a long and committed effort.\"",
      "Vance's comments come after Politico reported that the president has told his inner circle and members of his Cabinet that Musk still be stepping back in the coming weeks form his current role, a story Vance and Musk called \"fake news.\"",
      "As a special government employee, Musk's financial disclosure report is not public, and he is exempt from some ethics and conflict-of-interest rules that apply to permanent government employees. It's not clear what the White House would do if Musk, whom the White House says it not being paid, remains longer than 130 days.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Backlash to President Trump's tariffs cropped up throughout Capitol Hill on Thursday, as Democrats, and some Republicans, expressed concern about the sweeping levies on foreign imports \u2014 while putting forward a handful of possible methods to counter them.",
      "On Wednesday, the president announced a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of countries that charge higher taxes on American exports. And after what Mr. Trump described as \"Liberation Day,\" investors appeared spooked, with members of Congress unclear on the path forward.",
      "The response from some lawmakers was swift. Sens. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat and Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, introduced bipartisan legislation Thursday aimed at reasserting Congress' role over trade policy. The measure, known as the Trade Review Act of 2025, would require the president to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or raising tariffs. The president would have to include an explanation and analysis of the potential impact, while lawmakers would have the ability to end the levy with a joint resolution.",
      "Grassley said in a statement that Congress has for too long \"delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,\" while Cantwell argued that the same check and balance that prevents the president from unilaterally declaring war should exist \"as it relates to protecting our commerce activities.\"",
      "\"Congress in the War Powers Act decided to reclaim its authority because they thought a president had overreached,\" Cantwell said on the Senate floor. \"Sen. Grassley and I are trying to do the same thing today by introducing the Trade Review Act of 2025.\"",
      "Meanwhile in the House, Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat who serves as the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Wednesday in response to the new tariffs that he plans to introduce a resolution to force a vote on \"ending the made up national emergency Trump is using to justify these taxes,\" effectively blocking them.",
      "\"Republicans can't keep ducking this \u2014 it's time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,\" Meeks said in a post on X.",
      "The move would force a vote on the House floor within 15 days. And as the GOP wrestles with how to respond to the tariffs, a Democratic committee aide told CBS News they're looking to make the effort to pass Meeks' resolution a bipartisan one. But the resolution would ultimately require the president's signature or a veto-proof majority, making it a gambit unlikely to succeed.",
      "The efforts come after the Senate approved a resolution Wednesday aimed at blocking the president's Canada tariffs, as a handful of Republicans bucked their party leader to support the measure. The bill would have to be approved by the House, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged Speaker Mike Johnson to call the House back into session to take up the measure on Thursday, saying, \"Donald Trump is using tariffs in the dumbest way imaginable.\"",
      "But after House Republicans last month included in a\u00a0bill to keep the government funded\u00a0a provision that widely blocks members from forcing a vote on the Canada and Mexico tariffs amid a similar push by Meeks, it appears unlikely that the resolution would receive a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "Whether any of the moves can make it through both chambers and have an impact on the tariffs or trade situation more broadly remains to be seen. The legislative efforts to counter the tariffs come as congressional Republicans have appeared to struggle with how to respond, though few have appeared willing to strongly rebuke the move so far.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Thursday that he's concerned about the markets following the tariffs announcement. Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who was among the four Republicans who voted with Democrats to block the tariffs on Wednesday, told reporters, \"There is more pro-trade sentiment in the Republican caucus than was evidenced by the vote yesterday,\" adding that he expects after the market response Thursday, \"A lot of people are going to be reconsidering the wisdom of this.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Thursday morning that he was waiting to see how things shake out, noting that the market response was \"not unexpected.\"",
      "\"It's a big policy change, bold policy change, and I think it's going to take some time to determine what the ultimate impacts are going to be,\" Thune said. \"Right now, we're all kind of waiting and seeing and seeing how the administration reacts and what the ultimate permanent policy might look like.\"",

      "Trump has named Ed Martin to the unique U.S. attorney post, which oversaw the historic prosecutions of more than 1,500 defendants accused of storming the U.S. Capitol \u2013\u00a0 the largest federal criminal prosecution in U.S. history. Even before his confirmation vote, Martin's nomination and his reframing of the U.S. Capitol riot has upended an office that is among the largest and most powerful of all federal prosecutor offices in the nation.",
      "Martin has been serving as the District's top prosecutor in an acting capacity since Inauguration Day. He has said he shares President Trump's view of the Capitol attack as a \"day of love,\" and he has already fired some of the prosecutors who handled Jan. 6 cases.",
      "In his 27-page submission to the Senate on behalf of his nomination, a copy of which was obtained by CBS News, Martin highlights his litigation experience by pointing to two Jan. 6 cases in which he served as defense lawyer.",
      "Martin refers to the U.S. Capitol siege as \"the events of January 6, 2021 at the United States Capitol.\"",
      "He flags his work as \"instrumental\" in the defense of alleged Missouri Proud Boys member William Chrestman, who was convicted for confronting police, brandishing an ax and yelling vulgar threats at officers. Chrestman was sentenced to 55 months incarceration. Those convicted of crimes related to Jan. 6 were later pardoned by President Trump.",
      "Martin also wrote that he handled the case of Jan. 6 rioter Joseph Padilla.",
      "\"Mr. Padilla was alleged to have had a physical confrontation with police officers and forced his way into the Tunnel at the Capitol,\" he wrote, adding that he provided legal counsel to Padilla, who was sentenced to more than six years in prison.",
      "The Justice Department's allegations against Padilla in the criminal case were more specific. Prosecutors said in court documents that Padilla \"repeatedly pushed against the bike racks on the Lower West Terrace, forced his way into the Tunnel, and threw a flag pole into the Tunnel, striking an officer in the helmet.\" Padilla was later pardoned by Mr. Trump.",
      "The Justice Department ordered Martin to fire prosecutors involved in the Jan. 6 cases days after he took over as interim leader of the office, according to a memo reviewed by CBS News in January.",
      "He had been a \"Stop the Steal\" advocate and denied that Joe Biden won the presidency in 2020.",
      "Martin's questionnaire to the Senate said he has no experience in court cases that were \"tried to verdict, judgment or final decision (rather than settled)\" as sole or chief counsel.",
      "Although the Senate Judiciary Committee does not typically require U.S. attorney nominees to testify in a confirmation hearing, Senate Democrats have demanded that Martin do so.",
      "Ranking member Sen. Dick Durbin said in a statement that Martin merits the \"heightened scrutiny\" of a hearing because of his \"attacks on federal prosecutors\" and association with \"individuals who pose a threat to our nation.\" Durbin also pointed out Martin's association with alleged Nazi sympathizer Timothy Hale, who was convicted for his role in the assault on the Capitol. Durbin noted that Martin presented Hale with an award for being an \"extraordinary man, an extraordinary leader.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff placed an indefinite hold on Martin's nomination earlier this week, accusing him of undermining the independence of the D.C. U.S. attorney's office and abusing it.",
      "The California senator said Martin has been \"openly threatening and intimidating political opponents, dismissing charges against his own clients, firing public servants for their roles in legitimate investigations and using his office as a cudgel to chill dissent and free speech.\"",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking member in the House Judiciary Committee, issued a statement on Thursday calling Martin Mr. Trump's \"personal enforcer,\" and saying Martin's \"record of political extremism and subservience to Trump speaks for itself.\"",
      "\"In a stunning violation of the law and ethics rules, Martin used his public office in his first week to dismiss charges against a January 6 defendant whom he was still representing,\" Raskin said.",
      "The top prosecutor in D.C. is one of the nation's most powerful and influential U.S. attorneys, in part because it prosecutes cases involving Congress and the federal agencies. Unlike the other U.S. attorneys, the D.C. U.S. attorney has a dual role as both the top federal and local prosecutor in the District and has the largest staff of any of the other offices.",
      "Martin's questionnaire also includes a series of YouTube links to campaign speeches and videos he made when he ran for Congress in Missouri.",
      "As an example of his published legal writings, Martin provided a link to a subscriber-only newsletter substack, which touts itself as a source where \"we're naming names and shedding light on the demons, devils, and depravity attempting to destroy our country from within and without.\"",

From April 5, all imports to the U.S. will be subject to a baseline tariff of 10%. Then, beginning April 9, about 90 countries that the Trump administration says currently impose unfair barriers on imported U.S. goods will be hit by additional \"reciprocal\" taxes.",
      "Some of the Asian nations from which the U.S. has long imported vast quantities of consumer goods will be subjected to the highest tariffs, including a 34% blanket levy on imports from China, which quickly vowed to impose unspecified \"countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests.\"",
      "A number of nations, including Britain, Brazil and Egypt, were hit with the lowest, base-rate 10% tariffs.",
      "Economists have warned that across-the-board tariffs could impact lower-income Americans' finances the most and increase the likelihood of a recession.",
      "The response from other world leaders to Mr. Trump's announcement has almost universally included critique \u2014 or outright condemnation \u2014 of the American leader's overt pressure tactics, but it has also shown a recognition of the importance other countries place on trade relations with the world's largest economy.",

      "Beijing did not indicate what countermeasures it might take but in separate remarks, Ministry of Commerce spokesman He Yadong said \"the trade and economic departments of China and the United States have been maintaining communication,\" and he added that Asia's largest economy remained \"willing to engage with the United States on important issues in bilateral trade.\"",
      "The European Union",
      "Overall, the 27-nation European Union bloc is one of the United States' biggest trade partners and, as a collective entity, has come under some of Mr. Trump's most vociferous criticism for what he considers an unfair imbalance in economic relations.",
      "The EU will be hit next week with a blanket 20% \"reciprocal tariff\" on its exports to the U.S., Mr. Trump announced Wednesday.",
      "\"I know that many of you feel let down by our oldest ally,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a video statement. While she was unequivocal in predicting that Mr. Trump's tactics would negatively impact the entire world, she signaled that the EU would at least wait to see if a new trade deal can be reached before imposing additional retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "\"President Trump's announcement of universal tariffs on the whole world, including the EU, is a major blow to the world economy,\" she said. \"Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism. The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe.\"",
      "Von der Leyen said the EU was \"already finalizing a first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel, and we are now preparing for further countermeasures, to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail.\"",
      "The reaction to Mr. Trump's announcement from individual EU member states was, in some cases, more pointed.",
      "In Germany, the bloc's biggest single largest economy and a major exporter of vehicles to the U.S., in particular, Economy Minister Robert Habeck predicted a U-turn by the American president \u2014 if the EU is able to maintain a united front and push back against the tariffs with measures of its own.",
      "\"That is what I see, that Donald Trump buckles under pressure, corrects his announcements under pressure, but the logical consequence is that he must also feel the pressure, and this pressure must now be exerted from Germany, from Europe,\" Habeck said, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Germany's leader, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, called Mr. Trump's tariffs \"fundamentally wrong\" and \"an attack on a trade system that has created prosperity all round the world \u2014 itself an American achievement.\"",
      "\"The EU has the strongest internal market in the world with 450 million consumers, which gives us the strength to hold talks with the U.S. government to avert a trade war,\" he said. \"We want cooperation, not confrontation, and will defend our interests. Europe will respond united, strong and proportionately to this decision.\"",
      "Giorgia Meloni, Italy's right-wing prime minister and a Trump ally who visited him at Mar-a-Lago in January, called the 20% tariff on EU imports \"wrong\" and a move \"that does not suit any party.\"",
      "\"We will do everything we can to work a deal with the United States, aiming to prevent a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global actors,\" Meloni said. \"In any case, as always, we will act in the interests of Italy and its economy, even by comparing ourselves with other European partners.\"",
      "Ireland's Prime Minister Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, in a post on social media, called the U.S. tariffs on the EU \"deeply regrettable,\" adding: \"I strongly believe that tariffs benefit no one. My priority, and that of the government, is to protect Irish jobs and the Irish economy.\"",
      "The United Kingdom",
      "The U.K. pulled out of the EU almost a decade ago, and while the advantages and disadvantages of that \"Brexit\" remain hotly debated, it will see the U.K. dodge the higher 20% tariffs imposed on its European neighbors. But even the baseline 10% levy announced by Mr. Trump on Wednesday was met with disappointment in London and with a clear desire to keep the storied \"special relationship\" on track.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer huddled early Thursday with the top executives from some of Britain's biggest businesses, eager to voice his support for their enterprises and also to draw on their economic acumen as he pushes for a new trade deal with the U.S., with the hope of getting all tariffs lifted.",
      "\"Clearly, there will be an economic impact from the decisions the U.S. has taken both here and globally,\" Starmer told the business leaders. \"But I want to be crystal clear: We are prepared.",
      "\"Nobody wins in a trade war. That is not in our national interest, and we have a fair and balanced trade relationship with the U.S.,\" Starmer argued, adding that \"negotiations on an economic prosperity deal \u2014 one that strengthens our existing trading relationship [with the U.S.] \u2014 they continue, and we will fight for the best deal for Britain.\"",
      "\"Today marks a new stage in our preparations,\" said Starmer. \"We have a range of levers at our disposal, and we will continue our work with businesses across the country to understand their assessment of these options. As I say, our intention remains to secure a deal. But nothing is off the table.\"",
      "Japan",
      "\"We had been requesting that the U.S. government review its unilateral tariff measures at various levels and we are extremely disappointed and regret that such measures have been implemented nonetheless,\" Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Thursday as his nation woke up to the news of a new 24% levy being imposed by the White House \u2014 which was taking a toll on the Nikkei stock market.",
      "\"We will continue to strongly urge the U.S. to review its measures,\" Ishiba said, according to Reuters.",
      "Japanese Trade Minister Yoji Muto, asked if Tokyo would retaliate with its own new trade barriers to U.S. imports, said the government would \"need to decide what is best for Japan, and most effective, in a careful but bold and speedy manner.\"",
      "Brazil",
      "\"The Brazilian government is evaluating all possible actions to ensure reciprocity in bilateral trade, including resorting to the World Trade Organization, in defense of legitimate national interests,\" the Brazilian government said in a statement Thursday, according to Reuters.",
      "The statement came just after Brazil's Congress approved a bill that would give President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva a legal framework to respond to international tariffs, including with countermeasures such as retaliatory tariffs.",
      "The government statement said Brazil remained open to negotiations with the U.S., and it rejected the White House's characterization of the 10% levy as \"reciprocal,\" saying that assessment does not \"reflect reality.\"",
      "Lula said previously that Mr. Trump's decision to impose tariffs on America's trading partners risked damaging the U.S. economy, and he said Brazil would lodge a formal complaint with the WTO over a separate levy on Brazilian steel exports.",
      "\"It will raise the prices of goods and could lead to [U.S.] inflation that he hasn't yet realized,\" Lula said, according to Reuters. \"Protectionism doesn't help any country in the world.\"",
      "Vietnam",
      "Vietnam was among the nations hardest hit by Mr. Trump's tariff salvo on Wednesday, with the U.S. leader announcing 46% tariffs on exports from the Asian manufacturing hub. Its exports to the U.S. have flourished for years under the so-called China+1 strategy, which has seen Chinese manufacturers get around existing U.S. tariffs on their country by moving some production to other, less-heavily tariffed nations in the region.",
      "Vietnamese officials did not immediately signal any plan to impose retaliatory measures.",
      "As the nation's benchmark stock index appeared on course for its biggest single-day drop in four years and its currency hit an all-time low, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh declared a new task force dedicated to addressing the rapidly changing economic situation after holding a cabinet meeting early Thursday.",
      "Cambodia",
      "The French news agency AFP spoke Thursday with Penn Sovicheat, a spokesman for Cambodia's commerce ministry, who blasted the Trump administration's imposition of a 49% levy on the country's exports as \"not reasonable.\"",
      "The White House says Cambodia is among the nations, like Vietnam and Laos, that have developed their own economies by inviting Chinese investment under the China+1 strategy, enabling Chinese manufacturers to skirt existing U.S. trade barriers. According to Sovicheat, Cambodia exported about $10 billion worth of goods to the U.S. in 2024, largely clothing.",
      "\"China has turned Cambodia into the most important transshipment hub that Communist China uses to evade our tariffs,\" a White House official told reporters this week.",
      "Sovicheat acknowledged that American imports to Cambodia, which he said amounted to around $264 million worth of goods last year, were taxed at an average of 29.4%, but the White House figures Mr. Trump unveiled Wednesday claim the Asian nation has tariffs and other trade barriers in place on U.S. goods amounting to 97%.",
      "\"The 49% tariffs is not a good image for Cambodian industry or our investment attraction,\" Sovicheat told AFP, adding that the government was hoping to negotiate a trade agreement with the Trump administration through existing entities such as the ASEAN trade bloc or the World Trade Organization.",
      "Cambodian Commerce Minister Cham Nimul said in remarks aired by state TV that U.S. consumers would feel the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs on his country before Cambodians, according to the AFP.",
      "\"The increase in tariffs means that the U.S. people who make the purchase orders of Cambodian products are the first people to be impacted, and next will be Cambodia and business people,\" she was quoted as saying.",
      "Australia",
      "Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Thursday that Mr. Trump's 10% tariffs were \"not unexpected, but let me be clear, they are totally unwarranted.\"",
      "\"This is not the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, who, in addition to his frustration, appeared perplexed by the fact that the White House tariffs singled out some of his country's tiny, far-flung territories, including a group of islands that are home to lots of penguins, but no people.",
      "Norfolk Island is an inhabited Australian territory, but only by about 2,000 people, and Albanese called it \"a bit strange\" that it had been singled out by the White House and hit with an even greater tariff of 29%, nearly three times higher than the Australian mainland.",
      "The uninhabited Heard Island and McDonald Islands were subject to the same 10% levy as mainland Australia, meanwhile, despite them rarely seeing human footprints due to \"the extreme isolation\" and the \"persistently severe weather and sea conditions\" in the sub-Antarctic area.",

      "The decision to formally drop the case comes after Judge Ho appointed Paul Clement as a \"friend of the court\"\u00a0to present arguments over the DOJ's request. The\u00a0initial hearing on the request\u00a0did not include anyone who opposed the move.

      "\"The case against Eric Adams should have never been brought in the first place\u2014and finally today that case is gone forever. From Day 1, the mayor has maintained his innocence and now justice for Eric Adams and New Yorkers has prevailed,\" Adams' attorney Alex Spiro said.",
      "\"This case was an example of political weaponization and a waste of resources. We are focused on arresting and prosecuting terrorists while returning the Department of Justice to its core mission of keeping Americans safe,\" the Department of Justice said in a statement.",
      "In the DOJ request to drop the case, prosecutors said having it hang over Adams\u00a0interfered with his 2025 mayoral campaign and his ability\u00a0to cooperate with the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration.",
      "The initial request to drop the charges made note that the decision was not based on \"the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based.\"",
      "That triggered concerns that Adams could not effectively govern the city because\u00a0he would be beholden to the Trump administration, as long as the possibility of the charges returning remained in place.",
      "Adams and his attorneys have vehemently denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Mayor Adams responds to charges being dropped",

I want to thank New Yorkers who stood by my side, who prayed for me, who supported me from day one and stuck with me while we focused on the work at hand.\"",
      "He offered an apology to New Yorkers.",
      "\"I also want to apologize to New Yorkers for having to go through this with me, a baseless case that should have never been brought in the first place,\" Adams said.",

      "\"I'm a New Yorker, and this is the greatest city on the globe, and it's a privilege being your mayor, something I did not take for granted one day, and I'm going to continue to serve you,\" Adams said. \"As I have repeatedly said, I have always been solely beholden to the people of this city. No special interests, no political opponents, but just everyday New Yorkers. Just you, and I'm going to continue to do that. So today we turn the page, we move forward together.\"",
      "Before he went back into Gracie Mansion, Adams held up a copy of \"Government Gangsters,\" a book by FBI Director Kash Patel.",
      "\"Read it and understand how we can never allow this to happen to another innocent American,\" Adams said.",
      "More on the judge's ruling",
      "Judge Ho's decision includes words Adams' opponents are sure to focus in on: \"Everything here smacks of a bargain, dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions.\"",
      "In his ruling to dismiss the case with prejudice, Judge Ho took issue with the Department of Justice's request to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning he could've faced trial on the same charges again at a later time.",
      "Judge Ho summarized the DOJ's reasoning to drop the case as based on three things: It's tainted with impropriety, detrimental to national security and immigration enforcement, and was a weak case to begin with.",
      "\"There  may or may not be good reasons to drop this prosecution. But the reasons articulated by DOJ, if  taken at face value, are inconsistent with a decision to leave the charges in the Indictment hanging  like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the Mayor,\" Judge Ho wrote. \"And there are many reasons to be troubled by DOJ's proffered rationales\u2014further supporting dismissal with prejudice.\"",
      "Judge Ho also addressed why he couldn't continue to pursue the case after the DOJ moved to dismiss it.",
      "\"Some will undoubtedly find today's decision unsatisfying, wondering why, if DOJ's ostensible reasons for dropping this case are so troubling, the Court does not simply deny the  Motion to Dismiss altogether. But, as explained above, the Court cannot order DOJ to continue  the prosecution, and it is aware of no authority (outside of the criminal contempt context) that  would empower it, as some have urged, to appoint an independent prosecutor,\" Judge Ho wrote. \"Therefore, any  decision by this Court to deny the Government's Motion to Dismiss would be futile at best, because  DOJ could\u2014and, by all indications, unequivocally would\u2014simply refuse to prosecute the case,  inevitably resulting in a dismissal after seventy days for violating the Mayor's right to a speedy  trial. That route would simply postpone finality in this case to a date uncomfortably close to the  June 24 mayoral primary. The public interest would not be served by such an outcome.\"",
      "\"To be clear, the Court again emphasizes that it does not express any opinion as to the merits  of the case or whether the prosecution of Mayor Adams 'should' move forward,\" Judge Ho added.",

      "Impact on the mayor's race",
      "The timing of the decision to drop the case was critical for Adams, who faced a Thursday deadline to file petitions to run for mayor in New York City's Democratic primary. He later announced he will run as an independent candidate.",
      "The decision means Adams is now free to run without the threat of going to jail, or facing a politically damaging trial.",
      "CBS News New York has learned that Adams is immediately jumping into the political fray, and he plans to participate in a mayoral candidates forum sponsored by the National Action Network Thursday.",
      "\"He looks forward to engaging with fellow candidates and community leaders to discuss the future of our great city,\" a spokesman said.",
      "Since there's no possibility of the charges against him resurfacing, Adams can also say he is not beholden to President Trump or his administration, since they can no longer bring the same case against him. Adams has repeatedly said that, and just Tuesday night, New York City joined a suit against the Trump administration to challenge cuts that would cost New York City $100 million in CDC funding.",
      "\"When federal policies directly impact our city, we have been, and will continue to be, the first and loudest to advocate for New Yorkers. These funds are crucial in protecting public health, and the reversal will have serious consequences for communities across the five boroughs,\" Adams said in his statement Tuesday night.",
      "Even before Adams officially learned that his case had been dropped, Adams made it clear at a National Action Network event Wednesday that suggestions he was \"under the finger\" of President Trump were, in his mind, false.",
      "\"I do not know who you think I'm under the finger of,\" Adams said Wednesday morning. \"But I'm on the finger of Eric Adams, the mayor of the city of New York, and I'm going to continue to do so.\"",
      "Adams also made an argument voters can expect to hear if he seeks another term.",
      "\"I'm the same person that made sure we put $17 billion in the [minority and women-owned businesses] in this city, that invested in foster care children, that built more housing in year one and year two of our administration than in the history of this city,\" Adams said.",
      "Adams has previously told CBS News New York's Marcia Kramer to expect twists and turns in the upcoming mayoral election.",
      "Adams' opposition speaks out",
      "The mayor's detractors were also speaking out.",
      "\"Either way, I think there was tremendous damage that was done to this city because of an Adams administration, so the quickest we can get away from this administration, I think the better for the city,\" Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said.",
      "\"It's absolutely disgusting. You have a man that broke the law. We want to remind people that it wasn't just about flight upgrades. This was a man who illegally held a campaign donor scheme, and the fact that the judge unfortunately bowed to Trump is appalling,\" mayoral candidate Michael Blake said.",
      "\"The ruling does not change the facts: Eric Adams works for Donald Trump, not New Yorkers,\" mayoral candidate and city Comptroller Brad Lander said.",
      "\"Eric Adams has sold out New Yorkers and put himself above the public at every chance he could. Even the judge in the case agrees: this slimy deal reeks of a quid pro quo with the Trump administration. In exchange for his freedom, Adams has looked the other way while the federal government detains and disappears New Yorkers, steals money from our city, and wages war on working people. Adams should resign in disgrace,\" mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani said.",
      "Move to drop charges sparked resignations",
      "The DOJ memo seeking to drop the charges set off a spate of resignations that started in City Hall, at the very heart of Adams' inner circle, and reached all the way to the U.S. attorney's office. At issue was then-Acting U.S. Attorney of the Southern District of New York Danielle Sassoon's allegation that the request to dismiss the case amounted to a quid pro quo, namely Adams' cooperation on President Trump's immigration enforcement in exchange for his charges being dropped. Sassoon resigned, rather than drop the charges, as did several other people in the U.S. attorney's office.",
      "The mayor and his attorney pushed back strenuously against the notion of a quid pro quo.",
      "\"The idea that there was a quid pro quo is a total lie. We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us,\" Adams' attorney \u00a0Alex Spiro said.",
      "Allegations that Adams had been compromised by the Trump administration and was operating, essentially, under its thumb led\u00a0four New York City deputy mayors to resign\u00a0and spurred numerous calls for Adams to step down. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has the power to remove Adams from office, then met with key leaders to discuss his future. She ultimately acted to limit Adams' powers in a bid to restore trust in government, but said she wouldn't remove him.",
      "What Adams has been accused of",
      "Last September, federal prosecutors alleged Adams had been abusing his power for almost a decade. They said he solicited illegal campaign donations from wealthy foreigners and corporations, including a Turkish government official.",
      "In the\u00a057-page indictment, Adams was accused of receiving gifts he didn't disclose, including luxury travel, worth more than $100,000, in return for political favors.",
      "\"These upgrades and freebies were not part of some frequent flyer or loyalty program available to the general public. As we allege, this was a multi-year scheme to buy favor with a single New York City politician on the rise,\" then-U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District Damian Williams\u00a0said as he announced the indictment.",
      "Prosecutors accused Adams of pressuring FDNY officials to approve the Turkish consulate building in Manhattan, despite fire safety concerns.",
      "The Adams campaign was also accused of using \"straw donors\" for illicit contributions, enabling it to tap into $10 million in matching funds.",
      "\"These are bright red lines, and we allege that the mayor crossed them again and again for years,\" Williams said.",
      "Before the DOJ stepped in, prosecutors appeared to be ramping up their case, claiming they had uncovered\u00a0\"additional criminal conduct.\"",
      "Adams associates also under investigation",
      "The historic indictment came amid\u00a0multiple investigations into Adams' campaign, as well as other administration officials.",
      "Numerous top members of the Adams administration resigned before the indictment was announced, including former\u00a0NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban\u00a0and\u00a0his twin brother, James Caban. Former\u00a0Schools Chancellor David Banks\u00a0and his wife, former\u00a0Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright, and his brother, former\u00a0Deputy Mayor Philip Banks III, were also investigated.",
      "Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a longtime Adams advisor, pleaded not guilty to bribery, money laundering and conspiracy\u00a0in a case involving her son and two real estate developers. The mayor's former liaison for the Muslim community, Mohamed Bahi, was also\u00a0charged with conspiracy for his role in collecting illegal donations\u00a0for Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign and\u00a0has agreed to plead guilty, according to court documents.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans unveiled a budget resolution on Wednesday, as the GOP seeks to move forward with the budget plan that will enable them to implement President Trump's agenda later this week.",
      "The Senate Budget committee released the 70-page budget resolution on Wednesday, which would serve as a blueprint, directing congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview. The plan is a key step toward implementing the president's priorities on border security, defense, energy and taxes. It aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, along with authorizing $1.5 trillion in additional tax cuts, while raising the debt ceiling by as much as $5 trillion.",
      "The blueprint is a compromise resolution that comes after a key meeting between Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson and top tax leaders last week. Though House and Senate Republicans had previously forged ahead with their own budget blueprints in recent weeks, the two chambers must adopt the same budget plan to continue on in the reconciliation process \u2014 a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance legislation in the Senate.",
      "\"It is now time for the Senate to move forward with this budget resolution in order to further advance our shared Republican agenda in Congress,\" Thune said in a statement as the resolution was released.",
      "Thune said the budget resolution will \"pave the way for a generational investment in border security and national defense and unleash American energy dominance,\" while demonstrating a commitment to \"reducing the size and scope of the federal government by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse.\"",
      "The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for a number of committees, at just a few billion dollars, while it calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over a 10-year period in the House. The Senate is expected to find far more than the floor outlined in the resolution, but the figures are aimed at giving them flexibility moving forward.",
      "The Senate majority leader outlined to reporters earlier Wednesday that he plans to file the resolution on the floor after its release, which would start a clock of up to 50 hours of debate and set up a late week vote-a-rama, where senators are allowed to introduce an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to vote through the night. The timeline could set the House on a path to adopt the changes to the budget resolution next week, delivering a key win for President Trump and congressional Republicans before lawmakers leave town for Easter recess.",
      "The budget resolution's release comes as the majority leader and Senate Budget Committee Republicans met with Mr. Trump earlier Wednesday at the White House, where Thune said committee members aired their views with the president.",
      "In a post to his Truth Social platform Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump endorsed the budget deal, saying it \"gives us the tools that we need to get our shared priorities done, including certain PERMANENT Tax Cuts, Spending Cuts, Energy, Historic Investments in Defense, Border, and much more.\"",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after the meeting that the members made the point that their priorities are to extend the Trump tax cuts, to further refine the tax code to encourage growth and extend the debt limit while reducing spending. And he noted that the meeting allayed some of the concerns of budget hawks.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said after the meeting that feels \"a lot more comfortable\" with the budget resolution, saying \"there's just a real commitment to returning the federal budget to a reasonable pre-pandemic baseline.\"",
      "The development also comes as Senate Republicans opted to proceed without the Senate parliamentarian's sign off, arguing in recent days that they don't need the parliamentarian's permission to move ahead with the current policy baseline, an accounting approach that would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing.",
      "In order to approve legislation using the reconciliation maneuver, lawmakers must first approve a budget resolution and direct committees to craft bills reconciling spending with the new budget goals. The final product can only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit, and any new spending must be paid for. The Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package, confirming that the provisions have direct budgetary consequences, if an item is challenged.",
      "Kennedy reiterated the widely held GOP position Wednesday that \"we don't need the parliamentarian's permission,\" arguing that the Budget Committee chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, has the authority to make that decision on the current policy baseline. He projected that Senate Democrats will challenge it, but \"they'll lose.\"",
      "Graham said in a statement upon the resolution's release that \"I have determined that current policy will be the budget baseline regarding taxation.\"",
      "\"This will allow the tax cuts to be permanent \u2013 which will tremendously boost the economy,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday announced the U.S. will impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, as well as higher, \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nations that impose tariffs on U.S. exports, despite warnings from economists over\u00a0increased prices.",
      "The president, who signed an executive order to impose the tariffs, insisted the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of are \"over.\" The reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump said, will amount to roughly half the tariff rate those countries impose on U.S. exports, or less. Countries that will see tariffs higher than 10% include the European Union, China and Israel.",
      "Senior administration officials said the 10% worldwide tariffs take effect April 5 at 12:01 a.m., and the higher reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9 at 12:01 a.m.",
      "\"In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" the president said in a White House Rose Garden announcement. \"And for these reasons, starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\"",
      "\"For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating, and because we are being very kind, we're a kind people, very kind,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're not so kind when you're ripped off\u2026 We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.\"",
      "As he spoke, the president proudly held up a chart showing the new tariff rates the U.S. will begin to impose on allies, foes and everyone in between,",
      "Countries that will see \"discounted reciprocal rates,\" according to a sheet handed out by the White House, include China at a rate of 34%, on top of the tariffs the U.S. already imposes on China; 20% on goods from the European Union; 32% on Taiwan; 25% on South Korea and 17% on Israel.",
      "Canada and Mexico are not subject to these tariffs for now, senior administration officials said, but tariffs the president has already imposed, citing fentanyl and migration issues, persist.",
      "Mr. Trump said \"horrendous\" trade imbalances have hurt the U.S. and put national security at risk, placing blame on previous U.S. presidents and administrations.",
      "\"It's our declaration of economic independence,\" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Trump labeled Wednesday \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "The president lamented that the U.S. imports phones and other electronics, as well as pharmaceuticals, saying that if there's a war, the U.S. would struggle. He said his moves Wednesday are also standing up for U.S. farmers and ranchers who have been \"brutalized\" by other countries, specifically blasting Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump said the Americans \"subsidize\" a lot of other countries, calling out the European Union, China, South Korea and Australia for their trade practices.",
      "\"They've taken so much of our wealth away from us,\" Mr. Trump said of other countries.",
      "The president said he expects complaints from \"globalists,\" \"outsourcers,\" \"special interests,\" and \"fake news\" in the days ahead, but insisted those groups have been wrong about trade before.",
      "\"In the first term, they said tariffs would crash the economy,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Instead, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.\"",
      "In the audience for the president's announcement were rank-and-file steelworkers and auto workers, House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as most of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, including Vice President JD Vance.",
      "What new tariffs did Trump announce today?",
      "The president says his plan will place a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on all countries, with reciprocal tariffs on many trading partners that have their own tariffs placed on the U.S. The 25% tariffs the president previously announced on foreign cars and foreign auto parts are set to go into effect at midnight.",
      "A White House official said the reciprocal tariffs are additive, meaning they will be imposed in addition to any previous tariffs already in place, unless a specific good is exempt under Section 232 of the Tariffs Act, which carries a flat 25% rate on certain things like steel and aluminum.",
      "Here are some of the tariff rates that Mr. Trump announced:",
      "China \u2014 34%\u00a0European Union \u2014 20%Taiwan \u2014 32%South Korea \u2014 25%India \u2014 26%Israel \u2014 17%\u00a0Nicaragua \u2014 18%Norway \u2014 15%Jordan \u2014 20%",

      "Nicaragua \u2014 18%",
      "Norway \u2014 15%",
      "Jordan \u2014 20%",
      "Countries that will see only the baseline 10% tariff rates include: Guatemala, Honduras, Argentina, El Salvador, Ecuador, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Australia and the United Kingdom.",
      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday that tariffs are one tool to get companies to bring jobs back to the U.S.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and- and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here,\" Fain said. \"And, you know, invest in the American workers. The American working class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it.\"",
      "What are tariffs, exactly?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S.\u00a0The most common type of tariffs are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value\"), which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of a product. The 25% auto tariffs are these types of tariffs.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, and \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold.",
      "What do financial experts say about tariffs?",
      "Economists and taxpayer advocacy groups have their doubts, and are warning tariffs could upset economic growth and will almost surely contribute to higher prices for American consumers. Some automakers have already announced higher car prices, after the president announced tariffs on foreign cars and parts.",
      "More than a dozen leaders at think tanks and taxpayer advocacy groups, including at the National Taxpayers Union, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, on Tuesday sent a joint letter to congressional leaders and the commerce and treasury secretaries, urging them to consider how tariffs on steel, lumber, energy, pharmaceutical and medical supplies and cars and car parts will increase prices.",
      "\"We encourage you to consider whether tariffs may, in many cases, undermine President Trump's broader long-term economic goals by increasing the cost of goods subject to tariffs,\" they wrote. \"We are especially concerned about tariffs on inputs needed by U.S. manufacturers that make it harder to compete with finished goods made abroad and tariffs that increase the price of necessities like food and housing.\"",
      "Alex Jacquez, who worked on the Biden White House National Economic Council, said that although it's hard to know the exact impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs without knowing all the details, CEOs are telling investors and shareholders they will be hiking prices.",
      "\"What the major retailers and companies who may be affected by tariffs are planning to do and they're planning out in public here is pass these costs along to consumers as much as they possibly can,\" Jacquez, now the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "Colin Grabow, associate director at the libertarian Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, wrote in a USA Today op-ed that \"tariffs are a costly and inefficient tax usually borne by the importing country's customers.\"",
      "\"Americans may have voted for lower prices in November, but under the guise of tariff reciprocity, the Trump administration is set to deliver something very different,\" Grabow wrote.",
      "A reporter on Tuesday asked Leavitt if the president is thinking about seniors on fixed income who are stressed about the recent swings in the stock market, swings partly attributed to the president's tariff announcements. Stocks have struggled as Wall Street braces for the next round of tariffs.",
      "\"Well certainly, they are legitimate concerns and the president takes those concerns very seriously,\" Leavitt said. \"And he's addressing them every single day. And tomorrow's announcement is to protect future generations of the senior citizens you mentioned. It's for their kids and their grandkids, to ensure that there are jobs here in the United States of America for their children to live the American dream, just like they presumably did.\"",
      "And the president told NBC News he \"couldn't care less\" if his tariffs lead to automakers raising their prices.",
      "\"I couldn't care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars,\" he told NBC.",

    "story": [
      "Senior Food and Drug Administration leaders are planning for cutbacks to the number of routine food and drug inspections conducted by the agency, multiple officials say, due to steep layoffs this week in support staff.",
      "Around 170 workers were cut from the FDA's Office of Inspections and Investigations, according to two federal health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services has said layoffs ordered\u00a0by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with some 10,000 workers let go from the department, would not directly cut FDA's inspections staff. But in meetings among federal health officials, the agency's remaining leaders have grappled with how to deal with major delays and disruptions caused by the loss of administrative and management staff who had supported the agency's inspectors, according to two FDA officials.",
      "\"These administrative functions are being streamlined as part of HHS' transformation initiative to make the agency more efficient and responsive. FDA inspectors were not impacted and this critical work will continue,\" an HHS spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The inspections and investigations office will now need to work with FDA's drug, device and food centers to reprioritize their workload for the rest of the year, one official said. That will mean trimming routine \"surveillance inspections\" for more urgent tasks, the official said, like inspections of firms where the agency has been alerted to a safety risk or follow-up visits to ensure that drugmakers or food producers have fixed previous violations.",
      "One of the biggest immediate impacts on the agency's inspectors stems from the elimination of the office's travel operations division, one official said. The team's work ranged from booking flights to coordinating with the State Department to secure translators needed for inspections of drugmakers and food producers abroad.",
      "\"As of yesterday, all front-line investigators will now be spending significant time processing their own travel and related administrative requirements, rather than spending that time in firms ensuring the American consumer is protected,\" one FDA official told CBS News.",
      "A pilot program of unannounced foreign inspections has also been paused due to the cuts, an official said, because of the loss of staff that had been tasked with quickly securing translators around the world.",
      "The FDA has long struggled to meet its own inspection goals, which was worsened by a backlog created during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a January report by the Government Accountability Office, the FDA was facing a swelling list of food safety inspections that were on track to miss deadlines mandated by Congress, as they struggled to hire and retain qualified inspectors.",
      "While current inspections are still taking place, multiple FDA officials said that cuts are likely to worsen delays caused by other challenges introduced by the Trump administration's efforts to cut spending in recent months.",
      "As one example, multiple officials said that field operations have been hampered by a new government-wide $1 limit on spending cards. Any spending above that limit requires a cumbersome approval process.",
      "Inspectors had already been asked to plan their inspections a month in advance due to the delays caused by the spending limit, one official said.",

    "story": [
      "A wealthy bitcoin entrepreneur and three fellow adventurers plunged back to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Friday, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California to close out the first crewed flight around Earth's poles.",
      "Three-and-a-half days after launch Monday from the Kennedy Space Center \u2014 and after 55 passes above the North and South Poles \u2014 the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\" fired its braking rockets at 11:26 a.m. EDT and slammed back into the discernible atmosphere about 25 minutes later.",
      "Enduring heat shield temperatures up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit, the spacecraft rapidly slowed down, deployed four big red-and-white parachutes and settled to an on-target 16-mph splashdown at 12:19 p.m.",
      "SpaceX crews deployed nearby rushed to the gently bobbing capsule and rigged it for a lift onto the company's recovery ship Shannon.",
      "In the first test of its kind, the crew exited the craft on their own, demonstrating the ability to get out of a Crew Dragon without help from recovery crews.",
      "Unlike crews returning from long-duration flights to the International Space Station who are carried out of their capsules, mission commander Chun Wang and his three companions were able to lift emergency gear up and out of the hatch before climbing out themselves.",
      "While they moved a bit gingerly after three-and-a-half days in weightlessness, Chun, Norwegian cinematographer Jannicke Mikkelsen, Rabea Rogge, a German robotics specialist, and Australian polar guide Eric Philips were all smiles as they greeted support personnel and were escorted into the recovery ship for initial medical checks.",
      "Chun is a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, most recently in Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean where he first met his crewmates, all veterans of polar expeditions.",
      "\"We ... all met on Svalbard, and we love the ice,\" Chun posted on X during the flight. \"The mission was planned when I lived there, and we fly polar because, in an ISS-like orbit, we are unable to see where we live. From this perspective, the mission has perfectly achieved its goal.\"",
      "Chun said before launch he planned to be on the lookout for Antarctic research stations, but Mikkelsen said during the flight that \"unlike previously anticipated, from 460 km above, it is only pure white, no human activity is visible.\"",
      "Neither Chun nor his crewmates are licensed pilots. While Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "But the Crew Dragon is highly automated and can be controlled from the ground when necessary. SpaceX viewed the Fram2 flight as a stepping stone toward opening the door for more non-professionals to fly to orbit.",
      "Chun, an avid world traveler and polar visitor, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter Resilience for the trip to polar orbit, SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",
      "The mission was named Fram2 in honor of a 19th century sailing ship \u2014 Fram, or \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic explorers to the poles. A small piece of the original ship's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"My own journey has been shaped by lifelong curiosity and a fascination with pushing boundaries,\" Chun said before launch. \"As a kid, I used to stare at a blank white space at the bottom of a world map and wonder what's out there.",
      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023. ... Fram2 isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "The crew planned to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew was equipped  with multiple laptops and tablets, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray  generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the  human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration  missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Throughout the flight, the crew posted spectacular videos, including a timelapse view of Earth below as the Crew Dragon sailed over Antarctica all the way to the North Pole, making the trip from one pole to the other every 46 minutes.",
      "\"Proud to be able to bring to space some incredible cameras and lenses capturing the first images of the Arctic and Antarctic shot by humans from space,\" Mikkelsen posted on X. \"These videos are BIG in file size and we look forwards to sharing them with you post-mission splashdown.\"",

    "summary": "Churchill, Manitoba, a small village on the Hudson Bay, is known as the polar bear capital of the world.",
    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",

      "A wealthy Chinese-born bitcoin entrepreneur, a Norwegian cinematographer, a German robotics expert and an Australian adventurer blasted off atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket Monday, kicking off the first crewed flight over the North and South poles.",
      "Using a first stage booster making its sixth fight \u2014  another first for a Crew Dragon \u2014 liftoff from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center came on time at 9:46 p.m. EDT.",
      "Lighting up the night sky, the Falcon 9 initially climbed straight up and then arced over onto a due south trajectory along Florida's east coast before soaring out over the Gulf on a course carrying it above Cuba and Panama toward a polar orbit.",
      "After dropping off the first stage for a successful droneship landing, the rocket's upper stage shut down 10 minutes after liftoff and the Crew Dragon was released to fly on its own. It is expected to fly over the North and South Poles 55 times between Monday night and splashdown Friday in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "\"On behalf of the SpaceX team, we're honored to deliver you safely to your polar orbit,\" radioed Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's former director of space operations and now a senior manager at SpaceX. \"Enjoy the views of the poles, send us some pictures. Our hearts and our minds will be flying with you ... Have a great flight.\"",
      "Who are the private adventurers on the Fram2 mission?",
      "Chun Wang, a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\" for a trip in polar orbit. The deal marks SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",
      "\"My own journey has been shaped by lifelong curiosity and a fascination with pushing boundaries,\" Chun (pronounced choon) told reporters Friday. \"As a kid, I used to stare at a blank white space at the bottom of a world map and wonder what's out there.",
      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023, and now, soon, into space.\" The flight, he added, \"isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "Chun named the mission after the 19th century sailing ship Fram \u2014 \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic pioneers to the polar regions in the 1800s. A small piece of Fram's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"Pretty wild to see the Fram adventurers sailing to the poles once again, over 130 years from (the original ship's) christening,\" SpaceX's launch director radioed the crew. \"This time, though, with Starlink. Cheers.\"",
      "A veteran world traveler, Chun offered the Crew Dragon's three other seats to a trio of explorers he met during a recent polar trip. Jannicke Mikkelsen, a Norwegian cinematographer, is the designated vehicle commander, joined by German roboticist Rabea Rogge as the mission pilot.",
      "The fourth member of the crew is Australian Eric Philips, a professional polar tour guide, adventurer and veteran of some 30 trips to the North and South poles. He is serving as the crew's medical officer.",
      "Some might view the crew as seasoned adventurers and now, space tourists. In an interview with CBS News, Mikkelsen made it clear the crew is well qualified, but she said \"space tourists\" doesn't reflect the extensive training required by SpaceX.",
      "\"I wish it was tourism,\" she said. \"But our education has lasted well over a year, so I have never studied so hard for a three-and-a-half-day expedition in my life.\"",
      "History of private space flights",
      "Chun said he was inspired to book the mission by the example set by entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, the billionaire who chartered SpaceX's first two fully commercial missions, and fellow billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, who flew to the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "\"I owe my inspiration to Jared,\" Chun posted on X. \"If it weren't for @yousuckMZ and @rookisaacman taking the first step, I would have never had the courage to book an entire spaceship and bring along three people I had only met once before. I also copied many good practices from his previous missions \u2014 hope he doesn't mind.\"",
      "Isaacman, who owns and flies a Russian fighter jet, is the Trump administration's nominee to serve as NASA's next administrator.",
      "Unlike Isaacman, no one on the Fram2 mission is a licensed pilot. While Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one crew member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "SpaceX says Fram2 will help refine training procedures aimed at opening up spaceflight to more and more non-professionals.",
      "\"As a roboticist, I'm so hyped about Dragon being an autonomous vehicle which really, I think, shows you how much times are changing in the space sector,\" Rogge said. \"We are really at a crucial point in time where the spacecraft does so many of the tasks itself.",
      "\"I think that really spearheads the accessibility to space, right? Because the dream is (to) have many people in space if we want to live and work there as a civilization.\"",
      "She added, \"right now I think the stereotype of an astronaut is that, you know, super, super, super human, medically perfect. But we should really flip this question and be like, OK, how do we design living and working in space for everyone?\"",
      "Plans for orbiting around the poles",
      "The crew plans to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew is equipped with four iPad Minis, two iPhone Pro Max cellphones, three laptop computers, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Also on board: a Starlink laser terminal mounted in the Crew Dragon's lower trunk section that will give the crew, in theory, data relay speeds of up to 100 gigabytes per second or better.",
      "To reach the planned orbit around the poles, one tilted 90 degrees to Earth's equator, the flight plan called for the Falcon 9 to follow a due-south trajectory carrying the crew above southern Florida, Cuba and Panama on the way to space. The 273-mile-high orbit will allow 55 passes above the poles between launch and splashdown.",
      "Jon Edwards, a SpaceX vice president who oversee Falcon 9 flight operations, said the Crew Dragon's flight software was modified to ensure the vehicle passes safely over populated areas, guiding the rocket as needed to keep the capsule or other components well away from any populated areas in an emergency.",
      "\"We're going to fly out of 39A in Florida and go pretty much straight south,\" Edwards said. \"In fact, the flight path is going to go over Florida. If you were in Miami and you looked straight up, you know, at the right time. would see the rocket and the crew flying right overhead.",
      "\"What we call the instantaneous impact points, which is where, if we cut power, it would land, that will stay offshore, so it's totally safe to do this. But it will be flying over Florida and over Cuba and Panama and just to the west of Peru and Ecuador.\"",
      "NASA and the U.S. Space Force routinely launch military satellites and science probes into polar orbits from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, where rockets can fly due south over the Pacific Ocean without passing over populated areas.",
      "But the maximum inclination for orbital payloads launched from the East Coast has traditionally been limited to avoid flying over areas where debris from a catastrophic failure might fall. In recent years, SpaceX has launched satellites into polar or near-polar orbits from Cape Canaveral, but no piloted flights.",
      "While NASA and the Air Force once planned to launch space shuttles into polar orbit from Vandenberg, the military space program changed priorities in the wake of the 1986 Challenge disaster and those plans were shelved six months before the initial flight.",
      "The polar orbit will provide spectacular views for the Fram2 crew that Mikkelsen plans to document, from the ice caps to shimmering auroras. The public is invited to share the experience, photographing auroras at the same time Fram2 is capturing the view from space.",
      "\"We have reached out to 2.2 million auroral citizen scientists,\" she said. \"And anyone can join, where you go outside if there is aurora where you live and you note where you live and you ... take a photo of the aurora at the same time as we and Fram2 fly over.",
      "\"Local observatories are also activating their instruments so that we get this incredible data bank during our mission of the aurora from Earth and from space at the same time so we can understand ... what the phenomena can bring to humankind and specifically to satellite technology.\"",

      "Unlike crews returning from long-duration flights to the International Space Station who are carried out of their capsules, mission commander Chun Wang and his three companions were able to lift emergency gear up and out of the hatch before climbing out themselves.",
      "While they moved a bit gingerly after three-and-a-half days in weightlessness, Chun, Norwegian cinematographer Jannicke Mikkelsen, Rabea Rogge, a German robotics specialist, and Australian polar guide Eric Philips were all smiles as they greeted support personnel and were escorted into the recovery ship for initial medical checks.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stuck-astronauts-speak-out-after-return/",
    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 20:30:56 -0400",
    "summary": "NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, who were stuck in space for more than nine months, took questions after returning to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, speaking out at a news conference for the first time since returning to Earth after an extended 286-day stay in space, said Monday they did not blame Boeing for the spacecraft problems that effectively stranded them aboard the International Space Station.",
      "In fact, asked if he would fly again aboard the Starliner, Wilmore said, \"Yes, because we're going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We're going to fix them. We're going to make it work. Boeing is completely committed. NASA is completely committed, and with that, I'd get on in a heartbeat.\"",
      "Added Williams: \"I would agree. The spacecraft is really capable. There were a couple things that need to be fixed ... and folks are actively working on that, but it is a great spacecraft, and it has a lot of capability that other spacecraft don't have. To see that thing successful and to be part of that program is an honor.\"",
      "Asked if he blamed Boeing for the propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems that ultimately led NASA to bring the Starliner down without its crew, extending their stay aboard the space station from eight days to more than nine-and-a-half months, Wilmore said, \"That is a question that I cannot answer in a couple of comments. But I'll start with me.\"",
      "\"There were questions that I, as the commander of the spacecraft, that I should have asked, and I did not. At the time, I didn't know I needed to. And maybe you could call that hindsight, but I'll start and point the finger and I'll blame me. I could have asked some questions and the answers to those questions could have turned the tide.",
      "\"So blame, I don't like that term, but certainly there's responsibility throughout all the programs and certainly you can start with me. Responsibility with Boeing? Yes. Responsibility with NASA? Yes. All the way up and down the chain. We all are responsible. We all own this.\"",
      "Their repeatedly extended mission generated enormous attention in the wake of problems with Starliner, NASA's decision three months after launch to keep them in orbit until this year, and comments from President Trump claiming the astronauts had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "Williams denied feeling \"abandoned\" or \"stuck\" during an interview with CBS News in February, saying she was \"honored ... to be here and a part of the team\" doing \"world-class science.\" They said much of the same Monday. But they avoided answering questions about the political aspects of the mission.",
      "Wilmore and Williams returned to Earth on March 18, accompanied by two outgoing station fliers who were wrapping up their own six-month stay aboard the lab. The Starliner astronauts, like all returning station fliers, began physical therapy back at the Johnson Space Center to help them readjust to gravity.",
      "They both looked fit and were in obviously good spirits talking with reporters Monday. In fact, Williams said she went for a 3-mile run on Sunday.",
      "How long were the astronauts stuck in space?",
      "By the time they splashed down off Florida's Gulf Coast, Wilmore and Williams had spent 286 days in space.",
      "While the extended mission was much longer than originally planned, it ranks sixth on the list of longest flights by U.S. astronauts.",
      "The record is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, whose planned six-month stay aboard the space station was extended to just over a full year \u2014 371 days \u2014 because of coolant leaks in the Russian Soyuz that carried him to orbit. He came back to Earth aboard a replacement Soyuz in September 2023.",
      "Even though his record remains unbroken, problems with the Boeing Starliner that carried Wilmore and Williams to space triggered extensive coverage in the United States that far exceeded the coverage of Rubio's even longer mission.",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck in space so long?",
      "Three years after the space shuttle's retirement in 2011, NASA awarded multibillion-dollar contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build ferry ships to carry astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX has now launched 11 piloted Crew Dragon flights for NASA and five purely commercial missions. A sixth commercial launch is currently scheduled for Monday night.",
      "But Boeing ran into multiple problems with its Starliner that required two unpiloted test flights before Wilmore, who is 62, and Williams, 59, both former military test pilots, were finally cleared to launch last June 5 on the spacecraft's first piloted mission after engineers decided a small helium leak in the ship's propulsion pressurization system would not get worse.",
      "The astronauts successfully docked with the space station the next day, but the Starliner experienced additional helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "While the flight originally was expected to last about eight days, NASA and Boeing carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine what caused the problems and whether the spacecraft could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could, in fact, safely come home in the Starliner.",
      "But NASA managers eventually ruled out that option and decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year when they could hitch a ride home aboard a Crew Dragon. That spacecraft was launched last September with just two crew members on board, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner, meanwhile, successfully returned to Earth earlier in September, kicking off hands-on troubleshooting and ongoing work to prepare for the eventual resumption of flights.",
      "Wilmore, Williams, Crew 9 Dragon commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov originally planned to return to Earth in February. But the Crew 10 Dragon needed to carry their replacements to the station ran into problems of its own and the flight was delayed to the end of March.",
      "Those problems, and the threat of additional delays, prompted NASA to switch the Crew 10 fliers to a different Crew Dragon, eventually moving its launch up to March 12, paving the way for Crew 9 to head home.",

      "The unmanned Spectrum rocket, an orbital rocket developed by German start-up Isar Aerospace, started smoking from its sides and then crashed back to Earth with a powerful explosion after launching from Norway's Andoya Spaceport in the Arctic. The company called the test flight a success.",
      "\"Our first test flight met all our expectations, achieving a great success,\" Daniel Metzler, Isar's chief executive and co-founder, said in a news release. \"We had a clean liftoff, 30 seconds of flight and even got to validate our Flight Termination System.\"",
      "The company said the two-stage rocket fell into the sea, adding that \"the launch pad seems to be intact\".",
      "Orbital rockets are designed to place loads such as satellites into or beyond Earth's orbit.",
      "Spectrum's blast-off was the first of an orbital launch vehicle from the European continent, excluding Russia, and Europe's first financed almost exclusively by the private sector.",
      "The launch had been repeatedly postponed due to weather conditions, and Isar Aerospace had downplayed expectations.",
      "\"Every second we fly is good because we collect data and experience. Thirty seconds would already be a great success,\" Metzler, said ahead of the launch.",
      "\"We do not expect to reach orbit with this test. In fact, no company has yet managed to put its first orbital launch vehicle into orbit.\"",
      "The 92-foot two-stage rocket was not carrying any load for the test flight.",

    "summary": "Amazon has expressed interest in buying TikTok ahead of deadline for ByteDance to sell the social media app or face a U.S. ban.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon has told the White House it is interested in buying TikTok ahead of a key deadline by which its parent company, China-based ByteDance, must either sell the popular social media app or face a ban in the U.S., CBS News has learned, according to two people familiar with discussions.",
      "Amazon has submitted a bid for the app, the\u00a0New York Times reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter. Another plan under consideration is for a new entity backed by U.S. companies like BlackRock and Oracle to lease TikTok's algorithm from ByteDance, according to a source familiar with the situation.",
      "Both Amazon and TikTok declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the New York Times reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",
      "He added that he'd \"like to see TikTok remain alive.\"",
      "The U.S. government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because its vast trove of customer data, including browsing patterns, locations and biometric information, could end up in the hands of the Chinese authorities.",
      "Ahead of the initial divestiture deadline, ByteDance earlier this year briefly shut down TikTok in the U.S. Mr. Trump quickly paused the ban and the service was restored.",
      "The ban does not target TikTok's U.S. users. But the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, signed into law in 2024 under former President Biden, would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores and web-hosting services to distribute or service TikTok.",

    "story": [
      "Financial markets ended a tumultuous week with a thud, as stocks tumbled for a second straight day on concerns about the economic fallout from new U.S. tariffs and the prospects of a global trade war.",
      "President Trump's announcement of steep tariffs on Wednesday shocked investors and sent economists scurrying to revise downward their forecasts for U.S. economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also warned that the levies \u2014 which include a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nearly 90 countries \u2014 are likely to dent the economy.",
      "\"While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,\" Powell\u00a0said in a speech Friday in Arlington, Virginia. \"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\"",
      "The S&P 500 fell 322 points, or nearly 6%, to close at 5,074 \u2014 the largest one-day slump in the broad-based index since March 16, 2020, when it lost 12%. Today's plunge erased $2.7 trillion in market value from the index. The decline wipes out more than a year of stock market gains, taking the S&P 500 back to its levels in February 2024.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2,231 points, or 5.5%, and is down 14% since peaking in February. The Nasdaq Composite slid 963 points, or 5.8%. That means the the tech-heavy index is now in a bear market, or when stocks drop at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "Tech stocks have flailed this week because of concerns that American tariffs on China \u2014 along with countermeasures from Beijing \u2014 will hurt the high-tech sector, which has been key to driving corporate profits.",
      "\"The economic pain that will be brought by these tariffs [is] hard to describe and can essentially take the U.S. tech industry back a decade in the process while China steamrolls ahead,\" Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said in a report.",
      "Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, told clients that the U.S. could tip into a recession later this year unless the U.S. moves to ease tariffs.",
      "\"In the near term, we believe the effective tariff rates could be higher still, and without President Trump taking active steps to reduce tariffs over the next three to six months, we are likely to enter a downside scenario, including a meaningful U.S. recession and lower equity markets,\" he said in a research note.",
      "The free-fall amounts to the biggest two-day drop for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since March 2020, when the pandemic began, and has wiped out trillions of dollars in investor wealth.",
      "Drops of this magnitude aren't unheard of on Wall Street, but they're rare. Over the last 25 years, the S&P 500 has fallen 4% in a single day 38 times, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for brokerage firm LPL Financial.",
      "Overseas markets also slid Friday. In overnight trading in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 dropped 2.8%, while South Korea's Kospi sank 0.9%. In European trading, Germany's DAX lost 2%, France's CAC 40 in Paris dipped 1.6% and Britain's FTSE 100 shed 1.7%.",
      "U.S. growth downgraded",
      "Economists have downgraded their outlook for U.S. economic growth this year as Mr. Trump piles tariffs on a growing list of countries, warning that the levies are likely to boost inflation. That could reduce consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, as well as crimp business investment.",
      "Import taxes are largely borne by businesses, which typically pass on part or much of those added costs to consumers. As a result, Americans could face higher prices for electronics, household appliances, cars, clothing, furniture, and food such as coffee and chocolate, according to economists.",
      "\"Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters,\" Powell said\u00a0Friday.",
      "According to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research firm, the Trump administration's tariffs could cost U.S. households more than $1,900 this year.",
      "David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, thinks U.S. trade officials will eventually lower tariff rates as they negotiate with their counterparts abroad. But that process is likely to take time, and the investment bank doesn't expect a speedy reversal in U.S. tariffs. As a result, UBS economists have lowered their forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to less than 1%.",
      "China strikes back",
      "Investors are also nervously watching as the barrage of U.S. tariffs prompts retaliation from key trading partners. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014 materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose trade sanctions on 27 additional U.S. companies.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "In more upbeat news for financial markets, U.S. employers added 228,000 jobs in March, far exceeding analyst forecasts. The nation's unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, versus 4.1% in February.",
      "Yet while job growth was robust last month, experts say the government's latest hiring numbers don't reflect the impact of the Trump administration's trade policies on the economy.",
      "\"For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,\" Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, said of this week's downdraft in stocks.",

      "After a few seconds, Ovechkin's personal goal song, \"Shake, Rattle & Roll\" by Big Joe Turner started blaring from arena speakers as mascot Slapshot flipped the counter in one corner from 892 to 893. Fans chanted, \"Ovi! Ovi!\" before and after play resumed.",
      "Scoring in a fourth consecutive game, Ovechkin reached 40 goals for a 14th time in 20 seasons, which is the most in league history. With his second, he is at 41.",
      "And while Ovechkin has tied Gretzky's goals mark, no one will likely touch Gretzky's record of 1,963 assists and 2,857 total points. If Gretzky had never scored a single goal in his entire career, he would still be the NHL all-time leader in points since goals and assists both count as one point in hockey.",

      "Washington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin\u00a0has tied\u00a0Wayne Gretzky's career NHL regular-season record of 894 goals, one that has stood for more than a quarter-century.",
      "It's a number that was seemingly untouchable. Gretzky, considered arguably the greatest hockey player of all time, set the mark with the New York Rangers in 1999 in his 20th and final season.",
      "The 39-year-old Ovechkin has until the Capitals' final regular-season game on April 17 to break it or wait for next year. He reached 894 by scoring two goals against the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday, April 4, with Gretzky in attendance at D.C.'s Capital One Arena   looking on.",
      "\"It's just a matter of time, whether it's late this year, early next year, whenever,\" Gretzky told NHL.com last September about Ovechkin breaking the mark. \"I mean, he's a great player. He's a great goal scorer.\"",
      "Gretzky also holds the record for most career goals in the regular season and playoffs combined, with 1,016. Ovechkin sits in second place as well in that category, about 50 goals back.",
      "Gretzky won four Stanley Cups with the Edmonton Oilers, and also played for the Los Angeles Kings, St. Louis Blues and New York Rangers. By contrast, Ovechkin has spent his entire pro career in Washington, D.C. A colorful personality off the ice, the Moscow native once portrayed a Russian spy in an ESPN commercial and swam in a public fountain with teammates to celebrate winning the Stanley Cup. Ovechkin, who led the Capitals to their first championship in 2018, already holds several NHL career records, including the most power play goals, most goalies scored upon and most goals with one team.",
      "Here are some of the most famous records in American sports.",
      "Wayne Gretzky's NHL assists and points record: 1,963 and 2,857",
      "While Ovechkin has tied Gretzky's holy grail of goals, no one will likely touch Gretzky's record of 1,963 assists and 2,857 total points.",
      "To put that in perspective: If Gretzky had never scored a single goal in his entire career, he would still be the NHL all-time leader in points since goals and assists both count as one point in hockey. By comparison, the No. 2 all-time points leader is Jaromir Jagr, who tallied 766 goals and 1,155 assists during his career for a total of 1,921 points \u2014 or nearly 1,000 points shy of Gretzky.",
      "Wilt Chamberlain with the most points in an NBA game: 100",
      "On March 2, 1962, the late Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points for the then-Philadelphia Warriors (now the Golden State Warriors) in a win over the New York Knicks. Chamberlain, one of NBA's greatest centers, went 28 of 32 from the stripe despite being a career 50% free throw shooter.",
      "It's a record that has never been threatened. The late Kobe Bryant came the closest when he scored 81 points for the Los Angeles Lakers in a game against the Toronto Raptors in 2006.",
      "Chamberlain was utterly dominant in his era. There have only been 15 70-plus point games in NBA history, and Chamberlain has six of them.",
      "Cal Ripken Jr. with the most consecutive MLB games played: 2,632",
      "For 17 seasons, Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. did not miss a single game. From May 1982 until September 1998, Ripken was an iron man, playing a stunning 2,632 consecutive games.",
      "On Sept. 6, 1995, Ripken broke New York Yankees legendary first baseman Lou Gehrig's then 59-year-old record of 2,130 straight games set in 1939, one that was believed to be unbreakable. For good measure, Ripken went on to play another 502 straight games after surpassing Gehrig.",
      "His streak came to an end on Sept. 20, 1998, when he voluntarily chose to sit out Baltimore's final home game of the season against the Yankees.",
      "Caitlin Clark as the all-time leading scorer in NCAA Division I basketball: 3,951 points",
      "In her final season at Iowa, Caitlin Clark became a household name, completely upending the basketball world. Her games became must-see TV, drawing in millions of new fans, and her rivalry with Angel Reese prompted Lakers legend Magic Johnson to compare it to his own with the great Larry Bird.",
      "And while Clark set numerous records over her college career, one stands head and shoulders above them all. On March 3, 2024, against Ohio State, the sharp-shooting guard passed the late \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich to become the NCAA Division I career scoring leader. His mark of 3,667 points set in 1970 with LSU had stood for 54 years.",
      "Clark ultimately finished her college career with 3,951 points \u2014 no currently active players are close to Clark's mark. Over 139 games for Iowa, she averaged 28.4 points per game, also a women's Division I record.",
      "And she's not nearly done. The 23-year-old was the No. 1 overall pick by the Indiana Fever in the 2024 WNBA draft, and as a rookie, she set the WNBA's single-season assists record with 337.",

      "If that wasn't enough, Nicklaus was a runner-up in another 19 majors, also a record, according to the PGA Tour.",
      "When Tiger Woods came blazing onto the scene in the mid-1990s, Nicklaus' majors record appeared to be at risk. But Woods \u2014 whose career was derailed by injuries and tumult in his personal life \u2014 sits three back from Nicklaus at 15.",
      "While Nicklaus holds the record for most majors, Woods and Sam Snead are tied for the record for most PGA tour wins with 82. Nicklaus is in second with 73.",
      "The 1972 Miami Dolphins with the NFL's only undefeated season",
      "To say legendary head coach Don Shula and his 1972 Miami Dolphins steamrolled through the rest of the NFL is an understatement. That team, which produced eight Hall of Famers, went a stellar 14-0 in the regular season and had the league's No. 1 ranked offense and defense.",
      "The Dolphins then tore through their playoff competition, defeating Washington 14-7 in Super Bowl VII to cap their perfect 17-0 season.",
      "That record was put in serious jeopardy in 2007 by Bill Belichick's New England Patriots. Spurred by historic seasons from quarterback Tom Brady and wide receiver Randy Moss, the Pats went 16-0 in the regular season and reached Super Bowl XLII, where they were heavily favored against the New York Giants.",
      "But that only set the stage for one of the greatest upsets in NFL history. Late in the fourth quarter and trailing 14-10, Giants quarterback Eli Manning and wide receiver David Tyree connected on the \"helmet catch,\" one of the greatest plays in NFL history. The play set up a Plaxico Burress game-winning touchdown, denying the Pats their perfect season.",
      "Every NFL season, when the last undefeated team loses, the remaining living members of the 1972 Dolphins team will pop champagne to celebrate.",
      "The Los Angeles Lakers with the NBA's longest winning streak: 33 games",
      "With a roster featuring the likes of legendary Hall of Famers Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor and Gail Goodrich, the Lakers ripped off 33 straight regular-season wins from Nov. 5, 1971, until Jan. 7, 1972, a record that still stands more than a half-century later.",
      "That Lakers team finished the regular season with 69 wins \u2014 also a record which stood for over 24 years until Michael Jordan's 1996 Chicago Bulls broke it by going 72-10 \u2014 and delivered the Lakers their first title since they had relocated from Minneapolis to Los Angeles in 1960.",
      "The only group to come close to breaking the 33-game winning streak was LeBron James' Miami Heat in 2013, who won 27 straight games from Feb. 3, 2013, to March 25, 2013. That Heat team, with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, also won the NBA title that year.",
      "A few years later, Steph Curry's Golden State Warriors won 28 straight regular season games, but divided over two seasons. They won four games to close the 2014-15 season, and then another 24 straight to open the 2015-16 season.",
      "Joe DiMaggio with MLB's longest hitting streak: 56 games",
      "Baseball is a sport defined by statistics and dominated by numbers, and few numbers are more revered than New York Yankees centerfielder Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak in 1941.",
      "Beginning on May 15, 1941, DiMaggio recorded a hit in 56 straight games, spanning over two months. Over the course of the streak he batted .408, had 15 home runs and drove in 55 runs.",
      "On July 17, 1941, against the Cleveland Indians, shortstop Lou Boudreau fielded a groundball and recorded the out that ended DiMaggio's streak.",
      "In the more than 70 years since, no player has come close to DiMaggio's record. In 1978, the late Pete Rose had a 44-game hitting streak, and in 1987, Milwaukee Brewers infielder Paul Molitor achieved a 39-game streak.",
      "Eric Dickerson's NFL single-season rushing record: 2,105 yards",
      "In 1984, in just his second season in the league, Los Angeles Rams running back Eric Dickerson rumbled to an NFL regular-season rushing record of 2,105 yards, a mark that has remarkably stood for more than 40 years.",
      "Over the course of the 16-game season, the Hall of Famer averaged 131 yards per game and had twelve 100-yard games.",
      "Seven running backs have since recorded 2,000-yard seasons. In 2012, Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson came within nine yards of breaking Dickerson's record, falling just short with 2,097 yards.",
      "The NFL increased the regular season from 16 to 17 games in 2021, making it more likely Dickerson's mark could someday fall.",
      "This past January, Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley went into the team's final regular-season game sitting on 2,005 rushing yards and a chance to break Dickerson's record. However, Eagles head coach Nick Siriani chose to rest Barkley in preparation for the playoffs. A move that paid off when the Eagles won the Super Bowl about five weeks later.",
      "UConn with the longest winning streak in college basketball: 111 games",
      "Arguably, no team has eclipsed a sport quite like UConn has eclipsed women's college basketball this century.",
      "From 2000 to 2016, UConn under head coach Geno Auriemma won 10 of his 11 NCAA titles with the university. And beginning in 2000, UConn played in 21 of a possible 26 Final Fours.",
      "But it is the 111-game winning streak that began in November 2014 and was broken in March 2017 that is most staggering.",
      "During the two-and-a-half year winning streak, UConn won four consecutive NCAA titles.",
      "The 111-game streak, the longest in college basketball history, ended in dramatic fashion in the Final Four on March 31, 2017, when Mississippi State's Morgan William hit a buzzer-beater in overtime to shock UConn 66-64. Mississippi State went on to lose in the championship game to South Carolina.",
      "And even with the loss to Mississippi State, UConn also had a 126-game regular season streak that started in November 2014 and lasted more than four years through January 2019.",
      "UConn's dominance under Auriemma has drawn comparisons to the UCLA men's basketball team under John Wooden, which won 10 titles in 12 seasons between 1964 and 1975. During that era, UCLA had an 88-game winning streak of its own from 1971 to 1974.",

      "\"DHS is now exercising its discretion to terminate your parole,\" the April 3 notice said, referring to the temporary legal status that the Biden administration granted to hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians. \"Unless it expires sooner, your parole will terminate 7 days from the date of this notice.\"",
      "The Biden administration welcomed roughly 240,000 Ukrainians under a policy known as Uniting for Ukraine, or U4U, that allowed Americans to sponsor Ukrainians displaced by Russia's invasion. More than 20,000 Ukrainians who flew to Mexico at the start of the war were also allowed into the U.S. under the parole authority, which allows officials to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to migrants on humanitarian grounds.",
      "If recipients failed to leave the U.S., the message read, they would \"be subject to potential law enforcement actions that will result in your removal from the United States,\" unless they have received another immigration status.",
      "The notice also said recipients would lose their work permits once their parole status was revoked, and encouraged them to sign up for self-deportation using a government smartphone app known as CBP Home that the Trump administration recently repurposed.",
      "\"Again, DHS is terminating your parole. Do not attempt to remain in the United States \u2014 the federal government will find you,\" the notice warned. \"Please depart the United States immediately.\"",

      "The Trump administration's sweeping cuts to the federal bureaucracy have included slashing a little-known government agency that channels grant money to America's libraries \u2014 a potentially crippling interruption to a funding lifeline for libraries around the country.",
      "One staff member at the Institute of Museum and Library Services sent grant coordinators a chilling email, obtained by CBS News, warning the agency would \"not be able to work or respond to your emails\" and that there was no \"information about future timelines related to this action.\"",
      "\"You call and the phone just keeps ringing, you know, there's nobody home,\" Mandy Knapp, the Ohio state librarian and executive director, said in an interview with CBS News.",
      "On March 20, teams from DOGE \u2014 the budget-cutting army led by billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 descended on the Institute, a tiny federal department that was created by Congress in 1996 to oversee grants for museums and libraries around the nation. Late Wednesday night, organizations that receive Institute funding \"began receiving notification that their grants were being terminated, effective immediately,\" according to a local branch of the American Federation of Government Employees union.",
      "Wednesday night, word came that more than a dozen Institute grants were terminated \u2014 \"seemingly at random,\" the union said. Three states, California, Connecticut and Washington, received the first termination notices for their state library grants, according to a statement from the union.",
      "The notification could not have come at a worse time, library officials told CBS News. Washington's Deputy Secretary of State Randy Bolerjack says that the funding they received through the program helped support 32 positions at the Washington State Library, which have statewide impact and benefit public, tribal, K-12, and community college libraries.",
      "The Institute has previously cited its \"Grants to States\" program as the largest source of federal funding support for library services in the U.S. With over $160 million allocated to the program annually. The grants are formulated based on population and give state libraries complete oversight as to how funding is allocated to their local branches. In states like Ohio and South Carolina, officials told CBS News that this funding has been critical to keeping libraries in rural areas on par with those in larger cities.",
      "Breanne Smith, associate deputy director at South Carolina's state library, told us that public libraries in the state saw over 10 million visits last year alone. She says in rural communities especially, libraries are more than just a place to check out books.",
      "\"People go to their library for not even just the library services, they just go there for wifi, to use a computer. Libraries are really a community anchor,\" Smith said.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS, notice of the cuts to Washington's state library came from the Institute's acting director, Keith Sonderling, who is a deputy director at the Labor Department. Union officials said they were told that the Trump administration cuts were made because they were not aligned with the Institute's priorities. The deputy director at the South Carolina state library, Chris Yates, says he finds their rationale \"puzzling.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Labor Department for comment, but has not received a reply.",
      "Yates also expressed that the sporadic cuts have left state library staff in a state of uncertainty. The funds South Carolina receives support public libraries in all 43 counties, which serve over 5.4 million residents.",
      "\"Everyone, I think, is just in a holding pattern to see if they're gonna receive a letter or not.\", Yates told CBS News.",
      "Knapp says their funding does more than support libraries \u2014 it also funds summer reading programs, special access to materials for those with visual impairments, and offers access to state-of-the-art technology and the internet in rural communities. Their \"vital\" summer reading program has already been put on pause, Knapp said.",
      "In a letter sent to the White House yesterday, 127 Democratic members of Congress urged the administration to reconsider its decision to shutter the agency. \"Eliminating the [the Institute] would not only jeopardize these essential services but also dismiss the everyday needs of millions of Americans who rely on libraries and museums for learning, job opportunities, and community engagement,\" the letter says.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, told CBS News that the cuts will only undermine Americans' access to library resources, which he considers vital to bringing communities together.",
      "\"Trump's plan to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services would barely make a dent in the federal budget, but it would be devastating for communities across the country,\" Murphy said.",
      "In addition to congressional support, four major publishing houses have also sent a letter to Congress outlining concerns, saying, \"libraries are essential community hubs that provide free access to these valuable tools and resources. Defunding libraries would result in mass closures and the destruction of a system that today benefits millions of Americans.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the way for the Trump administration to cancel millions of dollars in federal education grants because it said they funded programs that involve diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "The high court split 5-4 in granting a request from the Justice Department to pause a federal district court order that required the Department of Education to reinstate the grants that had been awarded to universities and nonprofit organizations in eight states. The court said in an unsigned opinion that its stay will remain in place while legal proceedings move forward.",
      "\"Respondents have represented in this litigation that they have the financial wherewithal to keep their programs running. So, if respondents ultimately prevail, they can recover any wrongfully withheld funds through suit in an appropriate forum,\" the court said. \"And if respondents instead decline to keep the programs operating, then any ensuing irreparable harm would be of their own making.\"",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts joined with the three liberal justices in dissent.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan called the court's move a \"mistake,\" and said the Trump administration did not defend the legality of canceling the education grants at issue in the case. In a dissent joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said it is \"beyond puzzling\" that a majority of the court viewed the Justice Department's request for intervention as an emergency.",
      "\"The harms that will result from permitting the department to reinstate these terminations are directly contrary to Congress's goals in enacting the TQP and SEED programs and in entrusting the department with their implementation,\" Jackson wrote. \"It boggles the mind to equate the devastation wrought from such abrupt funding withdrawals with the mere risk that some grantees might seek to draw down previously promised funds that the department wants to yank away from them.\"",
      "Jackson called the court's decision to grant the Trump administration relief \"unprincipled and unfortunate,\" as well as \"entirely unwarranted.\"",
      "In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi called the ruling \"a significant victory for President Trump and the rule of law.\"",
      "Bondi said the ruling \"vindicates what the Department of Justice has been arguing for months: local district judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of taxpayer dollars, force the government to pay out billions, or unilaterally halt President Trump's policy agenda.\"",
      "The legal battle over the administration's decision to cut off the grants is the latest challenging President Trump's second-term policies to reach the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority. The Trump administration has sought to cut off federal assistance funding and foreign aid, but has so far been rebuffed by the courts.",
      "There are three other requests for relief from the Justice Department that are still awaiting action from the Supreme Court, though more emergency appeals are expected to reach the justices as the president faces a slew of lawsuits targeting his second-term agenda.",
      "At issue in this dispute over Education Department funds is up to $65 million in grants awarded through the Teacher Quality Partnership program and the Supporting Effective Educator Development program, which support teacher recruitment and training.",
      "In early February, the acting secretary of education directed an internal review of the department's grant awards to ensure they did not fund programs with DEI practices, which the Trump administration has claimed are discriminatory.",
      "The Education Department ultimately decided 104 grants should be terminated because they did not align with its policy objectives, according to the Justice Department. Five grants were left in place, the department said.",
      "Following the grant cancellations, a group of eight states sued the Trump administration and asked a federal district court to issue temporary relief while the case moved forward. The states \u2014 California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Wisconsin \u2014 said organizations within their states received the grants and argued the terminations violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "U.S. District Judge Myong Joun agreed to grant a temporary restraining order, in place until April 7, that required the government to reinstate the grants to recipients in the eight states. The court also temporarily blocked the government from reinstating the terminations, or cancelling any other awards for organizations in the states.",
      "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to pause that order while proceedings continue, which it declined to do. The Justice Department then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "In filings with the justices, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the district court's order is one of several that raise the question of whether a district court judge can force the government to pay out millions in taxpayer dollars.",
      "\"Unless and until this court addresses that question, federal district courts will continue exceeding their jurisdiction by ordering the executive branch to restore lawfully terminated grants across the government, keep paying for programs that the executive branch views as inconsistent with the interests of the United States, and send out the door taxpayer money that may never be clawed back,\" she wrote.",
      "Harris urged the Supreme Court to \"put a swift end to federal district courts' unconstitutional reign as self-appointed managers of executive branch funding and grant-disbursement decisions.\"",
      "In a separate case, the high court rejected an earlier bid from the Trump administration to pause an order that required it to pay out an estimated $2 billion in foreign-aid funding to groups that received money from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, lawyers for the states argued that the issue for the Justice Department is with other cases elsewhere, where courts are dealing with a slew of legal disputes arising out of Mr. Trump's executive actions.",
      "\"Those concerns are properly litigated in the context of those other cases,\" the states said in a filing. \"They provide no basis for this court to grant emergency relief here, where the district court appropriately granted a narrow and time-limited restraining order to preserve the status quo while it adjudicates the preliminary-injunction motion that was argued earlier today.\"",
      "Lawyers for the states said that the grant recipients are providing a pipeline of qualified teachers for local schools within their states, and warned that if the awards could be cancelled, programs that they fund will have to be scaled back or shut down entirely.",
      "\"Any harm that defendants might face from the temporary restraining order in the few days remaining before that order expires is far outweighed by the immediate harm the states will suffer if the order were stayed or vacated,\" they said.",

      "\"We're definitely back to low price eggs again \u2014 there's lot of relief and plenty of supply,\" Hollis told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our demand will go up 40% for Easter, so we're not worried at all and feel like we'll have plenty of eggs on the shelf.\"",
      "Demand for eggs also fell due to the high retail prices at the end of 2024, which caused some households to cut back on buying them, Hollis added. That's allowed farmers to rebuild their supply, he said.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's expansive new tariffs will likely lead to higher inflation and slower growth, and the Federal Reserve will focus on keeping price increases temporary, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday.",
      "The Fed chair's remarks come two days after Trump unveiled\u00a0sweeping tariffs that have upended the global economy and sent stock prices in the U.S. and overseas plunging, with investors nervously watching as key trading partners retaliate. China on Friday said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, the day after Mr. Trump's new tariffs go into effect.",
      "In written remarks delivered in Arlington, Virginia, Powell said that the tariffs and their impacts on the economy and inflation are \"significantly larger than expected.\" He also said that the import taxes are \"highly likely\" to lead to \"at least a temporary rise in inflation,\" but added that \"it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent.\"",
      "\"Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters,\" Powell said. \"Our obligation is to ... make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,\" he added.",
      "Powell's focus on inflation suggests that the Fed will likely keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at about 4.3% in the coming months. That is likely to disappoint Wall Street investors, who now expect five interest rate cuts this year, a number that has increased since President Donald Trump announced the tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Trump on Friday, in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, urged Powell to cut rates, writing that now would be the \"PERFECT time\" to do it. The president went on to criticize the Fed chair as \"always 'late,'\" adding that \"he could now change his image, and quickly.\"",
      "Economists forecast that the tariffs will weaken the economy, possibly threaten hiring, and push up prices. In that scenario, the Fed could cut rates to bolster the economy, or it could keep rates unchanged \u2014 or even hike them \u2014 to combat inflation. Powell's comments suggest the Fed will mostly focus on inflation.",
      "\"At the Fed, we are squarely focused on achieving the dual-mandate goals Congress has given us of maximum employment and stable prices,\" said Powell. \"While uncertainty is high and downside risks have risen, the economy is still in a good place. The incoming data show solid growth, a labor market in balance, and inflation running much closer to, but still above, our 2% objective.\"",
      "Tricky combination",
      "Weaker growth and higher prices are a tricky combination for the Fed. Typically the central bank would reduce its key interest rate to lower borrowing costs and spur the economy in the event of slower growth, while it would raise rates \u2014 or keep them elevated \u2014 to slow spending and combat inflation.",
      "\"We are closely watching this tension between the hard and soft data,\" said Powell. \"As the new policies and their likely economic effects become clearer, we will have a better sense of their implications for the economy and for monetary policy.\"",
      "Some positive news arrived Friday when the government reported that hiring accelerated in March, with\u00a0228,000 jobs added, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, from 4.1%.",
      "Yet those figures measure hiring in mid-March, before the scope of the duties became clear. The tariffs have also raised uncertainty about how the economy will fare in the coming months, which could limit businesses' willingess to invest and hire.",

    "story": [
      "A wealthy bitcoin entrepreneur and three fellow adventurers plunged back to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Friday, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California to close out the first crewed flight around Earth's poles.",
      "Three-and-a-half days after launch Monday from the Kennedy Space Center \u2014 and after 55 passes above the North and South Poles \u2014 the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\" fired its braking rockets at 11:26 a.m. EDT and slammed back into the discernible atmosphere about 25 minutes later.",
      "Enduring heat shield temperatures up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit, the spacecraft rapidly slowed down, deployed four big red-and-white parachutes and settled to an on-target 16-mph splashdown at 12:19 p.m.",
      "SpaceX crews deployed nearby rushed to the gently bobbing capsule and rigged it for a lift onto the company's recovery ship Shannon.",
      "In the first test of its kind, the crew exited the craft on their own, demonstrating the ability to get out of a Crew Dragon without help from recovery crews.",
      "Unlike crews returning from long-duration flights to the International Space Station who are carried out of their capsules, mission commander Chun Wang and his three companions were able to lift emergency gear up and out of the hatch before climbing out themselves.",
      "While they moved a bit gingerly after three-and-a-half days in weightlessness, Chun, Norwegian cinematographer Jannicke Mikkelsen, Rabea Rogge, a German robotics specialist, and Australian polar guide Eric Philips were all smiles as they greeted support personnel and were escorted into the recovery ship for initial medical checks.",
      "Chun is a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, most recently in Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean where he first met his crewmates, all veterans of polar expeditions.",
      "\"We ... all met on Svalbard, and we love the ice,\" Chun posted on X during the flight. \"The mission was planned when I lived there, and we fly polar because, in an ISS-like orbit, we are unable to see where we live. From this perspective, the mission has perfectly achieved its goal.\"",
      "Chun said before launch he planned to be on the lookout for Antarctic research stations, but Mikkelsen said during the flight that \"unlike previously anticipated, from 460 km above, it is only pure white, no human activity is visible.\"",
      "Neither Chun nor his crewmates are licensed pilots. While Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "But the Crew Dragon is highly automated and can be controlled from the ground when necessary. SpaceX viewed the Fram2 flight as a stepping stone toward opening the door for more non-professionals to fly to orbit.",
      "Chun, an avid world traveler and polar visitor, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter Resilience for the trip to polar orbit, SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",
      "The mission was named Fram2 in honor of a 19th century sailing ship \u2014 Fram, or \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic explorers to the poles. A small piece of the original ship's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"My own journey has been shaped by lifelong curiosity and a fascination with pushing boundaries,\" Chun said before launch. \"As a kid, I used to stare at a blank white space at the bottom of a world map and wonder what's out there.",
      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023. ... Fram2 isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "The crew planned to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew was equipped  with multiple laptops and tablets, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray  generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the  human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration  missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Throughout the flight, the crew posted spectacular videos, including a timelapse view of Earth below as the Crew Dragon sailed over Antarctica all the way to the North Pole, making the trip from one pole to the other every 46 minutes.",
      "\"Proud to be able to bring to space some incredible cameras and lenses capturing the first images of the Arctic and Antarctic shot by humans from space,\" Mikkelsen posted on X. \"These videos are BIG in file size and we look forwards to sharing them with you post-mission splashdown.\"",

    "story": [
      "Just over three months into 2025, the United States has recorded the most measles cases in a single year since a 2019 wave, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. The majority of the infections have been reported in an outbreak in West Texas that has led to\u00a0the death of a child. The number of cases in Texas alone has grown to\u00a0more than 480 and continues to rise. Nationwide, cases have surpassed 600, with infections confirmed in 21 states.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in a number of other states around the country as well.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Fridays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)",
      "The Texas outbreak is primarily affecting\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or have an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019 when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "The highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",
      "\"When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity),\" the CDC states.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a\u00a0noted vaccine skeptic, voiced support for the measles vaccine in early March amid the\u00a0deadly outbreak\u00a0in the Southwest, after previously downplaying the growing cases and making numerous false and misleading claims about the safety of the MMR vaccine.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-economists-forecast-stagflation-recession-risk/",
    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 12:41:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists say that President Trump's wide-ranging new tariffs raise the risk of a recession or stagflation.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is promising that his April 2 \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0volley of tariffs will \"make America wealthy again\" by repatriating manufacturing jobs and reviving demand for American-made products. But many economists are taking a different view, warning that the tariffs could lead to more dire economic scenarios, including a recession or stagflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has said the two new tariffs he unveiled Wednesday \u2014 a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and so-called\u00a0reciprocal tariffs\u00a0applied to imports from about 90 nations \u2014 will revitalize American manufacturing, create jobs and generate federal revenue.",
      "But economists are ringing alarm bells as they digest the impact of the wide-ranging tariffs, which they forecast will accelerate inflation and dampen U.S. economic growth. That's because Mr. Trump's tariffs will be paid by U.S. businesses that import goods and materials from other countries, and they are likely to pass on some or all of those costs to consumers through higher prices.",
      "As a result, experts say, inflation is likely to reignite, which could cause some U.S. households to back on spending. Because consumer spending accounts for about 70 cents of every $1 in GDP, economic growth could slow.",
      "Together, those outcomes could create \"stagflation,\" a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that describes periods when economic growth falters even as prices remain painfully high.",
      "The risks of recession\u00a0\u2014 a downturn that includes at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the nation's gross domestic product \u2014 are also rising due to Mr. Trump's latest tariffs, according to new estimates from several Wall Street economists.",
      "If the fresh U.S. tariffs spur retaliatory measures from other nations, \"serious recessions\" could emerge both in the U.S. and globally, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. A U.S. recession would likely reduce GDP by 2% and boost unemployment next year to 7.5%, up from its current rate of 4.1%, he estimated.",
      "On Friday, China announced it would implement a 34% retaliatory tariff on U.S. imports beginning April 10, a day after Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs are slated to go into effect.",
      "Still, for now that scenario remains unlikely, with Zandi assigning it a 15% probability. If the Trump administration drops some tariffs and offers exemptions for some products or nations, a recession would be more mild, with unemployment topping out at 5.5%, he added. Zandi said he is giving a 35% probability to this outcome.",
      "To be sure, while many economists are raising the likelihood of a recession, they also say the economy remains relatively strong, with low unemployment and steady growth. Much depends on whether the Trump administration sticks with its tariffs or eases up on some policies.",
      "Brace for higher inflation",
      "More certain is that Mr. Trump's tariffs will boost inflation, noted Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. Consumer prices could accelerate by 1 percentage point by year-end, he added, which would boost the inflation rate close to 4% from its current level.",
      "That could prove painful for many Americans, including for supporters of Mr. Trump who backed his candidacy because of his promises to \"end the inflation nightmare\" of the post-pandemic years. According to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll,\u00a0 most Americans said the president has focused too much on\u00a0tariffs, which they fear could end up raising prices, and not enough on lowering consumer costs.",
      "A hike in inflation from Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs could add $1,000 in annual costs for low-income households, Daco estimated. Products ranging from Apple's iPhones, which are largely manufactured in China, to clothing made in Vietnam could spike in price due to the reciprocal tariffs, with those nations facing rates of 34% and 46%, respectively.",
      "However, other estimates predict a bigger hit to Americans' budgets, with the Yale Budget Lab forecasting that the April 2 tariffs will cost a typical household about $2,148.",
      "\"With the most significant tariff increases targeting countries central to the U.S. supply chain for consumer goods \u2014 China, Vietnam, Taiwan and Cambodia \u2014 households should expect higher prices across a wide range of everyday items,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.",
      "Here's what other top economists are predicting",
      "Oxford Economics: \"[T]he announced tariffs will significantly raise the effective U.S. tariff rate to slightly less than 30%, matching levels not seen since the 1930s ....

      "Capital Economics: \"[W]e see U.S. GDP growth slowing to around 1.5% annualized, but the risks are to the downside and we would put the odds of a recession at about 30%. U.S. CPI inflation now looks set to jump to around 4.5% later this year.\" \u2014Its global economics team",
      "Deutsche Bank: \"[T]hese actions could potentially shave 1 - 1.5 [percentage points] from growth this year and add a broadly similar amount to core PCE inflation .... Recession risks will likely rise materially if these tariffs are sustained.\" \u2014Economics team",
      "Morningstar: \"The tariff hikes announced April 2, if maintained, represent a self-inflicted economic catastrophe for the U.S. .... We haven't yet published a full update, but we'll likely be reducing our U.S. real GDP growth forecast for 2025 and 2026.

      "The new portable console features a 7.9 inch LCD screen that displays in 1080p. Nintendo also revealed in the live stream that, when docked, the system will be able to support 4K resolution for compatible games.",
      "Wednesday's presentation started off with an extended look at \"Mario Kart World\" \u2014 the console's launch bundle game \u2014 which adds a bit of flair to the series with in-game characters doing tailwhips, flips, rail grinds and other tricks.",
      "The developer also unveiled a new James Bond game, dubbed \"Project 007,\" revisiting a classic Nintendo 64 console hit revered by many first-person shooter fans.",
      "Nintendo also announced two more Switch 2 exclusives featuring its marquee characters. \"Donkey Kong Bananza,\" a 3D adventure with the big ape punching his way through a huge underground world, arrives July 17. \"Kirby Air Riders,\" a racing game from the director of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, is due later in the year.",
      "Third-party exclusives likely to create some buzz include Koei-Tecmo's \"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,\" a hack-and-slash prequel to \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,\" coming this winter. From Software's \"The Duskbloods,\" a baroque multiplayer title from the creators of Elden Ring, is scheduled for 2026.",
      "Miss the GameCube? Nintendo said Switch Online subscribers will be able to access a limited selection of GameCube titles such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\" and \"F-Zero GX.\"",
      "The new console will be backwards compatible \u2014 able to play physical and digital Switch games \u2014 but users will need to purchase a microSD express memory card for the Switch 2. The presentation revealed that normal SD cards will not be compatible with the system. However, data from the original Switch can be transferred to the new console using a transfer feature.",
      "The original Switch, released in 2017, is \"one of the most popular game consoles of all time,\" Scott Stein, editor-at-large at CNET,\u00a0told CBS News Boston in January.",
      "It became popular in part because of its unique design. Resembling a tablet, the device has detachable pieces on each side that can be used to control game play. It also allows users to continuing playing a game on a television screen when docked on a charging station, a first-of-its-kind feature at the time.",
      "But the original has aged, leading to some of the excitement for the new version, Stein said.",
      "\"There's a lot of stuff it does well but there's a lot of stuff that people I think want it to do better for playing games they can play elsewhere,\" he said, noting the ability to take it on the go differentiates it from other gaming consoles.",
      "How much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?",
      "Nintendo will retail the Switch 2 for $449.99 at launch, which is significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. A separate bundle that includes the new \"Mario Kart World\" game will also be available for $499.99.",
      "Gene Park, a Washington Post reporter covering video games and gaming culture, told CBS News the console is \"a little pricey, but it is a more powerful system.\"",
      "He noted that the \"Mario Kart World\" game itself is priced at $80.",
      "\"It's a little eyebrow-raising. It's really the first Nintendo game to broach $80, and there's a lot of talk about video games becoming $100 right now,\" Park said.",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have hit the video game console industry at a fragile moment, said Joost van Dreunen, author of \"One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.",
      "\"At the beginning of a new hardware cycle, all of a sudden we're looking at this price hike,\" said van Dreunen, a games industry researcher. \"I had originally predicted that the Switch 2 would be $400. Now it's announced that it's $450. That $50 difference is a Trump tax.\"",
      "The tariffs, he said, impact games hardware because console devices are manufactured and shipped from China and that region at large.",
      "The early stages of a hardware life cycle are already very low margin, or usually a loss for hardware manufacturers, van Dreunen said. Those manufacturers typically eat the margin in order to get the devices out to stores.",
      "\"But with an increased tariff, that means that margin is probably even worse than it historically is. But their hands are kind of tied. They can't not progress. They can't not launch a new hardware generation. So for the consumer base, people are just going to pay more.\"",
      "The Consumer Technology Association also predicted President Trump's tariffs would drive up prices of video game consoles, and retailers like Best Buy have warned they may have to raise prices due to the tariffs.",
      "Nintendo plans to host \"Switch 2 Experience\" events in several countries, where gamers can get a hands-on experience with the new system. Those events are planned for cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris beginning this month.",

    "summary": "President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on about 90 countries, including China and the European Union. Here's the list.",
    "story": [
      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations will face only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries will be charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports will face the baseline rate of 10%, while China will face a 34% tariff.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his\u00a0Wednesday remarks.",
      "Asian nations will face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic. On top of China's 34% reciprocal tariff, imports from that nation will also face previously announced 20% tariffs, bringing that nation's total rate to more than 60%, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Full list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country",
      "When will these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries likely to retaliate against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "For now, other countries are taking a more measured approach in their response. European Union trade chief Maros Sefcovic is scheduled to meet with U.S. officials on Friday after Mr. Trump hit the 27-nation bloc with a 20% tariff.",
      "Sefcovic told AFP Thursday the EU would act in \"a calm, carefully phased, unified way\" and allow time for talks, but he also warned the bloc \"won't stand idly by, should we be unable to reach a fair deal\".",

      "What it means",

      "\"Today's better-than-expected jobs report will help ease fears of an immediate softening in the U.S. labor market. However, this number has become a side dish with the market just focusing on the entr\u00e9e: tariffs,\" said Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email.",

      "Asian stocks fell further Friday, though markets in Shanghai, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia were closed for holidays, limiting the extent of the day's declines, The Associated Press reported. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 2.8% while South Korea's Kospi sank 0.9%.",

Kennedy Jr.'s cuts to the nation's federal health agencies.",
      "In one example, a planned FDA exercise with a network of veterinary testing labs around the country to ensure they are able to detect the virus in milk has been suspended, due to the elimination of the agency's food safety lab in Illinois, two federal health officials said.",

The FDA lost around 3,500 full-time employees due to the layoffs, including staff supporting the agency's food and drug safety inspectors.",
      "\"This overhaul is about realigning HHS with its core mission: to stop the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again. Despite spending $1.9 trillion in annual costs, Americans are getting sicker every year, and we must shift course,\" an HHS official said in a statement.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2025-atlantic-hurricane-season-forecast/",
    "published": "Thu, 03 Apr 2025 21:04:25 -0400",
    "summary": "A new forecast from researchers at Colorado State University predicts the 2025 hurricane season will be busier than an average year.",
    "story": [
      "Researchers are predicting an above-average Atlantic hurricane season in 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but at the same time with\u00a0less intensity expected than last season. The annual prediction is closely watched in Florida and other coastal states at risk when hurricane season officially starts June 1.",
      "Experts at Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team estimate that nine hurricanes will occur over the course of the upcoming season, with 17 named storms overall.",
      "Four of the hurricanes are predicted to be major \u2014 meaning a\u00a0Category 3, 4 or 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Category 3 hurricanes are those with sustained winds that reach 111 to 129 miles per hour, enough to cause devastating damage. Category 4 hurricanes have sustained winds of 130 to 156 mph, and the most catastrophic Category 5 storms reach 157 mph or higher.",
      "Hurricane activity this year is expected to be roughly 125% higher than the 1991-2020 season average, according to the report. One of its authors, Levi Silvers, told CBS News that jump is significant, albeit slightly lower than the 2024 activity prediction, which was 130% higher than the 19-year average.",
      "\"It's a noticeable and important difference, because it matters for people along the coastlines whenever we have an above average season,\" Silvers said. \"But I think what's really important to understand here is that the amount of hurricanes that are occurring in the Atlantic and in the Gulf fluctuates a lot from decade to decade. As long as we've been paying attention to hurricanes, we've noticed that they fluctuate a lot from year to year.\"",
      "Warm sea surface temperatures were the primary driver for this year's above-average hurricane forecast. That was also the case in 2024, when Silvers said the measurement was \"off the charts.\"",
      "\"It was super warm, warmer than we've really seen before,\" he told CBS News, adding that, this year, \"they're still warmer than normal, but the temperatures have come down since last time. So that's one of the main factors, why we're forecasting less [activity] than last year, but it's still above average.\"",
      "The researchers' prediction recognizes that \"considerable uncertainty\" still exists as to the phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle. El Ni\u00f1o is the warmer half of the cycle, an alternating pattern of contrasting climate shifts defined by sea surface temperatures and precipitation in a block of the equatorial Pacific that depart from the neutral norm. La Ni\u00f1a, the inverse of El Ni\u00f1o, is the colder phase of ENSO.",
      "Weak La Ni\u00f1a conditions are currently present in that part of the tropical Pacific, but the CSU researchers said they anticipate those will transition to neutral conditions over the next couple of months. The likely absence of El Ni\u00f1o, which often is associated with conditions that disfavor hurricane activity, could mean the coming season is more conducive to hurricanes.",
      "\"We usually flip between El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, and we think that later in the season, it's going to be kind of neutral between the two of those,\" said Silvers. \"But we don't know for sure. That's actually one of the sources of uncertainty in our forecast. Trying to figure out if it's going to be a neutral state, or El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a is part of the challenge.\"",
      "Atlantic hurricane season happens annually in North America, beginning June 1 and ending November 30. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, scientists have pinpointed that timeframe as the window where hurricane activity peaks in the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Both Colorado State University and NOAA, the federal agency responsible for weather forecasts, release predictions each year before the season gets going. Usually their estimates\u00a0more or less align.",
      "Referencing recent\u00a0budget and staff cuts\u00a0at the federal agency, Silvers told CBS News that NOAA's data is integral to the university's research.",
      "\"A lot of what we do with this forecast is really fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe, but especially in the oceans,\" he said. \"And so it really would be pretty much impossible to get a good forecast for future hurricane seasons without NOAA's observational network.\"",
      "List of names for 2025 tropical storms and hurricanes",
      "Under a system maintained by the World Meteorological Organization, storms receive a name when they reach tropical storm strength, with sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Once winds reach 74 mph, the storm becomes a hurricane.",
      "The list of names for each season is determined in advance. For 2025, the first named storm of the year will be called Andrea, followed by Barry, Chantal, Dexter, Erin, Ferdinand, Gabrielle and on through the alphabet, ending with Wendy. (Q, U, X, Y and Z are excluded because there aren't enough names beginning with those letters.)",
      "If there continue to be more tropical storms after all 21 names on the list have been used, there is a supplemental list with another 21 names that would be assigned next.",

      "He added that it's \"my firm conviction\" that a potential trade war will not affect Europe's defense spending or commitment to NATO.",
      "Mr. Trump has frequently criticized NATO countries for spending less than 2% of their gross domestic product on defense and in his second administration pushed for members to more than double their defense spending to 5%.",
      "Rutte argued Friday that European countries have already ramped up their spending.",
      "\"It is staggering the amount of billions coming in. It \u2014you have to compare this to the days of the Cold War, when you look at the overall defense spending now being ramped up in Europe,\" Rutte said.",

      "Pressed by Brennan over statements made by the leaders of Germany, Poland and France about expanding a western European nuclear umbrella \u2014 beyond the assurances of protection provided by the U.S. and United Kingdom \u2014 Rutte said he's confident in the U.S.' nuclear security guarantee.",
      "\"Marco Rubio this week basically repeated what President Trump has said three times now on television: that the U.S. is completely committed to NATO, is completely committed to Article 5,\" Rutte said. \"That includes the U.S. being the ultimate guarantor, through the nuclear deterrent, for NATO territory, including, and particularly of course, the European part of NATO.\" Article 5 says that an attack on any NATO member country is an attack on all members.",
      "Rutte said the Trump administration has \"consistently\" said it is committed to the alliance.",

The answer is yes, it has been consistently coming out of the American system over the last three months.\"",

    "story": [
      "An African giant pouched rat is being honored in the record books after detecting more than 100 landmines and other undetonated explosives in Cambodia, Belgian non-profit APOPO announced Friday.",
      "The rat, named Ronin, was named APOPO's most successful Mine Detection Rat. He also was acknowledged by the Guinness World Records.",
      "Since August 2021, Ronin has detected 109 landmines and 15 items of unexploded ordnance, APOPO said. The record-smashing rodent is expected to do another two years or more of detection work, the non-profit said.",
      "\"Ronin's achievements are a testament to the incredible potential of positive reinforcement training. He's not just an asset; he's a valued partner and colleague,\" said Phanny, Ronin's handler, in a news release from APOPO.",
      "The previous record was held by the African giant pouched rat Magawa, who detected 71 landmines and 38 pieces of unexploded ordnance over the course of five years.",
      "APOPO has been training mine-detecting rats for over 25 years. Ronin underwent clicker training, where the rat learns to associate the sound of a click with a treat, to motivate him to learn how to smell explosives. He was also trained to work systemically within a grid pattern and to indicate landmines by scratching at the ground. Ronin and rats like him work for about 30 minutes a day, APOPO said. When they reach a certain age, they are moved to a retirement community and remain under APOPO's care. Magawa, the previous record-holder, was retired in 2021 and died in 2022.",
      "Undetonated landmines and ordnance are a huge problem in Cambodia. Decades of conflict have left up to six million unexploded munitions in the country's soil, according to the Landmine Monitor's 2024 report. Since 1979, those buried bombs have caused about 20,000 deaths and 45,000 injuries, the Landmine Monitor reported. Demining efforts have been underway for decades, including the work done by Ronin and other APOPO rats. In 2023, there were only 32 reported casualties involving landmines in Cambodia, according to the Landmine Monitor. The site does not distinguish between injuries and deaths when referring to casualties.",
      "The APOPO's efforts are not limited to Cambodia. The non-profit estimates that about 110 million landmines are buried across 60 countries. In 2023, 1,431 deaths were connected to these landmines. The agency said it continues to work to remove landmines and unexploded ordnance from the world.",
      "\"When we launched APOPO, the common view was that it would take around 500 years to clear all landmines from the Earth's surface,\" said Christine Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \"25 years later, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and if the international community fully supports the collaboration of all demining operators, we could clear the remaining minefields in our lifetime.\"",

      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

The new tariff matches the rate of the U.S. tariff announced by President Trump this week, which he called a \"reciprocal\" measure, claiming China had tariffs and other measures in place on U.S. goods already that amounted to a 67% trade barrier.",
      "For Mr. Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, the White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers, in reaching its decision on how heavily to tariff almost every other country in the world. Economists have questioned the methodology, and many foreign governments have complained the levies are unfair and misrepresent their trade imbalances with the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 South Korea's Constitutional Court removed impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol from office Friday, ending his tumultuous presidency and setting up an election to find a new leader, four months after he threw South Korean politics into turmoil with an ill-fated declaration of martial law.",
      "The unanimous verdict capped a dramatic fall for Yoon, a former star prosecutor who went from political novice to president in 2022, just a year after he entered politics.",
      "In a nationally televised verdict, the court's acting chief Moon Hyung-bae said the eight-member bench upheld Yoon's impeachment because his martial law decree seriously violated the constitution and other laws.",
      "\"The defendant not only declared martial law, but also violated the constitution and laws by mobilizing military and police forces to obstruct the exercise of legislative authority,\" Moon said. \"Ultimately, the declaration of martial law in this case violated the substantive requirements for emergency martial law.\"",
      "\"Given the grave negative impact on constitutional order and the significant ripple effects of the defendant's violations, we find that the benefits of upholding the constitution by removing the defendant from office far outweigh the national losses from the removal of a president,\" the justice concluded.",

      "No major violence was immediately reported.",

      "An election will be held within two months to replace Yoon, but a festering national divide over Yoon's impeachment will likely continue and could complicate South Korea's efforts to deal with President Trump's \"America First\" policies and North Korea's expanding ties with Russia, observers say.",
      "Yoon said in a statement issued via his defense team that he deeply regrets failing to live up to the public's expectations, but stopped short of explicitly accepting the verdict. There have been fears he would incite efforts to resist his removal, since he earlier vowed to fight to the end.",
      "He added that he will pray for the country and its people. \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve our nation,\" Yoon said.",

      "Nation still reeling from brief imposition of martial law",
      "Martial law lasted only six hours, but left behind a political crisis, rattling financial markets and unsettling the country's diplomatic partners. In January, Yoon was separately arrested and indicted by prosecutors on alleged rebellion in connection with his decree, a charge that carries the death penalty or a life sentence if convicted.",
      "Under Yoon's decree, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, hundreds of soldiers were dispatched to the assembly, election offices and other sites. Special operations soldiers smashed windows at the National Assembly and scuffled with citizens gathered to protest, shocking South Koreans and evoking traumatic memories of military rule.",
      "Enough lawmakers, including some from the ruling party, managed to enter the assembly to vote down his decree unanimously.",
      "No major violence occurred during the brief period of martial law, but some senior military and police officers sent to the assembly have testified that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to block a vote on his decree or to detain his political rivals. Yoon says the troops were deployed to the assembly simply to maintain order.",
      "Yoon, 64, a conservative, was impeached by the liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly on Dec. 14. The assembly accused him of violating the constitution and other laws by suppressing assembly activities, attempting to detain politicians, and undermining peace across the country.",
      "In his final testimony at the Constitutional Court hearing, Yoon said his decree was a desperate attempt to draw public support of his fight against the \"wickedness\" of the Democratic Party, which had obstructed his agenda, impeached top officials and slashed the government's budget bill.

A public image as strong-minded and uncompromising helped him defeat Lee in the close-fought 2022 presidential election.

The bodies of 14 children and five women were recovered from the school in the Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City, and the death toll could rise because some of the 70 wounded sustained critical injuries, said Health Ministry spokesman Zaher al-Wahidi.",
      "The Civil Defense rescue agency in Gaza said Friday that at least 31 people were killed in the strike on the school, with around 100 others injured.  More than 30 other Gaza residents were killed in strikes on homes in the nearby neighborhood of Shijaiyah, al-Wahidi said, citing records at Ahli Hospital.",
      "The Israeli military said it struck a \"Hamas command and control center\" in the Gaza City area, and that it took steps to lessen harm to civilians. Israel gave the same reason \u2014 striking Hamas militants in a \"command and control center\" \u2014 for attacking a United Nations building used as a shelter a day earlier, killing at least 17 people.",
      "Hamas, which had long been designated a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S. even before it carried out the brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, called the strike on the school a \"heinous massacre\" of innocent civilians.",
      "Israel has long accused Hamas of hiding weapons and fighters in and around civilian infrastructure, but the Israel Defense Forces provided no immediate evidence to back up its claim that Hamas commanders were present in the Gaza school or the U.N. building it bombed this week.",
      "The strikes came as Israel's military ordered more residents in parts of northern Gaza to evacuate west and south to shelters, warning that it planned to \"work with extreme force in your area.\" A number of the Palestinians fleeing the targeted areas did so on foot, with some carrying their belongings on their backs and others using donkey carts.",
      "\"My wife and I have been walking for three hours covering only one kilometer,\" said Mohammad Ermana, 72. The couple, clasping hands, each walked with a cane. \"I'm searching for shelters every hour now, not every day,\" he said.",
      "Israel has issued sweeping evacuation orders for parts of northern Gaza ahead of expected expansions in its ground operations. The U.N. humanitarian office said around 280,000 Palestinians have been displaced since Israel abruptly ended a ceasefire with Hamas last month that had been brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.",
      "The fresh evacuation orders came a day after senior government officials said Israel would seize large parts of the Palestinian territory and establish a new security corridor across it. Israel has imposed a monthlong blockade on food, fuel and humanitarian aid on Gaza that has left civilians facing acute shortages as supplies dwindle \u2014 a tactic that rights groups say is a war crime. Israel says it is intended to pressure Hamas to release hostages and disarm.",
      "Hamas has said it will only release the remaining 59 hostages \u2014 24 of whom are believed to be alive \u2014 in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The group has rejected demands that it lay down its arms or leave the territory.",
      "Overnight strikes by Israel killed at least 55 people in the Gaza Strip, hospital officials said Thursday.",
      "In the southern city of Khan Younis, officials said the bodies of 14 people had been taken to Nasser Hospital \u2013 nine of them from the same family. The dead included five children and four women. The bodies of another 19 people, including five children aged between 1 and 7 years and a pregnant woman, were taken to the European hospital near Khan Younis, hospital officials said. In Gaza City, 21 bodies were taken to Ahli hospital, including those of seven children.",
      "Later in the day, strikes killed four more people in Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital, and another two people were killed in central Gaza and taken to Al Aqsa Hospital.",
      "The attacks came as the Israeli military promised an independent investigation of a March 23 operation in which its forces opened fire on ambulances in southern Gaza. U.N. officials say 15 Palestinian medics and emergency responders were killed, and their bodies and ambulances were buried by Israeli soldiers in a mass grave.",
      "The military initially said the ambulances were operating suspiciously and that nine militants were killed. The military said the probe would be led by an expert fact-finding body \"responsible for examining exceptional incidents\" during the war. Rights groups say such Israeli investigations are often lacking and that soldiers are rarely punished.",
      "The head of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, Younes Al-Khatib, said Thursday he believed some of the medics were still alive when they were overtaken by Israeli forces. The organization's radio dispatchers heard a conversation in Hebrew between medics and Israeli soldiers after the ambulances had come under fire, Al-Khatib told members of the U.N. Security Council.",
      "Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, told the U.N. Security Council he was turning over a video he obtained, allegedly showing the moments leading up to the Israeli killing of 15 humanitarian workers in Gaza.",
      "Mansour said the video shows that the aid workers, including eight members of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, were traveling in emergency vehicles with the lights on at night to deconflict with Israeli Defense Forces. But, Mansour said, the video \"found on the body of one of the martyrs,\" shows that the Israeli army ambushed the vehicle despite the emergency lights.",

In an update on Friday, the ministry said 1,249 people had been killed in Gaza since March 18, when Israel resumed strikes, ending a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory.",

    "story": [
      "The stock market is poised for a second straight day of sharp declines amid mounting investor concerns about U.S. economic growth and the prospect of a global trade war.",
      "Ninety minutes before the start of trade in New York, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down nearly 1,500 points, or 3.6%. Futures on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slid 3.7% and 3.9%, respectively.",
      "Those numbers set up financial markets for another precipitous fall after stocks on Thursday suffered their biggest one-day drops since 2020, vaporizing roughly $2 trillion in investor wealth, according to FactSet.",
      "Investors are moving to reduce their exposure to risky assets after President Trump on Wednesday announced a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. trading partners and upped levies on dozens of countries that charge higher taxes on American exports.",
      "Economists and Wall Street analysts expect the fresh round of tariffs, which the Trump administration has dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" to reduce economic growth and lift inflation. Most market analysts still put the odds of a recession at less than 50%, although they warn that conditions look increasingly fragile.",
      "\"The opening salvo Wednesday afternoon was too devastating, puerile and economically illiterate to move past, and the economic downturn that was already underway will now evolve into something worse,\" equities analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a note to investors.",
      "Overseas markets also slid Friday. In overnight trading in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 2.8%, while South Korea's Kospi sank 0.9%. Markets in Shanghai, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia were closed for holidays, limiting the scope of Friday's sell-offs in Asia.",
      "In European trading, Germany's DAX lost 2%, France's CAC 40 in Paris dipped 1.6% and Britain's FTSE 100 shed 1.7%.",
      "Mr. Trump has warned other countries not to retaliate to the barrage of levies on U.S. imports. Ignoring that advice, China on Friday said it will impose a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products starting April 10.",
      "The new tariff matches the rate of the U.S. tariff announced by Mr. Trump this week, which he called a \"reciprocal\" measure, claiming China had tariffs and other measures in place on U.S. goods already that amounted to a 67% trade barrier.",
      "\"The tariff developments will remain the dominant driver for financial markets over the near-term,\" John Canavan, lead U.S. analyst at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"President Trump's announced tariffs weaken the outlook for economic growth and add to the risks of higher inflation.\"",

      "Indian police said on Thursday they had arrested a U.S. tourist who sneaked onto a highly restricted island carrying a coconut and a can of Diet Coke to a tribe untouched by the modern world. The incident occurred seven years after another American was killed\u00a0by the tribe on the same island.",

      "All outsiders, Indians and foreigners alike, are banned from traveling within three miles of the island to protect the Indigenous people from outside diseases and to preserve their way of life.",

      "India sees the wider Andaman and Nicobar Islands as strategically sited on key global shipping lanes. They are closer to Myanmar than mainland India.",
      "New Delhi plans to invest at least $9 billion to expand naval and air bases, troop accommodations, the port and the main city in the region.",
      "\"Reckless and idiotic\"",
      "Dhaliwal said Polyakov kept blowing a whistle off the shore of North Sentinel Island for about an hour to attract the tribe's attention before he went ashore.",
      "\"He landed briefly for about five minutes, left the offerings on the shore, collected sand samples, and recorded a video before returning to his boat,\" Dhaliwal said. \"A review of his GoPro camera footage showed his entry and landing into the restricted North Sentinel Island.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 03 Apr 2025 11:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "America's global trading partners are bristling at President Trump's tariff tactics, but many also stress a desire to strike new deals with the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "In a move that could upend American foreign relations across the globe, President Trump announced Wednesday that he is imposing what he calls \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. engages with in trade. From April 5, all imports to the U.S. will be subject to a baseline tariff of 10%. Then, beginning April 9, about 90 countries that the Trump administration says currently impose unfair barriers on imported U.S. goods will be hit by additional \"reciprocal\" taxes.",
      "Some of the Asian nations from which the U.S. has long imported vast quantities of consumer goods will be subjected to the highest tariffs, including a 34% blanket levy on imports from China, which quickly vowed to impose unspecified \"countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests.\"",
      "A number of nations, including Britain, Brazil and Egypt, were hit with the lowest, base-rate 10% tariffs.",
      "Economists have warned that across-the-board tariffs could impact lower-income Americans' finances the most and increase the likelihood of a recession.",
      "The response from other world leaders to Mr. Trump's announcement has almost universally included critique \u2014 or outright condemnation \u2014 of the American leader's overt pressure tactics, but it has also shown a recognition of the importance other countries place on trade relations with the world's largest economy.",
      "Below is a look at the criticism \u2014 and the desire to salvage economic relations with Washington \u2014 emanating from capital cities across the globe.",
      "China",
      "A White House official told CBS News that the tariffs announced Wednesday by Mr. Trump will be additive, meaning the 34% \"retaliatory tariffs\" will be on top of 20% levies imposed by Washington earlier this year.",
      "\"China firmly opposes this and will take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement. \"There are no winners in trade wars, and there is no way out for protectionism. China urges the U.S. to immediately lift unilateral tariffs and properly resolve differences with its trading partners through dialogue on an equal footing.\"",
      "\"Protectionism has no exit ramp,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Thursday, urging Washington to drop the new taxes on Chinese imports. \"What the U.S. needs to do now is correct its wrong practices and resolve economic and trade differences with other countries \u2014 including China \u2014 through fair, respectful and reciprocal consultations.\"",
      "Beijing did not indicate what countermeasures it might take but in separate remarks, Ministry of Commerce spokesman He Yadong said \"the trade and economic departments of China and the United States have been maintaining communication,\" and he added that Asia's largest economy remained \"willing to engage with the United States on important issues in bilateral trade.\"",
      "The European Union",
      "Overall, the 27-nation European Union bloc is one of the United States' biggest trade partners and, as a collective entity, has come under some of Mr. Trump's most vociferous criticism for what he considers an unfair imbalance in economic relations.",
      "The EU will be hit next week with a blanket 20% \"reciprocal tariff\" on its exports to the U.S., Mr. Trump announced Wednesday.",
      "\"I know that many of you feel let down by our oldest ally,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a video statement. While she was unequivocal in predicting that Mr. Trump's tactics would negatively impact the entire world, she signaled that the EU would at least wait to see if a new trade deal can be reached before imposing additional retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "\"President Trump's announcement of universal tariffs on the whole world, including the EU, is a major blow to the world economy,\" she said. \"Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism. The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe.\"",
      "Von der Leyen said the EU was \"already finalizing a first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel, and we are now preparing for further countermeasures, to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail.\"",
      "The reaction to Mr. Trump's announcement from individual EU member states was, in some cases, more pointed.",
      "In Germany, the bloc's biggest single largest economy and a major exporter of vehicles to the U.S., in particular, Economy Minister Robert Habeck predicted a U-turn by the American president \u2014 if the EU is able to maintain a united front and push back against the tariffs with measures of its own.",
      "\"That is what I see, that Donald Trump buckles under pressure, corrects his announcements under pressure, but the logical consequence is that he must also feel the pressure, and this pressure must now be exerted from Germany, from Europe,\" Habeck said, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Germany's leader, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, called Mr. Trump's tariffs \"fundamentally wrong\" and \"an attack on a trade system that has created prosperity all round the world \u2014 itself an American achievement.\"",
      "\"The EU has the strongest internal market in the world with 450 million consumers, which gives us the strength to hold talks with the U.S. government to avert a trade war,\" he said. \"We want cooperation, not confrontation, and will defend our interests. Europe will respond united, strong and proportionately to this decision.\"",
      "Giorgia Meloni, Italy's right-wing prime minister and a Trump ally who visited him at Mar-a-Lago in January, called the 20% tariff on EU imports \"wrong\" and a move \"that does not suit any party.\"",
      "\"We will do everything we can to work a deal with the United States, aiming to prevent a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global actors,\" Meloni said. \"In any case, as always, we will act in the interests of Italy and its economy, even by comparing ourselves with other European partners.\"",
      "Ireland's Prime Minister Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, in a post on social media, called the U.S. tariffs on the EU \"deeply regrettable,\" adding: \"I strongly believe that tariffs benefit no one. My priority, and that of the government, is to protect Irish jobs and the Irish economy.\"",
      "The United Kingdom",
      "The U.K. pulled out of the EU almost a decade ago, and while the advantages and disadvantages of that \"Brexit\" remain hotly debated, it will see the U.K. dodge the higher 20% tariffs imposed on its European neighbors. But even the baseline 10% levy announced by Mr. Trump on Wednesday was met with disappointment in London and with a clear desire to keep the storied \"special relationship\" on track.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer huddled early Thursday with the top executives from some of Britain's biggest businesses, eager to voice his support for their enterprises and also to draw on their economic acumen as he pushes for a new trade deal with the U.S., with the hope of getting all tariffs lifted.",
      "\"Clearly, there will be an economic impact from the decisions the U.S. has taken both here and globally,\" Starmer told the business leaders. \"But I want to be crystal clear: We are prepared.",
      "\"Nobody wins in a trade war. That is not in our national interest, and we have a fair and balanced trade relationship with the U.S.,\" Starmer argued, adding that \"negotiations on an economic prosperity deal \u2014 one that strengthens our existing trading relationship [with the U.S.] \u2014 they continue, and we will fight for the best deal for Britain.\"",
      "\"Today marks a new stage in our preparations,\" said Starmer. \"We have a range of levers at our disposal, and we will continue our work with businesses across the country to understand their assessment of these options. As I say, our intention remains to secure a deal. But nothing is off the table.\"",
      "Japan",
      "\"We had been requesting that the U.S. government review its unilateral tariff measures at various levels and we are extremely disappointed and regret that such measures have been implemented nonetheless,\" Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Thursday as his nation woke up to the news of a new 24% levy being imposed by the White House \u2014 which was taking a toll on the Nikkei stock market.",
      "\"We will continue to strongly urge the U.S. to review its measures,\" Ishiba said, according to Reuters.",
      "Japanese Trade Minister Yoji Muto, asked if Tokyo would retaliate with its own new trade barriers to U.S. imports, said the government would \"need to decide what is best for Japan, and most effective, in a careful but bold and speedy manner.\"",
      "Brazil",
      "\"The Brazilian government is evaluating all possible actions to ensure reciprocity in bilateral trade, including resorting to the World Trade Organization, in defense of legitimate national interests,\" the Brazilian government said in a statement Thursday, according to Reuters.",
      "The statement came just after Brazil's Congress approved a bill that would give President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva a legal framework to respond to international tariffs, including with countermeasures such as retaliatory tariffs.",
      "The government statement said Brazil remained open to negotiations with the U.S., and it rejected the White House's characterization of the 10% levy as \"reciprocal,\" saying that assessment does not \"reflect reality.\"",
      "Lula said previously that Mr. Trump's decision to impose tariffs on America's trading partners risked damaging the U.S. economy, and he said Brazil would lodge a formal complaint with the WTO over a separate levy on Brazilian steel exports.",
      "\"It will raise the prices of goods and could lead to [U.S.] inflation that he hasn't yet realized,\" Lula said, according to Reuters. \"Protectionism doesn't help any country in the world.\"",
      "Vietnam",
      "Vietnam was among the nations hardest hit by Mr. Trump's tariff salvo on Wednesday, with the U.S. leader announcing 46% tariffs on exports from the Asian manufacturing hub. Its exports to the U.S. have flourished for years under the so-called China+1 strategy, which has seen Chinese manufacturers get around existing U.S. tariffs on their country by moving some production to other, less-heavily tariffed nations in the region.",
      "Vietnamese officials did not immediately signal any plan to impose retaliatory measures.",
      "As the nation's benchmark stock index appeared on course for its biggest single-day drop in four years and its currency hit an all-time low, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh declared a new task force dedicated to addressing the rapidly changing economic situation after holding a cabinet meeting early Thursday.",
      "Cambodia",
      "The French news agency AFP spoke Thursday with Penn Sovicheat, a spokesman for Cambodia's commerce ministry, who blasted the Trump administration's imposition of a 49% levy on the country's exports as \"not reasonable.\"",
      "The White House says Cambodia is among the nations, like Vietnam and Laos, that have developed their own economies by inviting Chinese investment under the China+1 strategy, enabling Chinese manufacturers to skirt existing U.S. trade barriers. According to Sovicheat, Cambodia exported about $10 billion worth of goods to the U.S. in 2024, largely clothing.",
      "\"China has turned Cambodia into the most important transshipment hub that Communist China uses to evade our tariffs,\" a White House official told reporters this week.",
      "Sovicheat acknowledged that American imports to Cambodia, which he said amounted to around $264 million worth of goods last year, were taxed at an average of 29.4%, but the White House figures Mr. Trump unveiled Wednesday claim the Asian nation has tariffs and other trade barriers in place on U.S. goods amounting to 97%.",
      "\"The 49% tariffs is not a good image for Cambodian industry or our investment attraction,\" Sovicheat told AFP, adding that the government was hoping to negotiate a trade agreement with the Trump administration through existing entities such as the ASEAN trade bloc or the World Trade Organization.",
      "Cambodian Commerce Minister Cham Nimul said in remarks aired by state TV that U.S. consumers would feel the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs on his country before Cambodians, according to the AFP.",
      "\"The increase in tariffs means that the U.S. people who make the purchase orders of Cambodian products are the first people to be impacted, and next will be Cambodia and business people,\" she was quoted as saying.",
      "Australia",
      "Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Thursday that Mr. Trump's 10% tariffs were \"not unexpected, but let me be clear, they are totally unwarranted.\"",
      "\"This is not the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, who, in addition to his frustration, appeared perplexed by the fact that the White House tariffs singled out some of his country's tiny, far-flung territories, including a group of islands that are home to lots of penguins, but no people.",
      "Norfolk Island is an inhabited Australian territory, but only by about 2,000 people, and Albanese called it \"a bit strange\" that it had been singled out by the White House and hit with an even greater tariff of 29%, nearly three times higher than the Australian mainland.",
      "The uninhabited Heard Island and McDonald Islands were subject to the same 10% levy as mainland Australia, meanwhile, despite them rarely seeing human footprints due to \"the extreme isolation\" and the \"persistently severe weather and sea conditions\" in the sub-Antarctic area.",
      "Jordan Freiman, \n                                                  \n                                  Caitlin Yilek and \n                                                  \n                                  Alain Sherter\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Life-sized statues of a man and a woman were discovered in a tomb in Pompeii, researchers said, thousands of years after a deadly volcano wiped out the ancient Roman city.",
      "Researchers say the nearly life-size figures shed new light on life and religion in Pompeii, which was destroyed when Mt. Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D.",
      "The discovery was made while researchers from the archaeological site and the University of Valencia worked on an excavation focused on the necropolis of Porta Sarno, which was just outside the city, according to a news release. The site served as a burial ground, and was discovered in the 1990s during railway construction. Since 1998, researchers have found evidence of over 50 cremation burials in the necropolis. The current excavation, called \"Investigating the Archaeology of Death in Pompeii,\" has been ongoing since July 2024.",
      "The statues were found in the southern half of the tomb, covered in pumice stone, according to a report by the researchers. The pumice stone indicated that this part of the tomb had been buried in earthquakes shortly before the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius.",
      "The figures are a funerary relief, the researchers said. The couple may have been married and appear to have been \"well-to-do,\" according to the researchers.",
      "\"The delicacy and detail of the sculpture is remarkable,\" the researchers wrote. \"We can appreciate the careful carving of the hands, fingers and nails. We can also see the detailed work on the folds of the clothing and the ornaments: rings, bracelets, necklace, etc.\"",
      "The woman's figure includes carved accessories that may indicate she was a priestess of Ceres, a Roman harvest and fertility goddess. Researchers said that it is likely only women from prominent families held this position. Priestesses wielded political power and had the highest social standing possible for Roman women. Statues of priestesses holding items associated with their positions are very rare in southern Italy, the researchers said.",
      "The man is wearing a toga indicating that he is a Roman citizen. Both are depicted wearing rings that may be wedding bands.",
      "Other relics, including ointment jars that may have held perfumed oil, a broken mirror and a coin depicting the sea god Neptune were also found in the tomb. These items may have been important in funerary rites, the researchers said.",
      "The statues may date back to the late Republican period, which ranged from 133 to 31 B.C., the researchers said.",
      "The statues have been transferred to another part of Pompeii for restoration work. They will be featured in an exhibition that focuses on womanhood in ancient Pompeii, which will open on April 16. The restoration will be carried out in front of exhibition visitors, the park said.",
      "Other major finds have been unearthed in Pompeii in recent months. In February, paintings depicting Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, were discovered. The images were painted on the walls of a large banquet room. In January, archaeologists excavated a large private bathhouse that included multiple rooms and a plunge pool.",

      "Carbon monoxide poisoning was the cause of death, authorities in Costa Rica confirmed on April 2.\u00a0High levels of the toxic gas had been detected\u00a0in testing of the family's hotel room.",
      "Here is what we know about Miller Gardner's death.",
      "What happened to Miller Gardner?",
      "Miller Gardner's parents said in a statement that he died in his sleep after he and several other family members fell ill while vacationing. They did not elaborate on who else had gotten sick, what specific illness they were dealing with or what symptoms they had experienced.",
      "Where were the Gardners staying?",
      "The Gardners were vacationing at the Arenas Del Mar Beachfront & Rainforest Resort, which is along Costa Rica's Pacific coast, some 50 miles south of San Jos\u00e9.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by this loss, and our hearts go out to the family during this incredibly difficult time,\" the resort said in a statement on Tuesday, March 25. \"The factors that led to this tragic incident are unknown, and we are fully cooperating with authorities as they investigate. We remain committed to supporting our guests and staff, prioritizing their well-being and safety, while respecting the privacy of those affected.\"",
      "The resort also told CBS News that hotel staff responded to the incident according to protocol, saying: \"The hotel staff dispatched a medical team immediately, including a licensed doctor, which arrived to handle the emergency situation. Any medical attention to the family was done by medical professionals. Our staff did not administer any medical treatment.\"",
      "What are officials saying about the cause of death?",
      "Randall Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, director of the Judicial Investigation Agency, or OIJ, said on March 31 that investigators conducted testing in the hotel room where Gardner was staying and found high levels of carbon monoxide, which he said may have been caused by machinery in the room next door. The contamination they found led investigators to believe Gardner \"may have died from inhaling these highly dangerous gases,\" Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said.",
      "The cause of death was confirmed after Gardner was tested for carboxyhemoglobin, a compound generated when\u00a0carbon monoxide\u00a0binds to hemoglobin in the blood, according to Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. The test showed a carboxyhemoglobin saturation of 64%. Saturation is considered lethal when it exceeds 50%.",
      "The head of Costa Rica's judicial police also said that a \"layer\" was detected during the autopsy on Gardner's organs. That layer forms due to a high presence of carbon monoxide.",
      "Carbon monoxide\u00a0is an odorless gas produced by the burning of fossil fuels in equipment such as cars, furnaces, stoves, certain heaters and generators.\u00a0Symptoms\u00a0of carbon monoxide poisoning may include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and confusion.",

      "\"We trust that the forensic process will objectively, clearly, and conclusively clarify the causes of this unfortunate incident,\" the hotel said.",
      "The OIJ director had said it was conducting three types of analyses, including a toxicology report, at its forensic science laboratories.",
      "Why did early reports say the cause was food poisoning or \"food intoxication\"?",
      "Asphyxiation was initially thought to be the cause of death, although that theory was ruled out after an autopsy performed by the Forensic Pathology Section. An initial statement had said: \"Preliminary reports indicate the cause of death is asphyxiation following possible food poisoning.\"",
      "Some news outlets quoted a local official who cited possible \"food intoxication,\" but there is no condition by that name, and it appears in this context to have meant the same thing as food poisoning.",
      "Following the reports of possible food poisoning, Hotel La Mariposa, located less than a mile from where the Gardners were staying, released a statement to address what it called \"misinformation circulating on social media.\"",
      "\"The Gardner family dined at our restaurant, Le Papillon, on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 18, 2025\u2014three days before Miller's tragic passing. Any claims suggesting a link between our restaurant and this heartbreaking event are entirely false and unfounded,\" the restaurant said. \"Any news, statements, or claims to the contrary do not reflect the reality of the situation. Furthermore, we do not have any additional information, as the Gardner family did not stay at our hotel.\" The hotel also extended its \"heartfelt condolences to the Gardner family.\"",
      "The Arenas Del Mar resort, where the Gardners were staying, said in a statement, \"The family did not eat at any of Arenas Del Mar's restaurants for lunch or dinner the previous day. Additionally, on March 14th, we had an inspection by the Health Ministry in which the hotel passed with a 98.5 out of 100.\"",
      "What has the Gardner family said?",
      "In a statement before the cause of death was confirmed, Miller Gardner's parents, Brett and Jessica Gardner, said they had \"so many questions and so few answers.\"",
      "\"Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile,\" they said. \"He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.\"",
      "\"We are so thankful to all who have reached out to offer support and encouragement during this difficult time and we are confident our faith, family, and friends will help us navigate this unimaginable loss,\" their statement continued. \"Our prayers go out to Miller's teammates and friends, as well as to all other families who have lost a child far too soon as we share their grief.\"",
      "An\u00a0obituary\u00a0posted online described Miller Gardner as an Honor Roll student who played football and baseball and loved traveling with his family.",
      "\"The void Miller's passing leaves in the hearts of his family, friends, teammates, teachers, coaches and others will be felt for years,\" it said. \"Miller's time here with them was brief but his spirit will carry on forever through those who were impacted by the way he lived.\"",
      "What have the New York Yankees said?",
      "The New York Yankees, where Brett Gardner played for 14 years, released the following statement after news of Miller Gardner's death became public.",
      "\"Our hearts are heavy, and the Yankees family is filled with grief after learning of the passing of Miller Gardner. Words feel insignificant and insufficient in trying to describe such an unimaginable loss. It wasn't just Brett who literally grew up in this organization for more than 17 years \u2014 so did his wife, Jessica, and their two boys, Hunter and Miller.",
      "We grieve with Brett, Jessica, Hunter, and their community of family and friends in mourning the loss of Miller, who had a spark in his eyes, an outgoing and feisty personality, and a warm and loving nature.",
      "Our love for the Gardner family is unconditional and absolute, and we will offer our enduring support while understanding their desire for privacy at this time.",
      "May Miller rest in peace.\"",
      "Who is Brett Gardner?",
      "Brett Gardner is a former baseball player who spent his entire professional career with the New York Yankees. Originally from North Carolina, he was initially drafted by the Yankees in 2005 and was first called up in 2008 before becoming a regular starter the following season. During his 14 MLB seasons, the outfielder won one World Series in 2009, earned an All-Star appearance in 2015 and a Gold Glove Award in 2016.",

      "While the image was met by applause during the concert, Jalisco prosecutors quickly announced they were summoning the band to testify in an investigation into whether they were promoting violence, a crime which could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison. The state of Michoacan also announced an investigation into the Los Alegres del Barranco for projecting the same images during a concert in the city of Uruapan.",

In 2023, Peso Pluma beat Taylor Swift out as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "Many of the artists now topping the charts have come under fierce criticism because their lyrics often paint cartel leaders as Robin Hood-esque figures. Others say that the genre, known as \"narco corridos,\" expresses the harsh realities of many youths across Mexico.",
      "A number of Mexican states have banned public performances of the music in recent years, the most recent being the state of Nayarit in February. Some of the bans have come as famed artists have received death threats from cartels, forcing a number of them to cancel their performances.",
      "Others, including Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, have sought a less aggressive approach to addressing the genre. Sheinbaum, who has come out against censoring the music, has suggested instead that the Mexican government push forward initiatives that promote Mexican regional music with more socially acceptable lyrics.",

      "The president, who signed an executive order to impose the tariffs, insisted the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of are \"over.\" The reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump said, will amount to roughly half the tariff rate those countries impose on U.S. exports, or less. Countries that will see tariffs higher than 10% include the European Union, China and Israel.",
      "Senior administration officials said the 10% worldwide tariffs take effect April 5 at 12:01 a.m., and the higher reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9 at 12:01 a.m.",
      "\"In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" the president said in a White House Rose Garden announcement. \"And for these reasons, starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\"",
      "\"For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating, and because we are being very kind, we're a kind people, very kind,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're not so kind when you're ripped off\u2026 We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.\"",

      "\"It's our declaration of economic independence,\" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Trump labeled Wednesday \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "The president lamented that the U.S. imports phones and other electronics, as well as pharmaceuticals, saying that if there's a war, the U.S. would struggle. He said his moves Wednesday are also standing up for U.S. farmers and ranchers who have been \"brutalized\" by other countries, specifically blasting Canada.",

      "The president said he expects complaints from \"globalists,\" \"outsourcers,\" \"special interests,\" and \"fake news\" in the days ahead, but insisted those groups have been wrong about trade before.",
      "\"In the first term, they said tariffs would crash the economy,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Instead, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.\"",
      "In the audience for the president's announcement were rank-and-file steelworkers and auto workers, House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as most of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, including Vice President JD Vance.",
      "What new tariffs did Trump announce today?",
      "The president says his plan will place a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on all countries, with reciprocal tariffs on many trading partners that have their own tariffs placed on the U.S. The 25% tariffs the president previously announced on foreign cars and foreign auto parts are set to go into effect at midnight.",
      "A White House official said the reciprocal tariffs are additive, meaning they will be imposed in addition to any previous tariffs already in place, unless a specific good is exempt under Section 232 of the Tariffs Act, which carries a flat 25% rate on certain things like steel and aluminum.",

      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday that tariffs are one tool to get companies to bring jobs back to the U.S.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and- and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here,\" Fain said. \"And, you know, invest in the American workers. The American working class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it.\"",
      "What are tariffs, exactly?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S.\u00a0The most common type of tariffs are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value\"), which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of a product. The 25% auto tariffs are these types of tariffs.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, and \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold.",
      "What do financial experts say about tariffs?",
      "Economists and taxpayer advocacy groups have their doubts, and are warning tariffs could upset economic growth and will almost surely contribute to higher prices for American consumers. Some automakers have already announced higher car prices, after the president announced tariffs on foreign cars and parts.",
      "More than a dozen leaders at think tanks and taxpayer advocacy groups, including at the National Taxpayers Union, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, on Tuesday sent a joint letter to congressional leaders and the commerce and treasury secretaries, urging them to consider how tariffs on steel, lumber, energy, pharmaceutical and medical supplies and cars and car parts will increase prices.",
      "\"We encourage you to consider whether tariffs may, in many cases, undermine President Trump's broader long-term economic goals by increasing the cost of goods subject to tariffs,\" they wrote. \"We are especially concerned about tariffs on inputs needed by U.S. manufacturers that make it harder to compete with finished goods made abroad and tariffs that increase the price of necessities like food and housing.\"",
      "Alex Jacquez, who worked on the Biden White House National Economic Council, said that although it's hard to know the exact impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs without knowing all the details, CEOs are telling investors and shareholders they will be hiking prices.",
      "\"What the major retailers and companies who may be affected by tariffs are planning to do and they're planning out in public here is pass these costs along to consumers as much as they possibly can,\" Jacquez, now the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "Colin Grabow, associate director at the libertarian Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, wrote in a USA Today op-ed that \"tariffs are a costly and inefficient tax usually borne by the importing country's customers.\"",
      "\"Americans may have voted for lower prices in November, but under the guise of tariff reciprocity, the Trump administration is set to deliver something very different,\" Grabow wrote.",
      "A reporter on Tuesday asked Leavitt if the president is thinking about seniors on fixed income who are stressed about the recent swings in the stock market, swings partly attributed to the president's tariff announcements. Stocks have struggled as Wall Street braces for the next round of tariffs.",
      "\"Well certainly, they are legitimate concerns and the president takes those concerns very seriously,\" Leavitt said. \"And he's addressing them every single day. And tomorrow's announcement is to protect future generations of the senior citizens you mentioned. It's for their kids and their grandkids, to ensure that there are jobs here in the United States of America for their children to live the American dream, just like they presumably did.\"",
      "And the president told NBC News he \"couldn't care less\" if his tariffs lead to automakers raising their prices.",

    "summary": "The wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison, says he's not a criminal and she's \"scared for his life.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. citizen wife of a 29-year-old man who the Trump administration has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador said she fears for his safety in the infamous mega-prison where he's being held, maintaining that her husband is \"an amazing father\" and \"not a criminal.\"",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador on March 15 and imprisoned inside that country's maximum-security prison known as CECOT, as part of a series of U.S. deportation flights that have ignited a high-stakes legal battle in American courts.",
      "The Trump administration has acknowledged in federal court that his deportation was an \"administrative error,\" since an immigration judge in 2019 had granted him legal protection from being sent to El Salvador. But it has rejected requests to bring back Abrego Garcia, saying the U.S. no longer has custody over him. It is also accusing him of being part of MS-13, a transnational criminal gang. Abrego Garcia's lawyers have said in court documents that their client has no criminal record, a finding the government has not contested.",
      "During an exclusive interview with CBS News, Jennifer, Abrego Garcia's wife, said she confirmed her husband had been deported from the U.S. and imprisoned at the CECOT prison after identifying him in a photo posted by the Salvadoran government.",
      "\"When I saw it, I immediately broke down 'cause I knew it was him,\" she said. \"I was scared for his life.\"",
      "Jennifer, who requested that her surname be withheld, said she was \"very scared\" about Abrego Garcia's transfer to CECOT because it houses some of El Salvador's most dangerous gang members. After all, she said, the reason a U.S. immigration judge in 2019 granted him a reprieve from deportation was because of concerns that he could be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador.",
      "\"I've seen news of that prison,\" she said. \"I know they take criminals there. And my husband's not a criminal.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. in 2011, when he was 16. According to court documents, he entered the country illegally, without being inspected by immigration officials.",
      "In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after an encounter with local police outside of a Maryland Home Depot. Abrego Garcia's attorneys said he went there looking for work. He remained in ICE detention for months, while an immigration judge reviewed his case.",
      "Court documents show an immigration judge initially denied Abrego Garcia's release on bond, partially due to information submitted by the government that it said tied him to MS-13. The judge's bond denial, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board, mentioned information from an informant who the government deemed to be credible.",
      "But Abrego Garcia was ultimately released from ICE custody after another immigration judge granted him \"withholding of removal,\" a legal classification that bars officials from deporting individuals who prove they are more likely than not to face persecution in their home country. In his order, the judge said Abrego Garcia could be targeted by gangs if sent to El Salvador.",
      "Jennifer said her husband attended regular check-ins with ICE after he was released. He became their family's main breadwinner, she added, and helped her raise their 5-year-old disabled son, as well as two children from a previous relationship. He worked five days a week as a sheet metal worker while also attending college classes, she said.",
      "On March 12, however, Abrego Garcia was again arrested by ICE. Jennifer said he was driving with their 5-year-old son with disabilities when he was stopped. She said she rushed to the location and was told by ICE officials that her husband's status had \"changed\" and that he would be fingerprinted and detained.",
      "Over the next few days, Jennifer said her husband was transferred to different immigration detention centers, including ones in Louisiana and Texas. During their last phone call, Jennifer said Abrego Garcia told her that he was going to be deported to El Salvador and imprisoned at CECOT.",
      "Jennifer said she couldn't believe it. She told her husband there was no reason for the U.S. to send him to a foreign prison. He said that if she didn't receive another call from him, it would be because he had been deported.",
      "\"He never called,\" Jennifer said. \"I waited and waited. He never made that call.\"",
      "Jennifer said she has not heard from her husband since that call and has not found a way to communicate with him. She's now suing the government as part of a lawsuit before the federal district court in Maryland that is demanding that the U.S. government take steps to bring Abrego Garcia back to the country.",
      "While it has conceded it mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia, the Trump administration has defended the merits of his deportation and has told the federal court in Maryland it opposes his return to the U.S.",
      "The Justice Department has argued\u00a0that federal courts lack the authority to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, since he's now being held by the Salvadoran government and no longer in U.S. custody. Even if they did have the power to order his return, the Justice Department said in a filing, there has been \"no showing that El Salvador is even inclined to consider a request to release a detainee at the United States' request.\"",
      "Trump administration officials, including White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, have described Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 \"leader\" who is implicated in human trafficking. Officials have yet to disclose concrete evidence that supports those claims.",
      "Jennifer strongly refuted the White House's accusations, saying she would know if her husband was a gang member. Court documents indicate Abrego Garcia has traffic violations, but no criminal charges or convictions, in the U.S.",
      "\"He's not a criminal,\" Jennifer said. \"My husband is an amazing person. An amazing father.\"",

      "Tested's Adam Savage paired up with Medtronic to offer his commentary on what can contribute to a longer lifespan, including possible differences between men's and women's health.",
      "Former \"MythBusters\" star Adam Savage is exploring the science of longevity, asking how lifestyle choices, stress and even sleep affect how long we live.",
      "Savage, now a YouTube creator and head of the channel Tested, has partnered with health technology company Medtronic to engage in discussions about longevity. While not a researcher himself, he has taken a deep dive into scientific insights from experts and reflected on his own experiences.",
      "\"Longevity has always been a fascination for me,\" Savage told Fox News Digital\u00a0in an exclusive interview.\u00a0\"I mean, who doesn\u2019t want to know how to live better and maybe even longer? But the real question is what actually works?\"",

      "Adam Savage speaks at MegaCon Orlando 2025 at the Orange County Convention Center Feb. 8, 2025, in Orlando, Fla. (Gerardo Mora/Getty Images)",
      "He credits his \"MythBusters\" experience with fueling his passion for scientific exploration.",
      "\"Making that show legitimized the practice of science and engineering to me,\" Savage said. \"It made me realize how much of our world can be tested, questioned and improved through experimentation.\"",
      "Through his discussions with people on the street for Medtronic, Savage has uncovered key lifestyle factors affecting longevity. He noted a cultural shift in what we consider to be old age, highlighting that people today consider themselves \"young-ish\" for longer.",
      "Savage also pointed to Blue Zones, regions known for long life expectancy, but questioned whether longevity there stems simply from location or cultural practices.",
      "\"We assume people in these areas live longer because of where they are, but what if it\u2019s really just the way they live? That\u2019s the part that fascinates me,\" he said.\u00a0AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS",
      "\"There\u2019s no magic secret. It\u2019s a mix of daily habits \u2014 what you eat, how you move, how you interact with your community, how you handle stress. All those things matter.\"",
      "Savage has taken a personal interest in testing different longevity strategies in his own life. He spoke candidly with Fox News Digital about his journey with intermittent fasting, which helped him lose 25 pounds and eliminate sleep apnea.",
      "\"It\u2019s crazy how much of a difference it made,\" he said. \"I didn\u2019t just lose weight. I felt sharper, I slept better and I stopped snoring. It was like flipping a switch on my health.\"",
      "He also reflected on his past smoking habits and what it took to quit.",
      "\"I had to admit I wasn\u2019t smoking for enjoyment,\" Savage said. \"I was just doing it out of habit. Once I realized that, it was easy to quit.\"",
      "Medtronic is investigating how science can extend our lives. Savage believes that lifestyle choices and community have been beneficial in his own life. (iStock)",
      "On alcohol, Savage dismissed the idea of a universal approach, arguing that studies conflict. While he personally cut back, he emphasized that people shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about their lifestyle choices.",
      "\"I'm a big believer in not feeling guilty about the things that you do to the core, whether it's smoking, whether it's watching something dumb or puzzling for 100 hours at a time,\" he said. \"I don't care about any of those. We all do these things to sort of bring relaxation and down regulate. I just think that alcohol is an especially poor down regulator in the final analysis.\"",
      "Beyond lifestyle choices, medical advancements are playing an increasingly critical role in extending both lifespan and \"healthspan,\" the years we live without serious disease. Medtronic, which focuses on healthcare technology globally, has developed medical devices designed to manage chronic conditions, improve heart health and advance minimally invasive surgeries.",
      "According to Medtronic, as people live longer, the focus is shifting toward enhancing not just lifespan but quality of life. The company\u2019s latest innovations include artificial intelligence-driven healthcare monitoring, robotic-assisted surgeries and advanced pacemakers, all aimed at improving long-term health outcomes. Savage also spoke about the psychological aspects of aging, emphasizing that mindset and community play a significant role in longevity.",
      "Medtronic claims the first person to live to 150 may already have been born. When asked if there is an upper limit to human life, Savage replied, \"I think right now 150 is a very realistic target to be shooting for and to be discussing.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"That's really what science foreshadowing is,\" added Savage. \"It's about asking these questions and seeing, \u2018OK, what numbers are unrealistic.\u2019 I think 40 years ago, 150 would have seemed radically unrealistic. Today it seems more realistic, and I think it's entirely reasonable that, let's say, by 2040, we may all have a different cultural answer to that question.\"",

    "summary": "",
    "story": [
      "Health care took center stage during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 And in the five years since, the industry has experienced change and innovation.",
      "The field of medicine has undergone significant changes since the COVID-19 pandemic, with the biggest breakthrough right at our fingertips: telemedicine.\u00a0 While it may feel like a \"normal\" part of healthcare now, connected technology dominated how Americans saw doctors during the pandemic. \"Before the pandemic, virtual care was available, but it was not widely used. Now telemedicine is mainstream,\" says Dr. Michael Aziz, an Attending Physician at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital.",
      "According to one study, telemedicine encounters increased 766% in the first three months of the COVID outbreak. And while use of the 2-D technology has tapered off, Dr. Aziz, believes still plays a vital role in medical care, \"Especially for people in rural areas. Especially for young professionals. And it offers convenience. But we have so many barriers when it comes to telemedicine.... especially for senior citizens,\u2019 he explains, \"Also, the government has put some many roadblocks for patients to use that. One is the cost. There's a cost associated with that. It's not covered by many insurance.\"",
      "Experts say while telemedicine has been revolutionary, it's best suited for certain ailments, particularly psychiatric services.\u00a0 Dr. Chris Ivany, Psychiatrist and COO of Family Care Center, emphasizes, \"I think it's clear to say that the pandemic certainly had a immediate and negative effect on many Americans' mental health.\"",
      "A recent Gallup poll shows adults 18 to 49 reported a steep drop in their mental health since 2020, with many suffering from depression, anxiety, and isolation.\u00a0 This has led to an increase in Americans seeking help post-crisis.\u00a0 Dr. Ivany notes, \"The stigma to seeking mental health care is definitely decreased over the course of the past five or so years.... but also, in part to just a general recognition that mental health care is part of health care overall.\"\u00a0 Dr. Ivany points to two main reasons we're seeing a growth in mental health care, \"Part of what the pandemic has done is to raise the awareness of mental health issues, challenges across the American population in a way that really hadn't been done really in the past.... And I think the second is the field now is much more flexible in terms of how care can be delivered to people.\"",
      "Another challenge changing the landscape of the industry, a significant reduction in staffing. Dr. Aziz says, \"About 3000 healthcare professionals have died and about 100,000 have retired or changed career... Hospitals have a hard time not only hiring physicians and health care workers, but they have a hard time retaining them.\"",
      "While telemedicine has been a game changer, it\u2019s not the only major innovation to emerge from the pandemic. The production and rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, along with advancements in rapid testing and antigen tests, are also transformative innovations born out of the pandemic."

      "The amended framework would raise the debt ceiling by up to $5 trillion within the reconciliation process, taking future leverage away from Senate Democrats.

      "Some conservatives have signaled they're wary of using that method, however.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote series, \"I have been assured that there is a commitment and other ways to pay for the eventual reconciliation bill.\"",

      "Initially, there was stark disagreement between Republicans in the House and Senate on how to organize a budget reconciliation resolution. The House GOP leaders preferred one bill with both the border and taxes included, while those in the Senate wanted to have two separate resolutions for them.",

Statewide elections are going on next year, and if we stay true to form, we will have a strong, talented, dynamic, well-organized, well-funded slate of people running for statewide office, which lifts all boats with regard to Republican candidates in our state.

      "Security researchers at\u00a0LayerX Labs have uncovered a new phishing campaign that specifically targets Mac users, marking a shift from its previous focus on Windows. The attackers initially lured Windows users with fake Microsoft security alerts designed to steal login credentials. However, after Microsoft, Chrome and Firefox implemented new security features to block these attacks, the hackers started redirecting their efforts toward Mac users instead.",
      "The new attack closely mirrors its predecessor but with key modifications.

The attack code has also been adjusted to specifically detect macOS and Safari users, ensuring that only Apple users see the fraudulent pages.",
      "Plus, despite shifting their focus, the attackers continue to host these phishing pages on Microsoft\u2019s Windows[.]net domain. Since this is a trusted Microsoft platform, it allows the phishing pages to evade detection by security tools that assess risk based on domain reputation.",

      "Instead of reaching the intended site, they land on a compromised domain parking page. From there, they are redirected through multiple websites before ultimately arriving at the phishing page, which presents a fake Apple security warning.

      "7 ways to stay safe from attackers targeting Apple users",
      "Phishing campaigns are increasingly targeting macOS users, but you\u2019re not defenseless. Here are four essential steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0A reliable antivirus program is your first line of defense against phishing attempts and malicious websites. While Apple\u2019s built-in security features provide some protection, they aren\u2019t foolproof, especially against sophisticated phishing attacks that mimic legitimate Apple warnings. A robust antivirus solution can detect and block malicious sites before you even reach them, preventing you from accidentally entering your credentials on a fraudulent page. Additionally, advanced security software can identify suspicious redirects and alert you before you fall victim to typosquatting traps.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Keep your software up to date:\u00a0Regular\u00a0updates to macOS and your applications aren\u2019t just about new features. They\u2019re critical patches that fix security vulnerabilities. Attackers are quick to exploit any weakness, so ensuring your operating system and all installed software are current minimizes the risk of a breach. Enable automatic updates where possible so you\u2019re always protected by the latest security enhancements.",
      "3. Regularly monitor your Apple ID activity: Even with strong security measures in place, it\u2019s important to keep an eye on your Apple ID account for any signs of unauthorized access. Apple allows users to review their account activity, including devices logged into the account and recent changes. Regularly check your Apple ID settings to ensure that only trusted devices are connected and that no suspicious activity has occurred. If you notice anything unusual, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, immediately change your password and remove unauthorized devices. This proactive approach can help you catch potential breaches early and minimize damage.",

      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Strong, unique passwords for every account are essential, but they\u2019re even more effective when combined with\u00a0two-factor authentication. Even if attackers manage to steal your credentials through a phishing attack,\u00a02FA adds an extra barrier that makes unauthorized access significantly harder. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use a recovery key for enhanced security: Apple offers an optional feature called a recovery key, which is a 28-character code that provides an extra layer of security for your Apple ID. When you enable a recovery key, Apple disables its standard account recovery process, meaning you\u2019ll need this key, along with access to a trusted device or phone number, to reset your password or regain access to your account. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to take control of your account.",
      "To set up a recovery key, go to\u00a0Settings > [Your Name] > Sign-in & Security > Recovery Key on your iPhone, iPad or Mac. Follow the prompts to generate and confirm your recovery key. Be sure to write it down and store it in a secure location, such as a safe or with a trusted family member. Keep in mind that losing both your recovery key and access to trusted devices can permanently lock you out of your account. However, if used responsibly, this feature gives you greater control over your account\u2019s security.",
      "6. Enable biometric authentication: Apple devices offer advanced\u00a0biometric authentication options like Face ID and Touch ID, which provide an extra layer of security. These features make it significantly harder for attackers to gain access to your device or sensitive accounts, even if they manage to steal your credentials. Enable biometric authentication wherever possible, especially for apps and services that store personal or financial information. Since biometric data is unique to you, it adds a level of protection that passwords alone cannot provide.",
      "7. Practice safe browsing:\u00a0Many attacks rely on simple user mistakes, such as mistyping a URL or clicking on suspicious links. Always verify that you\u2019re visiting legitimate websites before entering any personal information. Be skeptical of unexpected security alerts, even if they mimic Apple\u2019s design. Learning to identify the subtle signs of phishing, like unusual URL structures or generic greetings, can help you avoid falling for these scams.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Apple has long sold the idea that its ecosystem is inherently safer than the alternatives, but that claim is starting to wear thin. The reality is that attackers are no longer ignoring Mac users, they\u2019re actively targeting them, and Apple\u2019s response has been anything but proactive. While Microsoft, Google and others roll out new security measures to counter evolving threats, Apple remains slow to adapt, relying on outdated assumptions about its platform\u2019s safety.",

Install firewalls,\u00a0strong antivirus software and intrusion detection systems to block malicious activities before they can cause harm. Regularly patch operating systems and applications to stay ahead of cybercriminals. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Implement strong password policies and use a password manager: Ensure all passwords are unique, at least 15 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Also, consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely. This reduces the risk of password reuse and weak passwords, which are common entry points for ransomware attacks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "3. Educate and train employees on cybersecurity awareness:\u00a0Many ransomware attacks start with phishing emails or social engineering tactics. As seen in the scam targeting executives, attackers often use fear-based tactics to manipulate victims into acting quickly. Train your employees, particularly high-level executives, to recognize suspicious emails, fraudulent requests and phishing attempts.",
      "4. Backup data and maintain a secure recovery plan:\u00a0Data backups are a critical safeguard against ransomware. Regularly back up critical data to secure, offline locations that ransomware cannot access. Testing your recovery plans frequently ensures that if an attack does occur, you can recover quickly with minimal impact on operations. In addition, consider using a cloud service with encryption to ensure that even if an attack happens, the backup remains safe.",
      "5.\u00a0Utilize two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Two-factor authentication is an essential security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to sensitive systems and data. With 2FA, even if attackers manage to obtain login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access critical systems without the second factor of authentication, whether it\u2019s a code sent to a phone or biometric verification.",
      "6. Verify threats before taking action:\u00a0If you receive a ransom demand (digital or physical), investigate its legitimacy. Scams often lack proof of data breaches or network compromise. Consult cybersecurity experts or law enforcement before responding.",
      "7. Report suspicious activity: Notify law enforcement or organizations like the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center if you encounter scams or ransomware threats. Reporting helps authorities track and mitigate these activities.",

    "story": [
      "Cybercriminals are sending fake meeting invitations that seem legitimate.",
      "Google Chrome is the most popular browser in the world, and it is used by billions of people. However, its widespread usage also makes it a prime target for bad actors who exploit various methods, such as malicious extensions, phishing links and fake websites. The latest attack involves hackers exploiting a browser vulnerability to conduct espionage. Google has acknowledged the security flaw and has released an update to fix it.",

      "A man using Google Chrome on his laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "About the attack",
      "Cybersecurity researchers at Kaspersky recently discovered a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in Google Chrome. The attack was triggered when victims unknowingly clicked on a phishing link in an email, launching a malicious site in their browser. Shockingly, no further action was required. Simply opening the link was enough to infect the system.",
      "According to\u00a0Kaspersky\u2019s report, the malware was based on a zero-day vulnerability, later identified as CVE-2025-2783. Researchers say they analyzed the exploit, reverse-engineered its logic and uncovered that it allowed attackers to bypass Chrome\u2019s built-in security features as if they didn\u2019t exist.",
      "The vulnerability exploited Chrome's inter-process communication framework, known as Mojo, which is crucial for the browser's functionality. This allowed the attackers to execute malicious code across different processes within Chrome, effectively bypassing its security measures.",
      "\"We have discovered and reported dozens of zero-day exploits actively used in attacks, but this particular exploit is certainly one of the most interesting we\u2019ve encountered,\" Kaspersky noted.",
      "The cybersecurity team also highlighted the stealthy nature of the attack, which primarily targeted media professionals, educational institutions and government agencies. Dubbed \"Operation ForumTroll,\" the campaign appeared to have espionage as its primary goal.",

      "As with most security updates, Google is keeping the details under wraps until the majority of users have installed the fix. This is a standard precaution to prevent other hackers from exploiting the flaw, while some users are still unprotected. If the bug also affects third-party software, Google will continue restricting details until those platforms release their own patches.",

      "While updating Chrome should fix the vulnerability, below are some security tips you can follow to further bolster your privacy and security.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers often gain access to devices by sending infected emails or documents or by tricking you into clicking a link that downloads malware. You can avoid all of this by installing strong antivirus software that will detect any potential threat before it can take over your device.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Many online accounts, including Google, offer two-factor authentication as an extra security measure.\u00a0Enabling 2FA ensures that even if a hacker obtains your password, they still need a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, to access your account. This simple step significantly reduces the chances of unauthorized access.",
      "3) Use a secure password manager:\u00a0A strong password is crucial, but remembering multiple complex passwords can be difficult. A password manager generates, stores and autofills strong passwords for your accounts, reducing the risk of password-related breaches. Avoid using the same password across different sites and always opt for long, unique passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This incident serves as yet another reminder that even the most secure systems are never truly invulnerable, especially when state-backed or highly skilled actors are in play. While Google\u2019s quick response is commendable, it also highlights the never-ending cat-and-mouse game between security teams and cybercriminals. If you are using Chrome, update it now.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Phishing attacks are everywhere, and most of us can spot the obvious ones. Even if someone falls for one and hands over their password, two-factor authentication (2FA) usually adds a crucial layer of protection. But a new phishing kit making the rounds can bypass 2FA entirely by using session hijacking and real-time credential interception.",
      "Known as Astaroth, this tool intercepts and manipulates traffic between your device and legitimate authentication services like Gmail, Yahoo and Microsoft. Since it grabs everything in real time, it completely bypasses 2FA and gives attackers full access to your account.",
      "Stay protected & informed! Get security alerts & expert tech tips \u2013 sign up for Kurt\u2019s The CyberGuy Report now.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Astaroth works",
      "Astaroth is a next-level phishing kit that takes scamming to a whole new level. Instead of using basic fake login pages like traditional phishing kits, it works as a middleman between your device and the real authentication service while silently grabbing everything needed to break in.",
      "The attack begins when you click on a phishing link and land on a malicious site that looks identical to the real one. Since the site has valid SSL certificates, there are no red flags, no security warnings and no sketchy pop-ups. When you enter your login details, including username, password, device info and IP address, Astaroth snatches them up before passing the request to the actual website.",
      "Two-factor authentication is not a problem for Astaroth. It intercepts one-time passwords the second they are entered, whether they come from an authenticator app, SMS or a push notification. The stolen codes are instantly sent to the attacker through a web panel or Telegram alert, so they can use them before they expire.",
      "The real kicker is that Astaroth also grabs session cookies, which are the small bits of data that keep users logged in after authentication. Attackers can inject these cookies into their own browsers, skipping the need for passwords or two-factor authentication altogether. Once they have the session, they are in with no extra steps required.",
      "An example of what the victim and attacker would see (SlashNext) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR MAC, PC, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS - CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "Astaroth is shockingly advanced",
      "As reported by cybersecurity company\u00a0SlashNext, Astaroth stands out from other phishing kits because of its ability to intercept credentials in real time, automate attacks and resist takedown efforts. Traditional phishing depends on tricking victims into entering their credentials on fake login pages, but Astaroth removes that step entirely.",
      "Beyond its advanced capabilities, Astaroth comes with features that make it appealing to cybercriminals. It uses bulletproof hosting to stay online despite law enforcement efforts, receives frequent updates to bypass security patches and follows a structured payment model. For $2,000, buyers get six months of continuous upgrades. To build trust, the creators even let hackers test the phishing kit before purchasing.",
      "Astaroth is widely available through Telegram and underground cybercrime forums. The anonymity of these platforms makes it difficult for authorities to track distribution.",

      "1) Avoid unknown links and use strong antivirus software: Remember that no matter how advanced the malware is, it still needs input from you. In most cases, an attacker will require you to click a link before they can steal your data. For example, for Astaroth to work, you have to click a link, visit a malicious website and enter your credentials. If you don\u2019t click the link, you stay clear of the malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS device.",
      "2) Double-check sites:\u00a0Always verify website addresses and use bookmarks for trusted sites. Instead of clicking on links in emails or messages, manually type the URL or use a trusted bookmark. This minimizes the risk of landing on a fraudulent page designed to mimic a legitimate website.",
      "3) Update your devices:\u00a0You might wonder how keeping your devices updated helps against malware like Astaroth. While it doesn\u2019t directly prevent an attack, it ensures the situation doesn\u2019t get worse.\u00a0Keeping your operating system and applications up to date with the latest security patches closes vulnerabilities that malware might exploit, making it harder for attackers to gain a foothold on your device.",
      "4) Avoid typing passwords:\u00a0Avoid entering passwords whenever possible to reduce the risk of credential theft. Instead, use authentication methods like passkeys, Google Sign-In or Apple Sign-In.",
      "A passkey is a feature that uses cryptographic key pairs to verify your identity, eliminating the need for traditional passwords. It allows you to sign in to apps and websites using the same process you use to unlock your device, such as biometrics, PIN or pattern.",
      "Google Sign-In is a feature that allows you to log in to third-party apps or websites using their Google Account credentials. It simplifies the sign-in process by eliminating the need to create and remember separate usernames and passwords for each service. You can sign in via a \"Sign in with Google\" button, a Google sign-in prompt or automatic sign-in if previously authorized.",
      "Apple Sign-In is a feature that enables you to privately sign in to participating third-party apps and websites using your Apple ID. It offers a fast, easy and more private way to authenticate without the need to create new accounts or remember additional passwords. To set up an account to \"Sign in with Apple,\" when a participating website or app asks you to set up or upgrade an account, do the following: Tap Sign in with Apple. Follow the onscreen instructions. Some apps (and websites) don\u2019t request your name and email address. In this case, you simply authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID (depending on your model), then start using the app.\u00a0Others may ask for your name and email address to set up a personalized account. When an app asks for this information, Sign in with Apple displays your name and the personal email address from your Apple Account for you to review.",
      "These methods rely on cryptographic keys or secure tokens, making it much harder for attackers to intercept your login information, even if they manage to trick you into visiting a malicious site.",

      "Astaroth shows just how far phishing kits have come, taking things beyond the usual tricks and bypassing 2FA with ease. It\u2019s a reminder that no matter how secure we think our systems are, there\u2019s always a smarter attack waiting to exploit the gaps. Cybercriminals are adapting fast, and while traditional defenses may not cut it anymore, there are still steps you can take to fight back: use passwordless logins, stay updated and keep learning about these evolving threats.",

      "\"I\u2019ve found myself trapped in a number of different true-crime stories, and the Manson murders are peculiar,\" Morris told Netflix's Tudum. \"You could encapsulate the mystery in just one question: How is it that Manson managed to convince the people around him that killing was OK?\"",

But was there this outside force that compelled him to do that? I don't believe that there was. There was still his personality that was distinct to him [and] was not created by an outside force.\"",

      "The government claims the changes aim to combat corruption and promote diversity, but critics argue it undermines Muslim rights and could lead to the confiscation of historic religious sites.",
      "Muslim groups and opposition parties have expressed concerns that the bill is politically motivated, and could marginalize Muslims by altering ownership rules and requiring waqf boards to validate property claims.",
      "India's parliament passed a controversial bill moved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist government to amend laws governing Muslim land endowments, while Muslim groups and opposition parties protested the move.",
      "The bill would add non-Muslims to boards that manage waqf land endowments and give the government a larger role in validating their land holdings. The government says the changes will help to fight corruption and mismanagement while promoting diversity, but critics fear that it will further undermine the rights of the country\u2019s Muslim minority and could be used to confiscate historic mosques and other property.",
      "The debate was heated in both houses of parliament. The Lower House debated it Wednesday through early Thursday, while in the Upper House, the fiery discussion lasted more than 16 hours into early Friday.",
      "The Congress-led opposition firmly opposed the proposal, calling it unconstitutional and discriminatory against Muslims. Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party lacks a majority in the Lower House, but its allies helped to pass the bill.",
      "MUSLIMS IN INDIA VOICE CONCERNS THAT NEW CITIZENSHIP LAW COULD FURTHER MARGINALIZE THEM",
      "In the Lower House, 288 members voted for the bill while 232 were against it. Similarly, 128 favored it and 95 voted against it in the Upper House. The bill will now be sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her assent to become law.",

      "Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju introduced the bill to change a 1995 law that set rules for the foundations and set up state-level boards to administer them.",
      "Many Muslim groups, as well as the opposition parties, say the proposal is discriminatory, politically motivated and an attempt by Modi\u2019s ruling party to weaken minority rights.",
      "The bill was first introduced in parliament last year, and opposition leaders have said some of their subsequent proposals for it were ignored. The government has said opposition parties are using rumors to discredit them and block transparency in managing the endowments.",
      "What\u2019s a waqf?",
      "Waqfs are a traditional type of Islamic charitable foundation in which a donor permanently sets aside property \u2014 often but not always real estate \u2014 for religious or charitable purposes. Waqf properties cannot be sold or transferred.",
      "Waqfs in India control 872,000 properties that cover 405,000 hectares (1 million acres) of land, worth an estimated $14.22 billion. Some of these endowments date back centuries, and many are used for mosques, seminaries, graveyards and orphanages.",
      "Law would change who runs waqfs",
      "In India, waqf property is managed by semi-official boards, one for each state and federally run union territory. The law would require non-Muslims to be appointed to the boards.",
      "Currently, waqf boards are staffed by Muslims, like similar bodies that help administer other religious charities.",
      "During the parliamentary debate, Home Minister Amit Shah said non-Muslims would be included in waqf boards only for administration purposes and to help run the endowments smoothly. He added that they were not there to interfere in religious affairs.",
      "\"The (non-Muslim) members will monitor whether the administration is running as per law or not, and whether the donations are being used for what they were intended or not,\" he said.",
      "Muslim groups, like The All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said such comments were against the fundamentals of Islamic endowments as such bodies necessarily need to be governed by Muslims only. The board said the bill was \"a blatant infringement on the constitutional rights of Muslim citizens\" and called on citizens to hit the streets against it.",
      "Mallikarjun Kharge, the Congress president, said, \"Why should waqf bodies allow non-Muslims as members when Hindu temple trusts don\u2019t allow people of other religions in their fold?\"",
      "One of the most controversial changes is to ownership rules, which could impact historical mosques, shrines, and graveyards, since many such properties lack formal documentation as they were donated without legal records decades, and even centuries, ago.",
      "Questions about title",
      "Other changes could impact mosques on land held in centuries-old waqfs.",
      "Radical Hindu groups have laid claim to several mosques around India, arguing they are built on the ruins of important Hindu temples. Many such cases are pending in courts.",
      "The law would require waqf boards to seek approval from a district level officer to confirm the waqfs\u2019 claims to property.",
      "Critics say that would undermine the board and could lead to Muslims being stripped of their land. It\u2019s not clear how often the boards would be asked to confirm such claims to land.",
      "\"The Waqf (Amendment) Bill is a weapon aimed at marginalizing Muslims and usurping their personal laws and property rights,\" Rahul Gandhi, the main opposition leader, wrote on social media platform X. He said the bill was an \"attack on the Constitution\" by the BJP and its allies \"aimed at Muslims today but sets a precedent to target other communities in the future.\"",
      "INDIA\u2019S RELIGIOUS DIVIDE CONTINUES TO WIDEN BETWEEN MUSLIM, HINDU COMMUNITY",
      "Fears among Muslims",
      "While many Muslims agree that waqfs suffer from corruption, encroachments and poor management, they also fear that the new law could give India\u2019s Hindu nationalist government far greater control over Muslim property, particularly at a time when attacks against minority communities have become more aggressive under Modi, with Muslims often targeted for everything from their food and clothing styles to inter-religious marriages.",
      "Last month, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said in its annual report that religious freedom conditions in India continued to deteriorate while Modi and his party \"propagated hateful rhetoric and disinformation against Muslims and other religious minorities\" during last year\u2019s election campaign.",
      "Modi\u2019s government says India is run on democratic principles of equality and no discrimination exists in the country.",
      "Muslims, who are 14% of India\u2019s 1.4 billion population, are the largest minority group in the Hindu-majority nation, but they are also the poorest, a 2013 government survey found.",

      "\"Erdogan is trying to reignite Turkey\u2019s influence in the region as a sort of neo-Ottoman power,\" said Ciddi. \"He sees Iran\u2019s proxies weakened, Russia overstretched, and is positioning Turkey to dominate the region \u2014 particularly through military footholds like the airbases.\"",

      "\"Erdogan wants to go to Trump and say, \u2018I\u2019m the big guy here. Leave Syria to me, just give me the F-35s,\u2019\" Ciddi said. \"But Israel sees this as a direct threat. Bombing the T-4 runway was a clear message: you\u2019re not welcome here.\"",

      "\"There ought to be some quiet discussions with Turkey about toning down the rhetoric about Israel \u2014 threats to destroy it, whether coming from the president or his son at rallies,\" said Edelman. \"There needs to be some kind of effort to deconflict over Syrian airspace.\"",

He intervenes directly, including inside Israel through Palestinian citizens and political activism.\"",

      "\"Israel has diplomatic ties with Turkey, but Erdogan keeps blocking meaningful security cooperation in NATO\" Golov added. \"Now that Turkey is moving south into Syria, we [Israel] need to escalate the rules of engagement. We can\u2019t allow Turkey to create a long-range air defense umbrella on our border.\"",
      "Golov said the current administration needs to understand that Erdogan's ambitions go beyond Syria. \"He wants to become a patron state, to control the skies, and to prevent Israeli operations by claiming we\u2019re violating Syrian sovereignty. But it\u2019s not about sovereignty \u2014 it\u2019s about power and shaping the new Middle East in Muslim Brotherhood colors.\"",

Erdogan doesn\u2019t care about international criticism or economic fallout \u2014 all he cares about is maintaining his regime. That\u2019s not strength, it\u2019s desperation.\"",

      "Boasberg pressed Ensign on who made the decision not to turn the planes around. \"I don't know that,\" Ensign replied.",
      "\"I'm certainly interested in finding that out because as we proceed with potential contempt proceedings, that may become relevant,\" the judge said.",

      "At an unrelated news conference Friday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi was asked if she \"was involved in the decision to defy\" Boasberg's order.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think anyone defied an order by a judge. That\u2019s pending in court right now,\" she said.",
      "On Tuesday, the parties will be back before Boasberg for arguments on the heart of the issue in the case \u2014 whether the Trump administration should be enjoined indefinitely from deporting alleged Tren de Aragua members under the AEA.",
      "The administration has already appealed his current restraining order to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging it infringes on the president's powers.",
      "Judge rules in favor of Maryland man deported to El Salvador",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis on Friday ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is a legal resident of Maryland, to be returned to the U.S. by Monday after a Justice Department lawyer acknowledged he should not have been sent to El Salvador.",
      "An immigration judge had specifically barred Garcia, who the government alleges is an MS-13 gang member, from being sent to El Salvador back in 2019, finding it \"more likely than not that he would be persecuted\" there.",
      "Xinis asked Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni why the administration couldn't ask El Salvador to return Garcia. Reuveni said he'd asked his client the same thing, and, \u201cI have not yet received an answer that I find satisfactory.\u201d",
      "Reuveni also said he did not know why Garcia had been arrested, how it was determined he would be sent to El Salvador or any details about the administration's deal with the prison there.",
      "\u201cThe government made a choice here to produce no evidence,\u201d he said.",
      "'Disingenuous' arguments in a California case",
      "A federal judge in California on Monday issued an order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from ending\u00a0Temporary Protected Status\u00a0for over 350,000 Venezuelan nationals.",
      "U.S. District Judge Edward Chen said the plaintiffs in the case are likely to succeed with their claims that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's \"unprecedented\" decision to bring an early end to their TPS protections \u2014 which allow them to live and work in the U.S. \u2014 is \"unauthorized by law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus.\"",
      "Noem had directed the TPS protections, which had been scheduled to expire late next year, to be terminated on April 7.",
      "The administration is appealing Chen's decision and separately asked him to stay his own ruling, arguing in part that ending the protections doesn't mean they'll be deported.",
      "\"[T]hat is a disingenuous argument,\" Chen wrote Friday, rejecting the administration's request for a stay.",
      "He noted that during an interview where she announced the decision, Noem said the \u201cpeople of this country want these dirtbags out.\u201d",
      "He said the \"entire point\" of Noem's early termination decision \"was to enable the removal of Venezuelan TPS holders on a schedule well in advance of the schedule set\" by her predecessor, Alejandro Mayorkas.",
      "\"Nor has the government stated that, if the Court were to stay its postponement order, it will not immediately move forward with the removal of any Venezuelan TPS holder,\" Chen added.",
      "He pointed to the administration's acknowledgement in the AEA case that one of the deportees shouldn't have been removed as another reason not to pause his ruling.",
      "The \"government mistakenly deported an individual, who has legal status to be in the United States, to El Salvador but has essentially taken the position that it cannot do anything to address that mistake,\" the judge wrote, showing any removal in his case\u00a0\"likely could not be 'undone' should Plaintiffs ultimately prevail.\"",
      "'Inaccurate' claims",
      "The Justice Department also sought a stay from a federal judge in Washington, D.C., asking her to pause her preliminary injunction barring the administration from shuttering the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson's March 28 decision granting the injunction included some harsh words for the administration, finding its claims it wasn't trying to close the agency \"unreliable.\"",
      "The government's \"eleventh hour attempt to suggest immediately before the hearing that the stop work order was not really a stop work order at all was so disingenuous that the Court is left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell the truth about anything,\" Jackson wrote then.",
      "She was similarly unimpressed Thursday with its arguments for a stay of her order.",
      "\"[T]heir description of the Order is at odds with the terms of the Order, and their description of the ruling that prompted it is inaccurate as well,\" she wrote, denying the request.",
      "That same day, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the government a partial temporary stay of the order.",
      "\"The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,\" the ruling said.",
      "Supreme victory",
      "The Supreme Court gave the administration some relief late Friday by allowing it to terminate education grants for teacher training that administration officials view as violating Trump's policy opposing\u00a0diversity, equity and inclusion\u00a0efforts.",
      "The 5-4 decision blocked a Massachusetts-based judge\u2019s ruling that found the administration hadn't followed the correct legal process in terminating the grants.",
      "The appeal was one of three the administration submitted to the high court with last week, including the Alien Enemies Act case."

    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 17:42:42 GMT",
    "summary": "While manufacturers of FDA-approved injectable pentobarbital are warning states not to use the sedative in executions, some states are still buying it \u2014 and paying top dollar.",
    "story": [
      "A discreet delivery pulled up outside of Idaho\u2019s maximum-security prison near Boise in the state\u2019s exhaustive quest for lethal injection drugs 1 1\u20442 years ago. Just outside of the prison gates, the warden said he met two people transporting pentobarbital \u2014 six vials of the liquid placed into cardboard boxes in the back seat of their car.",
      "Then, four months later, the warden arranged another pickup, meeting two people parked on a rural intersection at Pleasant Valley and Ten Mile Creek roads, about a mile from the Idaho Maximum Security Institution.",
      "The warden, Tim Richardson, would recall in a deposition in October that he chose to take the second transaction \u201coff site\u201d so as \u201cto not draw attention to it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so you cannot have, I guess, a visual on what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he said, according to a transcript.",
      "The details of the deal, revealed for the first time in court documents related to litigation in the cases of two death row inmates, Thomas Creech and Gerald Pizzuto, shed light on how Idaho procured its batches of lethal injection drugs while attempting to maintain confidentiality.",
      "Creech, 74, who was convicted of five murders in three states, was set to die by lethal injection in February 2024, but it was called off after prison staff failed to properly attach IV lines after 42 minutes. The botched execution has prompted a legal dispute to prevent the state from attempting it again.",
      "Pizzuto, 69, convicted of four murders in two states, faced execution in March 2023, but a federal judge halted it. Pizzuto is challenging the state\u2019s use of pentobarbital because of his medical condition, which Pizzuto\u2019s legal team says includes advanced bladder cancer.",
      "In court documents reviewed by NBC News, just as notable is what Richardson, now a warden at a different Idaho prison facility, was ordered by lawyers representing the state Department of Correction not to answer \u2014 including the identities of those who provided the drugs, if they were the same people each time and the type of vehicles they used.",
      "A 2022 Idaho law shields the identities of the state\u2019s execution team and the suppliers of lethal injection drugs. Correction officials say such secrecy makes it easier to obtain pentobarbital, given how the state has been unable to execute anyone since 2012 amid a nationwide shortage of lethal injection drugs. Idaho in 2023 also legalized execution by firing squad when it cannot obtain drugs.",
      "Meanwhile, major pharmaceutical companies have explicitly warned states not to use their drugs for executions, citing ethical and legal concerns. Pharmaceutical distributors may buy drugs from the companies, and they could in turn be sold to hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and other legitimate customers.",
      "But when it comes to supplying prisons that may want to use a manufactured drug for executions, drug companies have sued states for the return of their chemicals.",
      "\u201cWhat we know at this point is that every single drug manufacturer of any drug that could be potentially used for lethal injection, including pentobarbital, has not only objected to its use, but put contractual restrictions on their sales,\u201d said Corinna Barrett Lain, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law who studies lethal injection executions. \u201cThey have every right to do so as a private company that stands to lose a great deal of money if their drugs are used in lethal injection. They are risking the possibility of botched executions with their drugs, leading them to potential financial and legal damages. It\u2019s terrible for business.\u201d",
      "The Idaho Department of Correction did not immediately respond to a request for comment about where its most recent pentobarbital purchases came from. The state attorney general\u2019s office declined to comment this week, citing the pending litigation.",
      "Like other states, Idaho has turned to so-called compounding pharmacies for its lethal injection drugs, doing so for executions in 2011 and 2012. But the alternative has drawn concerns over quality and safety as compounded drugs are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "In the court filings, Idaho correction officials have suggested the pentobarbital procured by the state in 2023 and 2024 was not compounded but manufactured by an FDA-approved pharmaceutical company.",
      "\u201cMy belief is that they probably were\u201d manufactured, Richardson said in his deposition about the October 2023 delivery he received, adding, \u201cThey were in, like, an original-type manufacturer\u2019s box.\u201d",
      "He agreed that the second delivery he acquired during a roadside meeting in February 2024 was the same.",
      "In another court filing in October, the Idaho Maximum Security Institution\u2019s current warden, Randy Valley, described the state\u2019s supply of pentobarbital as having been sourced from \u201can FDA-approved manufacturer,\u201d and revealed the state received a new batch of \u201csix additional 2.5-gram vials of certified manufactured pentobarbital\u201d that same month.",
      "Court documents indicate the state has spent $200,000 in total for three separate purchases of pentobarbital, supplies that all expired after going unused in the wake of Creech\u2019s failed execution.",
      "In exhibits filed in Pizzuto\u2019s case, two pharmaceutical companies that manufacture injectable pentobarbital \u2014 Hikma, whose U.S. headquarters are in New Jersey, and Sagent, which is based in Illinois \u2014 sent letters to Idaho officials demanding they ensure that their drugs are not used in executions.",
      "Hikma spokesman Steven Weiss told NBC News on Friday that it has sent such letters to Idaho and other states every year for the past eight years \u201cto firmly remind them of and our strong objections to the use of our medicines in capital punishment.\u201d",
      "Weiss added that the company was able to determine that the medicines purchased by Idaho \"were not ours,\" because \u201cthere\u2019s information on the invoice that enables us to determine whether or not it was manufactured by us.\u201d",
      "Sagent did not respond to requests for comment about whether its drugs may have been purchased by the state.",
      "In letters last year to Idaho officials, the drugmaker said it \u201creserves the right to take legal action\u201d if it learns Idaho did not comply, and warned that if its \u201cproducts are diverted from legitimate channels, in violation of our distribution controls, they risk being counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful.\u201d",
      "The company also sent an email to the attorney general with the subject line: \u201cURGENT: Request Seeking Return of Pentobarbital Purchased for Capital Punishment Purposes.\u201d",
      "According to a court filing last month in Pizzuto\u2019s case, Josh Tewalt, the former director of the Idaho Department of Correction, declined to \u201cadmit\u201d or deny\u201d whether the department had obtained execution drugs manufactured by a company that opposes the use of its products in executions, citing the state\u2019s right to protect its sources.",
      "Tewalt, the agency\u2019s longtime director, denied the state would use expired chemicals for an execution. He left the agency for a private-sector job last month and did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In clinical settings, pentobarbital can be used for insomnia or to treat seizures in humans, while veterinarians use it as an anesthetic or to euthanize animals.",
      "But in executions, a potent dose of the sedative can cause death from respiratory failure, and for over a decade, it has become a go-to for states seeking to avoid the typical three-drug protocol. Indiana carried out its first execution in 15 years in December after having purchased pentobarbital for $900,000. The drug vendor and the amount of the drug were redacted from public records under the state\u2019s shield law.",
      "Tennessee next month is also planning to conduct its first lethal injection execution since 2019, after having bought pentobarbital in recent years for nearly $600,000 from an undisclosed supplier, according to reports.",
      "Utah bought pentobarbital for its last execution in 2024. Randall Honey, the state\u2019s chief of prison operations, said in a court filing last summer that Utah initially had difficulty obtaining the drug, but that someone who had read news reports contacted officials and put them in touch with a supplier asking $200,000. The drug was \u201cmanufactured, not compounded,\u201d but was paid for in \u201can appropriate and legal way,\u201d according to Honey.",
      "Such high costs were noted in court documents in Creech\u2019s case last fall, in which Michaela Almgren, a clinical associate professor at the University of South Carolina\u2019s College of Pharmacy, wrote that Idaho\u2019s purchase of a six-vial batch of pentobarbital at $50,000 was more than three times the cost on the wholesale market. She also said at the time that only Hikma and Sagent were making injectable pentobarbital at the size and strength that Idaho had obtained.",
      "It \u201craises the question of the legitimacy of the supplier, since the price of the drug vials is so severely inflated,\u201d said Almgren, on behalf of Creech\u2019s legal team, according to the court document. \u201cA drug supplier who marks prices 2-3 times higher than expected may be viewed as suspicious or illegitimate, leading to concerns about ethical practices and even regulatory compliance.\u201d",
      "Pizzuto\u2019s lawyers suggested in a court filing last week that it appears \u201cthe same profit-seeking actor is roaming the country selling pentobarbital to desperate correctional departments at huge markups.\u201d",
      "At the least, someone is profiting at the apparent expense of manufacturers who say they are against their drugs being used for executions, said Lain, the author of the upcoming book \u201cSecrets of the Killing State: The Untold Story of Lethal Injection.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe states\u2019 narrative is, \u2018Oh, we need secrecy to protect drug suppliers,\u2019\u201d Lain said. \u201cStates are using secrecy to violate. Who are you protecting? Because you\u2019re not protecting pharmaceutical manufacturers.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe state has to follow the law,\u201d she added. \u201cIt has to be different than the criminals that they are executing.\u201d"

    "summary": "Bird flu cases could rise as birds migrate north. But the sweeping cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services include workers focused on the virus.",
    "story": [
      "The outbreak of bird flu that has been ravaging farms nationwide had started to slow over the past few weeks \u2014 but as wild birds migrate north, scientists say the virus may follow.",
      "At the same time, the United States will have fewer people leading the national effort to stop avian influenza.",
      "The sweeping cuts this week to the federal Department of Health and Human Services include the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s chief medical officer, who was helping to lead the federal government\u2019s bird flu response, and senior staff from the FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine, which linked bird flu cases to raw pet food, leading to several recalls.",
      "\u201cWe no longer are going to have the same eyes on this virus,\u201d said Dr. Meghan Davis, a former dairy veterinarian and associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She said active surveillance of and investigation into how the virus spreads are a necessity, but local health officials and veterinarians will no longer have the same support from the federal government.",
      "The ongoing outbreak of bird flu \u2014 the worst in U.S. history \u2014 picked up steam through the fall and winter, pushing egg prices to record highs. While outbreaks in both poultry and cattle have fallen, along with the average price of eggs, health experts say that cases could rise again amid the spring migration, which typically peaks in May and June in the continental U.S.",
      "Quantifying the scope of bird flu in the U.S. is complicated. The number of confirmed outbreaks in poultry fell to 53 flocks last month after reaching 133 flocks in January. Outbreaks in cattle fell to 21 herds last month, after peaking at 253 in November. Detections in other mammals, wild birds and humans are tracked separately. And the 168 million domestic birds affected so far include many slaughtered because any detection on a poultry farm requires culling all the birds on the premises.",
      "The current outbreak has also been notoriously difficult to predict and contain, jumping to cattle for the first time last year and spreading to other species. Limited data on cases and testing has made it even harder to track the virus\u2019s spread and evolution, experts said, which could mean the virus could surge and new variants could emerge with little warning.",
      "\u201cWe cannot let our guard down \u2014 now is not the time to do that,\u201d said Stacey Schultz-Cherry, an influenza researcher at St. Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s Research Hospital.",
      "Wild birds are a major pathway for the virus when they land and mingle with domestic animals. Schultz-Cherry warned that the birds currently migrating northward might introduce new variants of the virus from South America to the U.S., giving the virus more opportunities to evolve in potentially dangerous ways. \u201cThat\u2019s what we worry about \u2014 is this something new?\u201d",
      "Variants of concern have already been emerging. In March, the U.S. confirmed the detection of a bird flu variant known as H7N9 on a Mississippi poultry farm. It was the first time since 2017 that the strain \u2014 which is especially deadly to humans \u2014 had been detected in a commercial U.S. poultry flock. In January, another variant linked to a handful of severe and fatal human infections was found in U.S. cattle for the first time.",
      "This week, more than 140 staff members from the FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine, which oversees animal food and medicine, were among the roughly\u00a010,000 staff\u00a0terminated from the Department of Health and Human Services, according to Alex Saint, who was an FDA communications specialist until she, too, was terminated. The cuts are part of the Trump administration\u2019s broader effort to shrink the federal government.",
      "The FDA has become increasingly involved in the bird flu response as the virus has spread beyond birds. More than 120 domestic cats have been infected with bird flu since 2022, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department, and FDA staff helped link some of the cases to raw pet food.",
      "The agency also helped to develop better diagnostic tests for the virus and has conducted extensive bird flu studies showing that pasteurization effectively inactivated the virus, making milk products safe for consumption.",
      "Already, the staff cuts prompted the FDA to suspend an effort to improve testing of pet food and dairy products for bird flu, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak to the media and who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing short of devastating to veterinary medicine,\u201d said Dr. K. Fred Gingrich II, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, which represents cow veterinarians. \u201cThey were absolutely critical \u2014 not just for the bird flu response, but for developing protocols for research and drug development.\u201d",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement that the cuts were limited to administrative staff and intended \u201cto make the agency more efficient and responsive.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe FDA and HHS continue to prioritize public health and animal health, including ongoing efforts to monitor and respond\" to bird flu, the agency added.",
      "In February, the USDA\u00a0accidentally fired officials\u00a0working on bird flu and then moved to rehire them. Later that month, the agency announced\u00a0a $1 billion effort\u00a0to combat the virus and lower egg prices.",
      "The risk remains low to the public, with 70 confirmed human cases in the U.S. and one death. But the unchecked spread of bird flu increases the chances that the virus could mutate into a strain that is far more deadly to humans and easily transmissible among them.",
      "Experts warn that the broader Department of Health and Human Services cuts also could hamper the country\u2019s ability to track and contain the virus among both humans and animals, particularly when outbreaks spread across state lines."

      "The U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York argued in a court filing Friday that a significant sentence was warranted because the New York Republican\u2019s \u201cunparalleled crimes\u201d had \u201cmade a mockery\u201d of the country\u2019s election system.",
      "\u201cFrom his creation of a wholly fictitious biography to his callous theft of money from elderly and impaired donors, Santos\u2019s unrestrained greed and voracious appetite for fame enabled him to exploit the very system by which we select our representatives,\u201d the office wrote.",
      "Prosecutors also argued that Santos had been \u201cunrepentant and defiant\u201d for years, dismissing the prosecution as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and refusing to resign from Congress as his web of lies was debunked.",
      "They said his claims of remorse after pleading guilty \u201cring hollow\u201d and suggested he has a \u201chigh likelihood of reoffending\u201d given he has not forfeited any of his ill-gotten gains or repaid any of his victims.",
      "Santos\u2019 lawyers, in an email to The Associated Press, dismissed the seven-year proposal as \u201cabsurd and unfounded,\u201d saying it appears \u201cdesigned to beat up on a man that already took full responsibility for his actions.\u201d",
      "In their own sentencing memo Friday, they rejected the notion that Santos will fall back into criminal behavior, noting he has no prior criminal record and also provides \u201ccrucial\u201d support to his sister and her young daughter.",
      "They argued for a two-year prison term, which is the mandatory minimum sentence for aggravated identity theft.",
      "The lawyers maintain such a sentence is in line with those handed to\u00a0former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.\u00a0and other political figures facing similar financial crimes.",
      "They also touted Santos\u2019 cooperation in a separate federal investigation into a Texas man who\u00a0tried to dupe Santos\u00a0out of nearly $1 million by posing as a political fixer offering to destroy evidence in his cases.",
      "\u201cThis sentence, coupled with the significant collateral consequences Mr. Santos has already suffered\u2014including the loss of his congressional seat and public humiliation \u2014 would send a clear message that such conduct will not be tolerated,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",
      "A federal judge on Long Island is scheduled to decide Santos\u2019 sentence during a court hearing April 25.",
      "The once-rising Republican, who represented parts of Queens and Long Island, served barely a year in office before he was ousted by his House colleagues in 2023, just the sixth congressperson ever expelled in the chamber\u2019s history.",
      "Santos\u2019 political demise came after it was revealed that he had fabricated much of his life story, leading to\u00a0questions\u00a0about how the political unknown had funded his winning campaign.",
      "The now-36-year-old cast himself as a wealthy businessman who had graduated from top colleges, worked at prestigious Wall Street firms and held a valuable real estate portfolio. In truth, he was struggling financially and faced eviction.",
      "Santos\u00a0admitted\u00a0in August that he duped voters, deceived donors and stole the identities of nearly a dozen people, including his own family members, to make donations to his congressional campaign.",
      "He was initially due to be sentenced in February, but a judge granted him a\u00a0three-month reprieve\u00a0to come up with more than half a million dollars in court fines.",
      "As part of his plea deal, Santos agreed to pay nearly $375,000 in restitution and $205,000 in forfeiture.",
      "Santos\u2019 lawyers said at the time that he had little more than $1,000 in liquid assets and needed more time to build his newly launched podcast \u201cPants on Fire\u201d in order to begin paying off the debt.",
      "Prosecutors maintain Santos profited handsomely from his infamy, arguing he has earned more than $800,000 from\u00a0appearances on the video-sharing website Cameo\u00a0and from a new documentary since his expulsion from Congress.",
      "Two of Santos\u2019 campaign staffers have also pleaded guilty to federal charges in connection to the campaign financing scheme.",
      "Sam Miele, his former campaign fundraiser, was\u00a0sentenced in March\u00a0to one year and one day in federal prison. He admitted to impersonating a high-ranking congressional aide and charging donors\u2019 credit cards without authorization while raising campaign cash for Santos.",
      "Nancy Marks, Santos\u2019 former campaign treasurer, admitted to filing bogus campaign finance reports filled with fake donors and a fake $500,000 personal loan from Santos himself.",
      "The embellishments helped the campaign hit fundraising thresholds needed to qualify for financial backing from the national Republican Party. Marks is due to be sentenced in May."

      "Mass General Brigham Newton-Wellesley Hospital said that in total, 11 employees from the fifth-floor maternity unit identified health concerns. Five had brain tumors, all of which are benign. Two of those have the most common, benign type \u2014 meningioma, according to the hospital in Newton, Massachusetts, which is about 10 miles west of Boston.",
      "\u201cThe investigation found no environmental risks which could be linked to the development of a brain tumor,\u201d the hospital\u2019s Jonathan Sonis, associate chief medical officer, and Sandy Muse, chief nursing officer, said in a statement.",
      "The hospital said its investigation was completed in collaboration with government health and safety officials and it considered multiple possible sources. It ruled out disposable masks, the water supply, nearby x-rays, and chemotherapy treatment on the floor below, the hospital said.",
      "\u201cBased on these results, we can confidently reassure our dedicated team ... and all our patients that there is no environmental risk at our facility,\" the administrators said.",
      "The Massachusetts Nurses Association, the union that bargains for nurses' compensation at Newton-Wellesley Hospital, said it will continue to investigate.",
      "\"Right now, the best way we can help is to complete an independent, scientific investigation,\" MNA spokesperson Joe Markman said in a statement Friday. \"That effort is underway and may take additional weeks.\"",
      "The union indicated that nurses came forward with workplace health concerns, which led to the discovery of those with tumors.",
      "\u201cThe hospital only spoke to a small number of nurses, and their environmental testing was not comprehensive,\u201d he said in his statement. \u201cThe hospital cannot make this issue go away by attempting to provide a predetermined conclusion.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for a state agency was unable to provide conclusive information on the matter by deadline. Federal occupational health and safety officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The American Cancer Society says that in order to meet the definition of a cancer cluster, occurrences must be the same type, in the same area, with the same cause, and affecting a number of people that's \"greater than expected\" when a baseline for occurrences is established.",
      "\u201cNearly 4 out of 10 people in the United States will develop cancer during their lifetimes,\" the society said on its cancer clusters webpage. \"So, it\u2019s not uncommon for several people in a relatively small area to develop cancer around the same time.\""

      "Americans nearing retirement and recent retirees said they were  anxious and frustrated following a second day of market turmoil that hit their 401(k)s after President Donald Trump\u2019s escalation of tariffs.",
      "As the impending tariffs shook the global economy Friday, people who were planning on their retirement accounts to carry them through their golden years said the economic chaos was hitting too close to home.",
      "Some said they are pausing big-ticket purchases and reconsidering home renovations, while others said they fear their quality of life will be adversely affected by all the turmoil.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just kind of stunned, and with so much money in the market, we just sort of have to hope we have enough time to recover,\u201d said Paula, 68, a former occupational health professional in New Jersey who retired three years ago.",
      "Paula, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she feared retaliation for speaking out against Trump administration policies, said she was worried about what lies ahead.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been doing is trying to enjoy the time that we have, but you want to be able to make it last,\u201d Paula said Friday. \u201cI have no confidence here.\u201d",
      "Trump fulfilled his campaign promise this week to unleash sweeping tariffs, including on the United States\u2019 largest trading partners, in\u00a0a move that has sparked fears of a global trade war. The decision sent the stock market spinning. On Friday afternoon, the broad-based S&P 500 closed down 6%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 5.8%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 2,200 points, or about 5.5%.",
      "As Wall Street reeled Friday after China hit back with tariffs against the U.S., millions of Americans with 401(k)s watched their retirement funds diminish along with the stock market.",
      "\u201cI looked at my 401(k) this morning and in the last two days that\u2019s lost $58,000. That\u2019s stressful,\u201d said Victor Fettes, 54, of Georgia, who retired last week as a senior director of risk management and compliance at Verizon. \u201cIf that continues, I can\u2019t stay retired.\u201d",
      "Trump has said the tariffs will force businesses to relocate manufacturing and production back to the U.S. and bring back jobs. Some investors and business groups have pushed back, saying they are likely to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers.",
      "\u201cOur country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,\u201d Trump said recently. \u201cBut it is not going to happen anymore.\u201d",
      "The president has acknowledged the potential pain coming to some Americans\u2019 wallets, but he continues to staunchly defend his agenda.",
      "\u201cMY POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE,\u201d he posted to social media Friday. Later, he wrote, \u201cONLY THE WEAK WILL FAIL.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs are steeper and more widespread than any in modern American history. They are potentially even broader than the tariffs of 1930 that historians said worsened the Great Depression.",
      "Some Americans thinking about retirement told NBC News they feel their economic stability is being played with.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to worry that everyone is constantly changing my financial reality,\u201d said Alison Carey, 64, of Oregon, a freelancer in the theater industry. \u201cLet the economy do its machinations, but don\u2019t put me in the gears.\u201d",
      "Paula said she and other older Americans are living with \u201canxiety about something where you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen. You can\u2019t do anything though.\u201d",
      "She and her husband have decided to pause and reduce spending on big-ticket items. They are reconsidering vacations and home renovations.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t change anything right now, except our spending,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are consumers across the board that want to be cautious, too. Then it becomes a vicious cycle. Consumer confidence goes down.\u201d",
      "One in five Americans age 50 and over have no retirement savings, and more than half, 61%, are worried they will not have enough money to support them in retirement, according to a survey published by the AARP last April.",
      "\u201cIt makes you realize how out of touch the current administration is with regular people,\u201d said Benajah Cobb, 63, Carey\u2019s husband, who also works in the theater industry.",
      "He said he hoped the last few days of stock market turmoil would motivate lawmakers to put more checks and balances on the president.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s happening so quickly. Things are falling apart so quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping Congress will try to step up a bit, the Republicans in Congress.\u201d",

      "More than a dozen other states and Washington, D.C. are dealing with cases of measles unrelated to Texas.",
      "On Friday, the Texas Department of State Health Services said the toll rose to 481 confirmed cases, a 14% jump over last week. Fifty-six people have been hospitalized in the area since the disease started spreading in late January.",
      "At the Tiny Tots U Learning Academy, a center with approximately 230 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, the outbreak began on March 24, when a little girl who had been sick with fever and vomiting tested positive. She later needed to be hospitalized for pneumonia and trouble breathing.",
      "Kids who have tested positive at the day care so far are between the ages of 5 months and 3 years old, said Maegan Messick, a co-owner of the center. None was fully vaccinated against measles.",
      "For nearly two weeks, Messick has been working with local health officials who are in contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the situation.

      "The U.S. is facing the largest measles outbreak in six years, but the CDC has remained relatively silent on the public health threat, providing just weekly updates on its website and sending an alert to doctors last month. The agency sent 2,000 doses of the MMR vaccine to Texas health officials at their request, but hasn't held a news briefing about measles since 2019, when\u00a0two large outbreaks in New York\u00a0threatened to reverse the United States\u2019 status of having eliminated the virus.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which is over CDC, did not respond Friday to a question about whether any briefings were in the works to address the current measles outbreak.",
      "It was unclear whether mass layoffs at HHS and CDC this week might stymie such efforts. But steep funding cuts to community health departments announced last week have already forced some areas to cancel vaccine clinics.",
      "Dallas County, for example, had to cancel more than 50 clinics. Many had been planned for schools in areas with low vaccination rates.",
      "According to an NBC News tally, 628 measles cases have been reported nationally in 2025. Other states with outbreaks include Kansas with 23 cases, Oklahoma with 10 cases, and New Mexico with 54 cases. Public health officials in Ohio have identified 17.",

      "They\u2019re also urging other child care facilities to encourage their families to get the MMR vaccine. Families who choose not to vaccinate their children have been asked to keep them home for at least 21 days.",
      "Two doses are almost always enough to give lifetime protection against measles, according to the CDC. Unvaccinated people who are exposed to the virus are almost certain to become infected.",
      "The first dose isn\u2019t usually given until after a child\u2019s first birthday, but can be offered early, at 6 months.",

But that means the move could be challenged later, and it could potentially blow up the bill if the parliamentarian rules against it \u2014 unless the Senate votes to overrule her, which some have likened to nuking the 60-vote filibuster rule.",
      "A handful of Republicans have concerns that they will be asked to do that later in the process.",
      "Another senator, Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he has \u201ca big concern\u201d about the bill slashing Medicaid \u2014 and took his concerns directly to Trump in a phone call Thursday evening before the vote.",
      "Twenty-one percent \u201cof my state receives Medicaid \u2014 CHIP or Medicaid. So, I\u2019ve made clear I\u2019m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts. And I thought the president\u2019s assurance to me tonight was completely unequivocal,\u201d Hawley added, saying that assurance made him comfortable voting to begin the process.",
      "That\u2019s easier said than done. The House-approved budget, which Trump endorsed, makes it mathematically impossible for Republicans to achieve their targets without cutting Medicare or Medicaid. Lawmakers say they want to cut waste and fraud, along with imposing a potential work requirement for Medicaid. Beyond that, they haven\u2019t identified ways to reduce spending.",
      "Three questions about Trump\u2019s tariffs",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping new tariffs have rattled the markets and raised new concerns about potential price hikes. While Trump campaigned on implementing tariffs, more questions remain as they take effect.",
      "First, how will the Trump administration explain the tariffs to the American public?",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand what the plan is, what the strategy is,\u201d former Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., told \u201cMeet the Press NOW\u201d on Thursday, later adding: \u201cThere are Republicans on the Hill who are wondering: Where are we going?\u201d",
      "Another key question: What will the economic fallout look like?",
      "Trump warned that his trade policies would cause a \u201clittle disturbance\u201d in his speech to Congress last month. And we\u2019re already seeing markets rattled by the new tariffs, raising questions about the possibility of a national \u2014 or even global \u2014 recession.",
      "Some Republicans have indicated that the administration may need to rethink its policies if they result in an economic downturn.",
      "\u201cIf they make things better, they should want more; if it makes things worse, they should want to recalibrate,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told our Capitol Hill team on Wednesday.",
      "And lastly: When are Americans going to reap the benefits of this trade policy?",
      "Trump told me back in December that he \u201ccan\u2019t guarantee\u201d American families will not pay more, later adding that tariffs \u201care going to make us rich.\u201d",
      "The president also said on Air Force One last night that it could take \u201ca year and a half to two years\u201d to ramp up American manufacturing. But the administration has yet to lay out exactly when everyday Americans will start to benefit from these tariffs.",
      "We\u2019ll delve into these questions and more on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this Sunday with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Sen. Jim Lankford, R-Okla., and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.",
      "I also talked to our friends over at NBCU Academy about how I prepare for a \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview. Check out the video here!",

      "Judges showed some frustration this week with how the Trump administration has been defending itself in court, with one saying it appeared to have used \"bad faith\" tactics, another accusing it of using \"disingenuous\" arguments and a third saying it was making \"inaccurate\" claims.",
      "One of the judges, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, suggested he might hold contempt proceedings to hold the government to account for failing to comply with his orders.",
      "In a separate but related case, a federal judge in Maryland on Friday ordered the government to return a deportee it acknowledged was accidentally sent to a\u00a0notorious megajail\u00a0in El Salvador.",
      "The week ended with a major win for the administration, when the Supreme Court allowed it to terminate\u00a0Education Department grants that a lower court had restored. It was the first time during President Donald Trump's second administration that the Supreme Court sided with him.",
      "Here's a look at some of the biggest legal developments of the week:",
      "'The government acted in bad faith'",
      "At a hearing Thursday, Boasberg demanded detailed answers about the administration's failure to comply with his order halting deportations under Trump's invocation of the rarely used Alien Enemies Act.",
      "He didn't get them.",
      "After Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Immigration Drew Ensign told him \"it is our position that the actions of the government complied\" with his two restraining orders barring alleged Venezuelan gang members from being flown out of the country on March 15, the judge let his frustration show.",
      "\"OK. So it seems to me that there is a fair likelihood that that is not correct, and in fact, that the government acted in bad faith throughout that day,\" Boasberg said.",
      "\"If you really believed everything you did that day was legal and could survive a court challenge, I can't believe you ever would have operated in the way you did,\" he added.",
      "He also referenced the deportation of a Maryland man who the administration acknowledged was mistakenly sent to El Salvador.",
      "\"So what you were willing to do by trying to do this as quickly as possible and avoid being enjoined by the court was to risk putting people on those planes who shouldn\u2019t have been on the planes in the first place,\" Boasberg said later in the hearing.",
      "The judge noted that Trump had signed the AEA on Friday, March 14, but didn't make it public until Saturday afternoon, when preparations to ship the deportees to a prison in El Salvador were already underway.",
      "He suggested the timing was intentional, so the deportees could be \"removed from the country before it was possible to challenge it legally.\"",
      "Ensign said, \"I don't have any information on that.\"",
      "The lawyers for the plaintiffs, who all deny that they're members of the gang, got wind of the executive order on March 14 and filed suit overnight to block the deportations. Boasberg ordered an emergency hearing for that Saturday afternoon.",
      "During that hearing, the judge ordered any deportations under the AEA to be temporarily halted, and directed that any flights that were underway be returned to the U.S. Ensign said at the time he was not aware of any, a position he reiterated Thursday.",
      "\u201cI had no knowledge from my client that was the case,\u201d Ensign said, and \u201cI made diligent efforts to obtain that information\u201d from the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department.",
      "It was later revealed that two such flights were in the air at the time. The government has refused to release details on the exact timing, labeling it a \"state secret.\" The Justice Department lawyers claimed the flights were out of U.S. airspace at the time, and therefore didn't have to return.",
      "Boasberg pressed Ensign on who made the decision not to turn the planes around. \"I don't know that,\" Ensign replied.",
      "\"I'm certainly interested in finding that out because as we proceed with potential contempt proceedings, that may become relevant,\" the judge said.",
      "He said he'll likely issue an order on whether there's\u00a0probable cause to find the government in contempt next week.",
      "At an unrelated news conference Friday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi was asked if she \"was involved in the decision to defy\" Boasberg's order.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think anyone defied an order by a judge. That\u2019s pending in court right now,\" she said.",
      "On Tuesday, the parties will be back before Boasberg for arguments on the heart of the issue in the case \u2014 whether the Trump administration should be enjoined indefinitely from deporting alleged Tren de Aragua members under the AEA.",
      "The administration has already appealed his current restraining order to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging it infringes on the president's powers.",
      "Judge rules in favor of Maryland man deported to El Salvador",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis on Friday ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is a legal resident of Maryland, to be returned to the U.S. by Monday after a Justice Department lawyer acknowledged he should not have been sent to El Salvador.",
      "An immigration judge had specifically barred Garcia, who the government alleges is an MS-13 gang member, from being sent to El Salvador back in 2019, finding it \"more likely than not that he would be persecuted\" there.",
      "Xinis asked Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni why the administration couldn't ask El Salvador to return Garcia. Reuveni said he'd asked his client the same thing, and, \u201cI have not yet received an answer that I find satisfactory.\u201d",
      "Reuveni also said he did not know why Garcia had been arrested, how it was determined he would be sent to El Salvador or any details about the administration's deal with the prison there.",
      "\u201cThe government made a choice here to produce no evidence,\u201d he said.",
      "'Disingenuous' arguments in a California case",
      "A federal judge in California on Monday issued an order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from ending\u00a0Temporary Protected Status\u00a0for over 350,000 Venezuelan nationals.",
      "U.S. District Judge Edward Chen said the plaintiffs in the case are likely to succeed with their claims that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's \"unprecedented\" decision to bring an early end to their TPS protections \u2014 which allow them to live and work in the U.S. \u2014 is \"unauthorized by law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus.\"",
      "Noem had directed the TPS protections, which had been scheduled to expire late next year, to be terminated on April 7.",
      "The administration is appealing Chen's decision and separately asked him to stay his own ruling, arguing in part that ending the protections doesn't mean they'll be deported.",
      "\"[T]hat is a disingenuous argument,\" Chen wrote Friday, rejecting the administration's request for a stay.",
      "He noted that during an interview where she announced the decision, Noem said the \u201cpeople of this country want these dirtbags out.\u201d",
      "He said the \"entire point\" of Noem's early termination decision \"was to enable the removal of Venezuelan TPS holders on a schedule well in advance of the schedule set\" by her predecessor, Alejandro Mayorkas.",
      "\"Nor has the government stated that, if the Court were to stay its postponement order, it will not immediately move forward with the removal of any Venezuelan TPS holder,\" Chen added.",
      "He pointed to the administration's acknowledgement in the AEA case that one of the deportees shouldn't have been removed as another reason not to pause his ruling.",
      "The \"government mistakenly deported an individual, who has legal status to be in the United States, to El Salvador but has essentially taken the position that it cannot do anything to address that mistake,\" the judge wrote, showing any removal in his case\u00a0\"likely could not be 'undone' should Plaintiffs ultimately prevail.\"",
      "'Inaccurate' claims",
      "The Justice Department also sought a stay from a federal judge in Washington, D.C., asking her to pause her preliminary injunction barring the administration from shuttering the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson's March 28 decision granting the injunction included some harsh words for the administration, finding its claims it wasn't trying to close the agency \"unreliable.\"",
      "The government's \"eleventh hour attempt to suggest immediately before the hearing that the stop work order was not really a stop work order at all was so disingenuous that the Court is left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell the truth about anything,\" Jackson wrote then.",
      "She was similarly unimpressed Thursday with its arguments for a stay of her order.",
      "\"[T]heir description of the Order is at odds with the terms of the Order, and their description of the ruling that prompted it is inaccurate as well,\" she wrote, denying the request.",
      "That same day, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the government a partial temporary stay of the order.",
      "\"The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,\" the ruling said.",
      "Supreme victory",
      "The Supreme Court gave the administration some relief late Friday by allowing it to terminate education grants for teacher training that administration officials view as violating Trump's policy opposing\u00a0diversity, equity and inclusion\u00a0efforts.",
      "The 5-4 decision blocked a Massachusetts-based judge\u2019s ruling that found the administration hadn't followed the correct legal process in terminating the grants.",
      "The appeal was one of three the administration submitted to the high court with last week, including the Alien Enemies Act case."

Title IX is a 1972 civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in educational programs that receive federal funding.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Theodore McCarrick,\u00a0a once-powerful Catholic cardinal who was defrocked by Pope Francis in 2019 after a Vatican investigation determined he sexually molested adults and children, died Friday, according to Archbishop of Washington Robert McElroy. McCarrick was 94.",
      "The McCarrick scandal created\u00a0a crisis of credibility\u00a0for the church, primarily because\u00a0there was evidence\u00a0Vatican and U.S. church leaders knew he slept with seminarians but turned a blind eye as McCarrick rose to the top of the U.S. church as an adept fundraiser who advised three popes.",
      "The Vatican\u2019s report on its investigation put the lion\u2019s share of blame on a dead saint: Pope John Paul II, who appointed McCarrick archbishop of Washington, D.C., in 2000, despite having commissioned an inquiry that confirmed he slept with seminarians.",
      "The report found that John Paul believed McCarrick\u2019s last-minute, handwritten denial: \u201cI have made mistakes and may have sometimes lacked in prudence, but in the seventy years of my life I have never had sexual relations with any person, male or female, young or old, cleric or lay,\u201d McCarrick wrote."

      "Obama rebuked Trump without explicitly naming him over the federal government's threats against universities and students who exercise free speech, its targeting of law firms, and the new tariffs imposed on foreign countries.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think what we just witnessed in terms of economic policy and tariffs is going to be good for America, but that\u2019s a specific policy,\" Obama said in his remarks at Hamilton College in New York. \"I\u2019m more deeply concerned with a federal government that threatens universities if they don\u2019t give up students who are exercising their right to free speech,\" he said.",
      "Obama said he's more troubled by a White House that takes aim at law firms that represent ideas or parties that its occupants disagree with, and that the administration has punished media outlets. Trump has signed executive orders penalizing major law firms and lawyers, prompting outrage within the legal community. The White House has also barred The Associated Press from coverage over its refusal to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.",
      "\"That kind of behavior is contrary to the basic compact we have as Americans,\" he said.",
      "Obama suggested that Republicans would be outraged if he had done similar things as president.",
      "\"Imagine if I had pulled Fox News\u2019 credentials from the White House press corps,\" he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s unimaginable that the same parties that are silent now would have tolerated behavior like that from me or a whole bunch of my predecessors.\"",
      "He added, \"I say this not on a partisan basis. This has to do with something more precious, which is who are we as a country and what values do we stand for?\"",
      "His final message during his speech was that \"history zigs and zags and there are times of conflict and there are times of stupidity and there are times of danger,\" but he wants people to remain resilient.",
      "\"Don\u2019t get discouraged,\" he said. \"I know it\u2019s a little crazy right now, but we\u2019re going to be OK.\"",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris also spoke out against the Trump administration at the Leading Women Defined Summit in California on Thursday. She said that the country is witnessing \"progress being rolled back\" and a \"sense of fear\" taking hold nationwide.",
      "\"We are seeing those who are capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats,\" she said. \"And these are the things that we are witnessing each day in these last few months in our country. And it understandably creates a great sense of fear.\"",
      "Harris, who has kept a low profile since losing to Trump in November's presidential election, said that \"fear has a way of being contagious\" but that \"courage is also contagious.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about their remarks."

I could name 15 better Indian restaurants right now, including the biryani cart outside of my apartment.\u201d",

      "Some things never change. In the case of Jennifer Garner and Judy Greer, being co-stars and besties is kind of a lifelong thing.",
      "The pair played best friends 21 years ago in \u201c13 Going on 30\"and reunited on-screen for \u201cThe Last Thing He Told Me\u201d Season 2, which is anticipated to arrive on Apple TV+ late this year. They also are close friends in real life, Greer says.",
      "\u201cHave you\u00a0ever\u00a0worked with one of your best friends? It\u2019s\u00a0really hard to get anything done,\u201d Greer tells\u00a0TODAY.com of filming the AppleTV+ show. \u201cWhen we were at the studio, sometimes we would have to separate ourselves because it\u2019s just too fun.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve\u00a0realized that we have to work together a lot because it\u2019s the best way to hang out,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe\u2019re both so busy otherwise.\u201d",
      "Still, they've maintained an off-camera connection over the years, and Greer let us in on the sweet personalized gifts the friends have swapped.",
      "\u201cShe\u00a0bought us these sweatshirts a long time ago that said \u2018Jen Garner and Judy Greer,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then I got us \u2018JG\u2019 necklaces as like a Christmas present. I don\u2019t know, we\u2019re dorks. We\u2019re friend dorks.\u201d",
      "Just as she's played the spunky best friend in films like \u201cThe Wedding Planner\u201d and \u201c27 Dresses,\u201d friendship has been a nonnegotiable priority in Greer's personal life for decades.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d\u00a0be nothing without my friends,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in working to maintain friendships. I think that there\u2019s a lot of focus on romantic relationships, especially when we\u2019re in our 20s and 30s.",
      "\u201cI think\u00a0that working to maintain our friendships is just as, if not more important,\u201d she adds. \u201cBecause in a romantic relationship, you\u2019re around that person, in theory, most days or every day. Friendships you really have to stick to it. You have to keep at it.\u201d",
      "To be a great friend, you have to\u00a0have\u00a0great friends. And Greer shares that Garner is exactly the kind of friend everyone needs in their corner.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s exactly\u00a0the kind of friend you would imagine,\u201d Greer said. \u201cPeople are like, \u2018what\u2019s she really like?\u2019 I\u2019m like, 'She\u2019s really like that, whatever you\u2019re thinking.\u2019 She\u2019s perfect in every way. She\u2019s better than the rest of us. She\u2019s somehow superhuman.\u201d",
      "\"I don't think I've ever read a text message from her that didn't make me laugh,\" she continues.",
      "As for whether they'd ever reunite for \"13 Going on 30\" sequel?",
      "\"If someone wants to pay us to do that, I could imagine that we would do it. But there's nothing in the works,\" she says."

(As for the real-life inspirations: Nikki Boyer is an executive producer on the show; Molly Kochan died of breast cancer in 2019.)",

      "\u201cI was thinking about Molly and feeling just really intense emotions. And I looked out the window and there was this absolutely beautiful apple blossom tree.

      "So how did she prepare to step into Lois\u2019 shoes?",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s one of the characters that\u2019s evolved the most in the history of these comics,\u201d she told TODAY.com. \u201cShe always represents whatever the modern intrepid journalist who is hungry and courageous and determined feels like, and that\u2019s looked like a lot of different things over time. So (writer-director) James (Gunn) laid the roadmap for us with his brilliant script. We had a lot of conversation about how he saw this character fitting into the canon of previous \u2018Superman\u2019 iterations, and then, and then just spend a lot of time trying on things for size.\u201d",
      "What Dichen Lachman thinks about those goats in \u2018Severence\u2019",
      "\u201cMum\u201d was totally the word when \u201cSeverance\u201d actor Dichen Lachman spoke on TODAY about spoilers for the Season 2 finale. The cliffhanger left fans pondering the fate of Lachman\u2019s character, Gemma Scout, otherwise known as Ms. Casey.",
      "While Lachman couldn\u2019t say what\u2019s to come when the series returns, she did talk to TODAY.com about the show\u2019s other compelling topic: those goats!",
      "\u201cI do believe that the others had an opportunity to work with the goats,\u201d Lachman said. \u201cI, sadly, only got to sort of wave to them from afar. But they\u2019re so cute.\u201d",
      "Perhaps it was for the best, because according to the Australian actor, working with goats can sometimes be a real challenge.",
      "\u201cI did, once, in a very old movie, get head-butted by a goat. That wasn\u2019t on film, but I have worked with goats before and they can be quite diva-ish,\u201d she laughed."

    "story": [
      "Are you a Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda or a Samantha?",
      "It's a question as old as time (or at least since June 6, 1998, when \"Sex and the City\" premiered on HBO).",
      "The show's four leading ladies collectively comprise a group of best friends in their 30s, navigating life and relationships in New York City in a time after the\u00a0\"end of love in Manhattan,\" as Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) puts it in the pilot.",
      "Their friendship is maintained through phone calls, parties, cab rides and meals and often consists of a central debate, with each person bringing a different perspective to the situation. Their conversations are full of banter and little disagreements, with each scene illuminating just how different each character is, setting up a perfect \u2014 and lasting \u2014 form of self-categorization.",
      "Kristin Davis, who plays Charlotte, says she fittingly identifies as a \"Charlotte.\"",
      "\"I think BuzzFeed had a quiz and people send it around. My daughter has gotten it, which is hysterical, and luckily she is a Charlotte,\" she tells TODAY.com with a laugh, referring to daughter Gemma.",
      "The personality litmus test also lent itself to her latest venture, a \"Sex and the City\" rewatch podcast called, \"Are You A Charlotte?\" The goal of the podcast is to connect with fans, she says.",
      "Currently on the podcast, Davis and her guests \u2014 a lineup she says will include TODAY's own Jenna Bush Hager, \"Sex and the City\" author Candace Bushnell and Sarah Jessica Parker \u2014 are still rewatching Season 1.",
      "\"The first season, especially, I barely remember it,\" Davis says. \"Because we used to film really quickly, also, so we would film all night. Maybe we had five days, I want to say, an episode ... I'd have to go back, it might have even been four. Like it was fast.\"",
      "Now, there's more time dedicated to filming each episode, she says. Davis currently stars as Charlotte in \"And Just Like That...,\" the \"Sex and the City\" revival.",
      "Headed into Season 3, Davis calls it \"a big season.\" Viewers left Charlotte in Season 2 on her journey of returning to work while balancing the expectations of being a wife and mother, including setting husband Harry (Evan Handler) straight on the division of their workload.",
      "\"The pressure of trying to be a good wife, be a good mother, her children are getting older, so she's trying to figure out, 'How much time can I devote to my career, at my job? ... What do I need to succeed?'\" Davis says. \"This is a big question for everyone, so I really relate to it myself, obviously, too. And that continues through the season, and you're going to see her really struggle with that.",
      "\"And it's a fun, fun storyline,\" she adds.",
      "\"And Just Like That...,\" which premiered in December 2021, reunited Davis, Nixon and Parker as Charlotte, Miranda and Carrie. Season 2 memorably saw the brief return of Samantha, when Kim Cattrall made a cameo in the finale.",
      "How to tell if you're a Carrie, Charlotte, Samantha or Miranda",
      "While fans have been categorizing themselves as a Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda or Samantha for years, Davis has her own ideas for how to decide which character you're most like. She boils it down to four key questions to ask yourself, centered on each character's core identity:",
      "Are you a searcher? Are you a trailblazer?Do you say it like it is?Are you looking for a traditional outcome for your life?",
      "Are you a searcher?",
      "Are you a trailblazer?",
      "Do you say it like it is?",
      "Are you looking for a traditional outcome for your life?",
      "After whichever question has you shouting, \"Yes!\" the most definitively, read on for which \"Sex and the City\" character that makes you.",
      "Are you a searcher?",
      "Yes? Congrats, you're a ...",
      "Carrie!",
      "\"In terms of the other (characters), like Carrie, I would say, are you a searcher? Are you looking for answers? Are you investigating things?\" Davis poses.",
      "In each episode of the original show, Parker\u2019s character, a columnist, took on a relationship or life dilemma, and in the process of writing it, often framed the issue as a question. Davis says the key to Carrie's identity is her signature phrase: \"I couldn't help but wonder.\"",
      "Carrie is also \"not so worried about tradition,\" Davis notes.",
      "\"Carrie is more independent and looking for what would make her happy, not necessarily what society might be expecting,\" she says.",
      "Are you a trailblazer?",
      "Then you're a...",
      "Samantha!",
      "Taking things a step further from Carrie's independence, Davis describes Samantha as a \"trailblazer.\"",

      "Do you say it like it is?",
      "You're most like...",
      "Miranda!",
      "Davis describes a Miranda as someone \"open in how you talk.\"",
      "\"Do you say it like it is?\" she says. \"Are you open to eating food out of a trash can? Do you like cats?\"",
      "A huge part of a Miranda's identity is also career-centric, she says.",
      "\"Are you into your career? She is a lawyer, and she's very good at it, and she wants to become partner, and she's super smart,\" Davis says. \"So are you super smart? That would be a Miranda question.\"",

      "If yes, you are a...",
      "Charlotte!",
      "\u201cFirst of all, in terms of, are you a Charlotte, I would say, \u2018Do you believe in love? Are you loyal?\u2019\u201d Davis adds.",
      "At her core, Charlotte is looking for \u201ca traditional outcome\u201d to her life. She also has certain material loves that are part of her identity, too, Davis says.",

      "\u201cBut I tried my best to, again, not sugarcoat it too much,\u201d he continued. \u201c(I) let them know, \u2018Hey, there are some risks that come with this.\u2019 You know, I called it the way it was. It\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, there\u2019s some tumors that your mom has in her brain.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I said, \u2018It sounds worse than what it is.

      "At the time, the \"That's So Raven\" star received quite a bit of backlash online for her comments about her race. Now, in her interview with Lee, she is once again addressing it and clarifying what she meant.",
      "\"I am not an African American. I'm an American. I am a Black American. I am definitely Black. And yes, my ancestors come from Africa,\" she said.",
      "\"How long does a bloodline have to live in one land before they are considered a pure species of that land? Meaning, how long did my people have to be in America to say, 'Hey, no, we're American,\" compared to some people who are English American, who are Irish American, who are German American from their ancestors, but they get to call themselves American,\" Raven-Symon\u00e9 continued.",
      "The \"Cheetah Girls\" singer explained that there is \"nothing wrong\" with someone identifying as African American, \"but a true African American is someone that is from Africa and moved here, either first generation or second generation, and has a tie to that country that I do not have.\"",
      "She also noted that her family has been in America for quite some time and were part of the \"first census in Virginia that allowed for Black people to have a name.\"",
      "\"I think there comes a point where, when you build a country, when you fight for freedom, make money and pay taxes and generationally live in a country, you have the privilege to call yourself pure American,\" she added.",

      "There, Raven-Symon\u00e9 said that she immediately felt \"judged\" when she saw all the backlash that she was getting from the public back then.

      "\u201cI said, \u2018Don\u2019t label me\u2019 and it turned into that instead of my coming out,\u201d she said."

    "summary": "Kevin Bacon plays a demon hunter from hell in \"The Bondsman, and he reveals the surprising thing he shares in common with his TV counterpart.",
    "story": [
      "Kevin Bacon has played almost every kind of character imaginable over the course of his tenured career, but it's his latest role in the new series, \"The Bondsman,\" that has the 66-year-old actor catching hell as Hub Halloran, a demon-hunter searching for redemption.",
      "\"It was a fun show for me because there's a lot of physical challenges, which I really like. There's a lot of running, jumping, fighting and underwater stuff,\" Bacon says during a sit-down interview with TODAY.com",
      "\"You know, just basically demon ass-kicking,\" he laughs.",
      "The new Prime series, which premiered on April 3, is about a murdered bounty hunter (Bacon) resurrected by Satan to help track down escaped demons, so it's naturally going to be hellish. But fortunately, for Bacon, it\u2019s in all the right ways.",
      "\"What's really fun to me is the fact that the character is such a badass, but at the same time, he's such a child in a lot of ways,\" Bacon says of the role. \"He's living in his mother's garage, he hasn't been able to make it work with his ex-wife. He's estranged from his son. He's kind of a mess in his life.\"",
      "That complicated backstory is exactly why he enjoyed taking on the character. \"If you're going to play somebody who is ultimately the hero of the show, it's fun to have that kind of complexity.\"",
      "Produced by showrunner Erik Oleson, \"The Bondsman\" also stars Beth Grant as Kitty Halloran, Bacon's tough-as-nails mother, Maxwell Jenkins as his son, Cade, and Sugarland's Jennifer Nettles as the ex-wife he still carries a torch for.",
      "It's a campy, often gory mix of comedy, action and straight-up horror as Bacon battles various demons as part of a mission he's been sent on to round up wayward demons by the Devil himself.",
      "No stranger to the genre, the \"Footloose\" actor has appeared in a variety of horror films, including the original \"Friday the 13th,\" \"Hollow Man\" and \"Tremors.\"",
      "Beyond it's genre identity, \"The Bondsman\" is also a metaphor for personal redemption, with its phrase, \"to hell and back,\" serving as both a literal and figurative meaning.",
      "Kevin Bacon vs. Hub Halloran: Similar or different?",
      "While Bacon says he doesn't connect with his character Hub's alter ego, they do share a passion for music.",
      "Along with acting, Bacon has spent decades touring with his brother, Michael, as one half of the musical duo known as The Bacon Brothers. Hub, a failed musician, provided Bacon with the perfect opportunity to marry two of his loves in \"The Bondsman.\"",
      "\"It came up when we were about to pitch (\"The Bondsman\"), that it might be fun for me to write some songs, and then Jennifer (Nettles) got cast, and she was definitely the best person for the part, the best actress, but she was also a fabulous singer and a great, great songwriter,\" Bacon tells Craig Melvin and Savannah Guthrie during a segment on TODAY April 3.",
      "\"So, right away, we wrote a song, and that song was rejected,\u201d Bacon said. \"And then we wrote some more, and wrote some more, and we ended up with three of our tunes in the show.\"",
      "Music, however, isn't the only thing that Bacon and Hub have in common. Bacon says that Hub's calm and collected way of dealing with chaos is something he can relate to.",
      "\"Part of the humor lies in the fact that when all this crazy stuff starts happening around (Hub), he's pretty cool around it. He's like, 'OK, well, now, I've come back from the dead and now I've got to go and hunt these demons. So, let me just figure out how I'm going to do that.' You know what I mean? I would say, if anything, that's a similar quality,\" explains Bacon.",
      "Big screen vs. little screen: Which does Kevin Bacon prefer?",
      "\"The Bondsman\" is far from Bacon's first TV series. The actor also starred in the 2019 cop drama \"City on a Hill,\" the 2016 comedy  \"I Love Dick\" and the 2013 serial killer series \"The Following,\" among others.",
      "He also stars opposite Julianne Moore in the upcoming Netflix series, \"Sirens,\" which will be released on May 22.",
      "Having appeared on both the big and little screens, does Bacon have a preference between the two?",
      "\"When I started out, all I wanted was to be in movies and on the stage. Those were my two dreams,\" he explains. \"It's hard to imagine, but back then, if you went from the movies to the small screen, it was kind of a sign that you were throwing in the towel.",
      "\"Now, movie stars left and right do it, everyone does it, and I love it. I'd never not do TV,\" Bacon continues. \"I also really love movies and I go to them, I would say, maybe once a week. I go to the theater, sit in the room, get the popcorn, go through that experience because I love it.\""

      "\u201cBoy Meets World\u201d stars have mixed feelings today about a complicated storyline that Will Friedle described as having an \u201cimportant message, not great execution.\u201d",
      "In the latest \u201cPod Meets World\u201d episode, podcast hosts Friedle, Danielle Fishel and Rider Strong criticized a 1998 episode titled \u201cEverybody Loves Stuart,\u201d in which a college professor makes an inappropriate move on Fishel\u2019s character Topanga.",
      "The theme of the episode, in their opinion, is, \u201cWhat happens when people in position of power take advantage of your trust.\u201d The trio, however, were frustrated with the way the storyline plays out.",
      "Professor Stuart is portrayed by Fred Savage, the older brother of \u201cBoy Meet World\u201d star Ben Savage. In it, he is known as the \u201ccool teacher\u201d and makes a pass on Topanga, who is one of his students and is engaged to Ben Savage\u2019s Cory.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t like (it),\u201d Friedle said. \u201cTopanga just sits there, quiet through the whole freaking thing, like, never speaks. It\u2019s not about her at all.\u201d",
      "In the episode, Cory becomes furious after Topanga tells him that Stuart hit on her in her dorm room. Cory confronts the professor and pushes him into a screen window in the common room. Because of his actions, he is at risk of being expelled.",
      "The \u201cPod Meets World\u201d hosts disliked how the storyline turned its focus on Cory instead of Topanga, who was the actual victim.",
      "Fishel agreed with Friedle, saying that being harassed by her professor became less about Topanga and more about, \u201cHow is the man in her life going to feel about it, and what\u2019s he going to do about it?\u201d",
      "\u201cTopanga's agency was completely just taken away, I did not appreciate that at all,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHow do we get across how important this is without being too heavy handed, and without trying to seem like we\u2019re making light of it?\" she added. \u201cI don\u2019t think that goal was achieved. I do think they just decided, let\u2019s lean into the melodrama of it.\u201d",
      "Friedle went on to note that the \u201cone time Topanga opens her mouth, she\u2019s told to be quiet by the dean.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe never tells her story to anybody that can help,\u201d he continued, adding that Cory doesn\u2019t even share Topanga\u2019s story. Instead, it's Mr. Feeny who takes charge.",
      "Strong, who called the episode \u201cpainful\u201d to watch, wondered why it was Cory\u2019s responsibility to stand up for Topanga.",
      "\u201cWhy is it Cory\u2019s responsibility to take the fall when he does stand up for her?\u201d\u00a0he asked.",
      "\u201cThe concern is not how Topanga feels,\u201d Strong added. \u201cIt\u2019s about how the violation of Topanga is reflected through how it violates Cory\u2019s rights ... It just made me so uncomfortable.\u201d",
      "Fishel did point out that the show is titled \u201cBoy Meets World,\u201d which centers on Cory\u2019s point of view. However, she believed the episode could have benefited from a scene where Cory asks Topanga, \u201cWhat do you want to do about this? This happened to you... How can I best support you?\u201d",
      "Fishel said she was also confused by Cory pushing Stuart and how it\u2019s unknown if Topanga asks Cory to confront him.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t even know whether or not Topanga wants this to happen or is expecting him to say something,\u201d she said, adding that what happens to her character \u201cbecomes unimportant.\u201d",
      "As the trio continued to watch the episode, Friedle said, overall, he was \u201cso thrown by this episode.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe second Cory walks in, it is now Cory\u2019s taking over the story and it\u2019s about how he\u2019s going to deal with what happened to Topanga,\" Friedle said. \u201cThey should\u2019ve stayed with the Topanga storyline.\""

      "She tells TODAY.com the amount of questions has been overwhelming, but that she's proud of her son.",
      "\"I'm happy for him because he's worked so hard. He takes acting classes all the time, and for every role like this you get, you're rejected like 300 times. You have to be resilient. You have to stay at it. And he has really stayed at it. And he'll have to stay at it after this. He's got to have life after 'White Lotus,' but his life during 'White Lotus' is pretty wild.\"",
      "In this season of the hit HBO show, Schwarzenegger portrays an entitled finance bro who works for his father's business in North Carolina. The Ratliff family is vacationing in Thailand to help Saxon's sister, Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook), complete her college thesis \u2014 or so she says.",
      "About halfway through the season, Piper reveals she actually wanted to travel to the country to visit a monastery to meet a monk she wants to study under for a year, all while her dad, Tim (Jason Isaacs), learns there is a warrant out for his arrest back in the U.S.",
      "The fate of the Ratliffs will be revealed during the finale April 6, and Shriver says she believed she would be able to watch the last episode with her son.",
      "\"I thought I was watching it with Patrick and all his friends, and I changed my book tour to be home, and then he announced to me the other day that they're doing a 'White Lotus' working thing that I'm not invited to,\" she says. \"I said, 'Well, then I just guess I'll do my own finale party with your friends, without you.'\"",
      "Shriver says her son told her he would love to be there with her and that he was sorry, but she's still worried for his character in the finale.",

They paid tribute to Bacon by performing some of the sweet dance moves he did as Ren McCormack in the iconic \u201880s flick.",

      "\u201cEveryone was screaming. I swear I still remember those screams \u2014\u00a0 they were screams of anguish,\u201d the Guatemalan immigrant said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo from his home in Springfield, Tennessee. \u201cNo one knew what to do. Out of desperation, some started banging on the doors, but they were made of iron and couldn\u2019t be opened,\u201d said P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez, 40.",
      "On the night of March 27, 2023, at a facility located in the border town of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, 40 migrants from Guatemala, Venezuela, Colombia, Honduras and El Salvador were\u00a0killed by asphyxiation as a result of a fire\u00a0started by two Venezuelan migrants, according to investigations by Mexican authorities. Security videos leaked after the incident appeared to show smoke coming out of a cell and immigration agents fleeing without helping the locked migrants.",
      "P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez is one of the dozens injured during the fire.",

      "Last week, on the two-year anniversary of the fire, families of the victims denounced what they said was institutional neglect and   prevailing impunity around the case. They noted that Francisco Gardu\u00f1o, who heads the National Migration Institute (INM) that ran the center, remains in his post.",
      "\"It makes you desperate and it's frustrating not to find justice when  the rights of a human being have clearly been violated. All we can do is continue fighting for our family,\u201d the family members said in\u00a0a statement\u00a0shared by the Foundation for Justice.",
      "Groups representing the families as well as the relatives say that none of the criminal cases against 11 defendants, including eight INM officials, have gone to trial.",
      "According to\u00a0a report by the Ju\u00e1rez-based investigative newspaper La Verdad, only three of the eight officials charged with the deaths of the migrants face imprisonment; three of them were released on bail and another is on the loose.",
      "\u201cIn this country, more than 90 out of every 100 crimes go unpunished. And if this is true for Mexican citizens, it is evidently even more serious for migrant populations in Mexico,\u201d Javier Urbano, professor of International Studies at the Universidad Iberoamericana, said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo.",
      "The detention center closed after the fire; last May, Gardu\u00f1o announced that it would be replaced by a new building several miles away, near the Ysleta-Zaragoza International Bridge. The new center would be overseen by Mexico\u2019s National Human Rights Commission (CNDH).",
      "\u201cWhen they set fire to the mattress, it was hot, we had no ventilation or fire protection system, and there were no fire extinguishers. We had run out of drinking water, and there was practically no water in the bathrooms,\u201d P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez said of the conditions at the facility on the day of the fire.",
      "In 2024,\u00a0a cross-border investigative report by El Paso Matters, La Verdad and Lighthouse Reports revealed new details highlighting a series of lapses in the detention center's security protocols. \u201cMigrants detained by the National Migration Institute (INM)\u00a0lacked food and water, were held in an overcrowded cell and were verbally abused and threatened with deportation,\u201d the report stated.",
      "The detention center was designed to accommodate a total of 60 people, but on the day of the fire it had a total of 90, including seven employees.",
      "Authorities said the migrants were there because they had been returned from the U.S. to Mexico under Title 42, a public health measure initially implemented by the first Trump administration during the pandemic to immediately expel migrants back to Mexico until their immigration status was resolved.",
      "A call for changes",
      "Other fatal incidents involving migrants have taken place in Mexico in recent years, and they've been attributed to organized crime. In January 2021, 19 migrants were found burned in two vans in the municipality of Camargo, Tamaulipas. In February 2015, the remains of 16 migrants from Honduras and Guatemala were found in G\u00fc\u00e9mez, another town in Tamaulipas, and the same state also saw the massacre of 72 migrants in 2010.",
      "But the fire in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez took place while migrants were in Mexican state custody. \u201cIt\u2019s known who the culprits are, they\u2019re the people who were in charge of that immigration station,\u201d said P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez.",
      "Even though the slow pace of judicial processes in the country and the lack of convictions continue to be a source of complaints, the fire was the starting point for promoting changes in Mexico's immigration centers or stations, according to Eunice Rend\u00f3n, a coordinator for Agenda Migrante, (Migrant Agenda), a coalition of migrant advocacy groups in Mexico and the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe National Migration Institute opened the door for us to work with them, and in two years we replaced 15 Mexican government immigration detention centers,\u201d Rend\u00f3n said. \u201cWe realized that this immigration detention center model was conceived 20 years ago as a prisonlike model, and that\u2019s part of the problem.\"",
      "But P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez said he is frustrated over the lack of indictments and convictions.",
      "Last January, Gardu\u00f1o succeeded in obtaining an 18-month freeze on the legal proceedings against him, P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez noted.",
      "\u201cThe person in charge of immigration is Gardu\u00f1o. He\u2019s the one in charge of giving the orders, and he should be involved in the case, but he\u2019s practically unindicted,\u201d he said.",
      "Noticias Telemundo contacted the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s Office and the National Institute of Migration for comment on the allegations made by survivors and advocacy organizations, but received no response.",
      "However, the INM published\u00a0an interview\u00a0with Gardu\u00f1o on social media last week announcing he would issue a public apology on April 16 in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. Gardu\u00f1o so far has denied allegations of mistreatment of the victims and their families, and emphasized that the Mexican government has provided nearly 240 million pesos (about $12 million) or 3.5 million pesos (about $171,600) to those who were directly or indirectly affected by the fire.",
      "P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez, who spent more than a year recovering, said he did receive this compensation it's not enough.",
      "\"There are health issues right now, and that practically doesn\u2019t make up for it. I\u2019m still seeing the doctor, still paying for my medications  and everything,\u201d he said.",
      "Despite the daily health issues, P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez lit up when he talked about his experiences living in the U.S. with his wife and three children, while he works through his asylum case.",
      "\u201cThe truth is, we have a better life in the U.S. It\u2019s a wonderful experience, having the whole family here,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, the children go to school happily, they laugh and play, they\u2019re healthier and everything. It\u2019s honestly the best thing that could have happened to me.\"",
      "While his life in the country has meant a new beginning for his family, he's concerned about the current immigration measures and increased deportations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little sad, and sometimes we get discouraged by the situation we\u2019re going through, but I think we should entrust ourselves to God and try to do the best we can \u2014\u00a0our dream is to live better, work, and continue to make this country even greater,\" he said.",

      "LONDON \u2014 The second Trump administration may have ruffled the feathers of America\u2019s allies, but there is also evidence it has boosted world leaders scrambling to deal with the White House\u2019s norm-busting approach.",
      "Some have gained plaudits for meeting Trump head-on, while others have taken a more nuanced line between flattering the president and trying to shore up their own interests against the headwinds blowing from Washington.",
      "Canada\u2019s Mark Carney is poised to win next month\u2019s election by volubly rejecting President Donald Trump\u2019s hostile advances to make his country the 51st state. On the flip side, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has earned accolades for becoming something of a Trump whisperer, deftly responding to his tariff threats and seeing her own popularity rise accordingly.",
      "In Europe, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have received polling boosts following their widely praised Trump strategies. And the embattled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has seen his numbers rise as he has tried to cope with Washington\u2019s brusque approach.",
      "\u201cThe standing of politicians who are having to deal with the crisis engendered by Trump\u2019s presidency is leading to a rise in their popularity, if they seem to be doing this in a reasoned and proper way,\u201d said Dominic Grieve, the former British attorney general and an ex-senior lawmaker for the Conservative Party.",
      "To be clear, Trump is no panacea for leaders. Macron and Starmer are still relatively unpopular and face harsh criticisms on domestic issues that will likely decide future elections. Likewise, good polling numbers will be of limited cheer for Zelenskyy while the future of his entire country is in doubt.",
      "Other analysts debate the extent to which this popularity boost is solely because of Trump, rather than the general climate of global instability and uncertainty of which Washington is a part.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure so how much it\u2019s a Trump bounce or more of a international crisis bounce,\u201d said Anand Menon, director of the think tank U.K. in a Changing Europe. \u201cInsecurity means that, initially at least, trust in the government goes up.\u201d",
      "Still, the abrupt change of tone and policy from the White House is an undeniable factor.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on Canada have seen a remarkable turnaround for Carney\u2019s Liberals. They were headed for historic losses, but Trump\u2019s onslaught has seen them ride a wave of renewed Canadian nationalism and lead the polls at 45% ahead of April 28\u2019s election.",
      "\u201cThe old relationship we had with the United States,\u201d Carney told a news conference Thursday, \u201cis over.\u201d",
      "Mexico\u2019s Sheinbaum has chosen a different tack, taking action on immigration and fentanyl trafficking \u2014 including sending 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. That earned a delay on Trump\u2019s tariffs, as well as praise from the U.S. president, who called her \u201ca wonderful woman.\u201d",
      "At home, she has mixed this strategy with a cerebral nationalism, telling voters that this is about \u201ccoordination, yes \u2014 submission, never.\u201d",

      "In the United Kingdom, Starmer\u2019s ratings have gone up 8.5 percentage points from February, according to the British pollster Ipsos. That followed an Oval Office meeting with Trump in which he mixed compliments with candor: talking up a potential trade deal while refusing to budge from a commitment to Ukraine.",
      "He has promised to hike British defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, part of the wider nervousness in Europe about Trump\u2019s commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance.",
      "The economy and health care will likely decide the next election. But defense is now the third most important issue for British voters, most polls show. And it is defense and international trade on which voters think Starmer is performing best, according to the Ipsos poll taken between March 14 and 17.",
      "\u201cPretty much all of his readings have become somewhat less unpopular in the wake of his trip to Washington,\u201d said John Curtice, one of Britain\u2019s most respected polling experts and a professor at Scotland\u2019s University of Strathclyde. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say the public have noticed that he\u2019s risen to the challenge.\u201d",

      "Likewise, the current international upheaval has seen Macron\u2019s popularity jump to 31% in March, up 7 points from the previous month, according to an Ifop poll.",
      "These numbers are still relatively low, however, and they may well be fleeting. Macron can\u2019t run again in the next election, in 2027, but his centrist heirs risk losing the presidency to the far-right National Rally, the current favorite.",
      "The same is true for Starmer, whose Labour Party has slid from a landslide victory last year to near parity with the Conservatives and hard-right Reform U.K. Most voters are worried about high prices for food, energy and housing, rather than their leader\u2019s Oval Office repartee.",
      "For any leader enjoying a momentary upside, Menon, of U.K. in a Changing Europe, has a word of warning: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get complacent on the back of the fact that, right at the moment, things are looking a little bit better because Trump uncertainty.\u201d"

      "The leader of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council tried to allay surging alarm among Haitians over rampant gang violence by acknowledging Thursday that the country has \u201cbecome hell for everyone\u201d and promising new measures to stop the bloodshed.",
      "Fritz Alphonse Jean spoke a day after gunfire erupted in the capital, Port-au-Prince, as thousands of protesters demanding an end to gang violence clashed with police outside the offices of the council and the prime minister. It was the biggest protest held since the council was installed a year ago.",
      "\u201cHaitian people, you\u2019ve spoken, and we\u2019ve heard you,\u201d Jean said. \u201cWe understand your misery. We know your pain and your suffering.\u201d",
      "More than 4,200 people have been reported killed across Haiti from July to February, and another 1,356 were injured, according to the U.N.",
      "Recent gang violence also left more than 60,000 people homeless in one month alone, according to the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration.",
      "\u201cThis national address comes at a decisive moment for the transitional government,\u201d said Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. \u201cProtesters from various parts of the capital deliberately marched toward key government buildings to express their frustration.\u201d",
      "He noted that Jean\u2019s address marked the first anniversary of the political agreement that established the new transitional government\u2019s structure and objectives. Since then, cohesion between political parties involved in creating that government \u201chas now largely collapsed,\u201d Da Rin said.",
      "\u201cThe groups that originally supported this government are now calling for a change in leadership,\u201d he noted.",
      "The council has not addressed those concerns, which also have been voiced by the international community.",
      "During his public address, Jean rattled off a list of neighborhoods that gangs have recently attacked.",
      "\u201cYou lost your homes, you lost your businesses, you lost your jobs, they raped you, they raped your kids. The criminal gangs killed a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fight against the darkness is not insignificant. But we are not insignificant ourselves\u2026 It\u2019s nothing compared with the battle we fought to get out of slavery.\u201d",
      "Jean referenced how Haiti became the world\u2019s first free Black republic in a bid to rally support from Haitians, asking them to help law enforcement officials and eschew efforts by gangs to recruit people, especially children.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let people profit from your distress and drag you in bad directions,\u201d he said.",
      "Jean said the council would take \u201cimportant measures\u201d to help quell the persistent violence, including setting aside a special budget and incorporating agents from an armed state environmental group known as BSAP.",
      "\u201cThe council asks the prime minister and the police to take these measures without delay,\u201d Jean said. \u201cWe are telling everyone in this government that we are at war.\u201d",
      "Jean did not provide further details, including how much money would be set aside for the budget and how many BSAP agents would join the fight against gangs.",
      "Jean also said that the electoral council is working so that Haiti can have new leadership once the transitional presidential council\u2019s term ends on Feb. 7 next year. He added that officials are taking steps so that the diaspora can vote in what would be Haiti\u2019s first general elections held in almost a decade.",
      "Haiti has not had a president since former President Jovenel Mo\u00efse was assassinated in 2021, with gangs becoming increasingly powerful in the aftermath.",
      "Last year, a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police arrived in Haiti to help local authorities quell gang violence, but the mission remains understaffed and underfunded, with only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel originally envisioned.",
      "Jean\u2019s speech did not appear to resonate with those most affected by gang violence.",
      "Mario Jean-Pierre, a 53-year-old street vendor who sells used clothes that he carries on his back, said he wasn\u2019t impressed by the public address.",
      "Gang violence recently forced him and his two children to move into a makeshift shelter in the yard of Haiti\u2019s Ministry of Public Works.",
      "\u201cFlying bullets are coming at you in different directions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few people in this camp who were hit by bullets as they slept.\u201d",
      "He worries constantly about his children\u2019s safety and said he didn\u2019t believe Jean\u2019s pledge to improve security.",
      "\u201cThis speech is not any different from other speeches,\u201d he said. \u201cThey keep making promises and don\u2019t accomplish any of the promises they\u2019ve made.\u201d",
      "Da Rin noted that throughout his speech, Jean emphasized the transnational dimension of Haiti\u2019s security crisis, stressing that the gang issue is part of a broader problem involving money laundering and arms and drugs trafficking that spans several countries.",
      "\u201cBy framing Haiti\u2019s gang problem as a matter of transnational crime that goes beyond Haiti\u2019s borders, the president seems to be seeking to rally international support for further security assistance that matches the escalating threats,\u201d he said."

      "While Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia was left out of the long list, Trump slapped 10% tariffs on Heard Island and McDonald Islands, a mostly barren, tiny outpost largely populated by penguins.",
      "The island group is located in the middle of the Antarctic Ocean and remains among the world\u2019s most remote places where no humans live.

      "\u201cIt just shows and exemplifies the fact that nowhere on Earth is safe from this,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters Thursday, calling Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u201cnot the act of a friend.\u201dFour of Australia's external territories, including Heard Island and McDonald Islands, as well as Christmas Island, and Cocos (Keeling) Islands, received the 10% tariff floor that Trump imposed on countries with which the U.S. runs a deficit, despite near-insignificant levels of trade.",
      "According to the World Bank, the Heard and McDonald islands exported about $1.4 million worth of goods to the U.S. in 2022, most of which were unspecified \u201cmachinery and electrical\u201d products, while the U.S. exported about $21,600 to the islands in the same year. It is unclear how these goods are traded despite a lack of human habitation, but a report by The Guardian newspaper found that some goods may have been mislabeled as coming from the territory.",
      "Norfolk Island, another Australian territory with a population of about 2000 people, received a 29% tariff, triple that of the rest of the country. Norfolk Island exported about $273,000 of mostly chemicals to the U.S. in 2022, while importing $52,000 worth of goods, according to World Bank data.",

      "\u201cDonald Trump slapped tariffs on penguins and not on Putin,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer posted Friday on X.",
      "Mike Coffin, a marine geophysicist who undertook seven research voyages to the Heard and McDonald Islands over the past four decades, said he was \u201castonished\u201d that the territory was on Trump\u2019s tariff list.",
      "The islands have no infrastructure to support human habitation, Coffin told NBC News on Friday in an email.",
      "Penguins are the most visible inhabitants in the area, with an estimated population exceeding 1 million, said Coffin, who is also an emeritus professor at the University of Tasmania in Australia. \u201cSeals are also prominent.\u201d",
      "Although Australia established a year-round research station on Heard Island in 1947, the territory hasn\u2019t been inhabited since it closed in 1954, he said.\u201cThe most recent visit by humans that I\u2019m aware of was a three-week visit of amateur\u00a0radio operators in 2016,\u201d Coffin said, adding that two Australian fishing companies are licensed to catch\u00a0fish surrounding the Heard Island and McDonald Islands.",
      "NBC News has reached out to the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s International Trade Administration and Australia\u2019s Foreign Affairs and Trade Department for comment.",
      "Heard Island and the McDonald Islands and their surrounding waters are\u00a0unique in Australia, having the country\u2019s only active volcanoes, its highest mountain and only glaciers. There are currently no commercial tour operations that visit Heard Island due to high costs and tough sailing conditions."

      "Search teams pulled more bodies from the ruins of buildings on Friday, a week after a massive earthquake rocked Myanmar killing more than 3,100 people, as the focus turns toward the urgent humanitarian needs in a country that was already devastated by civil war.",
      "United Nations humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher, who is also the emergency relief coordinator, was to arrive Friday in an effort to spur action following the quake. Ahead of his visit, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed to the international community to immediately step up funding for quake victims \u201cto match the scale of this crisis,\u201d and he urged unimpeded access to reach those in need.",
      "\u201cThe earthquake has supercharged the suffering with the monsoon season just around the corner,\u201d he said Thursday.",
      "Myanmar authorities said Thursday that 3,145 people had been killed, with another 4,589 people injured and 221 missing, and did not immediately update the figures on Friday.",
      "Britain, which had already given $13 million to purchase emergency items like food, water and shelter, pledged an additional $6.5 million in funds to match an appeal from Myanmar\u2019s Disasters Emergency Committee, according to the U.K. Embassy in Yangon.",
      "Many international search and rescue teams were also on the scene, and eight medical crews from China, Thailand, Japan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Russia were operating in Naypyitaw, according to Myanmar\u2019s military-run government. Another five teams from India, Russia, Laos and Nepal and Singapore were helping in the Mandalay region, while teams from Russia, Malaysia and the ASEAN bloc of nations were assisting in the Sagaing region.",
      "The Trump administration has pledged $2 million in emergency aid and sent a three-person team to assess how best to respond given drastic cuts to U.S. foreign assistance.",
      "On Friday, five bodies were recovered from the rubble in the capital Naypyitaw and the second-largest city of Mandalay, near the epicenter of the 7.7 magnitude earthquake March 28, authorities said. The last reported rescue came Wednesday, some 125 hours after the quake struck, when a man was saved from the wreckage of a hotel in Mandalay.",
      "The quake also shook neighboring Thailand, bringing down a high-rise under construction in Bangkok, where recovery work continued Friday. Overall, 22 people have been found dead and 35 injured in Bangkok, primarily from the construction site.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s military seized power in 2021 from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has turned into a civil war.",
      "The quake worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis, with more than 3 million people displaced from their homes and nearly 20 million in need even before it hit, according to the United Nations.",
      "As concerns grew that ongoing fighting could hamper humanitarian aid efforts, the military declared a temporary ceasefire Wednesday, through April 22. The announcement followed unilateral temporary ceasefires announced by armed resistance groups opposed to military rule.",
      "On Thursday, however, there were renewed airstrikes in Kayah state, also known as Karenni, in eastern Myanmar, according to witnesses.",
      "The military has said that it would still take \u201cnecessary\u201d measures against resistance groups, if they use the ceasefire to regroup, train or launch attacks, and the groups have said they reserved the right to defend themselves."

      "Flight 370, a Boeing 777, was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members when it vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in 2014, in one of the world\u2019s greatest aviation mysteries.",
      "The minister, quoted by state news agency Bernama, did not say why such a prolonged delay was required. In the Southern Hemisphere, it is now autumn and poor wintry conditions are then expected to predominate for several months.",
      "The U.S. exploration company charged with searching for the wreckage of the plane, Ocean Infinity, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cI think right now it\u2019s not the season. I think they (Ocean Infinity) have stopped the operation for the time being and will resume the search at the end of this year,\u201d Transport Minister Loke was quoted by Bernama as saying.",
      "Last month,\u00a0Malaysia\u00a0agreed to\u00a0terms and conditions\u00a0of an agreement with Ocean Infinity to resume the search for the plane in a new location estimated to cover about 5,790 square miles in the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "The search is based on a \u201cno find, no fee\u201d principle, in which Ocean Infinity will receive $70 million only if the wreckage is successfully located.",
      "Responding to news of the long delay, Kelvin Shim, whose wife was on the ill-fated flight, said he was not surprised as the weather in the Southern Hemisphere was changing.",
      "\u201cWe have been waiting for more than 11 years, so this is just another few more months ... I can still wait,\u201d the 50-year-old said."

      "Yoon\u2019s brief martial law declaration and subsequent impeachment trial have deeply divided South Korea, a key U.S. ally and one of the most vibrant democracies in Asia. Rallies for and against the conservative leader\u2019s removal from office have been held regularly, and officials had barricaded the courthouse ahead of the ruling in anticipation of possible violence.",
      "The political turmoil has also sidelined South Korea as it grapples with steep U.S. tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, as well as growing military cooperation between rival North Korea and Russia.",
      "The eight judges on the Constitutional Court ruled\u00a0unanimously against Yoon, 64, finding him guilty on all counts. The decision, which was broadcast live to cheering and despairing crowds and cannot be appealed, means an election for Yoon\u2019s successor must be held within 60 days."
