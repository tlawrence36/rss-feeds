      "The former co-stars met on Greta Gerwig\u2019s 2017 high school film \u201cLady Bird\u201d and were paired up again several years later in her adaptation of \u201cLittle Women.\u201d",
      "Though professionally their lives have taken them in different directions, they\u2019ve remained friends and will \u201cdip back in every few years\u201d to catch up, Ronan said.",
      "\u201cThat is what is so beautiful about this point in our lives, we\u2019re really lucky that the two of us are doing really well and our paths can continue to cross,\u201d Ronan added, as her husband, Jack Lowden supported from the audience.",
      "Both had busy years appearing in multiple film releases that are now vying for awards recognition.",
      "Chalamet took on the role of Bob Dylan in James Mangold\u2019s \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d which is out Christmas day, and Ronan played a young alcoholic who tries to escape the depths of her addiction by moving home to the Orkney Islands in Scotland in \u201cThe Outrun.\u201d",

      "The audience watched back-to-back scenes of the collaborations with Gerwig. Chalamet quipped that a \u201cLady Bird scene is a lot better than I remember it being!\u201d",
      "The conversation then shifted to their relationship with fame.",
      "Chalamet said it\u2019s the \u201cmost boring thing to talk about in my life.\u201d",
      "Ronan agreed: \u201cI just pretended that all of that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jay-Z\u2019s lawyers asked a judge Wednesday to speedily extract the rapper from a lawsuit in which a woman alleges she was sexually assaulted by Jay-Z and Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs when she was 13.",
      "The unidentified woman recently added Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, to her lawsuit against Combs in Manhattan federal court, alleging that she was attacked by the singers in 2000 after Combs\u2019 limo driver offered her a ride to an MTV Video Music Awards after-party.",
      "In their court filing Wednesday, Jay-Z's lawyers cited a recent television interview in which the woman acknowledged inconsistencies in her story.",
      "The filing came before Combs appeared for a pretrial hearing in his criminal case. After lawyers discussed evidentiary deadlines, prosecutors told Judge Arun Subramanian that any new charges against the hip-hop mogul before a May trial would require minimal new evidence to be shared among lawyers.",
      "In the criminal case, Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that the Bad Boy Records founder coerced and abused women for years with help from associates and employees. Combs, who has been jailed without bail for three months, hugged his lawyers and touched his heart as he acknowledged his children among spectators.",
      "In the civil case, one of several filed against him, the woman originally asserted that she was raped by Combs at the after-party but did not mention Jay-Z.",
      "Last Friday, NBC aired an interview in which she said she spoke with musicians Benji Madden and his brother at the party, and her father picked her up after the alleged assault. NBC also reported that a representative of the Maddens said they were touring the Midwest during the VMAs, and her father said he does not recall what would have been a drive home of more than five hours.",
      "Jay-Z has said the article proves that Tony Buzbee, a personal injury lawyer in Houston, filed a false complaint against him for money and fame. Attorney Teny R. Geragos, representing Combs, has said the TV interview was a part of the \u201cbeginning of the end of this shameful money grab.\u201d",
      "In the newly filed court papers, Jay-Z's lawyers wrote that the allegations \u201chave caused incalculable harm to Mr. Carter, his family, his businesses, his employees, and his legacy.\u201d",
      "Buzzbee told The Associated Press via email that the plaintiffs' lawyers planned to respond in court to the latest filing.",
      "\u201cThey continue to file meritless motions that are contrary to the rules and which have absolutely no merit,\u201d Buzzbee said.",
      "Buzbee announced in October that he represents some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "Jay-Z and Combs gained fame in the 2000s, emerging as wide-ranging entrepreneurs and two of the world\u2019s wealthiest rappers. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated Jay-Z\u2019s net worth to be $2.5 billion.",
      "The artists have collaborated over the years, with Jay-Z featured on Combs\u2019 debut album, \u201cNo Way Out\u201d and Combs appearing on Jay-Z\u2019s sophomore album, \u201cIn My Lifetime, Vol. 1.\u201d"

      "In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Matilda Djerf said she was \u201cgenuinely sorry\u201d to anyone she has \u201churt or let down\u201d after the tabloid, Aftonbladet, reported employees at her company had experienced or saw public berating, bullying and a \u201cculture of favoritism and control.\u201d",
      "The tabloid's report, which was published last week, cited 11 anonymous former and current workers at the Swedish brand, several of whom said they experienced panic attacks, anxiety and sleep problems while working for Djerf.",
      "One person told Aftonbladet that Djerf \u2014 whose company focuses on inclusivity \u2014 said she wanted a photo shoot of a plus-sized model redone, using an expletive and saying the model looked too \u201cfat\u201d in the clothes.",

      "\u201cWhen I started Djerf Avenue I never expected that the company would be what it is today, with so many team members and so much responsibility,\u201d Djerf wrote in her post on Instagram, where she has 3 million followers. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready. I had never led a team prior to this, I had never built a company, and under lot of stress, high tempo, and naivety I failed to be the leader and colleague I wish to be along the way. And for that I am so, so sorry.\u201d",
      "The 27-year-old also said her business \u2014 which sells apparel, beauty and homeware products \u2014 was making \u201cimportant changes\u201d to improve the work culture. She said the company has hired a \u201cmore experienced\u201d management team and were teaming up with an external organizational psychologist who could talk to employees.",
      "Djerf Avenue is also now doing monthly anonymous surveys to collect feedback from workers, the post said.",
      "Last year, Djerf was featured on Forbes\u2019 \u201c30 under 30\u201d list along with her boyfriend Rasmus Johansson, who co-founded the clothing label with her in 2019.",
      "Known for her \u201cclean girl\u201d aesthetic looks and bouncy hair, Djerf recently had a prominent campaign with model Hailey Bieber\u2019s skincare and beauty line, Rhode."

      "Amid a remarkable streak of high-profile projects with respected filmmakers \u2014 Sofia Coppola's \u201cPriscilla,\u201d Guillermo del Toro's upcoming adaptation of \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and, in theaters now, Paul Schrader's \u201cOh, Canada\u201d \u2014 the 27-year-old isn\u2019t taking his success for granted.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be so arrogant as to say like, you know, \u2018I choose what is befitting of me,\u2019\u201d he said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful because to say you choose these things sort of seems too conscious or something. I kind of am in a constant state of like, \u2018Wake me up from this.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cOh, Canada\u201d tells the story of Leonard Fife (Richard Gere), an acclaimed documentarian on his deathbed who, in what becomes a final act of confession, agrees to have the cameras turned toward him for a documentary about his own life.",
      "Elordi plays a young Fife in the film, based on Russell Banks\u2019 2021 novel, \u201cForegone.\u201d Despite their physical differences, Elordi\u2019s performance as a younger Gere is believable, thanks in part to the amount of effort he put into studying Gere\u2019s mannerisms.",
      "\u201cRichard has such a rich career of films and a really diverse range of films so there was a lot to watch and just kind of copy him, you know? Like Simon Says or something,\u201d Elordi said. \u201cThe best one for physicality was \u2018American Gigolo,\u2019 because I think he was 29 or something when he made that film. So, it\u2019s, you know, not far from where I am now.\u201d",
      "Schrader is not known for making big-budget blockbusters. And while the filmmaker has reaped critical praise throughout his prolific career, he\u2019s made his share of panned flops.",
      "But that hasn\u2019t stopped the 78-year-old from cementing his reputation as a pioneering auteur with an impressive catalog of actors who admire and work with him, including Amanda Seyfried,Willem Dafoe,Oscar Isaac and Nicolas Cage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a list of people who have sort of given to the art form of cinema and he\u2019s right up at the top of it,\u201d Elordi said. \u201cAs soon as the email comes through and it says Paul Schrader, you go, \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite that kind of reputation, Schrader is not one to break box office records. As he has looked back on his career, he\u2019s been frank about not prioritizing the immediate financial success of the dozens of films he\u2019s made.",
      "\u201cTo me, shelf life is more valuable than the box office,\u201d Schrader said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect that much from opening weekend.\u201d",
      "Instead, he evaluates a different set of criteria when determining how he feels about a film in his archive: \u201cIf I get it made, that\u2019s the first level of success. If it\u2019s taken seriously, that\u2019s the second level of success. And if it actually works with audiences, that\u2019s the third.\u201d",
      "While his films aren\u2019t necessarily avant-garde or experimental, Schrader makes the kinds of movies talked about more among film buffs than mass audiences. His 2017 \u201cFirst Reformed,\u201d for example, will not satiate those who crave closure or clear-cut endings. And \u201cOh, Canada\u201d is not exactly action-packed.",
      "But Elordi rejects the notion that Schrader\u2019s movies aren\u2019t accessible to a wide audience.",
      "\u201cThat kind of gives you like this elitist feel, you know? I hate that cinema conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a language in cinema that doesn\u2019t really take a long time to learn if you are sort of watching healthy things.\u201d",
      "Still, Elordi acknowledged certain movies require patience and a willingness to sit with ambiguity.",
      "\u201cMy mom says stuff like that to me all the time. She\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, but the movie can\u2019t just end. Like, I need to know about this, this and this.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018No, no, the movie can just end, and you can go away and think about it,\u2019\u201d he said."

      "Don\u2019t go looking in Wikipedia for architect L\u00e1zl\u00f3 T\u00f3th",
      "\u201cThe making of a good building,\u201d observed architect Frank Lloyd Wright, \u201cis a great moral performance.\u201d",
      "Like many notable quotes about architecture, it speaks to grandeur, permanence, scale. One imagines L\u00e1zl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, the visionary Hungarian architect who escaped the Holocaust and sailed to the United States to find his American Dream, would heartily agree.",
      "But don\u2019t go looking on Wikipedia. T\u00f3th, played with deep soul and unrelenting intensity by Adrien Brody in \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d is actually fictional, though you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise, so richly realized is his story in director Brady Corbet\u2019s audacious new film. Though not for everyone, it's a film that can justifiably be described as \u201cepic\u201d in ambition and design. And, wouldn't you know, ambition and design are precisely what the movie\u2019s about.",
      "Of course, that\u2019s not all. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which takes its name from the raw style of architecture that T\u00f3th creates, is also about the incalculable trauma that followed World War II. It\u2019s about the immigrant experience, and it\u2019s about what happens when the American Dream beckons, then fails. It also explores a different dream: the artist\u2019s dream, and what happens when it meets opposing forces, be they geographic displacement or cold economic calculus.",
      "Not to mix our arts metaphors, but it\u2019s fair to say a story like this needs a pretty big canvas. Corbet, working with co-writer Mona Fastvold, definitely gives himself that, shooting in VistaVision, with its expansive field of view; dividing his film into movements like a symphony; and finally, allowing himself a whopping three hours and 35 minutes, including a built-in intermission. The parallels with architecture here seem clear. Make a building, or make a movie \u2014 but if you\u2019re thinking small, go home.",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d spans 30 years in the life of T\u00f3th, whom we first meet in a terrific sequence, darting through darkness. It soon emerges these are the chaotic alleys of an immigrant ship. He\u2019s been left with nothing, but still lucky: unlike more than half of fellow Hungarian Jews, he's survived the Holocaust. His first view of the United States is the Statue of Liberty towering above the deck \u2014 filmed upside down, a choice we\u2019ll understand better later.",
      "T\u00f3th heads to Philadelphia, where he\u2019s greeted by cousin Attila (Alessandro Nivola), who'll let him work at his furniture store. Attila also bears monumental news: L\u00e1zl\u00f3's beloved wife, Erzs\u00e9bet (Felicity Jones) has survived her own ordeal in the camps, and is alive in Europe. (Just watching Brody receive this news is a vision hard to shake \u2014 the actor, himself the son of a Hungarian refugee, is doing his best work here since his Oscar-winning performance in \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d)",
      "A fortunate break comes when Harry Lee Van Buren (Joe Alwyn), the haughty, aristocratic son of industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren, comes looking for help renovating a library for his father. The perfectionist T\u00f3th begins creating a modernist gem, with daylight shining from above onto a single elegant reading chair and lamp (at moments, this movie's a great advertisement for architecture school).",
      "But then Dad himself \u2014 an impeccably clad, impossibly dapper yet explosive and ultimately monstrous character played to the hilt by Guy Pearce \u2014 shows up too early, infuriated that his library's been torn up. He expels the cousins and they don\u2019t get paid. T\u00f3th ends up in a church shelter, shoveling coal by day.",
      "But the elder Van Buren comes to see his error, especially when the press picks up on his library. Soon, T\u00f3th is dining with the wealthy at Van Buren\u2019s palatial Doylestown estate, and learning that Van Buren has tapped him to build a vast community center atop a hill to honor his mother.",
      "The film\u2019s second part opens with Erzs\u00e9bet arriving in America, along with T\u00f3th's niece Zs\u00f3fia (Raffey Cassidy). Erzs\u00e9bet, given a sensitive, intelligent portrayal by Jones, is suffering deeply from the physical effects of the war. She also quickly sees the darker side of the Van Burens. But T\u00f3th is stuck, mired in a project that will take years, a living hostage to the Van Burens on their estate, fighting for every phase of the project and darned near going mad \u2014 on top of a drug addiction stemming from the war \u2014 as Van Buren demands cuts and compromises, including the height of his building.",
      "A beautiful \u2013 and horrible \u2014 sequence comes in the exquisite marble quarries of Carrara, in Italy, where T\u00f3th travels with Van Buren to choose a final piece. The beauty is in the filmmaking. The horror is in what transpires between the men \u2014 and it's arguably an uncomfortably jarring note, given how suddenly it seems to arrive out of the blue.",
      "A coda, decades later in Venice, reveals something profound about why T\u00f3th was so insistent about the measurements of his Doylestown creation. And so, yes, it takes more than three hours for us to learn the full truth about T\u00f3th's vision.",
      "Not all directors can pull off such a feat and make it worth our while. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d like its protagonist, is not without flaws or incongruities or indulgences. But it hardly seems accidental that one of the film\u2019s key lines tells us it\u2019s the destination, not the journey, that matters. Corbet went big here \u2014 really big \u2014 and it paid off.",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d an A24 release, is unrated by the Motion Picture Association. Running time: 215 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "Each volume features collaborations with artists across the globe. But this time, the 30-year-old also harnessed voices of the audience at his shows to create harmonies for the album. Collier often acts as a conductor at his concerts, directing different sections of the crowd to sing segments of his songs, placing microphones around the venue to record their contributions.",
      "One track on \u201cDjesse Vol. 4\u201d is titled \u201c100,000 Voices,\" and it quite literally features that many singers.",
      "\u201cThere's like over 100,000 people on the album,\u201d he says. \u201cOver 100 of those are established artists or members of groups like orchestras and choirs and things that I really love and respect, from every single continent of the world. But yeah, most of 100,000 voices are the audience members from tour.\u201d",
      "His inventive approach to composition has scored him three Grammy nominations for the 2025 award show, including album of the year, global music performance and best arrangement, instrumental or a cappella.",
      "He's also the first British artist to win a Grammy for each of his first four albums. Not bad for an artist that began his career posting on YouTube, later to become mentored by the late-great producer Quincy Jones and release a number of critically acclaimed records.",
      "Still, Collier can't believe he's once again up for album of the year, the show's top prize. (\u201cDjesse Vol. 3\u201d was nominated in 2021 but lost to Taylor Swift's \u201cfolklore.\u201d) In 2025, the other nominees include Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Billie Eilish.",
      "\u201cIt's thrilling and wild,\u201d he says of the honor.",
      "\u201cThe album is in some ways like a celebration of the human voice,\u201d he says of \u201cDjesse Vol. 4.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m almost more proud of what that means philosophically than I am for, like, these specific songs on the record be recognized (for awards). But it\u2019s a really thrilling predicament.\u201d",
      "Collier believes that everyone can sing and considers himself to be \u201ca leader of a choir,\u201d in his audience improvisations and onstage collaborators. \u201cI really try to make space for all these different kinds of people to just feel welcome,\" he says. \"And if they can feel welcome, then they\u2019re a part of the music.\u201d",
      "\u201cDjesse Vol. 4\u201d contains collaborations with artists across genres, including Brandi Carlile, Camilo, aespa, Shawn Mendes, Stormzy, John Legend, Tori Kelly and Coldplay's Chris Martin.",
      "But now that Collier has completed the \u201cDjesse\u201d series, what's next?",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a clear idea of exactly what\u2019s coming next, which I love, actually. Sometimes in life you need those moments of question marks,\" he says.",

      "Carey has turned the song into an event, regularly hosting Christmas concerts to celebrate her undisputed smash and long career as a holiday icon. This year, she embarked on the \u201cChristmas Time\u201d tour, a variety show that kicked off on Nov. 6 in Highland, California, hitting many major North American cities, before concluding on Tuesday night at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.",
      "It came to an end in front of a crowd donning shimmery Santa hats and red sequin party dresses. Carey descended onto the stage in a snowflake-shaped throne, leading the audience into a few church staples: \u201cSilent Night\u201d and \u201cO Holy Night\u201d among them.",
      "Her children, twins Roc and Roe, joined in on the fun. At one point, Carey detoured into a medley of her biggest hits: \u201cEmotions,\u201d \u201cHero,\" \u201cFantasy,\u201d and \u201cWe Belong Together\u201d among them.",
      "The latter moment came with an unexpected surprise: the elusive Rihanna was in the audience, and Carey signed her chest during an arena-wide sing-a-long of \u201cAlways Be My Baby.\u201d Ri disappeared as quickly as she emerged, but Carey kept the momentum up, concluding the only way she could \u2014 with a spirited rendition of \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Carey's first Christmas album, 1994's \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d turned 30. She told The Associated Press she originally felt apprehensive to record a holiday album and then gave in to the festive spirit.",
      "\u201cI was very young and was just starting out and I felt like people do Christmas albums later in their lives. But now people have started to do them whenever, like right at the top of their career,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I decorated the studio and just had the best time.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 10:34:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Films that are straightforwardly about death are rare, but movies that are about both death and sex are rarer, still",

      "Films that are straightforwardly about death are rare, but movies that are about both death and sex are rarer, still",
      "Films that are straightforwardly about death are rare, but movies that are about both death and sex are rarer, still.",
      "In Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d the Spanish director\u2019s first English-language feature film, Julianne Moore plays Ingrid, a celebrated author who\u2019s just written a book about death. She\u2019s at a book signing in New York when she hears that an old friend, a war correspondent named Martha Hunt ( Tilda Swinton ), has been diagnosed with cancer.",
      "Ingrid rushes to Martha in the hospital, and the two friends, who haven\u2019t seen each other in years, quickly get reacquainted. Soon, Martha\u2019s cancer worsens and she asks Ingrid to assist her in self-euthanasia. \u201cThe cancer can\u2019t get me if I get the cancer first,\u201d she says.",
      "Why not ask someone she\u2019s closer with? Well, she has, Martha says, but for various reasons none of them are willing. With an illegal pill bought from, as she says, \u201cthe dark web\u201d and a slight conspiratorial vibe that they\u2019re committing a crime together, they travel to a modernist house in upstate New York where Martha plans to end her life. She'll be comforted, she believes, having Ingrid just down the hall. Martha doesn't want any fuss, just a nice time. \u201cAs if we were on vacation,\" she says.",
      "\u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d the title of which plays off Virginia Woolf\u2019s \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own,\u201d is about finding dignity and contentment with death as a natural part of life, and, perhaps, the mystery of the relationships that end up mattering the most. The one thing Martha and Ingrid share is a former lover (played by John Turturro ), who turns up again in clandestine meetings with Ingrid. He\u2019s preoccupied with environmental disaster and the death of the planet, but fondly recalls sleeping with Martha as \u201clike having sex with a terrorist \u2013 it always felt like the last time.\u201d",
      "No one besides Almod\u00f3var can get away with lines like this, in any language. A less fevered austerity has crept into some of his fine late-period movies (particularly \u201cPain and Glory\u201d but also \u201cParallel Mothers\u201d ), but within them still beats a passionate, melodramatic heart. Death is everywhere in \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own.\" The movie is very much in dialogue with other works like James Joyce\u2019s \u201cThe Dead.\" (They watch John Huston's 1987 adaptation one night.) But it\u2019s not an especially dour film, and you sense, in it\u2019s boldly colorful designs and lush storytelling that Almod\u00f3var is as concerned with life as he is with death.",
      "\u201cI still think sex is the best way to fend off looming thoughts of death,\u201d Martha tells Ingrid.",
      "Not all of this works, even if every bit of \u201cThe Room Next Door\u201d feels conjured \u2014 as is typical of Almod\u00f3var's thickly layered films \u2014 from a fully fleshed-out emotional terrain. (Here, he adapts Sigrid Nunez\u2019s 2020 American novel, \u201cWhat Are You Going Through.\") There's an awkward and overdone flashback early in the film when Martha recalls her painful history with the father to her estranged daughter. Some of the dialogue can sound stilted.",
      "But what absolutely, undoubtedly does work is Moore and Swinton together. If some of the more melodramatic or crime-movie flourishes feel forced, the central relationship of \u201cThe Room Next Door\u201d is consistently provocative. Swinton, in particular, is extraordinarily deft at finding Martha's singular equilibrium: on the brink of death but still alive to so much \u2014 books, movies, the conversation of a friend. Death is coming, so best to spend what's left in good company.",
      "\u201cThe Room Next Door,\" a Sony Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for thematic content, strong language and some sexual reference. Running time: 110 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "No one was expecting it",
      "NEW YORK -- No one was expecting it. Late last year, Andr\u00e9 3000 released his debut solo album, \u201cNew Blue Sun,\u201d 18 years after his legendary rap group Outkast's last studio album, \u201cIdlewild.\u201d",
      "But \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d has \u201cno bars,\u201d he jokes. It's a divergence from rap because \u201cthere was nothing I was liking enough to rap about, or I didn't feel it sounded fresh. I'm not about to serve you un-fresh (expletive.)\u201d",
      "Instead, he offered up a six-track instrumental album of ambient alt-jazz \u2014 with special attention paid to the flute.",
      "\u201cThe sound, that's how I got into it,\u201d he says of the instrument. \u201cThe portability, too. You can't tote around a piano and play in Starbucks.\"",
      "He's also invested in the flute's history \u2014 like learning about Mayan flutes made from clay, a design he had re-created in cedarwood. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of fables and, you know, indigenous stories that go along with playing the flute \u2014 playing like the birds or playing your heart like the wind \u2014 it kind of met (me) where I was in life,\" he says.",
      "\u201cFlutes \u2014 wind instruments in general \u2014 are the closest thing you get to actually hearing a human,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou're actually hearing the breath of a person.\u201d",
      "\u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d is a stunning collection, one that has earned Andr\u00e9 3000 three new Grammy Award nominations: album of the year, alternative jazz, and instrumental composition. Those arrive exactly 25 years after the 1999 Grammys, where Outkast received their first nomination \u2014 for \u201cRosa Parks,\u201d from their third album, \u201cAquemini\" \u2014 and 20 years after the group won album of the year for \u201cSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt matters because we all want to be acknowledged or recognized,\u201d Andr\u00e9 3000 says of his new Grammy nominations. \u201cIt's a type of proof of connection, in some type of way ... especially with the Grammys, because it's voted on by a committee of musicians and people in the industry.\u201d",
      "He's a bit surprised by the attention, too, given the type of album he created. \u201cWe have no singles on the radio, not even singles that are hot in the street,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you're sitting next to Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift, these are highly, hugely popular music artists, I'm satisfied just because of that ... we won just to be a part of the whole conversation.\"",
      "He theorizes that it may be because popular music listening habits are broadening. \u201cA lot of artists are just trying different things. Even, you know, the album that Beyonc\u00e9 is nominated for, it\u2019s not her normal thing,\u201d he says of her country-and-then-some record, \u201cCowboy Carter.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re in this place where things are kind of shifting and moving.\"",
      "For Andr\u00e9 3000, \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d has allowed him to \u201cfeel like a whole new artist,\u201d but it is also an extension of who he's always been. \u201cBeing on the road with Outkast and picking up a bass clarinet at a pawn shop in New York and just sitting on the back of the bus playing with it \u2014 these things have been around,\u201d he says.",
      "He's also always embraced \u201cnewness,\u201d as he puts it, experimenting creatively \u201ceven if it sounds non-masterful.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven producing for Outkast, I was just learning these instruments. If I ... put my hands down and play \u2018Ms. Jackson,\u2019 I'm not knowing what I'm playing. But I like it,\u201d he says.",
      "As for a new Outkast album, \u201cI never say never,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can say that the older I get, I feel like that time has happened.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Megan Thee Stallion asked a court on Tuesday to issue a restraining order against Tory Lanez, who she says is harassing her from prison through surrogates as he serves a 10-year sentence for shooting her in the feet.",
      "The petition filed by the hip-hop star in Los Angeles Superior Court asks the judge to prevent the Canadian rapper Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, from using third parties to continue the same online harassment of Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, that he engaged in and encouraged before his imprisonment.",
      "\u201cEven now, while behind bars, Mr. Peterson shows no signs of stopping,\u201d the petition says. \"Despite being sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting Ms. Pete, Mr. Peterson continues to to subject her to repeated trauma and revictimization.\"",
      "The petition says prison call logs from Lanez at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi show that he is coordinating attacks on Megan's credibility.",
      "An email seeking comment from Lanez's lawyers was not immediately returned. A court hearing on the order is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "The filing says bloggers acting on Lanez behalf continue to cast doubt on her allegations, making false claims including that the gun and bullet fragments in the case are missing.",
      "The petition says the protective order issued to prevent the previous harassment is no longer in effect, which it calls a loophole and flaw in the criminal justice system.",
      "In December 2022, Lanez was convicted of three felonies: assault with a semiautomatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.",
      "A judge rejected a motion for a new trial from Lanez's lawyers, who are appealing his conviction.",
      "In August of last year, he received the 10-year sentence, bringing what seemed to be a conclusion to a three-year legal and cultural saga that saw two careers, and lives, thrown into turmoil.",
      "The petition says that one blogger in particular, Elizabeth Milagro Cooper, whom Megan is suing in a separate lawsuit, is acting as Lanez \u201cpuppet and mouthpiece.\u201d She alleges Cooper is spreading falsehoods on social media and YouTube, saying in one video posted to X, \u201cCan you even prove she was shot?\" and calling her a \u201cprofessional victim\u201d in another post.",
      "Cooper's attorney Michael Pancier declined comment on the California petition, and said in an email that their forthcoming response to the separate federal lawsuit against her will speak for itself.",
      "A previous motion to dismiss Megan's lawsuit said it makes \u201cdubious legal claims\u201d and \u201cirrelevant and impertinent allegations.\u201d",
      "Megan testified during the trial that in July 2020, after they left a party at Kylie Jenner's Hollywood Hills home, Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding. She revealed who had fired the gun only months later.",
      "The case created a firestorm in the hip-hop community, churning up issues including the reluctance of Black victims to speak to police, gender politics in hip-hop, online toxicity, protecting Black women and the ramifications of misogynoir, a particular brand of misogyny Black women experience.",
      "Megan Thee Stallion, now 29, was already a major rising star at the time of the shooting, and her music\u2019s popularity has soared since. She won a Grammy for best new artist in 2021, and she had No. 1 singles with \u201cSavage,\u201d featuring Beyonc\u00e9, and as a guest on Cardi B\u2019s \u201cWAP.\u201d",
      "Lanez, 32, began releasing mixtapes in 2009 and saw a steady rise in popularity, moving on to major label albums. His last two reached the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s charts."

      "The song semifinalists include several notable artists, like Pharrell Williams for \u201cPiece by Piece,\u201d Lainey Wilson for her \u201cTwisters\u201d song \u201cOut of Oklahoma,\u201d Elton John and Brandi Carlile for \u201cNever Too Late\u201d and Robbie Williams for \u201cForbidden Road\u201d from \u201cBetter Man.\u201d Diane Warren may also be heading for a 16th nomination for her song from \u201cThe Six Triple Eight.\u201d Nicholas Britell\u2019s \u201cWinter Coat,\u201d performed by Saoirse Ronan in \u201cBlitz,\u201d was also included, as was Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s \u201cTell Me It\u2019s You\u201d from \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d performed by Aaron Pierre and Tiffany Boone.",
      "Among the 15 documentaries eligible for nominations are \u201cThe Bibi Files,\u201d\u201cDaughters,\u201d \u201cEno,\u201d \u201cFrida,\u201d\u201cThe Remarkable Life of Ibelin,\u201d \u201cDahomey,\u201d \u201cUnion,\u201d \u201cPorcelain War\u201d and \u201cNo Other Land.\u201d",
      "There are also 15 international features advancing, including \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d (Brazil), \u201cUniversal Language\u201d (Canada), \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\u201d (Germany), \u201cKneecap\u201d (Ireland), \u201cVermiglio\u201d (Italy), \u201cFlow\u201d (Latvia) and \u201cDahomey\u201d (Senegal).",
      "As most of the shortlists are in below-the-line categories celebrating crafts, there are also films that aren\u2019t necessarily the most obvious of Oscar contenders. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d was singled out for both sound and visual effects, as was \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d which also got a nod for score.",
      "\u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d included in visual effects, sound and makeup and hair, was notably not among the 20 score finalists. Hans Zimmer\u2019s work was not eligible because it contained too much preexisting music from the first \u201cDune.\u201d He did make the cut for \u201cBlitz,\u201d however, as did Danny Elfman for \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice,\u201d Kris Bowers for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d Bryce Dessner for \u201cSing Sing\u201d and Daniel Blumberg for \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "For the most part, shortlists are determined by members in their respective categories, though the specifics vary from branch to branch: Some have committees, some have minimum viewing requirements.",
      "These lists will narrow to five when final nominations are announced on Jan. 17. The 97th Oscars, hosted by Conan O\u2019Brien, will be held on Sunday, March 2, broadcasting on ABC and streaming live on Hulu."

      "Pop star and fashion designer Pharrell Williams has been named UNESCO\u2019s goodwill ambassador for artistic education and entrepreneurship on Tuesday in Paris",
      "PARIS -- Pop star and fashion designer Pharrell Williams was named UNESCO\u2019s goodwill ambassador for artistic education and entrepreneurship on Tuesday in Paris, continuing his cultural dominance of the French capital as Louis Vuitton menswear artistic director and performer at Notre Dame Cathedral\u2019s reopening earlier this month.",
      "Williams said he hoped to \u201cdeepen that sense of unity and togetherness\u201d in work that \u201cevens the odds for marginalized communities.\u201d",
      "He also spoke about his impoverished youth, adding: \u201cGrowing up in Virginia, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be given an opportunity like this one.\"",
      "The role of goodwill ambassador for the Paris-based U.N. cultural agency involves promoting its initiatives that include protecting Indigenous cultures, advancing education and health care for women, raising awareness about genocide prevention and safeguarding cultural heritage.",
      "The U.N. agency said Williams will be \u201ca mentor and role model for young creators, particularly in Africa, where UNESCO supports the development of cultural industries.\u201d",
      "Williams joins a list of goodwill ambassadors that includes U.S. jazz musician Herbie Hancock, Brazilian artist Vik Muniz and Japanese filmmaker Naomi Kawase.",
      "Williams has been particularly visible in Paris this year. Shortly before the Paris Olympics, his role as Louis Vuitton menswear designer took center stage during a star-studded event at UNESCO\u2019s headquarters. The show, celebrating the beauty of human skin, featured models wearing garments in shades representing the diverse hues of humanity.",
      "UNESCO leaders hope that Williams' global influence and deep connections to fashion and music will draw fresh attention to the agency\u2019s work.",
      "Williams is American, and his selection as goodwill ambassador also may be highlighting the readmission of the United States to UNESCO last year.",
      "The U.S. exit under President Donald Trump cited alleged anti-Israel bias within the agency. The decision followed a 2011 decision by UNESCO to include Palestine as a member state, which led the U.S. and Israel to cease financing for the agency.",
      "The U.S. return under President Joe Biden was marked by a flag-raising ceremony attended by U.S. First Lady Jill Biden."

      "\u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d in theaters Thursday, takes audiences back to Mufasa's days as a cub and explains how he and Scar came to be brothers",
      "\u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d has one very important thing going for it: an original story.",
      "That may seem like faint praise or at least a very, very low bar in the grand scheme of things. But in a landscape where Disney continues to remake its animated catalogue in slightly different, and usually less interesting, forms whether \u201clive action\u201d or \u201cphotorealistic\u201d that usually only serves to remind how good the 2D animation was, originality is not to be undervalued.",
      "And this story isn\u2019t simply checking off fan service boxes and overexplaining origins that never needed them: It\u2019s actually good. A prequel to \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d opening in theaters Thursday, it\u2019s a tale of found family, betrayal and destiny, one that begins to explain the estrangement between brothers Scar and Mufasa that we all know will end in murder, how Mufasa ( Aaron Pierre ) ends up as king of the pride lands and, perhaps most importantly, why only one has an English accent.",
      "In this telling, Scar was once Taka (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), destined to be king of his pride, and Mufasa was a lost cub, separated from his parents in a dramatic flood. Taka saves Mufasa and brings him into his family. His mother (Thandiwe Newton) embraces the newcomer; his father (Lennie James) rejects him as nothing but a stray. Not that it matters much to the cubs; both are thrilled to have a brother. They play and protect one another and grow up together. But fissures start to appear in this foundation as Mufasa emerges as the exceptional one and Taka as the coward. And then a lioness enters the picture in Sarabi (Tiffany Boone). We\u2019ve all seen enough movies to know what happens with that.",
      "The screenplay comes from veteran screenwriter Jeff Nathanson, whose credits include the 2019 \u201cLion King,\u201d this year\u2019s lovely \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea\u201d and \u201cCatch Me If You Can.\u201d He clearly took a corporate mandate (give us more \u201cLion King\u201d) and made the absolute least cynical version of that. There are still questionable corporate-feeling choices, like straining to tie it to a current and future \u201cLion King\u201d by having Rafiki (John Kani) tell the story to Simba (Donald Glover) and Nala\u2019s ( Beyonc\u00e9 ) daughter Kiara ( Blue Ivy Carter ), Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) and Timon (Billy Eichner). These comedic breaks, and Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s songs peppered throughout, aren\u2019t additive. They really only serve to break up the momentum of the compelling main story.",
      "But the biggest issue remains the form itself. The photo-realistic computer-generated animals may have technically improved since the 2019 \u201cLion King,\u201d but they still aren\u2019t movie stars like their 2D animation counterparts. Impressive though it may be intellectually, the reality of watching these animals for two hours is a somewhat numbing and dull experience despite the best efforts of director Barry Jenkins. The Oscar-winning filmmaker of \u201cMoonlight\u201d did an admirable job adding visual interest and color into the landscapes, bringing it closer to the vibrancy of animation than ever before, and making it as cinematic as possible. The original story also helps here in that he was never going to have to recreate iconic sequences in a less stimulating form. There are just inherent limitations that filmmakers have not yet figured out, including how odd it looks for these animals\u2019 mouths to be moving and speaking English words. It\u2019s strangest when they\u2019re singing, mouths agape to hold the long notes in a way that no lion\u2019s mouth should ever appear.",
      "If this is one future for filmmaking there\u2019s still a lot of room for improvement and experimentation. That doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be embraced while the kinks are worked out. But it also doesn\u2019t mean the moviegoing public has to get excited about every rehash. \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d is better than the ones that came before it, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s great.",
      "\u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d a Walt Disney Studios release in theaters Thursday, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cperil, action/violence and some thematic elements.\u201d Running time: 118 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "The Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday said it will soon require hotels, vacation rental platforms and live event promoters to disclose any fees up front when they list prices.",
      "The FTC said consumers often see advertised prices for hotel rooms, short-term rentals, and tickets to sporting events and concerts only to be surprised later by so-called \u201cjunk fees,\u201d including resort fees, cleaning fees, processing fees and other extra charges.",
      "\u201cPeople deserve to know up front what they\u2019re being asked to pay without worrying that they\u2019ll later be saddled with mysterious fees that they haven\u2019t budgeted for and can\u2019t avoid,\u201d FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement.",
      "The rule is scheduled to go into effect in 120 days.",
      "Ticketmaster said Tuesday it supports the new rule.",
      "\u201cTicketmaster has long advocated for all-in pricing as a nationwide industry standard, and we\u2019re pleased to see the FTC mandate the necessary changes to make ticket-buying more transparent for fans,\u201d the company said.",
      "The Associated Press left a message seeking comment Tuesday with the American Hotel and Lodging Association.",
      "Four of the FTC\u2019s five commissioners voted to approve the rule. Commissioner Andrew Ferguson, \u2013 who is President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to replace Khan, was the one dissenting vote.",
      "The rule requires lodging and ticketing businesses to clearly and conspicuously disclose the true cost \u2013 including all mandatory fees \u2013 when they display any pricing. Businesses that exclude taxes or shipping fees from advertised prices must also disclose them before customers enter any payment information.",
      "The FTC estimates the rule will save U.S. consumers 53 million hours per year of time spent searching for the true price of lodging or events.",
      "The FTC launched the rule-making process in 2022, asking for public input on whether a fee-disclosure rule might help eliminate unfair and deceptive pricing. The agency said more than 12,000 people commented.",
      "Junk fees and deceptive pricing are also one of the reasons the Department of Justice sued Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, earlier this year. The government asked a court to separate the companies, saying they have a monopoly on concert promotion and ticketing that drives up price for consumers.",
      "The Biden administration also has targeted the fee practices of U.S. airlines, banks and online payment platforms."

      "Panto is as much a part of Christmas in Britain as turkey, tinsel and mince pies",
      "LONDON -- Here\u2019s a recipe as essential to Christmas in Britain as turkey, tinsel and mince pies.",
      "Mix a fairy-tale plot with topical references, slapstick, song, dance and double entendres. Drench in sequins and spangles, mix vigorously, add some noisy audience participation, and you have a panto.",
      "Pantos \u2014 short for pantomimes \u2014 are stage musicals that play at theaters big and small across the U.K. each winter. Formulaic but anarchic, family friendly but a little risque, they are a holiday tradition that give many children their first exposure to live theater \u2014 and adults a chance to cut loose.",
      "Anyone who thinks Britons are buttoned up hasn't been to a panto. Audiences happily shed their inhibitions \u2013 cheering, singing, hissing the villain, shouting \u201cHe\u2019s behind you!\u201d to warn the hero.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s singing, dancing, laughing \u2014 taking the family out and being able to be out with their kids and letting the kids run riot,\u201d said Clive Rowe, who directed and stars in \u201cDick Whittington and his Cat\u201d at the Hackney Empire \u2014 his 17th annual panto for the storied east London theater.",
      "Pantomime has deep roots, stretching back to the stock characters and bawdy humor of the 16th-century Italian commedia dell\u2019arte and the French harlequinade, as well as the English music hall. By the late 19th century, the elements had gelled into a form still recognizable today.",
      "The plots are drawn from well-known fairy tales and children\u2019s stories such as \u201cAladdin,\u201d \u201cSnow White\u201d and \u201cCinderella.\u201d Characters include a plucky hero, or \u201cprincipal boy,\u201d often played by a woman, an outrageous villain, and a \u201cdame,\u201d a sharp-tongued matron who is always played by a man in fabulously flamboyant drag.",
      "\u201cThe pantomime dame is the beating heart of the show,\u201d said Simon Sladen, curator of theater and performance at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum. \u201cShe is that engine that drives it. Firstly with pace and anarchy, but also a little bit of sauce on the side.\u201d",
      "An estimated 3 million people in Britain attend a pantomime each year, in venues ranging from small regional theaters to London West End playhouses. Many theaters rely on them for a big chunk of their annual income.",
      "When London\u2019s theaters were closed for months by pandemic lockdowns in 2020, panto dames led a protest march through the city to stress their importance to the creative economy.",
      "They provide seasonal work to faded pop stars, television entertainers, the occasional Hollywood celebrity \u2014 Pamela Anderson took Liverpool by storm when she starred in \u201cAladdin\u201d in 2010, singing \u201cSanta Baby\u201d while suspended on a swing above the stage, dressed in costumes by Vivienne Westwood.",
      "They are also vital experience for many young actors, including the A-listers of tomorrow.",
      "Jude Law told The Associated Press recently that he\u2019d played Humpty Dumpty, recalling his performance as \u201cloud and round.\u201d At 17, Michael Fassbender played one of Cinderella\u2019s Ugly Sisters, and a tree.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d star Jonathan Bailey starred alongside a young Nicholas Hoult in a production of \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d Hoult also appeared in \u201cMother Goose\u201d as a child, and says he would happily do another, as they\u2019re \u201creally fun.\u201d",
      "Asked to sum up the art form, Bailey called it a \u201cquintessentially British bloody good time for all the family.\u201d",
      "Today\u2019s pantos often strive to reflect diversity, both onstage and in the audience. Rowe, whose Hackney Empire pantos draw many of their cast and crew from Britain\u2019s Black communities, said that at its core the genre is \u201cabout acceptance.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about understanding, it\u2019s about the idea that being different isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be brought in and kind of celebrated and that no matter where you are in society, from the youngest to the oldest, we all have a place and we should embrace that.\u201d",
      "Drag performer Ginger Johnson, starring in an adult \u201call-drag panto\u201d version of \u201cPeter Pan\u201d at London\u2019s Phoenix Theatre, said that panto\u2019s ability to change is \u201cwhy it\u2019s managed to survive for so long as a cultural form.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think for a lot of kids, panto is the first time that they come in contact with drag as well,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Stage historian Sladen said that some are leaning into the drag element of panto, with \u201ca bigger, wider explosion of roles than just the dame and the principal boy being cross-dressed.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe might see the fairy godmother played by a dame or played by a drag artist. We might see a wicked stepmother, also played by a very well-known drag performer. So (it\u2019s) constantly evolving, constantly changing with the times.\u201d",

      "A representative of CVS said the company has cooperated with the DOJ\u2019s investigation for more than four years, and strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called the \u201cfalse narrative\u201d within the complaint.",
      "Among the unlawful prescriptions that CVS allegedly filled from Oct. 17, 2013, to the present were for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, early fills of opioids, and \u201ctrinity\u201d prescriptions \u2014 a dangerous combination of drugs made up of an opioid, a benzodiazepine and a muscle relaxant, according to prosecutors.",
      "CVS also allegedly filled large quantities of prescriptions for controlled substances written by prescribers it knew to be engaged in \u201cpill mill practices\u201d \u2014 that is, prescribers who issue large numbers of controlled substance prescriptions without any medical purpose, investigators said.",
      "According to the complaint, CVS ignored substantial evidence from multiple sources, including its own pharmacists and internal data, indicating that its stores were dispensing such prescriptions.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit alleges that CVS failed to exercise its critical role as gatekeeper of dangerous prescription opioids and, instead, facilitated the illegal proliferation of these highly addictive drugs, including by pill mill prescribers,\" U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha for the District of Rhode Island said in a press release.",
      "If CVS is found liable, it could face civil penalties for each unlawful prescription filled and treble damages and other penalties for each prescription reimbursed by federal health care programs.",

Earlier in the epidemic, prescription pills were the primary cause of death.",

    "story": [
      "Arizona's governor wants to repeal the state law requiring an annual abortion report",
      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs is calling for legislators to repeal the state law that requires an annual abortion report, saying that it infringes on patients' privacy, which echoes other Democratic officials' push to reduce or eliminate such requirements.",
      "\u201cThe government has no place in surveilling Arizonans\u2019 medical decision-making or tracking their health history,\u201d Hobbs, a Democrat in a state where Republicans control the Legislature, said in a statement Wednesday as the state released its report covering 2023. \u201cStarting a family is a sensitive and personal experience for a woman and her loved ones; there should be no room for government surveillance and publication of that decision.\u201d",
      "Hobbs is not the only one concerned about the collection of abortion data, especially as Donald Trump prepares to take over as president again, when he could implement policies that are hostile, or at least less favorable, to abortion rights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really worth thinking carefully about the risk and the benefit of collecting data in this new environment,\u201d said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a researcher at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights and does its own voluntary surveys of abortion providers.",
      "A handful of Democratic-controlled states have reduced reporting requirements in recent years out of concern about privacy and also considering the burden it puts on providers to collect it all. Republican-run states generally ask for a lot, though many of them have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy or after roughly the first six weeks, before many people know they're pregnant.",
      "Michigan just released 2023 abortion data but is not collecting it at all going forward. Illinois has switched to aggregate reporting instead of requiring providers to send information about each individual abortion. Minnesota has reduced the number of questions they require to be tallied, eliminating data on marital status, race and ethnicity, among others.",
      "New York City has also cut back on asking the patient demographics questions.",
      "Abortion access has been shifting around the country since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion.",
      "Starting in the months before the Supreme Court ruling was released, the Society of Family Planning, which advocates for abortion rights, launched regular surveys of abortion providers about their work and has generally released the results quarterly. One of the lead researchers, University of California, San Francisco, public health social scientist Ushma Upadhyay, said the next report won't come out as soon as it otherwise might have.",
      "\u201cWe are delaying our next release to give providers time to adjust to the tenor of the new administration,\u201d she said, noting that she hopes providers continue to participate in the survey.",
      "Over the past two years, the report has shown that while abortions have become rare in the states where bans are in place, they've increased slightly overall as people travel for procedures or obtain pills via telemedicine.",
      "Arizona's policy changes have been more turbulent than most. Providers stopped offering abortions in 2022 amid legal questions about whether an 1864 ban on nearly all abortions was valid, then resumed them. Earlier this year, the state Supreme Court ruled that the old law could be enforced, but then put the start of enforcement on hold. Before it took effect, the state \u2014 aided by some GOP lawmakers joining Democrats \u2014 repealed the old law. And in November, voters added a right to abortion to the state constitution.",
      "The Arizona data made public on Wednesday reflects the policy changes \u2014 with the state going from just under 14,000 abortions in 2021 to 11,400 in 2022 to 12,700 last year. The 2024 numbers are not in the state's report, which is published by the Department of Health Services.",
      "The report began with voluntary participation from licensed providers in 1976 and became mandatory in 2010. The state collects detailed information, including whether minors have parental consent, as well as the age, marital status, and race and ethnicity of the patient. It also reports how many previous abortions and live births the patient has had, how far along in pregnancy she was, and whether the abortion involved a procedure or pills. But the data does not include the patient's name, address, birthdate or Social Security number.",
      "For years, four states with generally expansive abortion rights laws have skipped participating in the federal government's roundup of state data. California and Maryland don't collect the data. New Hampshire and New Jersey make it voluntary for hospitals and other providers to supply it.",
      "Rachel Rebouche, dean of the Temple University Beasley School of Law and an abortion law scholar, said states don't need to know personal information such as the name and address of people who receive abortions. And while it's useful to report basic information about abortion, she said, there are risks for abortion rights advocates, particularly in the reports from states with bans where the data mostly shows how often abortions are provided through exceptions.",
      "\u201cThe tension we find ourselves in is patient privacy,\u201d she said, \u201cbut also the looming allegation that exceptions are being misused.\u201d"

      "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving.",
      "This week, Undue Medical Debt, formerly RIP Medical Debt, announced it had received a rare third gift \u2014 $50 million \u2014 from the billionaire philanthropist, signaling her satisfaction with the group\u2019s efforts to purchase medical debt in bulk from hospitals and debt collectors. Scott has donated a total of $130 million to the organization since 2020.",
      "Medical debt is increasing despite most of the U.S. population having some form of medical insurance. Nearly 100 million people are unable to pay their medical bills, according to Third Way, a left-leaning national think tank.",
      "Overall, Americans owe about $220 billion in medical debt, with historically disadvantaged groups shouldering the bulk of the burden. Lower-income people, people with disabilities, middle-aged adults, Black people, the uninsured, and people living in rural areas are among the groups most likely to be affected by medical debt, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.",
      "Undue Medical Debt buys debt at a discounted price, estimating that it erases about $100 in debt for each $1 donated. The group also collaborates with policymakers to encourage the adoption of measures to curb what people owe for medical care. Scott first gave Undue Medical Debt a $50 million donation in 2020, followed by a $30 million donation in 2022.",
      "With that money, the group has relieved nearly $15 billion in debt for more than 9 million people, CEO Allison Sesso said. That\u2019s a significant leap from the $1 billion in debt relieved from 2014 to 2019, she noted.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m frankly astounded by this most recent gift from MacKenzie Scott and feel proud to be a steward of these funds as we continue the essential work of dismantling the yoke of medical debt that\u2019s burdening far too many families in this country,\u201d said Sesso.",
      "The continued funding has allowed Sesso \u201cto not have to worry about my next dollar,\u201d she said, and \u201cthink more strategically about the narrative around medical debt \u2014 she has helped us push that conversation.\u201d",
      "Undue Medical Debt was started in 2014 by two former debt collection executives, Jerry Ashton and Craig Antico, who were inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement\u2019s advocacy for debt relief. Growth initially was slow. But with Scott\u2019s gifts, the nonprofit has been able to staff up, produce more research, and develop relationships with policymakers who have pushed for changes to hospital billing practices to relieve debt and prevent people from accumulating it in the first place, Sesso said.",
      "Undue Medical Debt\u2019s public policy arm has worked with lawmakers in North Carolina, which in July became the first state to offer additional Medicaid payments to hospitals that agree to adopt debt relief measures, she said. The policy change followed the publication of a 2023 report from Duke University, which found that one in five families in the state had been forced into collections proceedings because of medical debt.",
      "Since 2020, the organization\u2019s staff has grown from three to about 40, Sesso said. Those hires included an anthropologist who collects stories from people set back by medical debt to inform the group\u2019s research and advocacy work. Scott\u2019s gifts also have helped improve Undue Medical Debt\u2019s technology to identify people eligible for debt relief and to find hospitals from which it can purchase medical debt, among other things, Sesso said.",
      "\u201cThis coming year, because of this MacKenzie Scott grant, we\u2019ll be able to add more people, making sure that we can support that growth on an ongoing basis,\u201d Sesso said.",
      "Few organizations have received more than one gift from Scott. Other multi-grant recipients include Blue Meridian, an intermediary group that has directed billions of dollars to nonprofits around the world, and GiveDirectly, which provides no-strings-attached cash payments to low-income people globally. GiveDirectly has received $125 million from Scott since 2020. Blue Meridian has not disclosed amounts for the four gifts it\u2019s received since 2019.",
      "Scott\u2019s contributions to those two organizations were for specific causes like GiveDirectly\u2019s U.S. poverty relief fund, said Christina Im, a senior research analyst at the Center for Effective Philanthropy. In the case of Undue Medical Debt, the timing of Scott\u2019s first gifts in 2020 and 2022 seemed to correspond with COVID-relief efforts, she said.",
      "Scott, the former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is worth an estimated $32 billion but provides few details about her grantmaking decisions. Without further information, it\u2019s hard to know what prompted this third donation to Undue Medical Debt, but Scott has said in public statements that she wants to help those who are most in need and bear the brunt of societal ills, said Elisha Smith Arrillaga, the Center for Effective Philanthropy\u2019s vice president for research.",
      "\u201cI have not seen a lot of other folks funding in this area,\u201d Smith Arrillaga added.",
      "Scott\u2019s latest gift to Undue Medical Debt comes amid national debates about medical insurance and the cost of medical treatments. The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on December 4 in Midtown Manhattan has heightened these conversations, with some lionizing the man who allegedly committed the crime.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s no way to get change, full stop,\u201d Sesso said in reference to Thompson\u2019s murder. \u201cBut I think the anger around insurance companies and having access to care is very clear.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has one of the most expensive health care systems in the world. And the amount of medical debt carried by individuals seems to be increasing, noted Adam Searing, a public interest attorney and associate professor at Georgetown University, where he focuses on Medicaid and other health coverage programs.",
      "Searing previously served for 17 years as director of the Health Access Coalition at the nonprofit North Carolina Justice Center, advocating for the uninsured and underinsured. During that time, he heard from people losing their homes due to liens from hospitals. Sometimes those liens could be delayed, but it still meant that the debtors couldn\u2019t pass those homes along to their children or grandchildren, he said.",
      "\u201cThose stories stuck with me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really has an impact on families.\u201d",
      "Relieving debt allows people to get their lives back on track and become financially secure after a major illness or series of expensive bills, Searing said. For philanthropists, it\u2019s also a cause that is largely nonpartisan. Scott shining a spotlight on the issue is undoubtedly \u201ca good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will have a big effect.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 13:54:27 -0500",

      "During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs",
      "WASHINGTON -- During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs. But not when it comes to Biden's Gender Policy Council, which has worked to defend reproductive health care in the face of growing restrictions.",
      "The first-of-its kind office was an effort to drive policy that would make life better for women and girls in the U.S. and in the world. Over the past four years, it has sought to advance reproductive freedom, make pay more equitable and increase participation by women in the workforce. It was formed through an executive order by Biden in September 2021, and members of his Cabinet have representatives on the council.",
      "It's not unusual for new presidents to remake the West Wing to suit incoming priorities, and the Trump administration hasn't said one way or the other whether the council will remain. But Project 2025, a conservative handbook written for an incoming GOP administration, has said it should be axed \u2014 in part because it promotes abortion. And Biden officials are concerned about what that might mean \u2014 particularly as reproductive health continues to worsen for some women across the nation following the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "Project 2025 is a detailed, 920-page roadmap for governing, led by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. A whirlwind of hard-right ambitions, its proposals include ousting thousands of civil servants and replacing them with Trump loyalists and reversing the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of medications used in abortions. The president-elect has claimed he has never seen it, but plenty of members of his incoming administration have written sections and many of Trump\u2019s policies align.",
      "According to the handbook, the incoming president should revoke the executive order that created the Gender Policy Council, \u201cand every policy, including subregulatory guidance documents, produced on behalf of or related to the establishment or promotion of the Gender Policy Council and its subsidiary issues.\u201d",
      "It mischaracterizes the office as one with a principal intent of \u201cgender affirming care\u201d and \u201csex-change\u201d surgeries on minors. The document also claims that by abolishing the office, Trump would \u201celiminate central promotion of abortion\" and \u201ccomprehensive sexuality education.\u201d",
      "It suggests, instead, that the president should spend time developing new structures dedicated to \u201cpromoting life and strengthening the family.\u201d",
      "Other presidents have carved out space for women's issues, but there has been no office within the West Wing specifically dedicated to advancing policy changes on behalf of women. Since the creation of the office, Biden has signed three executive orders and a presidential memorandum directing his administration to protect access to reproductive health, among other efforts.",
      "The council has also worked to address health disparities. Biden last year announced a women\u2019s health research initiative at wife Jill\u2019s urging that has invested nearly $1 billion. Women make up half of the U.S. population, about 168 million people, but medical research into their unique health circumstances has largely been underfunded and understudied.",
      "The council has also worked to lower child care payments and call for better paid leave for families.",
      "\u201cThe reality of the situation is that we\u2019ve done a huge amount that helps not only women \u2014 women and families \u2014 but really it helps our society as a whole,\" said Jen Klein, the chairwoman of the council.",
      "Klein believes that some of the work of the Gender Policy Council won\u2019t be undone. The Violence Against Women Act, for example, was reauthorized in 2022. And other issues have long been considered bipartisan. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is Trump's nominee for secretary of state, co-sponsored the Women, Peace and Security Act of 2017, a bipartisan law signed by Trump that seeks to protect women and girls globally from violence and include women in conflict prevention.",
      "\u201cWe had reached a point in American history where many of these issues were not only bipartisan, but where the business case had been made,\u201d Klein said. \u201cCare is a perfect example of that. If you think about the trajectory of the last 10 years, these are issues that are no longer seen as women\u2019s issues.\u201d",
      "But reproductive health care is much more contentious. The Gender Policy Council was formed before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned abortion rights in 2022. Since then, as states have restricted access to health care, access to abortion and other reproductive care has become a major focal point for the office.",
      "The council has spearheaded efforts throughout the administration to help safeguard access, including by working with the department of Health and Human Services to issue guidance reminding hospitals of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, a federal law that requires doctors to stabilize or treat any patient who shows up at an emergency room. Women have been turned away during miscarriages and left bleeding in parking lots in part because of abortion restrictions.",
      "Trump has waffled on abortion access particularly during his campaign. He has said that abortion limits should be left to the states, and has declined to endorse a national ban. Trump has shifted between boasting about nominating the justices who helped strike down federal protections for abortion and trying to appear more neutral.",
      "Most recently, he told NBC that he was not likely to restrict access to medication abortion. \u201cI'll probably stay with exactly what I've been saying for the last two years, and the answer is no,\" he said. But \u201cthings do change.\u201d"

In two cases \u2014 and adult in Missouri and a child in California \u2014 health officials have not determined how they caught it.",
      "CDC officials said that bird flu is still mainly an animal health issues and that the risk to the general public remains low. There has been no documented spread of the virus from person to person, said the CDC's Dr. Demetre Daskalakis.",
      "The Louisiana illness comes weeks after Canadian officials reported that a teen in British Columbia was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu. In both instances, the illnesses were caused by a strain of the virus found in wild birds, not in cattle, officials said.",
      "On a call with reporters, CDC officials did not answer a question about whether the new U.S. case and the Canada case had any similarities or differences.",
      "In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom declared the state of emergency as cases of the virus were detected in dairy cows on Southern California farms. Previously, the virus had been detected in state's Central Valley.",

      "Flu experts said the trajectory of the virus in people remains unclear, but they urged people who have contact with sick or dead birds to take precautions, including wearing respiratory and eye protection and gloves when handling poultry.",
      "\u201cWe may see more cases of severe disease in the U.S. since cases seem to be growing more frequent,\u201d said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",

      "Police in the United States rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after the use of force such as physical blows, restraints or Tasers",
      "Sitting alone in her car, Jen Dold was crying too hard to drive. She had just received a manila envelope with her brother\u2019s autopsy report.",
      "There it was, one devastating word: \u201caccident.\u201d The papers trembled in her hands.",
      "Their mother had called 911 for help getting Dold\u2019s 29-year-old brother, Alex, to the hospital because he was in a mental health crisis. Four sheriff\u2019s deputies and two police officers shocked him with Tasers, wrapped an arm around his neck, punched and kicked him, then left him face down until they noticed he wasn\u2019t breathing.",
      "How could that be an accident? Dold was certain it was a homicide.",
      "Angry and grieving in the parking lot outside the county medical examiner\u2019s office 30 miles north of Seattle, Dold vowed to fight.",
      "\u201cNo more silence or complacency,\u201d she thought. \u201cNo sweeping it under the rug.\u201d",
      "In the United States, police rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after officers use physical force. Whether they do can depend on a system that operates after the initial attention passes: medical examiners and coroners who decide how and why someone died \u2014 what\u2019s known as the manner and cause of death.",
      "On TV dramas such as \u201cCSI\u201d or \u201cBones,\u201d facts and established science determine whether a death was an accident or homicide. In reality, medical investigations involving police restraint deaths can be so riddled with inconsistencies, suspect science or conflicts of interest that even extensive force may matter little, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found.",
      "That investigation identified 1,036 deaths over a decade after police used not their guns but physical blows, restraints or weapons such as Tasers that aren\u2019t supposed to kill. Some people were causing little or no trouble, while others were committing violent crimes. Many died after officers broke widely known safety practices, or after medics injected them with powerful knock-out drugs, sometimes at the urging of police.",
      "Accident was the most common conclusion of medical investigations in AP\u2019s case database. Accidental rulings typically blamed preexisting conditions such as obesity or asthma, or drug use \u2014 even when in some cases blood testing did not detect lethal levels. Others faulted \u201cexcited delirium,\u201d a controversial diagnosis discredited by major medical associations. Some medical officials based their decisions not on physical evidence, but instead on whether they believed police intended to kill.",
      "Manner of death decisions are so pivotal that members of law enforcement and their allies push to shape them, with the multibillion-dollar company behind Tasers peppering medical officials with research it funded or wrote that downplays the dangers of its weapon.",
      "The degree of physical and professional separation a medical official had from local law enforcement appeared to affect rulings. Deaths were ruled accidents more frequently when medical examiners or coroners were in the same community as the department under investigation, or when they fell under the control of law enforcement.",
      "The mere location of a death has huge sway because each state designs its own system. Even within a state, county lines can matter. Death decisions are made in some places by doctors trained as forensic pathologists, in others by an elected coroner who may have no medical training and deep ties to local law enforcement.",
      "\u201cI call it a crazy quilt,\u201d said Dr. Victor Weedn, the former chief medical examiner of Maryland who has written about failed attempts to bring national consistency. Concerned about medical examiners\u2019 independence in police-involved deaths, he advocates for state health departments to take charge.",
      "When deaths are ruled accidental, prosecutions of officers are exceedingly rare \u2014 of the 443 cases the AP identified, just two resulted in criminal charges. A family\u2019s chances of winning a wrongful death lawsuit also become much tougher.",
      "\u201cI had a belief that the justice system was fair, that if you were a victim you\u2019d get justice, and the perpetrator would be convicted of their crime \u2014 police officer or not,\u201d Jen Dold said. \u201cSadly, we realized this was not the case.\u201d",
      "Jen Dold \u2014 11 years older than Alex \u2014 had been more like a doting mother to him growing up. When his schizophrenia began at 19, and he started to believe people were whispering and lurking outside his house, she became his primary caregiver, shuttling him around and helping him financially.",
      "One night in 2017, Alex Dold had an argument with his mother. He was in his late-20s, unemployed, living with her and off his medication. She had refused to give him more than his daily $30 from federal disability payments. So he yanked a lanyard around her neck, flipped the living room recliner where she sat, and left.",
      "The county mental health department wouldn\u2019t send someone, saying Dold wasn\u2019t violent enough.",
      "When Dold returned and sat down to watch television like nothing had happened, his mother called 911. She told the dispatcher her son was calm, yet needed hospital treatment.",
      "Two Snohomish County sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived. Dold acknowledged getting physical, but insisted his mother was fine and tried to close the front door.",
      "Many police are trained to calm people in mental crisis. Instead, Deputy Bryson McGee pushed inside. McGee would later say Dold punched his face, something Dold\u2019s mother, Kathy Duncan, who witnessed the interaction, denied.",
      "Four backup officers joined the fight. Over 12 minutes, the group punched, kicked and hit Dold with a baton, shocked him with Tasers, pressed a knee to his face and pushed his head down with a flashlight, according to a 990-page police report.",
      "Dold said he was submitting and cried out for his mother, who screamed that her son was mentally ill.",
      "\u201cIt was the worst yelling, shouting I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d one neighbor told an investigator.",
      "After handcuffing Dold in the driveway, deputies left him face down, a position the Justice Department and others have long warned carries a suffocation risk. No one started proper resuscitation for at least 10 minutes.",
      "Jen Dold didn\u2019t trust the investigation from the beginning. The detectives who interviewed her focused on her brother\u2019s mental illness, she thought to protect officers.",
      "Seeking an ally, she contacted Snohomish County\u2019s chief medical examiner, and was relieved when Dr. Daniel Selove told her by phone that he\u2019d weigh police force.",
      "Yet when Selove met her at his office, he explained that Dold died from an irregular heartbeat. While the Taser shocks and struggle were significant factors, Selove said, he didn\u2019t believe the officers intended to kill her brother, so his death was an accident.",
      "Whether to consider intent is a philosophical divide among forensic pathologists. Dold\u2019s death illustrates how unevenly intent can be applied \u2014 Selove used it even though under his own office\u2019s policies intent \u201cneed not be present or proven\u201d for a homicide ruling.",
      "For coroners and medical examiners, homicide doesn\u2019t carry the same meaning as murder does in criminal law. Guidelines from the National Association of Medical Examiners say intent is a valid consideration, but restraint deaths may be classified as homicide without it \u2014 and doing so has \u201csome value\u201d to reduce any appearance of a cover-up.",
      "Dr. J. Keith Pinckard, the organization\u2019s president, said manner of death is an opinion meant to be used for vital statistics and public health, not a legal determination. Nonetheless, it has influence in court.",
      "The significance of an accidental ruling quickly became clear when the local prosecutor cited it in exonerating the deputies and officers. It was one example among dozens AP found in which prosecutors referenced autopsy outcomes to close investigations, including other cases involving severe force.",
      "Jen Dold figured the last chance to hold the deputies in her brother\u2019s death accountable was a lawsuit.",
      "Looking for a lawyer, the family found a promising lead. Seven years before her brother\u2019s death, Deputy McGee \u2014 the first one into Dold\u2019s home \u2014 had fired his Taser in a fatal struggle with another man in mental distress. Dold was not his first death on duty.",
      "The county had settled that family\u2019s lawsuit. The Dolds contacted the lawyer, who took their case but cautioned litigation would be arduous. Officers get protections, including qualified immunity, which shield them from liability. The accidental manner of death would not help.",
      "As the lawsuit ground on, the attorney discovered something intriguing. The day after Alex Dold\u2019s autopsy, Selove fired the doctor who did it.",
      "Now it was February 2022. Jen Dold huddled with her mother and sister around a laptop to watch their attorney question Dr. Stanley Adams, a forensic pathologist who worked for the U.S. military before Snohomish County.",
      "Their lawyer asked Adams to review Dold\u2019s autopsy report. For the first time, Adams learned that, after he was fired, Selove had changed his conclusion from homicide and labeled it an accident.",
      "\u201cI have a little bit of heartburn with that because he took my correct answer and he changed it to an incorrect answer,\u201d Adams said.",
      "\u201cWhy do you say it\u2019s a homicide?\u201d the lawyer asked.",
      "\u201cBecause when one human being does an action or neglects to do an action that caused the death of another, it really doesn\u2019t matter about the intent,\u201d Adams replied.",
      "The family hugged.",
      "\u201cWe just kept saying, \u2018Did he really just say that? Did he really just say \u2018homicide'?\u201d Jen Dold recalled.",
      "Adams told AP that under the settlement he reached over his termination, he couldn\u2019t discuss his employment. But in a complaint filed with Snohomish County, Adams wrote he was fired for documenting Selove\u2019s violations of county policies and guidelines of the National Association of Medical Examiners. Without saying which policies, Adams called the violations a \u201cdanger to public health and safety.\u201d",
      "In an interview, Selove said Adams\u2019 homicide finding was unrelated to his firing. They disagreed over other matters, he said, but couldn\u2019t elaborate due to the settlement. His office's policy on intent was a relic of a predecessor that he didn't need to follow, he said. And he never felt pressure from law enforcement in any restraint death, including one in 2015 where a detective was publicly accused of improperly influencing him.",
      "The county offered Dold\u2019s family around $1.5 million to end their case in 2023. Jen Dold wanted the settlement to require a change to homicide, but said the county wouldn\u2019t budge. She finally relented.",
      "\u201cThe process beat us down and we were ready for it to be over,\u201d she said.",
      "When a reporter reached Deputy McGee, who resigned within three months of Alex Dold\u2019s death, he said never to call again and hung up. The deputy who responded with McGee resigned in 2019 after being accused of having sex on duty, according to police disciplinary records.",
      "In the seven years since her brother\u2019s death, the extent of the force troubles Jen Dold, as does the pain and fear he must have felt as he struggled to breathe.",
      "A simple question haunts her: What if the medical examiner\u2019s report was different by just one word \u2014 homicide?",
      "While loved ones like Jen Dold want a homicide ruling, powerful institutions may not. The AP found attempts at influencing medical officials in other cases by elected and appointed officials \u2014 the police chief or sheriff, the mayor \u2014 as well as outside sources, such as Axon Enterprise Inc., the maker of Tasers.",
      "In November 2021, the chief medical examiner in North Dakota was deciding how to rule the death of a 43-year-old man police encountered in a Bismarck neighborhood who was on methamphetamine, drenched in sweat and agitated because he believed his daughter was in danger.",
      "Police video that has never been reported before shows Ryan Pederson, a local hockey club coach and single father, resisted when officers tried to handcuff him. Three of them fired their Tasers at nearly the same time, with one connecting.",
      "Awakened by the commotion, a neighbor recorded police holding Pederson face down under a streetlight, remarking, \u201cI think they George Floyded him.\u201d",
      "The autopsy was done by Dr. Barrie Miller, the state\u2019s chief medical examiner.",
      "Emails AP obtained show Miller spoke with Michael Brave, then a longtime Axon attorney, who late into a Friday night and over one weekend emailed her more than a dozen documents, including research papers and book chapters co-authored by company officials that downplayed the risks of Tasers.",
      "\u201cGreat day!!\u201d Brave wrote in one. \u201cAfter our conversation I thought of a couple more documents you might want to have.\u201d",
      "He attached a checklist that tells forensic pathologists what evidence to collect during death investigations involving Tasers. Other materials described how the device works or discussed purported symptoms of excited delirium syndrome, such as \u201csuperhuman strength\u201d and high pain tolerance.",
      "Brave also sent a chart from a study he contributed to which argued that people rarely, if ever, die when police restrain them face down in what\u2019s known as prone position \u2014 the way officers restrained Pederson. While police do use prone restraint every day without harm, AP\u2019s investigation, done with the Howard Centers for Investigative Journalism and FRONTLINE (PBS), identified 44 deaths from 2012-2021 where a medical examiner or coroner ruled that prone restraint caused or contributed. In another 17 cases involving prone restraint, positional asphyxia or asphyxia due to restraint was cited as a cause or contributing factor.",
      "Four days later, Miller ruled Pederson\u2019s death was due to methamphetamine-induced \u201cpsychomotor agitation\u201d and \u201cphysical exertion with physical restraint.\u201d The cause mentioned neither Tasers nor officers. The manner was undetermined \u2014 one of five choices along with accident, homicide, natural and suicide.",
      "Miller didn\u2019t respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment. She was fired this spring after police went to her office. Brave, now a partner in a Phoenix law firm, said Miller contacted him wanting information about how Tasers work. He said he wasn\u2019t trying to influence her \u2014 he wanted her to have the correct information. An Axon official did not respond to messages.",
      "Checklists like the one Brave sent Miller have long been an Axon strategy.",
      "In a 2018 \u201cManaging Your Medical Examiner\u201d web presentation, a longtime member of the company\u2019s board of directors, Mark Kroll, urged law enforcement officials and prosecutors to use a company-created checklist. The essence: Influence the manner of death ruling. \u201cControl the narrative\u201d by getting the deceased\u2019s criminal and medical history. Drop in on the forensic pathologist and talk about cases. And if they are \u201chostile,\u201d line up police-friendly experts to counter them.",
      "Kroll left Axon this year. In an email to AP, he questioned how medical examiners arrive at a manner of death, saying their opinion is not \u201cinfallible truth\u201d but rather \u201cdriven by personal biases, local politics, sex of the medical examiner, religion, and years on the job.\u201d Noting the role drugs and preexisting conditions can play, he called some who die \u201cwalking time bombs.\u201d",
      "Axon has exerted influence in other ways. In autopsy reports, some medical officials shift culpability by citing company-funded research. And in the early 2000s, the company sent a chill through forensic pathology when, faced with product liability lawsuits, it launched a campaign to undermine rulings that Tasers caused or even contributed to deaths.",
      "One important victory came after the company sued a medical examiner in Ohio who had partially blamed the device in three fatal encounters. A judge required the medical examiner to change the manner of death from homicide and remove Taser references in the cause.",
      "\u201cDangerously close to intimidation,\u201d the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners said at the time.",
      "Pressure is a reality of forensic pathology. In a 2011 survey not specific to Taser or arrest-related deaths, 22% of the association\u2019s members said elected or appointed officials had leaned on them to change cause or manner of death. And 25% of those who resisted said they \u201csuffered consequences,\u201d including being fired.",
      "In a follow-up paper, the association said death investigations and decisions must be \u201cindependent from law enforcement and prosecutors,\u201d and based on scientific evidence and research.",
      "Cases in North Carolina and Vermont show what can happen behind the scenes.",
      "Marcus Smith was having a mental health breakdown at a music festival in 2018 and approached Greensboro, North Carolina, police for help. When he panicked and tried to flee, officers pinned Smith, 38, face down to the ground, records show.",
      "After an associate chief medical examiner for North Carolina ruled it a homicide, a police lawyer emailed the state\u2019s chief medical examiner in correspondence marked highly confidential and said Smith\u2019s death should have been undetermined because health problems, cocaine and alcohol could be to blame. He called the homicide classification \u201cwrong and it is being used by those with ulterior motives and visions of monetary payouts \u2026 to baselessly vilify police officers.\u201d",
      "The police lawyer, Amiel Rossabi, told AP in an email that he \u201cwas not pressuring anyone\u201d but was instead pointing out that, based on his research, the medical examiner was wrong. The chief medical examiner and the pathologist who performed the autopsy did not respond to emails and phone messages.",
      "In March 2019, an officer\u2019s punch fractured a 54-year-old man\u2019s skull in Burlington, Vermont. Douglas Kilburn died days later. After a Vermont Health Department doctor called it a homicide, Burlington\u2019s police chief questioned the finding in an email to the state health commissioner, saying he had conferred with the mayor.",
      "The former chief, Brandon del Pozo, now an assistant professor of medicine at Brown University, told AP he sent the email after getting unsatisfying answers from the medical examiner about the degree of certainty that it was homicide. It could have been undetermined, del Pozo said. Former Mayor Miro Weinberger told AP that Kilburn\u2019s death was tragic but the medical examiner\u2019s report had \u201cconfusing and contradictory findings.\u201d",
      "Neither state office budged from its homicide ruling. No officer was charged, but lawsuits resulted in payouts of $2.5 million in North Carolina and $45,000 in Vermont.",
      "An analysis by AP showed that death rulings can vary according to how close the medical examiner or coroner is to local law enforcement.",
      "State offices such as in Vermont and North Carolina labeled as accidents about 30% of deaths. Local agencies investigating deaths in their own communities classified nearly 50% of deaths as accidents. That number was higher still when the local agency was part of law enforcement, such as Texas\u2019 justice of the peace system or the sheriff-coroners in many California counties.",
      "In one notable California restraint death, a forensic pathologist resigned after learning the sheriff changed the manner from homicide to accident. The ensuing controversy led San Joaquin County to create an independent medical examiner\u2019s office.",
      "The death of Kyle Briones in the sprawl east of Los Angeles shows how important the coincidence of where someone dies can be.",
      "The 28-year-old was driving in the pre-dawn hours when a tire blew out. His car swerved and hit a street sign before stopping in a San Bernardino County farm field.",
      "Briones survived the wreck \u2014 but not the night.",
      "Ontario Police Department officers responding to a 911 call for an injured motorist pulled him from the car. Although there were no drugs or alcohol in his system, Briones was disoriented and wobbled as he walked. Police ordered him to sit. When Briones didn\u2019t respond, officers shocked him with a Taser, threw him to the ground and placed him face down for more than six minutes, according to court records. The department did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "By the time paramedics got to him, it was too late.",
      "Had Briones crashed a mile down the road, across the line dividing San Bernardino and Riverside counties, what happened next might have gone far differently.",
      "The two counties, known together as the Inland Empire, each have more than 2 million people and saw similar patterns in their arrest-related deaths \u2014 typically, people in mental health or drug emergencies died after a struggle. Each has a sheriff-coroner death investigation system.",
      "Yet in these cases, they arrived at opposite conclusions. Among the 13 deaths AP identified from 2012-2021 in Riverside County, the coroner\u2019s office classified 11 as homicides. The coroner\u2019s division of the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department ruled on 12 deaths, labeling none a homicide.",
      "In the Briones death, the chief forensic pathologist working for the San Bernardino County coroner blamed preexisting heart and lung conditions. Dr. Frank Sheridan said that \u2014 at 317 pounds and 5 feet, 11 inches \u2014 Briones was \u201cmorbidly obese.\u201d He ruled the death natural.",
      "The Briones family couldn\u2019t understand. Their attorney hired as an expert witness a former medical examiner who had worked for Ventura County, on the other side of Los Angeles. He said Briones died because officers held him down with pressure on his back so he couldn\u2019t breathe, and that it should be a homicide. The lawsuit settled for $2.75 million. Sheridan did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "San Bernardino was one of 19 agencies in the United States that had four or more deaths in AP\u2019s database and ruled none a homicide.",
      "In Miami-Dade County, for instance, all deaths in AP\u2019s data involving Tasers were ruled accidents. The one man who was shocked in Miami-Dade but whose death was not an accident died six years later \u2014 in neighboring Broward County, where a medical examiner called Derrick Blake\u2019s death a homicide attributable to tasing.",
      "All 16 deaths in Miami-Dade over the 10 years AP analyzed were accidents. Just one of Broward County\u2019s four deaths was. Miami\u2019s chief medical examiner declined to comment.",
      "The 19 agencies with four or more deaths but no homicides cover at least 17 million people. One was the medical examiner\u2019s office in Snohomish County, Washington. The same place where Jen Dold fought, to no avail, to reclassify her brother\u2019s death.",

    "story": [
      "A couple has dropped a lawsuit that led the Alabama Supreme Court to rule earlier this year that frozen embryos are what it called \"extrauterine children.\"",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- A judge last week dismissed a wrongful death lawsuit that led the Alabama Supreme Court to rule that frozen embryos are \u201cextrauterine children,\u201d a decision that drew national attention and temporarily halted in vitro fertilization services in the state.",
      "A couple, who filed a wrongful death lawsuit over the accidental destruction of their last frozen embryo, asked to drop the suit. A judge granted the request and dismissed the case Friday, according to state court records. Two other couples had dropped similar lawsuits in August.",
      "The court order did not detail the reason for dropping the lawsuit or if a settlement had been reached. Trip Smalley, a lawyer representing the couple, did not immediately return an email and telephone message seeking comment.",
      "The three couples had their embryos destroyed in 2020 when a hospital patient wandered into the storage area. The patient opened the container, picked up embryos and dropped them to the floor.",
      "The Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that the three couples could pursue wrongful death claims for the destruction of the embryos. Justices, citing anti-abortion language in the Alabama Constitution, ruled that an 1872 state law allowing parents to sue over the death of a minor child, \u201capplies to all unborn children, regardless of their location.\u201d",
      "The decision became a flashpoint in the national debate over abortion and raised liability concerns for fertility clinics as they create, store and work with frozen embryos. Three large IVF providers in Alabama paused services in the wake of the ruling. Facing a public backlash to the decision, Alabama lawmakers approved immunity legislation to shield doctors from lawsuits and get IVF services restarted in the state.",
      "The couple, who had turned to IVF to have children, said in their 2021 lawsuit that the accident destroyed their final frozen embryo, which was being stored at the facility. Even though they had chosen not to implant it, \u201cthey considered this embryo a human being or life,\u201d their lawyer wrote in the lawsuit."

      "Indonesia's mining industry is rapidly expanding on demand for the minerals needed to help power the global energy transition, like nickel, cobalt and bauxite",
      "KABAENA, Indonesia -- The crystal blue waters that once surrounded Kabaena are murky brown now, and the octopi and colorful fish that locals used to catch nearby to eat and sell have fled. The lush seaweed they used to harvest is gone. And parents who grew up swimming happily in the Flores Sea now warn their children to stay out of the water for fear of itchy rashes or skin lesions.",
      "The people of Kabaena \u2014 including Indigenous Bajau, a group that has traditionally lived near and relied on the sea \u2014 are among what experts estimate are thousands of communities around Indonesia where traditional ways of life have been devastated by the impacts of a rapidly expanding mining industry. Most of the materials mined in Indonesia fuel the international supply chain for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more.",
      "\u201cAll residents here have felt the impact,\u201d said Amiruddin, 53, a fisherman who like many Indonesians uses only one name.",
      "With the world's largest known nickel reserves and rich deposits of cobalt, bauxite and other materials, Indonesia has been experiencing a mining boom on demand for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more that are needed for the global energy transition. The island nation has sought to expand its mining and processing capabilities while facing backlash from international and local watchdogs for various environmental concerns.",
      "Across Indonesia, nickel processing plants sometimes sprawl just a few minutes from the sea, and barges ready to carry away nickel ore often dot the water. Some mines operate near schools.",
      "Local communities and the natural environments around these mines can bear the burden of this intense demand. From 2001 to 2020, the world lost nearly 1.4 million hectares (about 3.5 million acres) of trees due to mining, with Indonesia having the highest loss, according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute.",
      "______",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change.",
      "______",
      "On Kabaena, over 3,700 hectares (9,140 acres) of forest \u2014 including protected forest \u2014 were cleared by mining companies between 2001 to 2023, according to data analysis by international environmental organization Mighty Earth. That deforestation has devastated the environment and livelihoods on Kabaena, said Amanda Hurowitz, a senior director at Mighty Earth.",
      "Where fishers could once catch fish to sell or feed their families, the water is now filled with runoff sediment from mining activities and no fish are to be found. Fishers with boats must travel farther, using expensive petrol, and wind up with smaller catches that earn them less money. Those without boats often resort to eating the small shellfish they can find in the murky water around their homes.",
      "\u201c(I would) fish near there by setting a net,\u201d Ilyas, 70, said while pointing in front of his home. \u201cNow it\u2019s far away before (fish) are found.\u201d",
      "Communities on land are experiencing the mines' impact as well: Sugar cane, palm and clove trees cultivated for food and income don't grow as well, with water sources used for crops tainted by mining activities, residents said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the effect: The growth of the sugar palm trees will not be as good because of the influence of mining,\u201d said Amal Susanto, 32, a palm sugar farmer in an area of Kabaena where exploration permits have been granted but mining has not yet begun. \u201cI hope no mines around here, because our income will be impacted.\u201d",
      "Since the mines have opened, there's been a spike in residents complaining of itchy skin, sore throats and other health issues. Villagers no longer want to bathe or wash clothes in the water; when they do, they get itchy skin and rashes said Nina, 33, an Indigenous Bajau resident of Kabaena.",
      "Lab results from samples of rivers, sea water, dust and shellfish from Kabaena taken by Satya Bumi, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Indonesia, in July and November showed hazardous levels of nickel, lead and cadmium \u2014 common mining byproducts.",
      "Exposure to these metals at the levels seen in the lab samples could lead to cancer, cardiovascular, kidney and other chronic diseases, said Kathrin Schilling, an assistant professor at Columbia University who researches molecular biology and reviewed the lab results.",
      "\u201cIf people on this island are using the river water as drinking water \u2014 which has higher levels of the metals \u2014 and then if they are also eating the shellfish and breathe the air ... you cannot escape basically any of the exposure to those toxic metals,\u201d Schilling told AP.",
      "The impact isn\u2019t limited to Kabaena. Across the sea to the north, a nickel mine near the village of Torobulu pushes up against a tattered soccer field and nearby athletic courts.",
      "The impacts and mining continue despite a March 2024 ruling by Indonesia's constitutional court that small islands such as Kabaena require special protection from abnormally dangerous activities, including mining, as they threaten ecosystems in vulnerable areas.",
      "But Indonesia's government is still issuing mining permits for small islands, said Sayyidatiihayaa Afra, a researcher at Satya Bumi.",
      "Since the constitutional court ruling, forest loss has continued on Kabaena, with 150 hectares (370 acres) cleared in areas approved for mining on the island since April 1, according to data analysis by Mighty Earth. Over half of the forest loss occurred in a concession owned by mining company Tonia Mitra Sejahtera.",
      "Tonia Mitra Sejahtera did not respond to a request for interviews or comment. Mining company Anugrah Harisma Barakah \u2014 which caused the most deforestation on Kabaena, according to Satya Bumi \u2014 also did not answer the publicly listed phone number when AP made requests for interviews or comment.",

    "story": [
      "Teen drug use hasn\u2019t rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "NEW YORK -- Teen drug use hasn't rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the results from a large annual national survey released Tuesday.",
      "About two-thirds of 12th graders this year said they hadn\u2019t used alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes or e-cigarettes in the previous 30 days. That\u2019s the largest proportion abstaining since the annual survey started measuring abstinence in 2017.",
      "Among 10th graders, 80% said they hadn\u2019t used any of those substances recently, another record. Among 8th graders, 90% didn\u2019t use any of them, the same as was reported in the previous survey.",
      "The only significant increase occurred in nicotine pouches. About 6% of 12th graders saying they\u2019d used them in the previous year, up from about 3% in 2023.",
      "Whether that has the makings of a new public health problem is unclear. The University of Michigan\u2019s Richard Miech, who leads the survey, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know if we\u2019re seeing the start of something, or not.\"",
      "The federally funded Monitoring the Future survey has been operating since 1975. This year\u2019s findings are based on responses from about 24,000 students in grades 8, 10 and 12 in schools across the country. The survey is \u201cone of the best, if not the best\" source of national data for substance use by teens, said Noah Kreski, a Columbia University researcher who has studied teen drug use.",
      "Early in the pandemic, students across the country were told not to go to schools and to avoid parties or other gatherings. They were at home, under parents' supervision. Alcohol and drug use of all kinds dropped because experimentation tends to occur with friends, spurred by peer pressure, experts say.",
      "As lockdowns ended, \u201cI think everyone expected at least a partial rebound,\u201d Miech said.",
      "Even before the pandemic, there were longstanding declines in teen cigarette smoking, drinking and use of several types of drugs. Experts theorized that kids were staying home and communicating on smartphones rather than hanging out in groups, where they sometimes tried illicit substances.",
      "But marijuana use wasn't falling before the pandemic. And vaping was on the upswing. It was only during the pandemic that those two saw enduring declines, too.",
      "Some experts wonder if the pandemic lockdowns had a deeper influence.",
      "Miech noted that a lot of teens who experiment with e-cigarettes or drugs start in the 9th grade, sometimes because older adolescents are doing it. But the kids who were 9th graders during the lockdowns never picked up the habit, and never had the opportunity to turn into negative influencers of their younger classmates, he said.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic stopped the cycle of new kids coming in and being recruited to drug use,\u201d Miech said.",
      "Mental health may also be a factor. There were increased reports of depression and anxiety in kids after the pandemic began. Depression is often associated with substance use, but some people with depression and anxiety are very wary of messing with drugs, said Dr. Duncan Clark, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who researches substance use in kids.",
      "\u201cSome teens with anxiety are worried about the effects of substances. They may also be socially inhibited and have less opportunity to use drugs,\" Clark said. \"It's a complicated relationship.\u201d",

      "People worried they'll never get a scarce human transplant want to know when they might get a pig kidney instead",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The calls and emails started coming into NYU Langone Health and Massachusetts General Hospital soon after doctors began experimenting with pig organs in humans.",
      "People worried they\u2019ll never get a scarce human transplant asked: When could we get a pig kidney?",
      "Alex Berrios of Louisville, Kentucky, needs a second transplant but finding another human match is proving impossible. So he's closely watching for a chance at pig kidney research.",
      "\"It may not work, and I have to be OK with that,\u201d Berrios said. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth the shot.\u201d",
      "Now two U.S. companies aim to begin the world\u2019s first clinical trials of xenotransplantation in 2025 \u2013 using pig kidneys or hearts to try to save human lives. Would-be volunteers are impatient to see if they'll qualify as researchers fine-tune how best to test if the humanized pig organs they\u2019ve designed might really work.",
      "Anticipation is growing with news that an Alabama woman was faring well after a pig kidney transplant at NYU in late November. Towana Looney is the fifth American to receive a gene-edited pig organ, each case so far an emergency experiment for people out of options.",
      "None of the previous recipients \u2014 two given pig hearts and two kidneys \u2014 survived more than two months but that hasn't deterred researchers hunting an alternative to the dire shortage of transplantable organs.",
      "\u201cWe have to have the courage to continue,\u201d said University of Maryland transplant surgeon Dr. Bartley Griffith.",
      "Back in 2022, Griffith had a hard time figuring out how to ask a dying patient if he\u2019d consider undergoing the world\u2019s first transplant of a gene-edited pig heart.",
      "\u201cI was so afraid to mention the word pig heart,\u201d Griffith said. He marveled that patient David Bennett responded with a joke about oinking and made clear if the last-ditch attempt failed that \u201cmaybe you\u2019ll learn something for others like me.\u201d",
      "Fast forward to late 2023, when patients at a National Kidney Foundation meeting with FDA officials and pig developers described a life so miserable on dialysis that they, too, would chance an animal organ.",
      "\u201cWhy not try? That was really what we took back,\u201d said Mike Curtis, CEO of eGenesis, one of the companies developing organs. \u201cIt was like we really almost have an obligation to try.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe patients pushed us to go ahead,\u201d agreed Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, a Mass General surgeon who\u2019d been reluctant to even broach the idea \u2013 but last March, four months after that meeting, gave a longtime patient the first gene-edited pig kidney.",
      "In Palm Springs, California, Carl McNew emailed NYU to ask about volunteering while he\u2019s still fairly healthy.",
      "McNew donated a kidney to his husband in 2015 but later his remaining kidney began declining, something very rare in living donors. Medications and intermittent dialysis are helping but McNew knows he\u2019ll eventually need a transplant.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just something about being part of something like that, that is so cutting-edge,\u201d said McNew, who spotted news of NYU\u2019s xenotransplant research in 2023 and emailed his interest.",
      "For Louisville\u2019s Berrios, donor scarcity isn\u2019t the only hurdle. Born with a single kidney that failed in his late 20s, a living donor transplant restored his health for 13 years. But it failed in 2020 and he has since developed antibodies that would destroy another human kidney, what doctors call \u201chighly sensitized.\u201d",
      "Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Berrios quietly slips out of his home before dawn to spend nearly four hours tethered to a dialysis machine. Getting the grueling treatments at 5 a.m. is the only way the father of two can both stay alive and hold down a fulltime job.",
      "But dialysis doesn\u2019t fully replace kidney function \u2013 people slowly get sicker. So even as Berrios tried an experimental therapy to tamp down his problem antibodies, he told NYU he's interested in a pig kidney.",
      "FDA rules require that pig organs be extensively tested in monkeys or baboons before humans. And while researchers have extended those primates\u2019 survival to a year, sometimes longer, they were desperate for experience with people. After all, the pig organs are genetically altered to be more humanlike, not more baboon-like.",
      "At NYU and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, surgeons first tested pig organs in bodies of the recently deceased, donated for scientific research.",
      "And patients given pig organs so far have been \u201ccompassionate use\u201d transplants, experiments that FDA allows in select emergency cases for people out of other options.",
      "Although the first four didn\u2019t survive long, in part because of complications from other diseases, those experiments proved pig organs could work at least for a while and offered other lessons. For example, discovery of a hidden pig virus in the first heart transplant prompted better tests for that risk.",
      "Only rigorous studies comparing similarly ill patients will offer a clearer picture of pig organs\u2019 potential \u2013 maybe those like Looney. Despite eight years of dialysis, she wasn\u2019t nearly as sick as prior xenotransplant recipients but couldn\u2019t find a matching donor. Like Berrios, she had a highly sensitized immune response.",
      "Looney may be \u201ckind of a litmus test\u201d for trial candidates, said NYU\u2019s Montgomery, who led her transplant with her original surgeon in Alabama, Dr. Jayme Locke. \u201cShe\u2019s received the transplant at just the right time,\u201d before dialysis did too much damage.",
      "Scientists have tried animal-to-human transplants for years without success but now they can edit pig genes, trying to bridge the species gap enough to keep the human immune system from immediately attacking the foreign tissue. Still, nobody knows the best gene combination.",
      "Revivicor, a United Therapeutics subsidiary, produces kidneys and hearts with 10 gene edits, \u201cknocking out\u201d pig genes that trigger hyper-rejection and excessive organ growth and adding some human genes to improve compatibility. Maryland used hearts with 10 gene edits in its two xenotransplants. Looney also got a kidney with 10 gene edits, based on Locke\u2019s research when she worked in Alabama.",
      "While Montgomery is thrilled with Looney\u2019s progress, he's done most work using Revivicor pigs with just one gene edit, in a xenotransplant last April and in research with the deceased.",
      "\u201cOur feeling is, you know, less is more,\u201d said Montgomery, noting it\u2019s easier to mass produce pigs with fewer gene alterations. Looney\u2019s transplant offers a chance to compare \u201creally how much difference those additional gene edits are making.\u201d",
      "In Boston, eGenesis has still another approach \u2013 a whopping 69 gene edits. In addition to 10 genetic alterations to improve human compatibility, genes linked to certain pig viruses also are inactivated.",
      "Researchers feel pressure to show if pig organs can keep people alive much longer than a few months, said eGenesis' Curtis. If not, the question will be \u201cdo we have the right gene edits?\u201d",
      "The balance is choosing participants sick enough to qualify but not so sick they have no chance.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous number of patients who would be very willing, very willing to do this,\u201d said Dr. Silke Niederhaus of the University of Maryland, who isn\u2019t involved in xenotransplant research but watches it closely.",
      "Niederhaus became a kidney transplant surgeon because around her 12th birthday, one saved her life. That kidney lasted three decades. When it failed, it took five years to find another. So she understands the draw of pig research, and urges people to learn their odds of getting a human kidney before volunteering.",
      "If they\u2019re younger, healthier or have a living donor, \u201cI would probably say go with what\u2019s known and what\u2019s proven,\u201d Niederhaus said. But if they\u2019re older and dialysis is starting to fail, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s worth taking the risk.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- An Alabama woman is recovering well after a pig kidney transplant last month that freed her from eight years of dialysis, the latest effort to save human lives with animal organs.",
      "Towana Looney is the fifth American given a gene-edited pig organ \u2014 and notably, she isn\u2019t as sick as prior recipients who died within two months of receiving a pig kidney or heart.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a new beginning,\u201d Looney, 53, told The Associated Press. Right away, \u201cthe energy I had was amazing. To have a working kidney \u2014 and to feel it \u2014 is unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Looney\u2019s surgery marks an important step as scientists get ready for formal studies of xenotransplantation expected to begin next year, said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led the highly experimental procedure on Nov. 25.",
      "On Tuesday, NYU announced that Looney is recuperating well. She was discharged from the hospital just 11 days after surgery although she was temporarily readmitted this week to adjust her medications. Doctors expect her to return home to Gadsden, Alabama, in three months. If the pig kidney were to fail, she could begin dialysis again.",
      "\u201cTo see hope restored to her and her family is extraordinary,\u201d said Dr. Jayme Locke, Looney's original surgeon who secured Food and Drug Administration permission for the transplant.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney. Thousands die waiting and many more who need a transplant never qualify. Now, searching for an alternate supply, scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike.",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed. It\u2019s incredibly rare for living donors to develop kidney failure although those who do are given extra priority on the transplant list.",
      "But Looney couldn't get a match \u2014 she had developed antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney. Tests showed she\u2019d reject every kidney donors have offered.",
      "Then Looney heard about pig kidney research at t he University of Alabama at Birmingham and told Locke, at the time a UAB transplant surgeon, she'd like to try one. In April 2023, Locke filed an FDA application seeking an emergency experiment, under rules for people like Looney who are out of options.",
      "The FDA didn't agree right away. Instead, the world's first gene-edited pig kidney transplants went to two sicker patients last spring, at Massachusetts General Hospital and NYU. Both also had serious heart disease. The Boston patient recovered enough to spend about a month at home before dying of sudden cardiac arrest deemed unrelated to the pig kidney. NYU\u2019s patient had heart complications that damaged her pig kidney, forcing its removal, and she later died.",
      "Those disappointing outcomes didn\u2019t dissuade Looney, who was starting to feel worse on dialysis but, Locke said, hadn't developed heart disease or other complications. The FDA eventually allowed her transplant at NYU, where Locke collaborated with Montgomery.",
      "Moments after Montgomery sewed the pig kidney into place, it turned a healthy pink and began producing urine.",
      "Even if her new organ fails, doctors can learn from it, Looney told the AP: \u201cYou don't know if it's going to work or not until you try.\u201d",
      "Blacksburg, Virginia-based Revivicor provided Looney\u2019s new kidney from a pig with 10 gene alterations. Its parent company, United Therapeutics said Tuesday it plans to file an application with the FDA \u201cvery soon\u201d to begin clinical trials with that type of kidney.",
      "Looney was initially discharged on Dec. 6, wearing monitors to track her blood pressure, heart rate and other bodily functions and returning to the hospital for daily checkups before her medication readmission. Doctors scrutinize her bloodwork and other tests, comparing them to prior research in animals and a few humans in hopes of spotting an early warning if problems crop up.",
      "\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing for the first time,\u201d Montgomery said.",
      "Locke, who recently joined the federal Health Resources and Services Administration, visited last week to check her longtime patient's progress. Looney hugged her, saying, \u201cThank you for not giving up on me.\u201d",

      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged to $91.4 billion last year",
      "Global security leaders are warning that nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged around the world. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren\u2019t necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 100-page guide on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",
      "Here are takeaways from the AP\u2019s reporting on bunkers and the debate over the message building bunkers sends.",
      "The market for U.S. bomb and fallout shelters is forecast to grow from $137 million last year to $175 million by 2030, according to a market research report from BlueWeave Consulting. The report says major growth factors include \u201cthe rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard. He says his bunker factory, in Sulphur Springs, Texas, is the world\u2019s largest. Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you\u2019re going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,\u201d he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating.",
      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Sanders-Zakre called radiation the \u201cuniquely horrific aspect of nuclear weapons,\u201d and noted that even surviving the fallout doesn\u2019t prevent long-lasting, intergenerational health crises. \u201cUltimately, the only solution to protect populations from nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern year after year introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation.",
      "\u201cIf we ever get to a point where there\u2019s all out nuclear war, underground bunkers aren\u2019t going to protect people,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we ought to be investing our resources and our energy trying to talk about a nuclear weapons freeze, initially.\u201d",

      "When Bernard Jones Jr. and his wife, Doris, built their dream home, they didn\u2019t hold back. A grotto swimming pool with a waterfall for hot summer days. A home theater for cozy winter nights. A fruit orchard to harvest in fall. And a vast underground bunker in case disaster strikes.",
      "\u201cThe world\u2019s not becoming a safer place,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to be prepared.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf there was a nuclear strike, would you rather go into the living room or go into a bunker? If you had one, you\u2019d go there too,\u201d said Jones, who said he reluctantly sold the home two years ago.",
      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending surged to $91.4 billion last year. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally, from small metal boxes to crawl inside of to extravagant underground mansions.",

      "Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "On Nov. 21, in the hours after Russia\u2019s first-ever use of an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile to attack Ukraine, Hubbard said his phone rang nonstop.",
      "Four callers ended up buying bunkers in one day, he said, and more ended up ordering doors and other parts for shelters they were already building.",
      "Hubbard said his bunkers are built for all disasters.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re good for anything from a tornado to a hurricane to nuclear fallout, to a pandemic to even a volcano erupting,\u201d he said, sweeping his arms toward a massive warehouse where more than 50 different bunkers were under construction.",
      "A loaded shotgun at arm\u2019s length and metal mesh window shields to block Molotov cocktails nearby, Hubbard said he started his company after building his own bunker about 10 years ago. He says callers ask about prices \u2014 $20,000 to multimillions, averaging $500,000 \u2014 and installations \u2014 they can go just about anywhere. He said most days he sells at least one bunker.",
      "Under Hubbard\u2019s doomsday scenario, global tensions could lead to World War III, a situation he is prepared to live through.",
      "\u201cThe good news about nuclear warfare,\u201d he said, \u201cif there ever was any, that it\u2019s very survivable if you\u2019re not killed in the initial blast.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s not wrong, say U.S. government disaster preparedness experts.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. Buddemeier and his colleagues are tasked with evaluating what could happen after an attack and how best to survive. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "Buddemeier and others in the U.S. government are trying to get Americans \u2014 who decades ago hid under desks during nuclear attack drills \u2014 educated about how to respond.",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you\u2019re going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,\u201d he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating.",
      "The government\u2019s efforts to educate the public were reinvigorated after a false alarm missile alert in Hawaii in 2018 caused widespread panic.",
      "The emergency alert, which was sent to cellphones statewide just before 8:10 a.m., said: \u201cBALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\u201d",
      "For the next 40 minutes there were traffic jams, workers running into and out of buildings, families huddling in their bathrooms, students gathering in gyms, drivers blocking tunnels, all in an attempt to seek shelter, without any clear idea of what \u201cseek immediate shelter\u201d actually meant.",
      "Today the federal government offers a guide to prepare citizens for a nuclear attack that advises people to find a basement or the center of a large building and stay there, possibly for a few days, until they get word about where to go next.",
      "\u201cGently brush your pet\u2019s coat to remove any fallout particles\u201d it says, adding that the 15-minute delay between bomb and fallout allows \u201cenough time for you to be able to prevent significant radiation exposure.\u201d",
      "Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, who directs the FEMA-backed National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said \u201cthe scenarios of a nuclear detonation are not all or nothing.\u201d",
      "If a small number of weapons detonate rather than all-out war, he said, sheltering inside a large building to avoid the fallout could save lives.",

      "Researcher Sam Lair at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies says U.S. leaders stopped talking about bunkers decades ago.",
      "\u201cThe political costs incurred by causing people to think about shelters again is not worth it to leaders because it forces people to think about what they would do after nuclear war,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that very, very few people want to think about. This makes people feel vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Lair said building bunkers seems futile, even if they work in the short term.",
      "\u201cEven if a nuclear exchange is perhaps more survivable than many people think, I think the aftermath will be uglier than many people think as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamental wrenching that it would do to our way of life would be profound.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s been a serious concern of Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern for almost 50 years.",
      "\u201cIf we ever get to a point where there\u2019s all out nuclear war, underground bunkers aren\u2019t going to protect people,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we ought to be investing our resources and our energy trying to talk about a nuclear weapons freeze, initially.\u201d",
      "Next, he said, \u201cwe should work for the day when we get rid of all nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Year after year he introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation, but looking out his office window at the Capitol, he said he\u2019s disappointed by the lack of debate over what will be a $1 trillion expenditure to build and modernize the U.S. arsenal.",
      "\u201cThe stakes, if a nuclear weapon is ever used, is that millions and millions and millions of people will die. It really is shocking that we have world leaders who talk casually about utilizing nuclear weapons. I mean, it would be catastrophic, not just for those that are involved in an exchange of nuclear weapons, but for the entire world.\u201d",
      "McGovern pushed back against FEMA\u2019s efforts to prepare the public for a nuclear attack by advising people to take shelter.",
      "\u201cWhat a stupid thing to say that we all just need to know where to hide and where to avoid the most impacts of nuclear radiation. I mean, really, that\u2019s chilling when you hear people try to rationalize nuclear war that way,\u201d he said.",
      "Nuclear war was far from a couple's mind when they went house-hunting in Southern California a few years ago. They wanted a home to settle down and raise their family, and they needed extra garage space. They spotted an online ad for a home with at least eight parking spots. On the basketball court, there was a metal hatch. Beneath it was a bunker.",
      "This was Jones' former home, which Jones said he put up for sale for family reasons.",
      "The husband, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about his family's privacy, went ahead and bought Jones' home, bunker and all. They aren\u2019t particularly worried about nuclear war, and haven\u2019t spent a night in the bunker, but they have stored food and medical supplies down there.",
      "\u201cWe have told some of our friends, if something goes crazy and gets bad, get over here as fast as possible,\u201d the husband said. \u201cIt does provide a sense of security.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. swept onto Capitol Hill late Monday as the anti-vaccine health guru from the famous political family reintroduced himself to senators, this time as President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the nation's Health and Human Services Department.",
      "It was a soft-opening debut for Kennedy, whose wide-ranging views \u2014 yes to raw milk, no to fluoride, Ozempic and America's favorite processed foods \u2014 are raising alarms in the scientific community and beyond. In the Senate he's facing a mix of support, curiosity, skepticism and downright rejection among the senators who will be asked to confirm him to Trump's Cabinet.",
      "Kennedy's first stop Monday was on potentially friendly terrain, to the offices of a few GOP senators allied with Trump, the start of a robust, weeks-long process.",
      "One Republican, Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, said Kennedy told him, \u201cI 100% support the polio vaccination.\u201d But Mullin added that their conversation also turned to other childhood vaccinations. He predicts Kennedy will be confirmed.",
      "\u201cThe more you talk to him, the more he explains it, the more you like him,\u201d Mullin said.",
      "The man known simply as RFK, Jr., 70, is the latest in the Trump rival-turned-partner orbit, a former Democratic presidential hopeful now in line to run the world's largest public health agency, with its whopping $1.7 trillion budget, and some of the U.S. most important public services.",
      "HHS has a broad reach across the lives of Americans \u2014 inspecting the nation's food, regulating medicines and overseeing research of diseases and cures. It provides health insurance for nearly half of the country \u2014 poor, disabled and older Americans, including via Medicare.",
      "Richard Besser, CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called Kennedy \u201ca truly dangerous\u201d choice.",
      "Besser, in an op-ed in U.S. News and World Report, said Kennedy stands out as a \u201csingle potential Cabinet member who could do the most damage to the American people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "Ahead of Kennedy's arrival he was given a word of advice from one important voice: outgoing Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, a childhood polio survivor, who cautioned the nominee against views opposing the vaccine.",
      "\u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\u201d McConnell said recently.",
      "Trump said Monday during his own press conference he\u2019s a \u201cbig believer\u201d in polio vaccines and sought to tamp down fears about Kennedy, saying he will be \u201cmuch less radical\u201d than people think.",
      "The incoming GOP leader, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said Kennedy will have to address questions about his views on the polio vaccine and other issues.",
      "\u201cWell, I think he\u2019ll have to address that,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d",
      "But hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a House member who has no vote in the confirmation process, has been influential in supporting and amplifying Kennedy\u2019s views on vaccines.",
      "In the Capitol on Monday, Republican senators said they want to hear more about Kennedy\u2019s views.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m open,\" said GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. But \u201cif you come in and say I won\u2019t consider myself successful unless I eliminate these vaccines, that could be problematic.\u201d",
      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination will test the nation\u2019s emerging political realignment, as Trump expands his base of supporters to include former Democratic voters shifting elsewhere. Kennedy\u2019s views find favor but also opposition from both sides of the political aisle.",
      "In particular, Kennedy's ideas about ridding the nation\u2019s food of additives has drawn interest if not support from some Democrats, but his criticism of major farm interests have also raised concerns from the agricultural industry.",
      "Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley says he\u2019s interested in what Kennedy says about pigs \u201cbecause Iowa is the number one pig producer.\u201d",
      "Other Trump nominees are also expected back on Capitol Hill this week. The president-elect's choice of Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary, Tulsi Gabbard for Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Kash Patel for FBI director and others are all running into turbulence from wary senators.",
      "With Republicans taking control of the Senate in the new year, Trump's nominees have a pathway to confirmation. But with just a 53-47 majority, any nominee can only lose a handful of GOP supporters, in the face of Democratic opposition.",

The federal government foots 90% of the expansion costs under the program.",
      "In just the first few weeks of the program's rollout, the state had 300,000 North Carolinians \u2014 half of its goal \u2014 enroll in Medicaid expansion. North Carolina is part of a handful of Southern states that now participate in the program.",
      "More than a third of expansion enrollees come from rural communities, according to Cooper's office. About 4.1 million prescriptions related to heart health, diabetes and other diseases have been filled so far because of the new coverage, the governor's office said."

The participating state and local governments leverage public funds, often from their American Rescue Plan Act allocations, to pay off the debt, often for pennies on the dollar. In Connecticut, officials set aside $6.5 million in ARPA funds, and $100,000 was used to pay off this first $30 million.",

      "A lawyer for convicted British killer nurse Lucy Letby says he plans to ask an appeals court to re-examine her convictions after the prosecution\u2019s leading expert changed his opinion on how three infants died",
      "LONDON -- A lawyer for convicted British killer nurse Lucy Letby said Monday that he plans to ask an appeals court to re-examine her convictions after the prosecution's leading expert changed his opinion on how three babies died.",
      "Dr. Dewi Evans's testimony is no longer credible after he reversed his opinion that Letby killed three infants by injecting air down a nasal gastric tube, attorney Mark McDonald said.",
      "\u201cThe defense will argue that Dr. Evans is not a reliable expert, and given that he was the lead expert for the prosecution, we say that all the convictions are not safe,\u201d McDonald said.",
      "Letby, 34, is serving multiple life sentences with no chance of release after being convicted of murdering seven babies and trying to murder seven others while working as a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England between June 2015 and June 2016.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service defended the verdicts.",
      "\u201cTwo juries and three appeal court judges have reviewed a multitude of different strands of evidence against Lucy Letby,\u201d a CPS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cIn May, the Court of Appeal dismissed Letby\u2019s leave to appeal on all grounds \u2014 rejecting her argument that expert prosecution evidence was flawed.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said at trial that Letby's methods left little trace and included injecting air into their bloodstreams, poisoning them with insulin and interfering with breathing tubes. Prosecutors said she was a \u201cconstant malevolent presence\" and was alone on duty in the neonatal unit when the children collapsed or died.",
      "Letby, who testified at two trials that she never harmed a child, has stood by her claims of innocence.",
      "Experts said it is unusual to ask the Court of Appeal to reopen its previous decision to reject a case and would require convincing evidence to succeed.",
      "\u201cIt is vanishingly rare for a lead expert witness in a criminal case to \u2018change his mind\u2019 on key evidence,\" said defense lawyer Sean Caulfield, who is not involved in the case. \u201cIt is also rare for there to be a bid to reopen an appeal after it has already been refused by the Court of Appeal. I have never seen these two things happen in unison during my 20-year plus career. It is quite an astonishing turn of events.\"",
      "McDonald said 15 medical experts around the world are reviewing trial evidence.",
      "An inquiry currently underway to examine failures by the hospital to recognize why babies were dying and why they took so long to stop Letby opened in September against a backdrop of experts and others who have questioned evidence used against Letby.",
      "A group of scientists, doctors and legal experts that independently reviewed scientific evidence from Letby\u2019s trial warned Britain\u2019s ministers of health and justice that legal systems were \u201cparticularly vulnerable to errors\u201d when dealing with technical matters, \u201cespecially in cases involving statistical anomalies in health care settings.\u201d",
      "Evans gave his new opinions on the death of infants identified in court as Baby C, Baby I and Baby P in a signed response to a Channel 5 documentary, McDonald said.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m sure Dr. Evans is still going to say that Lucy Letby is guilty and he has a different view or different hypothesis in relation to it,\" McDonald said. \u201cBut the cause of death that was before the Court of Appeal is different now, according to Dr. Evans, and I think that is a profound issue that needs to be relooked at.\u201d",
      "Evans has not yet responded to a request for comment following McDonald's news conference.",
      "Additionally, two neonatologists working with the defense said there were medical reasons Baby C and Baby O became ill and could not be resuscitated, McDonald said."

      "Experts say that the holidays can put a strain on your mental health",
      "Bells are ringing. Snow is glistening. But you\u2019re bummed out.",
      "You could be suffering from a case of the holiday blues, which experts say is not uncommon.",
      "A strained relationship with family, for example, can make this time of year pretty lonely. The holidays are expensive, and financial woes can cause major stress. Anxiety about holiday anything can fuel depression and worsen existing mental health concerns.",
      "\u201cA lot of people at certain years can find the holidays to be more challenging than they have experienced in past years,\u201d said Shilagh Mirgain, a psychologist at UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin. \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize the common humanity that others, too, are struggling.",
      "\"You\u2019re not alone.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what experts say you can do to make your holiday season a little more bearable, if not cheery.",
      "Spending an extended amount of time with family is hard to avoid around the holidays, Mirgain said, but there are ways to make it a little easier.",
      "\u201cCertainly this year, I think with the recent election, there\u2019s a lot of divisiveness and discord, and you\u2019re probably having to interact with family members that have really opposing beliefs,\u201d she said. \u201cThat can bring up strong emotions.\u201d",
      "Think about the boundaries you want to set: What kind of contact do you want to have with your family and how long are you prepared to be around them?",
      "It\u2019s also important to give yourself permission to exit the event \u2014 and have some strategies in place, she said. For example, if you need some space, go on a walk or run some errands.",
      "And if stressful conversations come up, have some language ready to go to draw your boundaries quickly and firmly.",
      "\u201cYou could say, \u2018Gosh, thanks for asking, but I don\u2019t talk politics over the holidays,\u2019\u201d Mirgain suggested.",
      "The holidays can be difficult for people who are grieving or don\u2019t have anyone nearby with whom to celebrate.",
      "\u201cLoneliness and isolation can feel exacerbated during the holiday season when you look around and it seems like everyone\u2019s getting together and you don\u2019t have plans, or you\u2019re not looking forward to your plans,\u201d Mirgain said.",
      "Find ways to connect with people if that\u2019s something you\u2019re craving, like scheduling calls with people across the country or volunteering in your community.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much opportunity to give back during this time, and I think generosity is one of the best things we can do for our own well-being,\u201d she said.",
      "And if you\u2019re grieving the death of someone close to you, the holidays can be the perfect time to reflect on that person's legacy, said Dr. Ellen Lee, a geriatric psychiatrist at UC San Diego Health.",
      "\"Try to honor that person by visiting their grave site or doing something they really loved to do, and then find people to share those memories with,\u201d Lee said. She also advises people not to tamp down feelings but let yourself grieve.",
      "Gifts, dinners, decorations \u2014 it\u2019s all a lot to keep track of around this time of year, and it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed. Those extra expenses and get-togethers can put more stress on your mental health.",
      "For milder symptoms of depression, anxiety or mood issues, lean on tried-and-true methods of self-care, experts said, such as spending time doing something you love or watching a movie.",
      "But it's important to reach out for help if you start to feel mounting financial anxiety or intensifying symptoms that impair your ability to function. Early intervention can keep them from intensifying, Mirgain said, adding that if you have suicidal thoughts, reach out to your provider. You can also call or text 988 or chat at 988Lifeline.org.",
      "Remember, your holidays don\u2019t have to be a Hallmark movie. Give yourself permission to do it differently this year, Lee said.",
      "\u201cWe have so many goals, so many targets,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting all the gifts, decorating the house perfectly \u2026 sometimes it\u2019s helpful to sort of focus on the most important part of it.\u201d",
      "That can look different depending on who you are: The most important part may be spending time with people you don\u2019t get to see often, or having a nice meal with your favorite foods.",
      "Lee emphasized that it is fine to have a low-key celebration.",
      "\u201cI ask people, \u2018What\u2019s the best part of the holiday?\u2019\" she said, \"It\u2019s not usually about the decorations or all these extra things that we all spend a lot of time worrying about.\u201d",

They were hospitalized with nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms, said Jemesa Tudravu, a Fiji Health Ministry spokesperson.",

      "\u201cThe resort management has assured us that they have not engaged in practices such as substituting ingredients or altering the quality of drinks served to guests,\u201d Gavoka said.

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who had polio as a child, says any of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominees seeking Senate confirmation should \u201csteer clear\u201d of efforts to discredit the polio vaccine.",
      "\u201cEfforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d McConnell said in a statement Friday. \u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",
      "The 82-year-old lawmaker\u2019s statement appeared to be directed at Trump\u2019s pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., after a report that one of his advisers filed a petition to revoke approval for the polio vaccine in 2022. That vaccine is widely considered to have halted the disease in most parts of the world.",
      "McConnell's words were a sign that Kennedy, who has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism, could face some resistance in the soon-to-be GOP-controlled Senate.",

      "Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real-world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades \u2014 they are considered among the most effective public health measures in history.",
      "McConnell contracted polio at 2 years old but survived because of \u201cthe miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother\u2019s love,\" according to the statement. He praised the \u201csaving power\u201d of the polio vaccine for the \u201cmillions who came after me.\u201d",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a post on X that it was \u201coutrageous and dangerous for people in the Trump Transition to try and get rid of the polio vaccine that has virtually eradicated polio in America and saved millions of lives.",

      "Trump announced last month his selection of Kennedy, saying Kennedy would work to protect Americans \u201cfrom harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives.\u201d",
      "But that pick was met with alarm from scientists and public health officials, who fear Kennedy would unwind lifesaving public health initiatives such as vaccines.",
      "Kennedy has pushed other conspiracy theories regarding vaccines, such as that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.",
      "Kennedy said he plans to remake the Department of Health and Human Services, an agency with sprawling reach and a $1.3 trillion budget, if he is approved. He has suggested the FDA is beholden to \u201cbig pharma,\u201d and his anti-vaccine nonprofit has called on it to stop using COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "During the COVID-19 epidemic, his nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, petitioned the FDA to halt the use of all COVID vaccines. The group has alleged that the FDA is beholden to \u201cbig pharma\u201d because it receives much of its budget from industry fees and some employees who have departed the agency have gone on to work for drugmakers.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit."

      "Putin began by boasting about Russia's economic performance, saying that it's on track to grow by nearly 4% this year. He acknowledged that consumer inflation is high at 9.3%, but noted Central Bank's efforts to bring it down and insisted that the situation in the economy remains \u201cstable.\u201d",

      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Brazil\u2019s real on Wednesday fell to its weakest level against the dollar since the currency was introduced in 1994, undercut by investors' frustration with President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's efforts to rein in government spending.",
      "A bill backed by Lula that aims to slash 70-billion-real ($11 billion) in government spending is being debated in Brazil's lower house of Congress. But some market players have said it is insufficient to shore up Brazil\u2019s finances.",
      "The real shed 2.8% of its value against the U.S. dollar Wednesday, depreciating to 6.26 per dollar. It\u2019s the weakest the currency has been in nominal terms since its adoption in an economy with a history of boom-and-bust cycles and bouts of high inflation.",
      "This year, it has lost nearly 23% of its value against the U.S. currency.",
      "Brazil's lower house late Tuesday passed some less-divisive elements of the bill, but key parts \u2014 such as restrictions to increases in the minimum wage \u2014 have yet to be taken up for a vote. The Senate also needs to vote on what the lower house approves, and Congress adjourns Friday.",
      "Brazil's central bank has repeatedly intervened in local currency markets to stem the real's slide but so far has largely failed to stop the bleeding. Economists say the currency's weakness, which will increase costs of Brazilian imports, could trigger inflation as soon as January.",
      "\u201cThe government sent a package that is seen as insufficient, and it will be watered down in Congress. It also comes with a measure to increase spending through income tax,\u201d analyst Mario S\u00e9rgio Lima, from Medley Advisors, told The Associated Press. \u201cThe real at 6 per dollar looks acceptable, but nearing 6.30 looks like an exaggeration.\u201d",
      "Lula, who is recovering from surgery to stop a brain bleed, told TV Globo on Sunday that his administration is fiscally responsible and downplayed concerns in the financial markets.",
      "\u201cIt is not the market that needs to be worried about government spending. It is our administration. If I don't rein in spending, if I spend more than I have, it is the poor people who will pay for it,\u201d the Brazilian president said.",
      "Brazil's Economy Minister Fernando Haddad said the real's steep depreciation does not reflect the realities of the country's economy, noting that inflation and unemployment figures are improving.",
      "\u201cSome are talking about speculation, including respectable journalists,\u201d Haddad told journalists in Brazil's capital, Brasilia, without providing more details. \u201cOur currency floats and at this moment, when some things are pending (in Congress), there's an atmosphere of uncertainty that makes the currency float. But I believe it will find its ground.\""

      "President Claudia Sheinbaum used her morning news briefing to present the song \u201cMigrant Hymn.\u201d The lyrics, a mix of English and Spanish, include lines like \u201cwhere we are from, no nos rajamos\u201d (we don't give up).",
      "Sheinbaum called Mexican migrants \u201cheroes,\u201d in part because they sent $63 billion back home to relatives in Mexico last year.",

      "But they have little or no chance of making it more than a few dozen miles. In November, Mexican officials broke up two similar migrant caravans.",

      "For years, migrant caravans have often been blocked, harassed or prevented from hitching rides by Mexican police and immigration agents. They have also frequently been rounded up or returned to areas near the Guatemalan border.",
      "This week, the human rights group Doctors Without Borders wrote in a report that \u201chundreds of thousands of migrants, the majority of whom are crossing to reach the United States, fall into limbo in Mexico, hemmed in by violence.\u201d",

      "Sarkozy and 12 others will go on trial in January 2025 on charges that his 2007 presidential campaign received millions in illegal financing from the government of late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.",
      "Sarkozy has been under investigation in the case since 2013. He is charged with passive corruption, illegal campaign financing, embezzlement of Libyan public funds and criminal association.",
      "Investigators examined claims that Gadhafi\u2019s government secretly gave Sarkozy 50 million euros ($52.3 million) for his winning 2007 campaign. The sum would be more than double the legal campaign funding limit at the time and would violate French rules against foreign campaign financing.",
      "The investigation gained traction when French-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine told news site Mediapart in 2016 that he had delivered suitcases from Libya containing 5 million euros in cash to Sarkozy and his former chief of staff. Takieddine later withdrew the allegation and Sarkozy sought to have the inquiry closed.",
      "After becoming president in 2007, Sarkozy welcomed Gadhafi to France with high honors later that year. Sarkozy then put France at the forefront of NATO-led airstrikes that helped rebel fighters topple Gadhafi\u2019s government in 2011.",
      "French investigative judges filed preliminary charges last year against Sarkozy for his alleged involvement in an attempt to mislead magistrates in order to clear him in the Libya financing case.",
      "Financial prosecutors said Sarkozy is suspected of \u201cbenefitting from corruptly influencing a witness\u201d \u2014 Takieddine \u2014 who accused him of receiving illegal campaign financing from Libya.",
      "Sarkozy\u2019s wife, the former supermodel Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was given preliminary charges in July this year for alleged involvement in efforts to pressure Takieddine. Bruni-Sarkozy was placed under judicial supervision, which includes a ban on contact with all those involved in the proceedings with the exception of her husband.",
      "In February this year, an appeals court in Paris upheld a guilty verdict against the former president for illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 re-election bid. Sarkozy was sentenced to a year in prison, of which six months were suspended.",
      "Sarkozy is accused of having spent almost twice the maximum legal amount of 22.5 million euros on the re-election bid that he lost to Socialist Francois Hollande.",
      "Lawyers for Sarkozy, who has denied all allegations, have appealed to the Court of Cassation against the sentence in that case."

      "\u201cThis year we're having atypical situations,\u201d she said.",
      "Cordoned off by tape and flags, the young male seal became the main attraction on one of the world\u2019s most famous beaches. Among the curious onlookers was Jordana Halpern, 29. She had never seen such a specimen and rushed to the beach when she heard it had been spotted.",
      "\u201cIt's cool, but it\u2019s kind of sad. It seems like it\u2019s not doing very well,\u201d Halpern said. Almost as though hearing her, the seal moved more energetically, lifting its head and emitting a low sound. \u201cOh my God! It moved a lot!\u201d Halpert said.",
      "Santiago said they still don't know why the animal ended up in Ipanema out of season, but wasn't worried: \"It's just resting. The animal is very active, so he\u2019s only resting, and soon it\u2019ll head back to the sea.\u201d"

      "The British government says it still plans to hand over a contested Indian Ocean archipelago, which is home to a strategically important military base, to Mauritius",
      "LONDON -- The British government said Wednesday it still plans to hand over a contested Indian Ocean archipelago, which is home to a strategically important military base, to Mauritius, after that country\u2019s new leader backed away from the contentious deal.",
      "The U.K. and Mauritius announced an agreement in October to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, a chain of more than 60 islands just south of the equator off the tip of India. Under the deal, the U.K.-U.S. naval and bomber base on the largest of the islands, Diego Garcia, would remain under U.K. control for at least 99 years.",
      "When it made the announcement, Britain\u2019s Labour Party government said it was finalizing details of a treaty with the Mauritian government. Since then, voters in Mauritius ousted the government that made the deal, replacing it with one led by Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam.",
      "Ramgoolam said he was reopening negotiations because the draft deal \u201cwould not produce the benefits that the nation could expect from such an agreement.\u201d He told lawmakers in Mauritius\u2019 parliament on Tuesday that his government \u201cis still willing to conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom\" and had submitted counterproposals.",
      "Britain's Foreign Office Minister Stephen Doughty said he was confident the deal would be finalized, and it was \u201ccompletely understandable that the new Mauritian government will want time to study the details.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am confident that we have agreed a good and fair deal that is in both sides\u2019 interests,\u201d he told lawmakers in the House of Commons. \u201cIt protects the base at proportionate cost. It has been supported across the national security architecture in the United States and by India.\u201d",
      "The U.K.\u2019s opposition Conservatives have accused the government of surrendering sovereignty over a British territory.",
      "The deal was hailed by U.S. President Joe Biden as a \u201chistoric agreement\u201d that secured the future of the Diego Garcia base. But supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump have slammed it.",
      "British lawmaker Nigel Farage, a Trump ally, said \u201cthere is very deep disquiet\u201d among incoming Trump administration officials \u201cas to what this may mean for the long-term future of Diego Garcia.\u201d",
      "One of the last remnants of the British Empire, the Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814. Britain evicted as many as 2,000 people from the islands in the 1960s and 1970s so the U.S. military could build the Diego Garcia base, which has supported U.S. military operations from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the U.S. acknowledged it also had been used for clandestine rendition flights of terror suspects.",
      "The U.S. has described the base, which is home to about 2,500 mostly American personnel, as \u201can all but indispensable platform\u201d for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia and East Africa.",
      "The displaced Chagossians fought unsuccessfully in U.K. courts for years for the right to go home. Under the deal, they and their descendants could be allowed to return to the islands, apart from Diego Garcia.",
      "Mauritius, which lies east of Madagascar in southern Africa, is around 2,100 kilometers (1,250 miles) southwest of the Chagos Islands."

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:10:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Syria&rsquo;s nearly 14-year-old civil war fragmented the country, crumbled the economy and created fertile ground for the production of the highly addictive drug Captagon",
    "story": [
      "Syria\u2019s nearly 14-year-old civil war fragmented the country, crumbled the economy and created fertile ground for the production of the highly addictive drug Captagon",
      "BEIRUT -- Since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad, industrial-scale manufacturing facilities of the amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon have been uncovered around the country, which experts say fed a $10 billion annual global trade in the highly addictive drug.",
      "Among the locations used for manufacturing the drug were the Mazzeh air base in Damascus, a car-trading company in Latakia and a factory that once made snack chips in the Damascus suburb of Douma. Government forces seized the factory in 2018.",
      "\u201cAssad\u2019s collaborators controlled this place. After the regime fell ... I came here and found it on fire,\u201d Firas al-Toot, the original owner of the factory, told The Associated Press. \u201cThey came at night and lit the drugs on fire but couldn\u2019t burn everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom here, Captagon pills emerged to kill our people,\u201d Abu Zihab, an activist with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main group now ruling the country, said while his group gave journalists access to the site.",
      "Syria's nearly 14-year-old civil war fragmented the country, crumbled the economy and created fertile ground for the production of the drug. Militias, warlords and the Assad government transformed the production of Captagon from a small-scale operation run by criminal groups into a billion-dollar industrial revenue stream.",
      "The recent ousting of Assad has disrupted these networks and has given a closer look at its operations \u2014 revealing the workings of a war economy that sustained Assad\u2019s power over Syria. Experts say the change in Syria might create an opportunity to dismantle the Captagon industry.",
      "Captagon was first developed in Germany in the 1960s as a prescription stimulant for conditions like narcolepsy. It was later outlawed due to heart issues and its addictive properties.",
      "Its amphetamine-like effects made it popular in the Middle East among both elites and fighters, as it enhanced focus and reduced fatigue.",
      "Assad's government recognized an opportunity in the cheaply manufactured drug amid Syria\u2019s economic turmoil and the heavy sanctions imposed on it.",
      "Captagon is produced through a simple chemical process that involves mixing amphetamine derivatives with excipients to form tablets, typically in makeshift labs.",
      "The Captagon trade began industrializing around 2018-2019 as the Assad regime \u2014 and other armed groups in Syria -- invested in production facilities, warehouses and trafficking networks. This allowed Syria to emerge as the largest producer of Captagon globally, with some production also occurring in Lebanon.",
      "Most seized consignments of Captagon originated from Syria, according to data by the New Lines Captagon Trade Project, an initiative of the New Lines Institute think tank.",
      "Evidence of the Assad regime\u2019s sponsorship of the Captagon industry is overwhelming, the report published in May said. The Security Office of the 4th Armored Division of the Syrian Arab Army, headed by Bashar al-Assad\u2019s brother Maher oversaw operations and created a coordinated production system, the report added.",
      "Captagon was smuggled across borders in trucks and cargo shipments. Sometimes the drugs were concealed in food, electronics and construction materials to evade detection.",
      "The primary smuggling routes were Syria\u2019s porous borders with Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, from which the drug was distributed throughout the region. The leading markets are wealthy Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "In Lebanon, the Captagon trade has flourished, particularly near the Syrian border and in the Bekaa Valley. Lebanese authorities struggled to curb the flow of Captagon from Syria, which analysts say was facilitated by the Hezbollah militant group.",
      "Following the discovery of crates of fruit meticulously packed with bundles of the drug hidden among pomegranates and oranges, Saudi Arabia and the UAE implemented bans on Lebanese agricultural products.",
      "Captagon has also found its way as far as Southeast Asia and parts of Europe.",
      "The annual global trade in Captagon had an estimated value of $10 billion, with the ousted Assad family's annual profit reaching around $2.4 billion, according to Caroline Rose, director of the New York-based New Lines Institute Captagon Trade Project.",
      "\u201cSeeing the uncovering of so many industrial-scale facilities affiliated with the regime was shocking but not surprising. There was extensive evidence linking key regime-aligned cronies and Assad family members to the trade,\u201d said Rose, whose organization tracks all publicly recorded Captagon seizures and lab raids.",
      "The discovery of the facilities, she said, confirmed \"the concrete relationship between Captagon and the former regime.\u201d",
      "The exact number of factories in Syria remains unclear, but experts and HTS members estimate that there are likely hundreds spread throughout the country.",
      "While neighboring countries have long sought to curb drug trafficking, their influence over Assad was limited.",
      "Saudi Arabia imposed strict penalties for Captagon trafficking and enhanced border security, collaborating with other Gulf states to monitor smuggling routes. However, these efforts faced challenges from the complex networks operating across Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.",
      "Captagon provided Assad's government with leverage to end his political isolation. In recent years, as several Arab states reestablished ties with him, stopping the Captagon trade was a key demand in talks aimed at normalizing relations. In May 2023, Syria was readmitted to the Arab League, where it had been suspended since 2011 due to Assad\u2019s brutal crackdown on protesters.",
      "Syria pledged to clamp down on smuggling, leading to the formation of a regional security coordination committee.",
      "Shortly after the summit and in a possible sign of behind-the-scenes trade-offs, Jordan intensified surveillance along the Syrian border. Activists and experts attributed airstrikes on a known drug kingpin\u2019s home and on a suspected Captagon factory near Daraa to Jordan, likely with Assad\u2019s consent.",
      "Assad has turned Syria into \u201cthe largest Captagon factory in the world,\u201d HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa stated in a victory speech at Damascus\u2019s Umayyad Mosque on Dec. 8. \u201cToday, Syria is being cleansed, thanks to the grace of Almighty God.\"",
      "While Assad and his circle may have been the primary beneficiaries, there is also evidence that Syrian opposition groups were involved in drug smuggling. Rebel groups, local militias and organized crime networks manufactured and smuggled the drug to finance their operations, analysts say.",
      "\u201cLikely, we will see a short-term supply reduction in the trade, with a decline in the size and frequency of seizures as industrial-scale production is largely halted. However, criminal actors are innovative, likely seeking out new locations to engage in production and smuggling, particularly as demand levels remain stable,\u201d Rose said.",
      "They may also \u201cseek out alternative illicit trades to engage in instead,\u201d she said.",
      "In addition to dismantling the Captagon trade, the country's transitional government should \u201cestablish programs for economic development that will incentivize Syrians to participate in the country\u2019s formal, licit economic sphere,\u201d Rose said."

      "More than 1,200 people were arrested for the disorder that lasted a week and hundreds have been jailed for up to nine years in prison.",

      "A released hostage in Gaza is fighting to save her boyfriend, who remains in captivity",
      "KIRYAT GAT, Israel -- Ilana Gritzewsky is fighting a battle against time to save her boyfriend from Hamas captivity.",
      "While there appears to be progress toward a deal to free the remaining captives in phases, Matan Zangauker would likely not be released in the first stage since he is a young man. Gritzewsky is terrified a deal could break down or he could die in captivity before he\u2019s freed.",
      "Gritzewsky knows first-hand the perils facing her boyfriend, who turned 25 on Wednesday. She was kidnapped and held hostage for 55 days before being released during the only previous ceasefire deal a year ago.",
      "\u201cAll the hostages need to get out,\u201d said Gritzewsky. \u201cIf we don\u2019t release all of the hostages \u2014 all the hostages in captivity \u2014 they will be dead.\u201d",
      "Many relatives of people held in Gaza find no reprieve in reports that negotiations toward a deal are progressing. The renewed ceasefire talks are just the latest twist in what\u2019s been more than 14 months of anguish, despair and uncertainty about their loved ones\u2019 fates. Still, they dedicate themselves to lobbying for their loved ones\u2019 freedom, even as the world moves on to other crises.",
      "\u201cI gave my promise to my friends from the kibbutz in the tunnels before I went home. I told them I will do everything, everything I have to, to take them out from that hell. And I ask all the time: Am I doing everything I can?\u201d said Gritzewsky, 31.",
      "Hamas militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and abducting roughly 250, dragging them into Gaza. The attack sparked an Israeli invasion of Gaza. More than 45,000 people have been killed in the ongoing war, according to local health authorities, who say more than half are women and children but do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count.",
      "About 100 hostages were freed in a brief truce in November 2023, while others have been rescued or their bodies have been retrieved by the Israeli military. Around another 100 have not been released, though Israel believes at least a third of them are dead.",
      "In the deal under discussion, mostly women and older people are expected to be freed in the first six-to-eight-week phase, but many families of hostages are lobbying for all of the hostages to be freed at once.",
      "Zangauker and Gritzewsky were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where they lived together, and then held separately in Gaza. Just before her release from a tunnel under Gaza, Gritzewsky heard from other hostages that Zangauker was nearby. She begged to be able to see him but was not allowed.",
      "Two weeks ago, Hamas released a video of Zangauker, filmed under duress, where he described difficult conditions in Gaza and pleaded with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to strike a deal to end the war.",
      "\u201cHe spoke quietly, but his eyes were screaming for help,\u201d Gritzewsky said of the footage.",
      "While it was a relief to see Zangauker, the video is no guarantee that he\u2019s still alive today, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want a photo. I don\u2019t want a video. I want him here. I want all the hostages here,\u201d she said.",
      "The video brought back some of the worst memories of her captivity: the middle of the night interrogations, the filthy conditions, the lack of medical help for the injuries she suffered during the kidnapping. Gritzewsky's pelvis and jaw were broken and she has burns on her legs. She suffered hearing loss in one ear.",
      "\u201cWhat they are going through is physically, psychologically, and emotionally torture, day and night,\u201d said Gritzewsky, wearing a hat that belonged to Zangauker that she rescued from their destroyed home. \u201cI know the psychology that they use, how you don\u2019t have water, how you don\u2019t have food, how you don\u2019t see the light, you don\u2019t know what day or hour it is.\u201d",
      "Gritzewsky said she hates being in front of the cameras, telling her story over and over, reliving the worst days of her life, in a desperate attempt to raise awareness of the plight of the hostages and bring her boyfriend home.",
      "Nonetheless, Gritzewsky has been a constant presence at protests and demonstrations across the country along with Zangauker\u2019s mother, who has emerged as one of the most vocal activists for the hostages.",
      "Einav Zangauker, who used to support Netanyahu, has virulently opposed his handling of the war and is furious at the government for not yet reaching a ceasefire deal, accusing it of forsaking the hostages in its bid to topple Hamas.",
      "Netanyahu has said that the war must continue until Hamas is crushed and unable to rearm, but critics point out that Israel has already assassinated the top leadership and destroyed large swaths of Gaza.",
      "Einav Zangauker, a single mother, has been relentless in her crusade, attending demonstrations daily, speaking repeatedly to every major Israeli media outlet, and even climbing into a cage that was hoisted high above a protest to hammer home the idea of her son in captivity.",
      "She has demanded that politicians pursue a ceasefire that will release all the hostages at once.",
      "\u201cIf my son returns in a body bag or body parts, I will not put you on trial, I will take the law into my own hands!\u201d she screamed at lawmakers during a parliamentary committee meeting Monday.",
      "While Gritzewsky is no longer captive in Gaza, she said she can\u2019t begin to heal until the hostages, including her boyfriend, come home.",
      "\u201cSince Oct. 7, it\u2019s like time stopped,\" she said. \"You see the world running in front of your eyes, but your life is crushed like little pieces of dust.\u201d",

      "MAMOUDZOU, Mayotte -- They clustered around water taps, rare sources of electricity and each other. Four days after the strongest cyclone in nearly a century ripped through the French island territory of Mayotte off the coast of Africa, survivors recalled the horror of the storm that caught many by surprise.",

      "Streets were lined with the rubble of informal settlements whose migrant populations complicated the efforts to count the dead.",
      "\u201cWe lived something very apocalyptic,\u201d said Samuel Anli, 28, who rode out Saturday's storm in a windowless office for hours as shrieking wind gusts exceeding 220 kph (136 mph) tore away doors and walls.",
      "He and others held the door to their small office shut, fearing for their lives. \u201cWe thought if it lasted one or two hours more we\u2019d all be dead,\u201d he said. His home was partly destroyed and three of his relatives were injured by flying metal.",
      "On Wednesday, French authorities described the storm as a \"catastrophe of exceptional intensity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe island is devastated,\u201d they said, putting the confirmed death toll at 31 but noting that it could be much higher, partly because of the Muslim practice of burying the dead within 24 hours.",
      "Some survivors and aid groups have described hasty burials and the stench of bodies.",
      "Mayotte, located in the Indian Ocean between mainland Africa's east coast and northern Madagascar, is France\u2019s poorest territory and is a magnet for migrants hoping to reach Europe.",
      "The cyclone devastated entire neighborhoods as many people ignored the warnings, thinking the storm wouldn't be so extreme.",

      "Sarkozy, 69, faces a year in prison, but is expected to ask to be detained at home with an electronic bracelet \u2014 as is the case for any sentence of two years or less.",
      "He was found guilty of corruption and influence peddling by both a Paris court in 2021 and an appeals court in 2023 for trying to bribe a magistrate in exchange for information about a legal case in which he was implicated.",
      "\u201cThe convictions and sentences are therefore final,\u201d a Court of Cassation statement on Wednesday said.",
      "Sarkozy, who was France\u2019s president from 2007 to 2012, retired from public life in 2017 though still plays an influential role in French conservative politics. He was among the guests who attended the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral earlier this month.",
      "Sarkozy, in a statement posted on X, said \u201cI will assume my responsibilities and face all the consequences.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cI have no intention of complaining. But I am not prepared to accept the profound injustice done to me.\u201d",

      "It is the first time in France\u2019s modern history that a former president has been convicted and sentenced to a prison term for actions during his term.",
      "Sarkozy\u2019s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty in 2011 of misuse of public money during his time as Paris mayor and was given a two-year suspended prison sentence.",
      "Sarkozy has been involved in several other legal cases. He has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "He faces another trial next month in Paris over accusations he took millions of dollars from then-Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi to illegally finance his successful 2007 campaign.",
      "The corruption case that led to Wednesday's ruling focused on phone conversations that took place in February 2014.",
      "At the time, investigative judges had launched an inquiry into the financing of Sarkozy\u2019s 2007 presidential campaign. During the inquiry, they discovered that Sarkozy and his lawyer, Thierry Herzog, were communicating via secret mobile phones registered to the alias \u201cPaul Bismuth.\u201d",
      "Wiretapped conversations on those phones led prosecutors to suspect Sarkozy and Herzog of promising magistrate Gilbert Azibert a job in Monaco in exchange for leaking information about another legal case involving Sarkozy. Azibert never got the post and legal proceedings against Sarkozy have been dropped in the case he was seeking information about.",
      "Prosecutors had concluded, however, that the proposal still constitutes corruption under French law, even if the promise wasn\u2019t fulfilled. Sarkozy vigorously denied any malicious intention in his offer to help Azibert.",
      "Azibert and Herzog have also been found guilty in the case."

    "story": [
      "For more than a decade, farmers in parts of southwest Georgia haven\u2019t been able to drill new irrigation wells to the Floridian aquifer",
      "ATLANTA -- Jason Cox, who grows peanuts and cotton in southwest Georgia, says farming would be economically impossible without water to irrigate his crops.",
      "\u201cI'd be out of business,\u201d said Cox, who farms 3,000 acres (1,200 hectares) acres around Pelham.",
      "For more than a decade, farmers in parts of southwest Georgia haven't been able to drill new irrigation wells to the Floridian aquifer, the groundwater nearest the surface. That's because Georgia put a halt to farmers drilling wells or taking additional water from streams and lakes in 2012.",
      "Farmers like Cox, though, will get a chance to drill new wells beginning in April. Gov. Brian Kemp announced Wednesday that Georgia's Environmental Protection Division will begin accepting applications for new agricultural wells in areas along the lower Flint River starting April 1.",
      "Jeff Cown, the division's director, said in a statement that things have changed since 2012. The moratorium was imposed amid a parching drought and the collapse of the once-prolific oyster fishery in Florida's Apalachicola Bay.",
      "The state of Florida sued in 2013, arguing that Georgia's overuse of water from the Flint was causing negative impacts downstream where the Flint and Chattahoochee River join to become the Apalachicola River. But a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court in 2021 rejected the lawsuit, saying Florida hadn't proved its case that water use by Flint River farmers was at fault.",
      "That was one lawsuit in decades of sprawling litigation that mostly focused on fear that Atlanta\u2019s ever-growing population would suck up all the upstream water and leave little for uses downstream. The suits include the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint system and the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa system, which flows out of Georgia to drain much of Alabama. Georgia also won victories guaranteeing that metro Atlanta had rights to water from the Chattahoochee River's Lake Lanier to quench its thirst.",
      "Georgia officials say new water withdrawals won't disregard conservation. No new withdrawals from streams or lakes will be allowed. And new wells will have to stop sucking up water from the Floridian aquifer when a drought gets too bad, in part to protect water levels in the Flint, where endangered freshwater mussels live. New wells will also be required to be connected to irrigation systems that waste less water and can be monitored electronically, according to a November presentation posted by the environmental agency.",
      "In a statement, Cown said the plans \"support existing water users, including farmers, and set the stage to make room for new ones. We look forward to working with all water users as they obtain these newly, developed permits.\u201d",
      "Georgia had already been taking baby steps in this direction by telling farmers they could withdraw water to spray vulnerable crops like blueberries during freezing temperatures.",
      "Flint Riverkeeper Gordon Rogers, who heads the environmental organization of the same name, said Georgia's action is \u201cgood news.\u201d He has long contended that the ban on new withdrawals was \u201can admission of failure,\" showing how Georgia had mismanaged water use along the river. But he said investments in conservation are paying off: Many farmers are installing less wasteful irrigators and some agreed to stop using existing shallow wells during drought in exchange for subsidies to drill wells to deeper aquifers that don't directly influence river flow.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is make it more efficient, make it more equitable and make it more fair,\" Rogers said. \"And we\u2019re in the middle of doing that.\u201d",
      "A lawyer for Florida environmental groups that contend the Apalachicola River and Bay are being harmed declined comment in an email. Representatives for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and state Attorney General Ashley Moody did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Cox, who lives about 165 miles (265 kilometers) south of Atlanta, said he's interested in drilling a new well on some land that he owns. Right now, that land relies on water from a neighboring farmer's well.",
      "He knows the drought restrictions would mean there would be times he couldn't water his crops, but said data he's seen show there wouldn't have been many days over the last 10 years when he would have been barred from irrigating, and that most of those days wouldn't have been during peak watering times for his crops.",
      "Three years ago, Cox drilled a well for some land into a deeper aquifer, but he said even spending $30,000 or more on a shallower well would boost the productivity and value of his land.",
      "\u201cIt would enhance my property if I had a well myself,\" Cox said."

      "Donald Trump has delivered a probable death blow to bipartisan congressional budget negotiations by rejecting the measure as a \u201cbetrayal of our country\u201d just days before a spending deadline",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump delivered a probable death blow to bipartisan congressional budget negotiations on Wednesday, rejecting the measure as full of giveaways to Democrats and increasing the risk of a government shutdown right before Christmas.",
      "\u201cRepublicans must GET SMART and TOUGH. If Democrats threaten to shut down the government unless we give them everything they want, then CALL THEIR BLUFF,\u201d Trump said in a joint statement with JD Vance, the vice president-elect.",
      "It was a display of dominance from a president-elect still a month away from inauguration who remains hundreds of miles away at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. It reinjected a sense of chaos and political brinkmanship that was reminiscent of his first term in office.",
      "The episode also showcased the influence of Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who spent the day attacking the budget legislation as full of excessive spending. They kicked up a storm on social media \u2014 Musk even threatened to support primary challenges against anyone who voted for the measure \u2014 before Trump decided to weigh in himself.",
      "\u201cKill the Bill!\u201d Musk wrote on his social media platform X as he gleefully reposted messages from Republican House members who vowed not to back the bill.",
      "Trump\u2019s allies were overjoyed by his intervention, viewing it as the fulfillment of his promise to shake up Washington. But lawmakers were also left bewildered by how a crucial bipartisan deal could fall apart so quickly just days before the deadline. There are also questions about the future of Trump-backed House Speaker Mike Johnson, who was pushing the budget legislation and is up for reelection for his post in just a couple of weeks."

    "summary": "New York prosecutors are using a 9/11-era anti-terrorism law in their case against the man charged with killing UnitedHealthcare&rsquo;s CEO",
    "story": [
      "New York prosecutors are using a 9/11-era anti-terrorism law in their case against the man charged with killing UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO",
      "NEW YORK -- New York prosecutors are using a 9/11-era anti-terrorism law in their case against the man charged with gunning down UnitedHealthcare's CEO outside a midtown Manhattan hotel.",
      "Luigi Mangione was indicted on charges of murder as an act of terrorism, under a state law that allows for stiffer sentences when a killing is aimed at terrifying civilians or influencing government.",
      "If it sounds like an unusual application of a terrorism law, it\u2019s not the first time the statute has been applied to a case that wasn't about cross-border extremism or a plot to kill masses of people.",
      "Mangione is jailed on other charges in Pennsylvania, where he is scheduled to appear at an extradition hearing Thursday that could clear the way for him to be brought to New York.",
      "Here are some things to know about the anti-terrorism law and the case surrounding the death of Brian Thompson.",
      "Mangione is charged with first-degree and second-degree murder counts that specifically refer to a New York law that addresses terrorism. Essentially an add-on to existing criminal statutes, it says that an underlying offense constitutes \u201ca crime of terrorism\u201d if it's done \u201cwith intent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policy of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion or affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder, assassination or kidnapping.\u201d",
      "If a defendant is convicted, the \u201ccrime of terrorism\u201d designation boosts the underlying offense into a more serious sentencing category. For example, an assault normally punishable by up to 25 years in prison would carry a potential life sentence.",
      "Mangione would face a possible life sentence if convicted.",
      "New York does not have the death penalty. The state's highest court threw out a capital punishment law in 2004.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg put it simply: \u201cThe intent was to sow terror.\" The Democratic prosecutor noted that the shooting unfolded early on a workday in a heavily trafficked business and tourist area, and he mentioned Mangione's writings, while declining to get more specific.",
      "When arrested, the 26-year-old was carrying a handwritten letter that called health insurance companies \u201cparasitic\u201d and complained about corporate greed, according to a law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch has said Mangione also was carrying a gun that matched shell casings at the crime scene. Investigators say ammunition found near Thompson\u2019s body bore the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d mimicking a phrase some people use to decry insurers' practices.",
      "Deputy Commissioner Rebecca Weiner said the reaction to Thompson's killing shows it fits within a law against violence designed to intimidate a civilian population.",
      "The shooting prompted a wave of public criticism of the health insurance industry. Much of it is people sharing stories and frustration, but there also have been \u201cwanted\u201d posters targeting other health care honchos. Concerned companies have taken top executives' biographies offline, canceled in-person shareholder meetings and even told employees to work from home temporarily.",
      "His New York attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, has declined to comment.",
      "State lawmakers passed it in 2001, six days after the Sept. 11 attacks, saying the state needed \"legislation that is specifically designed to combat the evils of terrorism\" and that wasn't just for federal courts. Then-state Sen. Michael Balboni, who was among the law's leading proponents, recalls pointing out that many cases could come via state and local law enforcement officers, who far outnumbered federal agents in New York.",
      "Many other states passed similar laws around the same time, and Congress approved the Patriot Act.",
      "There's no comprehensive count of cases where the anti-terrorism statute was used, because it can be layered onto many different types of charges, from weapons possession to murder.",
      "The specific first-degree murder \u201cin furtherance of an act of terrorism\u201d charge against Mangione has been the top count in only three other cases statewide, according to the Division of Criminal Justice Services.",
      "In New York City alone, over a half-dozen cases of various sorts have used the terror law, starting with the 2004 indictment of a Bronx gang member. He was accused of killing a 10-year-old girl and paralyzing a man at a christening party.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors got convictions or guilty pleas in cases including plots to bomb synagogues or open fire on their congregants; a plan to build pipe bombs to try to undermine public support for the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; alleged efforts to recruit support for the Islamic State group and to provide money and knives to Syrian extremists; and a white supremacist who killed a Black man because of racial hatred.",
      "Friedman Agnifilo was a top deputy to Bragg's predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr., when some of those cases were prosecuted.",
      "Lawmakers set the parameters broadly. The law doesn't say that cases have to involve mass casualties or international extremism, Balboni said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re trying to prevent individuals in this country who want to change government and use extremism and violence to that end,\u201d whether what they want to change is foreign policy or health care industry regulation, said.",
      "Courts haven't set out overarching rules for when a case qualifies. However, the state's top court said the Bronx gang member's case did not.",
      "The high court overturned his conviction. Justices were skeptical that the shooting \u2014 allegedly targeting a rival gang member \u2014 was meant to intimidate the broader community. They also worried that the meaning of terrorism could be trivialized if \"applied loosely in situations that do not match our collective understanding of what constitutes a terrorist act.\u201d",
      "The man, who denied involvement in the shooting, was retried on manslaughter and other charges. He was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison.",
      "Yes. The indictment includes another second-degree murder charge that doesn't have the terrorism allegation, as well as eight weapons-possession counts."

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 17:46:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Global battery maker CATL says it will expand its electric vehicle battery swapping in China in 2025",
    "story": [
      "Global battery maker CATL says it will expand its electric vehicle battery swapping in China in 2025",
      "Detroit -- China will soon see a massive expansion of electric vehicle battery swapping, as global battery maker CATL said Wednesday it is investing heavily in stations there next year.",
      "Battery swapping is not new \u2014 but it's had a challenging journey. Adoption of electric vehicles has varied in regions across the globe over the past several years, and that doesn't always bode well for building new infrastructure.",
      "While the technology could do well in China, it's uncertain whether it could work in other countries.",
      "Battery swapping allows EV drivers to pull into a station on a low battery and receive a swapped, fully-charged battery within minutes.",
      "An EV has to be equipped with the right technology to receive a swap \u2014 and not many models around the world currently have it. Automakers have to buy into the idea, and EV adoption among consumers also has to grow, so that investing in new infrastructure seems worthwhile. Consumers also have to be comfortable not owning their battery.",
      "China is much further along in adopting EVs than other countries.",
      "Not only is it the world's largest auto market, but in July, the country hit a milestone with 50% of new sales electric \u2014 and it accounts for most of this year's global EV sales.",
      "China supports EV growth through government subsidies and mandates. So it makes more sense for companies to invest in unique EV infrastructure there because that's more likely to be needed.",
      "The most notable example might be Israeli startup Better Place, which tried its hand at swapping in 2007.",
      "But the company shut down a few years later after investing a lot of money and coming up against roadblocks with logistics. EV adoption was especially low at the time.",
      "Startup Ample, for example, has a modular battery swapping station that it says can complete a swap in 5 minutes. That\u2019s important as charging time remains a point of concern for prospective EV buyers. Even the fastest fast chargers could take at least 15 minutes for a decent charge.",
      "But in the U.S., pure EVs only accounted for 8% of new vehicle sales as of November.",
      "Meanwhile Nio, a rival Chinese EV brand, has about 60 swap stations in northern Europe, and the EV adoption is higher there than the U.S., but the same challenges remain.",
      "Different automakers put different batteries in their various EV models, so a station would need all of those available if the industry didn't agree to a standardized battery, and not all of those models are out yet in volume. This is something that really needs scale.",
      "Swapping could help with EV cost \u2014 currently a barrier to adoption for many \u2014 because a driver wouldn\u2019t necessarily own the most expensive part of an EV: the battery.",
      "Greg Less, director of the University of Michigan Battery Lab, said with proper framing and education, people might like the idea of battery swapping. To him, it's not unlike buying a propane-fueled grill and purchasing a refilled tank every so often. But it would require a rethinking of car ownership.",
      "\"Where I could see it working is if we went entirely away from vehicle ownership and we went to a use-on-demand model,\" Less added. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet.\u201d",
      "Battery swapping might make most sense for ride-sharing or other fleet vehicles.",
      "Drivers of buses, taxis, Uber or Lyft vehicles want to spend as much time on the road as possible, transporting customers and making money. If battery swapping can shorten the time needed to charge EVs, that makes driving one less disruptive to their business.",

      "NEW YORK -- Billionaire author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott acknowledged another $2 billion in donations in a blog post on Wednesday, bringing the total she\u2019s given away since 2019 to $19.2 billion.",
      "She also revealed new information about how she was managing her wealth, saying she had directed advisors to invest her funds into \u201cmission-aligned ventures.\u201d Most of the grants she made in 2024, she said, went to bolstering economic security and opportunities..",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve asked the investment team helping me manage the assets I\u2019m working to give away to source funds and companies focused on for-profit solutions to these challenges,\u201d Scott wrote. That is in contrast to \u201cwithdrawing funds from a bank account, or from a stock portfolio that increases the wealth and influence of leaders who already have it.\u201d",
      "Most of Scott's wealth comes from shares of Amazon that she received when she divorced the company\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos. Forbes estimates her current wealth to be $31.7 billion, even after giving away her money for five years.",
      "Gabrielle Fitzgerald, founder and CEO of The Panorama Group, has researched Scott's giving and provided advice and support for nonprofits who have received Scott's gifts. She said she sees a growing focus in Scott's giving on issues of poverty.",
      "\u201cShe is creating an amazing role model for philanthropists, although I don\u2019t see very many that have followed her role modeling,\" Fitzgerald said. \"But it really shows that it\u2019s easy to give away a lot of money to good groups.\u201d",
      "In announcing the gifts on her Yield Giving website, Scott mulled over the meaning of \u201cinvesting,\u201d writing that it \"seems to have undergone a kind of semantic shriveling. On the list of its big, beautiful, original definitions? To devote resources for a useful purpose. To endow with rights. To clothe.\u201d",
      "Scott, who does not comment on her giving beyond the rare post on her website, has shaken up the nonprofit sector with her embrace of \u201ctrust-based philanthropy,\u201d providing big grants with no strings attached to over 2,450 nonprofits.",
      "In 2024, she also gave repeat gifts to several organizations \u2014 something of a new development in her giving, which has set a high bar for how much and how fast megadonors can give. Two organizations, CAMFED, which supports girls education in Africa, and Undue Medical Debt, which was formerly called RIP Medical Debt, both got third donations from Scott this year.",
      "Grantees say that when Scott's team notifies them of grants they say not to expect additional support. So it was a surprise for Shaun Donovan, CEO of the affordable housing organization Enterprise Community Partners, when he got the news of a second, major donation.",
      "\u201cI was taking my luggage off the security screener at LaGuardia Airport and my phone rang and I was told that MacKenzie Scott was awarding us another $65 million,\u201d Donovan said in an interview in November.",
      "His organization had received $50 million from Scott in 2020, making them one of the nonprofits that has received the most funding from Scott, based on grant data made public on Yield Giving. About 500 organizations have not disclosed the amount of funding they've received from Scott.",
      "\u201cWe were not expecting their second gift. Every time they award this funding, they\u2019re very clear that organizations should not expect it,\u201d Donovan said, adding his advice is, \u201cReally treat it that way. Don\u2019t use it for regular operating expenses. Don\u2019t use it for things that will create a cliff or a hole in your budget for your organization.\u201d",
      "This year was already a standout in Scott's giving because it was the first time that she awarded grants through an application process. In March, she announced the recipients of an \u201copen call\u201d for applications from nonprofits. She surprised recipients by awarding more money to more organizations than she had initially promised, committing $640 million to more than 360 nonprofits.",
      "In one measure of the demand for the large and unrestricted grants she makes, 6,353 nonprofits applied through the nonprofit Lever for Change, which ran the \u201copen call\u201d for Scott. Ultimately, 279 nonprofits were awarded $2 million, while 82 organizations received $1 million each. Previously, organizations have said they've responded to questions from an anonymous donor who turned out to be Scott or just received an email or cold call without any application at all.",
      "The fact that her grants are unrestricted, meaning that nonprofits can use them however they want to further their charitable purpose, is part of what makes them so valuable, Donovan said. Five years into her philanthropic blitz, he said it's now possible to see her impact across whole sectors.",
      "\u201cThe scale of this giving has really not just changed individual organizations but changed entire fields like affordable housing,\u201d he said.",

      "The agency has said inflators in about 49 million vehicles from 13 manufacturers are at risk of exploding and hurling shrapnel into drivers and passengers. They're responsible for at least seven injuries and two deaths in the U.S. and Canada since 2009, and recalling all of them would have cost millions of dollars.",
      "But in a document posted Wednesday in the Federal Register and dated Dec. 13, the agency said it considered comments on a decision from July seeking the recall. The auto industry pointed to technical and engineering differences between ARC inflators in vehicles made by different manufacturers. The comments also raised manufacturing-process variations at different plants that made the ARC inflators.",
      "\u201cGiven the potential relevance of these issues to the agency's decision making, including the appropriate scope of any recall, further investigation is warranted,\u201d the agency said in the document.",
      "A message was left Wednesday seeking comment from ARC, which is owned by by Yinyi Group of China.",
      "NHTSA said Wednesday that it carefully considered the comments on its decision to seek a recall of all the inflators and decided that more investigation is warranted.",
      "The agency said that in the coming weeks it will send more information request letters to ARC, vehicle manufacturers and air bag-module manufacturing companies.",
      "\u201cNHTSA will evaluate the responses to these information request along with all available information to determine how to proceed,\u201d the agency\u2019s memorandum said. \u201cIf appropriate, NHTSA will provide a further opportunity for public comment prior to considering whether to issue a final decision in this matter.\u201d",
      "The agency has been investigating ARC since 2015 after drivers-side inflators blew apart in a 2004 Kia in Canada and a 2002 Chrysler Town & Country minivan in the U.S., both injuring people.",
      "In a supplemental decision in July, NHTSA said seven ARC inflators have ruptured in the field in the U.S., each showing evidence of insufficient welds or too much pressure in a canister designed to contain the explosion and fill the air bags in a crash.",
      "In addition, the agency said 23 inflators have ruptured in testing with causes common to the inflators that blew apart in the field. Also, four inflators have ruptured outside the U.S., killing at least one person, the agency said.",
      "\u201cTo be sure, the overwhelming majority of the subject inflators will not rupture upon deployment,\u201d NHSTA wrote in July. \u201cHowever, based on the evidence linking past ruptures to the same friction welding process, all of the subject inflators are at risk of rupturing.\u201d",
      "But several automakers argued in public comments that years of investigations by NHTSA did not establish a systemic design defect. Some said none of the millions of inflators in their vehicles have ruptured due to the cause pointed out by the agency.",
      "NHTSA had said the only way to know which of the ARC-designed inflators will blow apart is for them to deploy in a crash. The federal motor vehicle safety act \u201cdoes not allow such a defect to go unaddressed,\u201d the agency said.",
      "One person who died after an ARC inflator explosion was Marlene Beaudoin, a 40-year-old mother of 10 from Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. She was struck by metal fragments when her 2015 Chevrolet Traverse SUV was involved in a minor crash in 2021. Beaudoin and four of her sons had been on their way to get ice cream. The sons were not hurt.",
      "____",
      "This story has been correct to show that the most recent NHTSA decision on the ARC recall was July, not January."

      "WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department's efforts to curb China's and Russia's access to American-made advanced computer chips have been \u201cinadequate\u201d and will need more funding to stymie their ability to manufacture advanced weapons, according to a report published Wednesday by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.",
      "The Biden administration imposed export controls to limit the ability of China and Russia to access U.S.-made chips after Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago.",
      "The agency's Bureau of Industry and Security, according to the report, does not have the resources to enforce export controls and has been too reliant on U.S. chip makers voluntarily complying with the rules.",
      "But the push for bolstering Commerce's export control enforcement comes as the incoming Trump administration says it is looking to dramatically reduce the size and scope of federal government. President-elect Donald Trump has tapped entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d to dismantle parts of the federal government.",
      "The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.",

      "In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, chair of the subcommittee, pointed to news reports of the Russian military continuing to acquire components from Texas Instruments through front companies in Hong Kong to illustrate how the export controls are failing as an effective tool.",
      "Texas Instruments did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cWhile Congress must provide BIS more resources to undertake its critical mission, it is long past time for BIS to make full use of the enforcement powers Congress has conferred upon it and take aggressive steps to cut the flow of U.S. semiconductors into the Russian war machine,\u201d Blumenthal wrote.",
      "Blumenthal in a separate statement added that he was calling on \"Commerce to take immediate action and crack down on the companies allowing U.S.-made semiconductors to power Russian weapons and Chinese ambition.\u201d",
      "It's not just Texas Instruments that's the issue. The subcommittee in September published a report that found aggregated exports from four major U.S. advanced chip manufacturers nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022 to Armenia and Georgia.",
      "Both of those countries are home to front companies known to assist Russia in acquiring advanced chips made in the U.S. despite export controls.",
      "China, meanwhile, has created \u201cvast, barely disguised smuggling networks which enable it to continue to harness U.S. technology,\u201d the subcommittee report asserts.",
      "Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls in China, as President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of chips in the U.S.",

Currently, Commerce has only 11 export control officers spread around the globe to conduct such checks.",
      "The committee made several recommendations in its report, including Congress allocating more money for hiring additional personnel to enforce export controls, imposing larger fines on companies that violate controls and requiring periodic reviews of advanced chip companies\u2019 export control plans by outside entities.",

    "story": [
      "A report by CNN's Clarissa Ward about a freed Syrian prisoner provided some dramatic scenes, but the network has since found that it apparently wasn't all that it appeared",
      "CNN is acknowledging that a gripping story it aired last week depicting a Syrian man being let free from a Damascus prison after the fall of dictator Bashar Assad's regime was not what it seemed.",
      "The network said that it has since found out that the man shown in correspondent Clarissa Ward's report, which initially aired on Dec. 11, apparently gave a false identity.",
      "\u201cThis moment captures the complexity of the situation in Syria,\u201d CNN's Jake Tapper said on Tuesday.",
      "In the report, Ward was being escorted by a Syrian rebel through a prison that had been run by the Syrian Air Force intelligence services and emptied since the Assad government fell. That's what they thought, at least \u2014 until they came upon a padlocked door.",
      "The rebel guard shot the lock to open the door to a cell, where they found a man hiding under a blanket. Clearly bewildered and shaking, he gulped water when offered, said \u201coh, God, there is light!\u201d when led outdoors and hugged the guard when told of the change in power.",
      "He told Ward that his name was Adel Ghurbal from the Syrian city of Homs, and that he was a civilian who had been arrested three months ago and spent time in three different prisons.",
      "But a few days later, a Syrian fact-checking site, Verify-Sy, said that the man was really Salama Mohammad Salama, and that he was a former intelligence officer for the Assad government. CNN obtained a photo of Salama and, through facial recognition software, found that it was a better than 99 percent chance that was the same man from their report, the network said.",
      "Ward said Tuesday that CNN didn't know why he had been arrested. Verify-Sy reported that Salama, who had a reputation for extortion, had been thrown in prison because of a dispute with a superior officer over sharing some of the profits, she said. CNN has been unable to confirm that or locate Salama, she said.",
      "A CNN spokeswoman said that no one outside of the network knew ahead of time of the plans to visit the prison. CNN reported the scene as it unfolded, the network said.",
      "It was arresting video, and the temptation to air Ward's story was obvious. While CNN did due diligence and research in uncovering the problem after the fact, the question is whether the network could have, or should have, done more to verify the prisoner's story before it was used.",
      "\u201cI think we need to be humble about the challenges,\u201d Ward said on the air Tuesday. \u201cIt is a chaotic atmosphere, there is a huge amount of flux, and it is very difficult to verify information in real time on the ground ... Stories take unexpected turns. We have to continue to report them without fear or favor, but it is immensely challenging in this environment and I think we need to be transparent about that.\u201d",

    "summary": "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving",
    "story": [
      "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving",
      "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving.",
      "This week, Undue Medical Debt, formerly RIP Medical Debt, announced it had received a rare third gift \u2014 $50 million \u2014 from the billionaire philanthropist, signaling her satisfaction with the group\u2019s efforts to purchase medical debt in bulk from hospitals and debt collectors. Scott has donated a total of $130 million to the organization since 2020.",
      "Medical debt is increasing despite most of the U.S. population having some form of medical insurance. Nearly 100 million people are unable to pay their medical bills, according to Third Way, a left-leaning national think tank.",
      "Overall, Americans owe about $220 billion in medical debt, with historically disadvantaged groups shouldering the bulk of the burden. Lower-income people, people with disabilities, middle-aged adults, Black people, the uninsured, and people living in rural areas are among the groups most likely to be affected by medical debt, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.",
      "Undue Medical Debt buys debt at a discounted price, estimating that it erases about $100 in debt for each $1 donated. The group also collaborates with policymakers to encourage the adoption of measures to curb what people owe for medical care. Scott first gave Undue Medical Debt a $50 million donation in 2020, followed by a $30 million donation in 2022.",
      "With that money, the group has relieved nearly $15 billion in debt for more than 9 million people, CEO Allison Sesso said. That\u2019s a significant leap from the $1 billion in debt relieved from 2014 to 2019, she noted.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m frankly astounded by this most recent gift from MacKenzie Scott and feel proud to be a steward of these funds as we continue the essential work of dismantling the yoke of medical debt that\u2019s burdening far too many families in this country,\u201d said Sesso.",
      "The continued funding has allowed Sesso \u201cto not have to worry about my next dollar,\u201d she said, and \u201cthink more strategically about the narrative around medical debt \u2014 she has helped us push that conversation.\u201d",
      "Undue Medical Debt was started in 2014 by two former debt collection executives, Jerry Ashton and Craig Antico, who were inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement\u2019s advocacy for debt relief. Growth initially was slow. But with Scott\u2019s gifts, the nonprofit has been able to staff up, produce more research, and develop relationships with policymakers who have pushed for changes to hospital billing practices to relieve debt and prevent people from accumulating it in the first place, Sesso said.",
      "Undue Medical Debt\u2019s public policy arm has worked with lawmakers in North Carolina, which in July became the first state to offer additional Medicaid payments to hospitals that agree to adopt debt relief measures, she said. The policy change followed the publication of a 2023 report from Duke University, which found that one in five families in the state had been forced into collections proceedings because of medical debt.",
      "Since 2020, the organization\u2019s staff has grown from three to about 40, Sesso said. Those hires included an anthropologist who collects stories from people set back by medical debt to inform the group\u2019s research and advocacy work. Scott\u2019s gifts also have helped improve Undue Medical Debt\u2019s technology to identify people eligible for debt relief and to find hospitals from which it can purchase medical debt, among other things, Sesso said.",
      "\u201cThis coming year, because of this MacKenzie Scott grant, we\u2019ll be able to add more people, making sure that we can support that growth on an ongoing basis,\u201d Sesso said.",
      "Few organizations have received more than one gift from Scott. Other multi-grant recipients include Blue Meridian, an intermediary group that has directed billions of dollars to nonprofits around the world, and GiveDirectly, which provides no-strings-attached cash payments to low-income people globally. GiveDirectly has received $125 million from Scott since 2020. Blue Meridian has not disclosed amounts for the four gifts it\u2019s received since 2019.",
      "Scott\u2019s contributions to those two organizations were for specific causes like GiveDirectly\u2019s U.S. poverty relief fund, said Christina Im, a senior research analyst at the Center for Effective Philanthropy. In the case of Undue Medical Debt, the timing of Scott\u2019s first gifts in 2020 and 2022 seemed to correspond with COVID-relief efforts, she said.",
      "Scott, the former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is worth an estimated $32 billion but provides few details about her grantmaking decisions. Without further information, it\u2019s hard to know what prompted this third donation to Undue Medical Debt, but Scott has said in public statements that she wants to help those who are most in need and bear the brunt of societal ills, said Elisha Smith Arrillaga, the Center for Effective Philanthropy\u2019s vice president for research.",
      "\u201cI have not seen a lot of other folks funding in this area,\u201d Smith Arrillaga added.",
      "Scott\u2019s latest gift to Undue Medical Debt comes amid national debates about medical insurance and the cost of medical treatments. The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on December 4 in Midtown Manhattan has heightened these conversations, with some lionizing the man who allegedly committed the crime.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s no way to get change, full stop,\u201d Sesso said in reference to Thompson\u2019s murder. \u201cBut I think the anger around insurance companies and having access to care is very clear.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has one of the most expensive health care systems in the world. And the amount of medical debt carried by individuals seems to be increasing, noted Adam Searing, a public interest attorney and associate professor at Georgetown University, where he focuses on Medicaid and other health coverage programs.",
      "Searing previously served for 17 years as director of the Health Access Coalition at the nonprofit North Carolina Justice Center, advocating for the uninsured and underinsured. During that time, he heard from people losing their homes due to liens from hospitals. Sometimes those liens could be delayed, but it still meant that the debtors couldn\u2019t pass those homes along to their children or grandchildren, he said.",
      "\u201cThose stories stuck with me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really has an impact on families.\u201d",
      "Relieving debt allows people to get their lives back on track and become financially secure after a major illness or series of expensive bills, Searing said. For philanthropists, it\u2019s also a cause that is largely nonpartisan. Scott shining a spotlight on the issue is undoubtedly \u201ca good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will have a big effect.\u201d",

      "Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin proposed a state budget plan on Wednesday that would permanently give tax relief on tips and cars, measures that his Republican administration has said would give money back to middle- and lower-income workers",
      "RICHMOND -- Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin proposed a state budget plan on Wednesday to provide tax relief on tips and cars, measures his Republican administration touted as giving money back to middle- and lower-income workers.",
      "The proposal, which would amend the final year of the state's two-year budget cycle, also seeks to boost funding for schools, maternal health and disaster relief. An adviser for Youngkin said ahead of his speech that the proposed adjustments are fueled by surplus funds coming out of fiscal year 2024.",
      "\u201cWe reopened Virginia\u2019s economy after a global pandemic, all while delivering surplus after surplus after surplus,\u201d Youngkin said in a presentation to the General Assembly\u2019s money committees. \"And as a result of our work together, Virginia is growing, Virginia is leading and Virginia is winning.\u201d",
      "Budget plans introduced by governors typically undergo revisions by the money committees before lawmakers vote. And with Democrats poised to keep control of both General Assembly chambers after special elections in January, Youngkin's priorities may likely be contingent on bipartisanship.",
      "Democratic House of Appropriations Chair Luke Torian said on Wednesday that none of Youngkin's proposed amendments were off the table, clarifying that the state had roughly $2 billion to $3 billion in surplus funds. He also said that the state would have to be strategic in its spending, particularly if its economy takes a dip in years to come.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll go over the governor\u2019s presentation and we\u2019ll see what is applicable \u2014 what we can do, what we can\u2019t do,\u201d he said.",
      "Youngkin said $1.1 billion could be deposited into a car tax relief fund from the state's surplus, which would pre-fund its first three years. In his speech, he envisioned a permanent, refundable income tax credit of up to $150 for people earning under $50,000 a year, and up to $300 for joint filers making under $100,000 annually.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s give Virginia families relief on the most hated tax in America since the tax on tea: the local car tax,\u201d he said.",
      "He also pushed for Virginia to eliminate taxes on tips, which would make the Old Dominion the first state in the U.S. to take such action. Youngkin argued the proposal would save $70 million, though some Democrats questioned whether such fiduciary relief would be feasible.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that I read the legislation, there was no definition really, of what tips are, given that this is ground that hasn\u2019t been plowed before,\u201d Democratic Del. Vivian Watts said in the joint committee meeting. \u201dI look forward to a discussion before we act on any such legislation of how we define tips.\"",
      "Echoing nationwide concerns surrounding immigration, Youngkin emphasized he would also like to cut off funds toward local entities that do not fully comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 an initiative he said would weed out sanctuary cities.",
      "In his speech, Youngkin said local law enforcement, sheriffs and jail directors should be required to notify federal authorities of migrants\u2019 arrest 48 hours before their release. His proposal comes after the governor has gone on national news networks, lamenting illegal immigration.",
      "\u201cThis should be common sense. I don\u2019t think anybody wants an illegal immigrant who has committed a serious and violent crime to be released back in the community,\u201d Youngkin said.",
      "Youngkin\u2019s proposal to deny funds to jurisdictions that ignore immigration detainers would likely be held up by Democrats. But as lawmakers roll into an election year in 2025, immigration may be a key issue to voters across the state.",

      "Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 14:34:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s third interest rate cut of the year will likely have consequences for debt, savings, auto loans, mortgages and other forms of borrowing by consumers and businesses",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve\u2019s third interest rate cut of the year will likely have consequences for debt, savings, auto loans, mortgages and other forms of borrowing by consumers and businesses",
      "NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve's third interest rate cut of the year will likely have consequences for debt, savings, auto loans, mortgages and other forms of borrowing by consumers and businesses.",
      "But with inflation pressures still elevated and with concern that President-elect Donald Trump's policies could fuel inflation, the Fed indicated Wednesday that it's likely to cut rates more gradually in 2025 than it had projected three months ago. The policymakers now envision two rate cuts next year, not the four they predicted back in September.",
      "The result is that borrowers who have been hoping for much-lower-rate loans could be disappointed. Loan rates may barely budge if the Fed sticks with its plan to cut its key short-term rate only twice next year.",
      "\u201cThis could be the last cut for a while,\u201d said Jacob Channel, senior economist for LendingTree. \u201cBecause the upcoming Trump administration\u2019s policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting.\u201d",
      "Depending on the specific proposals the Trump administration manages to enact, the Fed could hold off on any additional cuts until March or even later.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "\u201cAnother rate cut is welcome news at the end of a chaotic year, but it ultimately doesn\u2019t amount to much for those with debt,\u201d said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. \u201cA quarter-point reduction may knock a dollar or two off your monthly debt payment. It certainly doesn\u2019t change the fact that the best thing cardholders can do in 2025 is to take matters into their own hands when it comes to high interest rates.\u201d",
      "The average annual percentage rate on a new credit card offer, according to LendingTree, is 24.43%. In September, it was 24.92%. Further modest declines in that rate, Schulz said, are possible in the next few months.",
      "But, he cautioned, \u201cAnyone expecting card rates to go from awful to amazing overnight because of the Fed is going to be sorely disappointed.\u201d",
      "Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said that particularly for credit card users who carry debt from month to month, \u201cIt\u2019s a drop in the bucket for anyone feeling pressure from high rates.\u201d",
      "For savers, returns on high-yield accounts have dropped, too, in tandem with the Fed's rate cuts. So while these accounts are not quite as attractive as they had been, they might still be worth investigating if you haven\u2019t shopped for one recently. Some of these accounts offer yields at or near 5%.",
      "\u201cYes, you\u2019ve missed the peak rates seen a few months ago,\" Schulz said. \u201cBut even at these levels, they\u2019re still likely higher than what you\u2019ll find at a traditional bank.\u201d",
      "Though the Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, it does influence them. Long-term mortgage rates generally track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which, in turn, is driven in part by the market's outlook for inflation and the Fed's benchmark rate.",
      "That means that, at least indirectly, cuts to the Fed\u2019s key rate can put downward pressure on mortgage rates, even if they don\u2019t move in lockstep.",
      "\u201cCase in point, turmoil in the bond market has caused mortgage rates to yo-yo up and down over the last month,\u201d Channel said. \u201cAfter peaking at 6.84% for the week ending Nov. 21, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has since come down to 6.60%.\u201d",
      "Despite this decline, this average remains well above the 2024 low of 6.08%, back in late September.",
      "For people with fixed mortgages, their rate won\u2019t change unless they refinance their mortgage or sell and move someplace else.",
      "The effects of the Fed\u2019s half-point rate cut in September and its quarter-point cut in November have largely been passed through to auto loans, which fell on average from a peak of 7.3% in July to 6.8% last month, said Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds.com.",
      "The half-point drop, he said, has helped more people afford new vehicles, helping to spur a buying spree in November. But the increased demand, which Drury attributed largely to some optimism over Trump's election, also boosted average prices and monthly payments to record levels.",
      "\u201cOptimism and having money on hand to do these things has definitely green-lit some people\u2019s spending, when other folks are more conservative with how much they\u2019re spending,\u201d he said.",
      "The average amount that a car buyer financed rose to $42,160, and average monthly payments hit $753, according to Edmunds data.",
      "Edmunds expects only a modest increase in auto sales next year, from just under 16 million vehicles this year to 16.2 million in 2025.",
      "\u201cThe Federal Open Market Committee is in a balancing act \u2014 cut (rates) too much and risk inflation resurgence; cut too little and continue to squeeze the labor market,\" said Renter of NerdWallet.",
      "Gregory Daco, chief economist for EY, suggested that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is reiterating \u201cthe familiar metaphor of moving slowly in a dark room full of objects to justify a potential rate cut \u2018skip\u2019 at the January meeting.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis will favor a gradual easing of policy to observe how the economy and inflation behave, indicating an extremely \u2018data-dependent\u2019 approach,\u201d Daco said.",
      "\u201cRemember,\" Channel said, \u201cthe Fed is designed to pivot relatively quickly should something unexpected happen. If the economy shows serious signs of deterioration, we could see bigger and more frequent cuts over the next 12 months.\u201d",
      "On the other hand, he cautioned, \"if inflation rears its head and spikes once more, (rate) cuts might be moved off the table.\u201d",

      "Republicans will still be in charge when the Wisconsin Legislature returns to work in January but will have the narrowest majorities in years",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- When the Wisconsin Legislature returns to work in January, Republicans will still be in charge but will have the narrowest majorities since taking control in 2011. That's giving Democrats, including Gov. Tony Evers, optimism that both sides will be able to work together better than they have since Evers took office six years ago.",
      "Both sides are eyeing the state's massive budget surplus, which sits at more than $4 billion. What to do with that money will drive debate over the next two-year budget, which will be written in 2025, while questions hang in the air about whether Evers plans to run for a third term in 2026 and how the state will interact with President-elect Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Here is a look at some of the biggest pending issues:",
      "Democrats gained seats in the November election because of redrawn maps ordered by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The Republican majority now sits at 54-45 in the Assembly and 18-15 in the Senate. Democrats have 10 more seats in the Assembly than last session and four more in the Senate and are hopeful about gaining the majority after the 2026 election.",
      "\u201cWe have already seen a shift in the Capitol due to the new maps,\u201d Assembly Democratic Minority Leader Great Neubauer told The Associated Press.",
      "She and other Democrats predict it will lead to more pressure from rank-and-file Republicans in competitive districts to move to the middle and compromise with Democrats.",
      "\u201cEverybody understands, at least at this point, that we need to work together, pull together,\u201d Republican Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu told the AP. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important to get some things done.\u201d",
      "Democrats say they have been talking with Evers and Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul about how Wisconsin can push back against the Trump administration\u2019s plans for mass deportations. But Democrats say they are also looking at other ways the state can fight Trump\u2019s policies on issues like abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re worried about a lot of the things that former and future President Trump might do, especially when it comes to deportation and immigration,\" Senate Democratic Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein said.",
      "Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said he would support Trump's efforts to deport people who are in the country illegally and commit crimes.",
      "Republicans passed a $3.5 billion tax cut that Evers gutted to just $175 million with his veto in the last budget. With another large surplus, Republicans say they want to try again.",
      "\u201cPeople struggling to pay their bills,\u201d LeMahieu said. \u201cWe heard that in our local races. And so we want to help help help families out there. We have the money to do it. And that\u2019s going to be our number one priority.\u201d",
      "Both he and Vos said they would like a tax cut of around $2 billion.",
      "Democrats say that they aren't opposed to cutting taxes, but that they want it to be targeted to helping the middle and lower classes and families.",
      "\u201cWe are not interested in tax cuts that primarily benefit rich Wisconsinites or corporations,\u201d Neubauer said. \u201cBut we are certainly open to tax cuts that help those who are struggling to make ends meet.\u201d",
      "The state superintendent of schools, Jill Underly, proposed spending more than $4 billion on K-12 schools in her budget proposal, which is subject to legislative approval. That's almost certainly not going to happen, both Republicans and Democrats said.",
      "\u201cWe're not going to spend $4 billion on education, I can guarantee you that right now,\u201d LeMahieu said.",
      "While Democrats say they are prioritizing education funding, \u201cI don't think we're going to be able to match that,\u201d Hesselbein said of the $4 billion request.",
      "Leaders of the cash-strapped Universities of Wisconsin have asked for $855 million in additional funding in the next budget, nearly an 11% increase. System President Jay Rothman says schools need the money to stave off tuition increases, cover raises, subsidize tuition, and keep two-year branch campuses open in the face of declining enrollment and flat state aid.",
      "Evers has promised to include the request in his budget, but Republican leaders said they would not approve that much, and Democrats also said it was a goal that was unlikely to be met.",
      "LeMahieu and Vos both said UW would not get what it wants.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to need to see some substantial change in how they\u2019re doing their programing,\u201d LeMahieu said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep spending more and more on a system that\u2019s educating less and less people.\u201d",
      "Vos said he intends to create a state-level task force to improve government efficiency, similar to what Trump created at the national level dubbed DOGE. He also supports passing a bill that will allow for the processing of absentee ballots the day before Election Day, a measure that's had bipartisan support in the past but failed to pass.",
      "Democrats say they will continue to push for ways to expand and reduce costs for child care, health care for new mothers and prescription drugs. Both Republicans and Democrats say they want to do more to create affordable housing. The future of the state's land stewardship program also hangs in in the balance after the state Supreme Court said Republicans were illegally blocking funding of projects.",
      "Democrats also say they hope to revive efforts to legalize medical marijuana, an effort that was backed by some Republicans but that failed to pass last session.",
      "LeMahieu predicted the slimmer Republican majorities will make it more difficult for any marijuana bill to pass because some lawmakers \u201care dead set against it.\u201d"

      "MIAMI -- A federal grand jury in Washington has returned an indictment against former Congressman David Rivera for failing to register as a foreign agent of a sanctioned Venezuelan media tycoon on whose behalf the Miami Republican allegedly lobbied the Trump administration.",
      "The indictment is the second set of criminal charges to examine Rivera's relationship with Ra\u00fal Gorr\u00edn, a billionaire businessman charged in 2018 and again in 2024 with bribing senior Venezuelan officials in corrupt deals to embezzle state funds from Nicolas Maduro's administration.",
      "The indictment unsealed on Wednesday alleges that Rivera, between June 2019 and April 2020, lobbied U.S. officials, including an unnamed senior official in the executive branch, to remove sanctions against Gorr\u00edn.",
      "Rivera was allegedly aided in that effort by another unnamed former U.S. official and resident of New York, who he allegedly paid $125,000 from the over $5.5 million he received from Gorr\u00edn or on his behalf, prosecutors from the U.S. Justice Department's National Security Division said.",
      "Rivera was charged with money laundering and failing to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, as required when lobbying U.S. officials on behalf of foreign individuals and companies.",
      "To promote his criminal activities, Rivera allegedly created fake shell companies registered in Delaware using names associated with a law firm and with the unnamed official, as well as the official's hometown, to give the false appearance that the shell companies were legitimate, according to the indictment. Prosecutors said the official was unaware the companies were using his or her name and hometown.",
      "Ed Shohat, a Miami defense attorney who represents Rivera, declined to comment, saying he hadn't had time to discuss the indictment with his client.",
      "Rivera was arrested in 2022 in another illegal lobbying case, out of federal court in Miami, tied to a $50 million consulting contract his firm, Interamerican Consulting, signed with a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela's state-owned oil company PDVSA. Prosecutors say the 2017 contract was a ruse to hide a secret campaign by Maduro's government to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.",
      "The Maduro outreach, at the same time Trump's current incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles was working as a lobbyist for Gorr\u00edn's TV network Globovision, ultimately failed. In 2019, Trump recognized opposition lawmaker Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader and imposed stiff oil sanctions on the OPEC nation in a bid to unseat Maduro.",
      "But before the charm offensive unraveled, Gorr\u00edn, with the help of Rivera and others, managed to get his photo taken shaking hands with then-Vice President Mike Pence at an event in Florida. Rivera and Gorr\u00edn also met with Trump's pick to become Secretary of State, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who was once Rivera's roommate when both were state lawmakers in Tallahassee.",
      "Rivera also looked to set up a possible flight and meeting on Gorr\u00edn's jet for a female campaign adviser turned White House \u201ccounselor\u201d on June 27, 2017, according to court records in the earlier criminal complaint and a parallel lawsuit filed against Rivera by Maduro\u2019s opponents who now control the U.S. subsidiary of PDVSA. That same day Trump aide Kellyanne Conway was in Miami for a fundraising dinner with Miami Republicans.",
      "Conway told The Associated Press she did not take any private flight and that she and her security detail flew commercial round trip to Miami for the event. All travel arrangements were made by the U.S. Secret Service, she added.",
      "Rivera also roped in Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas to try and set up a meeting for Venezuela\u2019s foreign minister with executives from Exxon, which was headquartered in Sessions\u2019 district at the time.",
      "Rivera, who served in Congress from 2011 to 2013, has been embroiled in several election-related controversies, including orchestrating the stealth funding of an unknown Democratic candidate to take on his main rival in a South Florida congressional race and a state investigation into whether he hid a $1 million contract with a gambling company. That probe also involved possible misuse of campaign funds to pay for state House activities already reimbursed by the state.",
      "He has denied any illegal lobbying on behalf of Venezuela's government and has countersued Maduro's opponents in federal court."

      "\u201cWith Pavia as quarterback, Vanderbilt has seen historic success \u2014 Vanderbilt beat both the University of Alabama and Auburn University \u2014 and the team will be playing in a bowl game for the first time since 2018,\u201d Campbell wrote in an opinion issued with the injunction. \u201cThose familiar with college football appreciate this remarkable accomplishment. Pavia estimates that he could earn over $1 million in NIL compensation in the 2025-26 season.\u201d",

I\u2019ve died for years now and now it\u2019s others people turn. I\u2019m prepared to give my life. ... Not all shootings are bad I\u2019m realizing. Some are necessary for change to happen.\u201d",
      "Court filings said Hernandez was struggling financially, was frustrated at seeing other people get hired as football coaches and felt owed by UConn. He played quarterback and wide receiver for the Huskies.",
      "Police said Hernandez had driven to the UConn campus and to Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, where he once served as quarterbacks coach, to \u201cmap the schools out\u201d for a shooting.",
      "Also in July 2023, prosecutors said Hernandez made multiple Facebook posts threatening to harm or kill three people who live out of Connecticut, including a state court judge.",
      "Hernandez has pending charges in state court in Connecticut in connection with an incident outside ESPN's headquarters in Bristol. He was arrested in March 2023 on misdemeanor breach of peace charges after police say he threw a bag containing a brick and a note over a fence and onto ESPN\u2019s property before leaving.",
      "\u201cTo all media outlets, It\u2019s about time you all realeyes the affect media has on all family members. Since you\u2019re a world wide leader maybe you could lead how media and messages are delivered brick by brick. Clean it up! Yours truly, Dennis J. Hernandez,\u201d the note said, according to police.",
      "Authorities said Hernandez was angry with people he believed were profiting from the death of his younger brother. Aaron Hernandez killed himself in 2017 while serving a murder sentence."

    "story": [
      "After losing his job as the Atlanta Falcons' starting quarterback, Kirk Cousins is promising to support rookie Michael Penix Jr. Cousins threw nine interceptions with one touchdown in the last five games",
      "FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. -- Kirk Cousins was signed to a massive four-year deal with the Atlanta Falcons because he was perceived to be the missing piece at quarterback for a team that otherwise was ready for a return to the playoffs.",
      "Cousins lost his starting job to rookie Michael Penix Jr. because coach Raheem Morris concluded Cousins' turnovers were the biggest barrier to the team's playoff hopes.",
      "That conclusion was difficult for Cousins to hear from his coach during an unscheduled meeting on Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pro football, and it was a standard that I have for myself and the team has for me,\u201d Cousins said Wednesday. \u201cUnfortunately, I wasn\u2019t playing up to that standard consistently enough.\u201d",
      "In the last five games, the Falcons (7-7) went 1-4 as Cousins threw one touchdown pass with nine interceptions. After holding the NFC South lead at 6-3, the Falcons now need help from first-place Tampa Bay to win the division.",
      "The Falcons, who play the New York Giants at home on Sunday, are one game behind the Buccaneers. Atlanta holds the tiebreaker advantage if it finishes tied with Tampa Bay.",
      "Cousins said he will support Penix but he had a quick answer when asked if he believed he can still start in the NFL.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t forget how to play quarterback,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cCertainly turnovers were not what you want, but I didn\u2019t forget how to play.\u201d",
      "Cousins insisted health and confidence were not issues in his turnovers but instead said he just needs to make better decisions.",
      "The promotion of Penix to the starting role was not a one-week decision. The job belongs to Penix indefinitely.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anything\u2019s ever permanent in the National Football League,\u201d Morris said Wednesday. \u201cBut, you know, right now, Mike Penix is our quarterback and we\u2019re going to back him and give him the utmost support he needs as we did Kirk when he was our starter.\u201d",
      "If Cousins, 36, doesn't start another game for Atlanta, it would be a costly 14-game stint because he signed a four-year, $180 million contract with $100 million guaranteed.",
      "Morris said Falcons owner Arthur Blank was \u201cextremely supportive,\u201d but the coach acknowledged the decision to bench Cousins has financial ramifications. Morris said those factors were outweighed by the drive for the team's first playoff appearance since 2017.",
      "\u201cObviously it definitely has some financial implications for us and how you go about your process,\u201d Morris said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s definitely one of the deals where we\u2019re always going to make football decisions in order to win the football game. And that\u2019s always going to be first and foremost.\u201d",
      "The Falcons have a short week of practice following Monday night's 15-9 win at Las Vegas that snapped a four-game losing streak. Cousins threw for 112 yards with his first TD pass in five games \u2014 and one interception. He leads the NFL with 16 interceptions.",
      "Morris hopes Penix, the No. 8 overall pick out of Washington in this year's draft, can be the difference-maker in the close division race.",
      "\u201cWe want to play better at quarterback,\u201d Morris said. \u201cAnd we felt like we got a chance to play a little bit better. And if we can go out there and play better at quarterback, who knows what can happen?\u201d",
      "Morris said Cousins was disappointed but was \u201can absolute professional\u201d when told of the decision.",
      "\u201cHe definitely expressed to me he\u2019s going to be the best No. 2 quarterback in the National Football League,\u201d Morris said.",
      "Penix has appeared in only two games, completing 3 of 5 passes for 38 yards.",

      "NEW YORK -- In pivoting to Plan B after losing Juan Soto, Brian Cashman went after a familiar name in Cody Bellinger.",
      "\u201cI acquired his dad back in the day. Now I acquired his son,\u201d the New York Yankees general manager said Wednesday.",
      "In the first 10 days after Soto spurned the Yankees for a record $765 million, 15-year contract with the Mets, the Yankees signed left-hander Max Fried to a $218 million, eight-year contract, acquired closer Devin Williams from the Milwaukee Brewers and obtained Bellinger, a former NL MVP, from the Chicago Cubs.",
      "Cashman said the Yankees also had been invited to meet in California with Roki Sasaki, the heralded 23-year-old Japanese pitcher who can sign with Major League Baseball clubs from Jan. 15-23.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just happy we have an opportunity,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cExtremely talented, no doubt about it, has a chance to be one of the world\u2019s great pitchers. Be nice to be able to have Yankee Stadium be his home.\u201d",
      "Because he is under 25, Sasaki is treated by MLB as an international amateur and subject to signing bonus pools for minor league contracts usually allocated to 16-year-old Latin American prospects. Teams have amounts ranging from roughly $7.6 million to $4.1 million they can spend, and the Yankees are capped at around $5.3 million.",
      "Bellinger's father signed with the Yankees in November 1996 and played for the big league team from 1999 to 2001, winning two World Series and three American League pennants. Cody turned 6 in his father's last season in pinstripes.",
      "\u201cSomeone that wants to be here,\u201d Cashman said, a remark that some may read as aimed at Soto. \u201cI\u2019ve been hearing it for a long time, including his agent, Scott Boras, saying, `Can you get him over here? He\u2019s driving me crazy. He wants to be a Yankee.' But that\u2019s not why I did it. Ultimately I did it because it\u2019s a fit.\u201d",
      "Bellinger could play outfield or first base depending on other moves the Yankees make.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s different ways of doing it,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to have the perfect team and you'd never know going into an offseason what you\u2019re going to be able to do, whether it\u2019s hammering a strength, whether it\u2019s plugging a hole. It\u2019s kind of where the market and the matchups happen. And so far, I think the moves that we\u2019ve made I\u2019m really excited about. ... I feel like the winter's to this point been a good one.\u201d",
      "Bellinger is guaranteed $52.5 million for the next two seasons. The left-handed-hitting 29-year-old has a $27.5 million salary for next year and a $25 million player option for 2026 with a $5 million buyout.",
      "\u201cHonored to wear the pinstripes, ready and excited to get to work!!\u201d he wrote on Instagram.",
      "Chicago agreed to send the Yankees $5 million: $2.5 million next Sept. 1 and if the option is exercised, five payments of $500,000 on the first of each month from May through September in 2026. If the option is declined, the Cubs would pay the Yankees $2.5 million on Jan. 15, 2026.",
      "Bellinger batted .266 with 18 homers and 78 RBIs in 130 games this year, sidelined between April 23 and May 7 by a broken right rib. He had a 1.035 OPS in 2019 when he was picked for his second All-Star team and won the NL MVP award with the Los Angeles Dodgers. It has been above .800 once in the last five years.",
      "\u201cI do feel like offensively speaking, he\u2019ll play up in our yard and he\u2019s still a young man and a really good athlete,\u201d Boone said. \u201cSo you always hope for the ultimate upside but at the very least I know we\u2019re getting a really valuable player.\u201d",
      "Boone spoke with Bellinger on Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cHe's like, `By the way, don\u2019t worry about where you play me. I\u2019ll play wherever. Wherever you need me that night, whether it\u2019s center, left, first, whatever it may be,'\u201d Boone recalled.",
      "Williams will become the Yankees closer, and Boone and pitching coach Matt Blake said they both assured Luke Weaver he will have a prominent role.",

He told a state trooper that he had just flown in from the Pacific Northwest and was on his way to see Bueckers at UConn, the police reports said.",
      "The trooper took Parmalee into custody when he learned there was an arrest warrant against him out of Josephine County, Oregon, accusing Parmalee of setting a home on fire with roommates and pets inside, police said.",
      "Parmalee had posted photos, videos and comments about Bueckers on TikTok and other social media platforms and had emailed UConn officials since June with rambling comments including his desire to marry Bueckers, police said.

      "\u201cFred Lorenzen was one of NASCAR\u2019s first true superstars. A fan favorite, he helped NASCAR expand from its original roots. Fred was the picture-perfect NASCAR star, helping to bring the sport to the silver screen \u2014 which further grew NASCAR\u2019s popularity during its early years,\" NASCAR Chairman Jim France said in a statement. \u201cFor many years, NASCAR\u2019s \u2018Golden Boy\u2019 was also its gold standard, a fact that eventually led him to the sport\u2019s pinnacle, a rightful place in the NASCAR Hall of Fame.\u201d",
      "In 1964, Lorenzen entered 16 of the scheduled 62 races and won eight, including five consecutive starts. During that stretch, Lorenzen led 1,679 of the possible 1,953 laps, one of the more dominant stretches in NASCAR history.",
      "He was the first driver in NASCAR to earn more than $100,000 in a single season, which he did in 1963.",
      "Lorenzen battled dementia in his later years and pledged his brain to the Concussion Legacy Foundation.",

      "Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman and Indiana coach Curt Cignetti are football junkies at heart",
      "Marcus Freeman spent his first two seasons as the Notre Dame coach chasing the playoff dream.",
      "This year, he's living it \u2014 at home.",
      "After closing the regular season on a 10-game winning streak and getting two weeks to prepare for the most meaningful postseason game of his career, Freeman is finally ready to lead the seventh-seeded Fighting Irish against 10th-seeded Indiana on Friday.",
      "\u201cWe've been in the playoffs since Week 3,\" Freeman said, alluding to their postseason hopes following the stunning loss to Northern Illinois. \u201cEvery game we play is a version of a playoff game in our minds. We have to continue to understand that you don't have any more added pressure than you've had the previous 10.\u201d",
      "Except the Irish (11-1) know this one is different.",
      "Notre Dame hasn't made a national championship run since 1988, its longest title drought since winning the school's first in 1924. And unlike previous playoffs, the Irish will be playing the first game on campus in College Football Playoff history.",
      "Just how unusual will this environment be?",
      "It's the first time Notre Dame has hosted a postseason game, the first time Notre Dame Stadium has hosted a Friday night game and the first time since 1990 that a Notre Dame home game has not been telecast by NBC.",
      "Still, the Irish are doing what they can to make this seem like just another football week.",
      "\u201cThe hardest thing throughout this whole process has probably been finals here at Notre Dame because that's no joke,\" quarterback Riley Leonard said. \u201cOtherwise, it's like a couple of bye weeks for us. We handle it the same way. Practice has been the same, the same recipe for success.\u201d",
      "But the stakes are significantly higher in this matchup between the two Indiana schools that have met just once since 1959. Notre Dame won 49-27 in 1991.",
      "No. 9 Indiana (11-1) is the most improbable playoff entrant.",
      "Associated Press Coach of the Year Curt Cignetti engineered an eight-game turnaround in his first season with the Hoosiers, setting a new single-season school record for victories while falling just a tiebreaker short of playing for its first Big Ten title since 1967.",
      "The Hoosiers are scoring 43.3 points, the most of any playoff team, and have one of the FBS' stingiest defenses, too. And even though Indiana failed its only test against a ranked foe, the Hoosiers believe that loss will help them do what most still believe impossible \u2014 reaching the Sugar Bowl for a quarterfinal game against No. 2 seed Georgia.",
      "\u201cIt was a tough loss, but I think it was really important for us to have a game like that, to be tested and know what it takes to win these games,\u201d quarterback Kurtis Rourke said, referring to the 38-15 loss at then-No. 2 Ohio State last month. \u201cThis is a win or go home kind of setup, so we're going to have to make sure that we come with our best effort.\u201d",
      "They also may have one key advantage \u2014 postseason experience.",
      "Cignetti and many of his assistant coaches were together for FCS and Division II playoff teams, and Cignetti also has that national championship ring from his days as Alabama coach Nick Saban\u2019s recruiting coordinator.",
      "\u201cWell, I am kind of used to this routine,\" Cignetti said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a major change for any of the coaches, to be quite honest with you, that are in the playoff.\u201d",
      "Notre Dame's defense has been one of the best all season despite a rash of injuries, including two that took out preseason All-Americans.",
      "But one of those, defensive tackled Howard Cross III, is expected to return Friday after missing the final three regular season games. There's little doubt Cross will be fresh, nearly six weeks after suffering the high ankle sprain. The question is will he be rested or rusty?",
      "\u201cI feel physically, fine,\u201d Cross said. \u201cSo I'm just happy, blessed to be able to get on the field.\u201d",
      "Indiana didn't just win games this season. It dominated opponents.",
      "Ten of the Hoosiers 11 wins were by 14 or more points and they faced deficits in only three games and only once in the second half. But even if that's not the same story underneath the Friday night lights, the Hoosiers insist they're ready for any challenge.",
      "\u201cWe know we\u2019re supposed to be here, we know we belong, but we\u2019re always going to have that chip (on our shoulder),\u201d Indiana receiver Elijah Sarratt said. \u201cWe remember what everyone was saying during the season and remember what everyone is saying now. We're going to go down there, focus on us and try to handle business.\u201d",
      "The most telling matchup Friday will be Notre Dame's ground game against Indiana's defense.",
      "The Irish offense has centered primarily around a three-pronged running attack that features Leonard, Jeremiyah Love and Jadarian Price.",
      "Indiana, meanwhile, leads the nation in fewest yards rushing per game allowed (70.8) and the 2.46 yards per carry allowed is second best in FBS. Even in their loss, Ohio State rushed 29 times for just 115 yards. So the Hoosiers know where they must begin if they hope to advance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop the run,\u201d all-Big Ten linebacker Aiden Fisher said. \u201cThat's something we\u2019re very prideful in here as a defense and something that they are really good on offense. It\u2019s going to be a really good matchup.\u201d",

      "Temperatures in the low 20s with a light breeze is forecast for Columbus, Ohio, for Tennessee-Ohio State on Saturday night. Austin, Texas, will feel like the tropics, by comparison, with sun and low 60s temperatures expected for Clemson-Texas.",
      "The conditions will be less of a factor for Indiana, Notre Dame and Ohio State \u2014 all are accustomed to raw afternoons and evenings late in the season \u2014 and Tennessee plays its share of games in chilly weather.",
      "For SMU, its game could be the coldest in program history. The lowest temperature at kickoff for the Mustangs was 24 degrees \u2014 Dec. 7, 2013, against UCF in Dallas and Dec. 24, 1983, against Alabama in the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas.",
      "SMU coach Rhett Lashlee has minimized the weather factor, noting his team holds morning practices when it's in the 30s and 40s. It looks like State College will be much colder than that, making it notable that only four of the 44 players on SMU's two-deep chart are from places outside the Sun Belt.",
      "The picks, with seedings and lines from BetMGM Sportsbook:",
      "An idyllic setting for the start of the 12-team playoff era: Notre Dame Stadium for a matchup of two Hoosier State teams that traditionally have lived on opposite ends of the college football world.",
      "The upstart Hoosiers didn't fare so well on the their biggest stage of the regular season, losing by 23 points at Ohio State. The spotlight will be even brighter in South Bend. Indiana can win if the Notre Dame defense that allowed 35 points and 577 yards to Southern California shows up and if the Hoosiers' top-ranked run defense keeps Riley Leonard, Jeremiyah Love and Jadarian Price under control. Hard to see both of those things happening.",
      "Pick: Notre Dame 28-17.",
      "Penn State is more battle-tested, having been in two top-five matchups (losses to Ohio State and Oregon), and the Nittany Lions have a huge home-field advantage. Of course, the fans in Happy Valley always are anxious when it comes to James Franklin and big games, and there's no proven backup to Drew Allar in the wake of Beau Pribula's untimely entry into the transfer portal.",
      "SMU quarterback Kevin Jennings has been really good, and occasionally great, while getting the Mustangs to this point. This will be too tall a task.",
      "Pick: Penn State 24-14.",
      "Oh, the things that had to happen for Clemson to reach this game. First, it took Syracuse's upset of Miami to get the Tigers through the back door into the ACC championship game. Then the Tigers, who lost a 17-point halftime lead, needed Adam Randall\u2019s 41-yard kick return to set up Nolan Hauser's career-long 56-yard field goal as time ran out to beat SMU.",
      "Now Clemson's Cade Klubnik returns home to Austin for a quarterback duel against his high school rival Quinn Ewers. Tempting as it would be to keep the great Clemson storyline going, it ends here because the Longhorns are just too talented.",
      "Pick: Texas 27-17.",
      "Ohio State has had three weeks to stew on its fourth straight loss to Michigan \u2014 this time as a 21-point favorite at home \u2014 and deal with the cloud that has hovered over Ryan Day since. Now, in spite of his athletic director's vote of confidence, there's chatter about whether Day will be fired if he loses to the Volunteers as a touchdown favorite at home. Talk about pressure.",
      "Tennessee, by comparison, can play freely. Josh Heupel had to knock down a \u201cjust-happy-to-be-there\u201d question after the matchup was announced. The Volunteers have what it takes to pull an upset with 1,400-yard rusher Dylan Sampson and an elite defensive front. This one could be as close as an 8-9 matchup suggests.",
      "Pick: Ohio State 24-23.",
      "Conference championship week: Straight-up \u2014 6-4 (including SWAC); Against spread \u2014 4-5 (no line on SWAC).",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 16:02:11 -0500",
    "summary": "The two teams suing NASCAR over an antitrust complaint have been granted a preliminary injunction that will allow them to compete as chartered teams in 2025",
    "story": [
      "The two teams suing NASCAR over an antitrust complaint have been granted a preliminary injunction that will allow them to compete as chartered teams in 2025",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The two teams suing NASCAR over an antitrust complaint were granted a preliminary injunction Wednesday that will allow them to compete as chartered teams in 2025.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth D. Bell said in his ruling, which favors 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports, that \u201cNASCAR fans (and members of the public who may become fans) have an interest in watching all the teams compete with their best drivers and most competitive teams.\u201d",
      "NASCAR did not immediately respond to a request for comment and has not said if it plans to appeal.",
      "23XI, the team owned by NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, and Front Row refused in September to sign take-it-or-leave it revenue sharing offers made by NASCAR just 48 hours before the start of the playoffs.",
      "A charter is essentially a franchise and guarantees prize money, a spot in the field each week and other protections.",
      "The teams filed an antitrust suit alleging NASCAR owners are \u201cmonopolistic bullies\u201d and were denied in federal court in November a request to be recognized as \u201cchartered\u201d teams as the suit continues.",
      "23XI and Front Row can now sign the charter agreements and still pursue their lawsuit. They also each were granted permission to purchase additional charters from Stewart Haas Racing, which closed its four-team shop at the end of the 2024 season, and NASCAR must approve the transfers to those teams.",
      "\u201c YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!\u201d Hamlin wrote on social media.",
      "It was a much-needed win for 23XI. Tyler Reddick, who finished fourth in the 2024 Cup standings, had an opt-out clause in his contract that would have gone into effect Wednesday and made him a free agent if the team did not land a charter for next season. Fellow 23XI driver Bubba Wallace also informed his team he needed to know how it intended to compete \u201cimmediately\u201d so he could explore options with other teams, the judge wrote.",
      "Jordan had said he took the fight to court on behalf of all teams competing in the top motorsports series in the United States. NASCAR had argued that the two teams simply do not like the terms of the final charter agreement and asked for the lawsuit be dismissed.",
      "Both Front Row and 23XI want to expand from two full-time cars to three. They have agreements with SHR to purchase one charter each. SHR is now Haas Factory and has plans to use one charter in 2025.",
      "Until Wednesday's injunction, 23XI and Front Row would have been forced to compete next season as \u201copen\u201d teams that don\u2019t have the same protections or financial gains that come from holding a charter.",
      "The teams contend they must be chartered under some of their contractual agreements with current sponsors and drivers, and competing next year as open teams will cause significant losses.",
      "Earlier this month, the suit was transferred to a different judge than the one who heard the first round of arguments and ruled against the two teams in their request for a temporary injunction to be recognized in 2025 as chartered teams as the case proceeds.",
      "\u201cHere, the public interest strongly favors entry of a limited preliminary injunction in favor of the Plaintiffs during the 2025 NASCAR race season, both to give fans of stock car racing the opportunity to watch (and root for and against) the full slate of teams and to allow Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust legal challenges to be considered,\u201d Bell wrote.",
      "Front Row is owned by businessman Bob Jenkins, while 23XI is owned by Jordan, Hamlin and longtime Jordan adviser Curtis Polk.",
      "Jenkins told The Associated Press in October that the two teams stood to miss out on $45 million in combined revenue if they competed without charters. But he was willing to do so for Front Row because he believed the case against NASCAR was winnable.",
      "NASCAR had been operating with 36 chartered teams and four open spots since the charter agreement began in 2016.",
      "\u201cThe availability of multiple sports in the United States says nothing about NASCAR\u2019s control of a major one of them in the same way that the availability of professional basketball and football did not lead to a finding that the NCAA was not a monopolist,\u201d the judge ruled.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 13:14:14 -0500",
    "summary": "Lamar Jackson will finally have help he&rsquo;s never enjoyed before against Pittsburgh",
    "story": [
      "Lamar Jackson will finally have help he\u2019s never enjoyed before against Pittsburgh",
      "OWINGS MILLS, Md. -- Lamar Jackson's struggles against Pittsburgh have been well documented.",
      "Now he'll finally have help he's never enjoyed before in this rivalry \u2014 from a packed stadium that's actually cheering for him.",
      "This weekend's showdown between the Steelers and Jackson's Baltimore Ravens is only the second time the star quarterback has faced Pittsburgh at home. And the other was in 2020, with the coronavirus pandemic limiting the announced crowd to 4,345.",
      "Expect a lot more than that Saturday, when the Steelers can clinch the AFC North with a win and the Ravens will do their best to prevent that.",
      "\u201cJust being in front of our crowd, Flock Nation, just being in the building, knowing it\u2019s a rival game, knowing what\u2019s at stake for us,\" Jackson said. \"I feel like the momentum, the momentum from our crowd, will just give us what we need \u2014 that extra boost.\u201d",
      "Jackson is 1-4 as a starter against Pittsburgh, a remarkably small number of games against a divisional opponent for a quarterback in his seventh season in the league. He beat the Steelers in his first start against them in 2019, although even in that game he was sacked five times and threw three interceptions.",
      "Jackson has never had a passer rating higher than 80.1 in a full game against Pittsburgh. He's thrown five touchdown passes and eight interceptions against the Steelers.",
      "But almost all of that has come on the road in a pretty difficult environment. In his first MVP season of 2019, Jackson sat out the home game against the Steelers after Baltimore had already wrapped up the No. 1 seed in the playoffs. The same thing happened last season. In 2021 and 2022, Jackson was injured when Pittsburgh came to Baltimore.",
      "Now the Ravens (9-5) have few excuses left if they can't take care of business at home. BetMGM had them favored by six points around midday Wednesday. Jackson is having a sensational season, with a passer rating of 120.7 that ranks among some of the best all time. He's thrown 34 touchdowns and three interceptions.",
      "\u201cI think anytime he can make a play, he\u2019s going to try to make that play. I don\u2019t think he tries to hold anything back, especially at the end of the season,\" said Steelers linebacker Patrick Queen, who played for the Ravens before this season. \"Everything\u2019s on the line at that point. There\u2019s no holding back on him. You definitely see that now, him lowering his shoulder, him stiff-arming a guy out of bounds \u2014 which is crazy \u2014 just him pushing the ball downfield is just a whole lot more plays he\u2019s trying to make.\u201d",
      "Pittsburgh (10-4) arrives with a one-game lead in the division, a result of an 18-16 victory over the Ravens in Week 11. That game unfolded like so many others when Jackson has faced the Steelers: In front of a raucous crowd in Pittsburgh, everything seemed to go wrong.",
      "Baltimore missed two field goals and lost two fumbles. Jackson threw an interception when Payton Wilson basically snatched the ball away after running back Justice Hill appeared to have the pass secured in his arms.",
      "The Ravens had a chance to tie the game late, but missed a 2-point conversion. That's happened multiple times in the recent history of this rivalry. In 2021 in Pittsburgh, Baltimore went for 2 and the win with 12 seconds left. The Ravens didn't convert and lost 20-19.",
      "Baltimore has lost eight of its past nine to Pittsburgh. It doesn't feel quite that lopsided to the Ravens. They did rest starters for a couple of those games and didn't have Jackson for some others. But this season the head-to-head matchups could well decide the division.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll get talked about. I think some people got a taste of it. There were a couple of skirmishes in the last game, but this is big,\u201d Baltimore cornerback Marlon Humphrey said. \"This means a lot to a lot of people. It means a lot to me being here for a long time, and if you don\u2019t understand, the message will be very clear as the week goes on.\u201d",

      "The last time there was such a gulf in results between an F1 champion and the team\u2019s other driver in F1 was in 1994, when Verstappen\u2019s father Jos was dropped before the end of the season as Michael Schumacher won the title with Benetton.",
      "\u201cDriving for Red Bull has been an unforgettable experience and I\u2019ll always cherish the successes we achieved together,\u201d Perez said in a team statement.",
      "\u201cWe broke records, reached remarkable milestones, and I\u2019ve had the privilege of meeting so many incredible people along the way,\" he added. \"A special thank you to the fans around the world, and especially to the Mexican fans for your unwavering support every day.

    "summary": "The Ivy League has announced its football programs will compete in the FCS playoffs beginning next season",
    "story": [
      "The Ivy League has announced its football programs will compete in the FCS playoffs beginning next season",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The Ivy League will compete in the FCS playoffs beginning next season, the conference announced on Wednesday, ending a century-long postseason ban originally aimed at allowing the athletes to focus on their schoolwork.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a monumental day in the Ivy League and a special day to be an Ivy League student-athlete,\u201d said Yale receiver Mason Shipp, who was the chair of the conference's Student-Athlete Advisory Committee that pushed for the change after a year-long study. \u201cFor the future generations that are fortunate enough to represent the Ivy League in the FCS playoffs, go win us some hardware!\u201d",
      "The 2024 Ivy League season ended with Columbia, Dartmouth and Harvard earning a share of the championship; it was Colombia's first conference title since 1961. The league will spend the offseason coming up with a tiebreaker to determine how its automatic qualifier for the FCS playoffs will be awarded.",
      "\u201cThank you to the Presidents for giving the student-athletes an opportunity to compete for a national championship,\u201d Harvard coach Andrew Aurich said. \u201cIvy League football is the most competitive it\u2019s ever been and I\u2019m excited for us to make some noise in the playoffs for years to come.\u201d",
      "The schools that would later form the Ivy League were a force in college football in the leather helmet days that predated the forward pass, with Yale and Princeton winning 23 of the sport\u2019s first 25 unofficial national championships in the late 1800s. Harvard claimed the other two and went on to add five more, including a 1919 title that was sealed by a victory over Oregon in the Rose Bowl.",
      "That would be \u2013 for at least the next century \u2013 the Crimson\u2019s only postseason appearance, with Harvard, Yale and Princeton voting a few years later to decline bowl invitations and maintain their focus on academics.",
      "A few things have changed since then.",
      "As college football grew, the balance of power shifted from the Northeast to the south and west. Mammoth stadiums turned the sport from a quaint little endeavor for the students to a focus of campus life. Lucrative television contracts helped fuel the business for schools. Athletic scholarships became a lure for player, and the rise of the NFL gave college players a chance to make football a career.",
      "Still, the Ivy League, which became a formal athletic conference in 1954, resisted the temptation of big-money college sports, forsaking bowl games and what is now the FCS playoffs to avoid the disruption on academics. But what really made its football postseason ban an anomaly was the growing number of other sports at the schools.",
      "At Harvard, longtime football coach Tim Murphy liked to point out his was the only one of the school\u2019s 42 varsity sports that was deprived the opportunity to participate in its postseason.",
      "Starting in 2025, the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference and the Southwestern Athletic Conference are the two remaining FCS playoff holdouts. (The biggest football conferences and schools, like Alabama and Georgia in the Southeastern Conference and Michigan and Ohio State in the Big Ten, compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision, which crowns its national champion through the separate College Football Playoff.)",
      "Although the sport has mostly outgrown the Ivy League roots that pioneered the forward pass, the bowl-shaped stadium and \u2014 more recently \u2014 tackle-free practice to diminish the risk of concussions, a player from the conference has participated in 10 of the last 12 Super Bowls. NFL front offices and sidelines are also teeming with Ivy alums.",
      "\u201cThe Ivy League prides itself on a storied tradition of impact, influence and competitive success throughout the history of college football,\" executive director Robin Harris said. \u201cWe now look ahead to a new chapter of success.\u201d",

      "Besides first-round games at on-campus sites, the expanded 12-team College Football Playoff also serves up something now for this postseason: cold-weather northern venues as opposed to bowl games in warm, sunny climates",
      "Asked if playing in near-freezing weather at Ohio State might pose a challenge for his team, Tennessee coach Josh Heupel quickly noted that it wouldn\u2019t be the Volunteers\u2019 first rodeo with the cold.",
      "Kicker Max Gilbert even posted a photo last week standing with teammates as light snow fell before a morning practice. And, Tennessee beat cross-state rival Vanderbilt last month on a tundra of sorts with a kickoff temperature of 41 degrees before dropping to the 30s in the fading daylight. A combination of heated benches, portable heaters and extra layers helped take the chill off, along with a 36-23 comeback victory.",
      "The Saturday night forecast calls for temperatures in the high teens and low 20s with a slight chance of snow for the first-round College Football Playoff matchup in Columbus, Ohio. But with few degrees of separation between climates in the Tennessee and Ohio valleys, it won\u2019t feel much different when the Vols venture 350 miles north to face the Buckeyes.",
      "\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a June day in South Dakota,\" Heupel joked this week. \"It\u2019s going to be great football weather. A couple of weeks ago we played in 30 degree weather. We practice in the morning, still a chill, as cold as it will be around this area. And at the end of the day, you get between the white lines, weather doesn\u2019t matter. The temperature doesn\u2019t. And we\u2019ll be ready to go play. It\u2019ll be a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "The playoff this year for the first time is holding first-round games on campus and that opens things up in terms of potential weather. Whether his weekend's official start of winter has a chilling effect on the outcome in the expanded 12-team playoff remains to be seen, but it\u2019s a definite departure from warm climates Power Four teams are used to for postseason games.",
      "The prospect of spending the Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day holidays preparing for a bowl in a sunny locale is considered an incentivizing finish to a long season.",
      "Warmer destinations and indoor stadiums await the first-round winners in the quarterfinals, but no one\u2019s complaining about the chance to play in \u201cideal\u201d football weather that many players grew up with. This additional postseason layer may require, well, layering for players, but cold comes with the territory and is worth the sacrifice of playing for a national championship.",
      "\u201cWhether there\u2019s snow or not snow, whether it\u2019s really cold or just kind of cold, it is what it is,\u201d said SMU coach Rhett Lashlee, who noted his players' aspirations of an NFL career certainly can should include the likelihood of wintry weather.",
      "\u201cThey aspire to play championship football, which we\u2019re getting to do right now,\" said Lashlee, who played his high school and college football in Arkansas. \"The weather is only going to be an issue if we allow it, so we know it\u2019s going to be really cold. It\u2019s going to be really cold for them as well. So it\u2019s our 11 versus their 11.\u201d",
      "Ditto for fans who willingly accept cold hands, feet and noses if it means rooting on their teams.",
      "\u201cThey get a little bit more snow but as far as temperature, we\u2019ve been mostly in the 30s for the last couple of weeks and been in the 20s for two nights,\" said longtime Tennessee season ticket holder Earl Brown, 75, who will be in The Horseshoe with wife Judy and three others. \"Plus, the game\u2019s up there and it will be my 355th consecutive game. So, I don\u2019t think it really matters if it\u2019s snow, rain and sleet or 85 degrees. I will be in the stadium.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe'll put on six, seven layers, probably,\u201d Judy Brown said.",
      "The State College forecast calls for low 20s dropping into the low teens when Penn State hosts SMU on Saturday night. Lashlee jokingly lamented pleasant 70-degree temperatures in Dallas for workouts but doesn't expect a huge adjustment for his team after playing last month's Atlantic Coast Championship in the 30s in Charlotte, North Carolina.",
      "The coach added that non-bowl December football is also new territory for Penn State, which means it will also be cold on the Nittany Lions' bench.",
      "Temperature-wise (low to mid-20s), Indiana players and fans won't notice much change between Bloomington and what the Hoosiers will face 200 miles upstate in South Bend for Friday night's matchup at Notre Dame. The daytime forecast includes a 63% chance of snow, conditions the Fighting Irish embrace in a hype video featuring clips of the white stuff.",
      "Having won at Purdue in the snow and seeing it elsewhere while playing at Ohio, Indiana quarterback Curtis Rourke looks forward to whatever awaits in Notre Dame Stadium \u2014 including noise to wake up the echoes.",
      "\u201cHaving snow fall in the stadium, that was pretty cool,\u201d Rourke said. \u201cSnow games are pretty fun, so I\u2019m looking forward to it if that\u2019s the case.\u201d",

      "A trio of well-known and well-decorated American ski racers are all rooting for their longtime teammate Lindsey Vonn as she returns to ski racing at 40 this weekend in St. Moritz, Switzerland",
      "BEAVER CREEK, Colo. -- At 47, Bode Miller will stick to developing skis and raising his kids. Same with Ted Ligety, 40, who runs a ski-gear company while chasing his children around the mountain.",
      "Julia Mancuso is just fine with beach life these days as the 40-year-old splits her time between Hawaii and Fiji, balancing family life with a burgeoning career as a foil surfer (surfing with a hydrofoil attached to ride above the water).",
      "The trio of well-known and well-decorated American ski racers are all content in retirement and rooting for their longtime teammate Lindsey Vonn as she returns to World Cup ski racing at 40 \u2014 with a new titanium knee \u2014 this weekend in St. Moritz, Switzerland.",
      "They're holding their breath, too.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s one of the best there\u2019s ever been and it\u2019s great for the sport. I have no doubt she\u2019ll be fast,\u201d Miller said in a phone interview from Park City, Utah. \"I just want her to stay healthy.\"",
      "Vonn retired in 2019 not because she was slowing down, but because she was broken down.",
      "All those spills and crashes took a big toll on her. She\u2019s broken arms and legs, suffered concussions and torn knee ligaments. She's even been hurt celebrating, once slicing her thumb on a bottle of bubbly.",
      "She always got back up and continued racing \u2014 until the pain became too much. Her last major race was in February 2019, when she took third in the downhill during the world championships in Sweden.",
      "Last April, she underwent a partial right knee replacement. The pain soon dissipated.",
      "She was doing exercises she hadn\u2019t done in a while. She could leap 20 inches (50.8 centimeters) off a single leg, when it used to be about 10 (25.4). Her strength back, along with her resolve, she announced last month she was rejoining the U.S. Ski Team.",
      "Her training runs have been a chance to dial in her Head skis and boots in her return after nearly six years away. She's been embraced by teammates almost half her age \u2014 she gave detailed course reports as a forerunner last weekend in Beaver Creek \u2014 as she quickly earned enough points to be eligible to compete on the World Cup circuit.",
      "She will race in two super-G events on Saturday and Sunday. If all goes well there, and the rest of the season, she may even hang around for the 2026 Winter Games, with ski racing held at one of her favorite venues in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m lucky,\" Vonn said, \u201cthat I have this second chance.\u201d",
      "Of course, Mancuso misses ski racing. That's why the four-time Olympic medalist understands the drive behind Vonn's comeback. Mancuso didn\u2019t fully retire on her own terms, but more due to injuries. She had a full hip replacement and \u201cfelt amazing after,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cI for sure would have considered a comeback if I didn\u2019t have kids. So I can totally relate to Lindsey.\u201d",
      "These days, her husband runs a surf resort in Fiji. They spend part time there and the rest of the time in Hawaii or chasing snow.",
      "\u201cMy kids love the snow and I am making a huge effort to foster that,\u201d Mancuso wrote.",
      "Mancuso isn\u2019t surprised by Vonn\u2019s comeback.",
      "\u201cThe fact that she is really taking it seriously and going for it makes a great story and I wish her all the best,\u201d Mancuso wrote. \u201cIt inspires all the old-timers out there that age is just a number. Can\u2019t wait to see how it goes.\u201d",
      "Even in jest, Miller, a six-time Olympic medalist, doesn\u2019t take long to answer if he would ever contemplate a return.",
      "\u201cNo,\" Miller said. \u201cI would never come back.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s content being cofounder and \u201cchief innovation officer\u201d of Peak Ski Company, along with skiing with the kids. His wife, Morgan, also plays professional volleyball for a Utah team.",
      "Miller's last major race was at the 2015 world championships in Beaver Creek, Colorado. He crashed in a super-G and later underwent surgery to fix a torn right hamstring tendon when his ski sliced him.",
      "He was known for his daredevil style, which led to 33 World Cup wins and numerous wipeouts.",
      "\u201cMy win and loss and crash records, I don\u2019t really even think about it,\" Miller said. \"I know I brought something unique to the sport and to the world.\"",
      "He believes Vonn has more to contribute.",
      "When Vonn left the tour, she had 82 World Cup wins \u2014 the record for a woman at the time and within reach of the all-time Alpine mark of 86 held by Swedish standout Ingemar Stenmark. The women\u2019s record held by Vonn was eclipsed in January 2023 by Mikaela Shiffrin, whose 99 wins are more than any Alpine ski racer in the history of the sport.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s an amazing glider. She\u2019s got great aerodynamics. She\u2019s tactically really sound,\u201d Miller said of Vonn. \u201cShe\u2019ll probably get more wins.\u201d",
      "Ligety knew when it was his time to step away. The two-time Olympic champion's body was beat up after returns from frayed cartilage in his hip, a torn ACL, metal screws that needed to be inserted into his wrist and surgery to fix herniated disks in his back. He called it quits in 2021 after 336 World Cup starts.",
      "\u201cI continued on well past my expiration date and didn\u2019t finish at the top of my game,\u201d cracked Ligety, who was dubbed \u201cMr. GS\u201d by skiing great Marcel Hirscher (Ligety won 24 of his 25 World Cup wins in the discipline).",
      "Ligety and his wife have three kids. He runs his company Shred, which makes helmets, sunglasses and goggles, and serves as head of product performance for DPS Skis.",
      "Sometimes, Ligety misses racing. On sunny giant slalom days, he wouldn't mind being in the starting gate.",
      "\u201cBut most of the time when I watch it,\" Ligety said, \u201cI do not envy what they\u2019re doing.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Wake Forest has hired Washington State\u2019s Jake Dickert to become the Demon Deacons\u2019 next football coach",
      "Wake Forest moved quickly in reaching across the country to find its next football coach.",
      "The school hired Washington State's Jake Dickert on Wednesday, two days after Dave Clawson resigned unexpectedly following 11 seasons that included regular bowl bids and an Atlantic Coast Conference division title.",
      "\u201cCoach Dickert\u2019s approach to building a program \u2014 through evaluation and development of talent with a plan rooted in detail, discipline, and an unwavering commitment to student-athlete development \u2014 reminds me of what made Dave Clawson so successful during his 11-year transformational tenure as our head football coach,\u201d athletic director John Currie said in a statement.",
      "\u201cJake\u2019s philosophy of fostering personal growth, cultivating trust within the team, and relentlessly competing for championships embodies the principles we hold dear.\u201d",
      "Dickert, 41, had been the defensive coordinator when he took over during the 2021 season as the Cougars' interim coach after Washington State fired Nick Rolovich for refusing a state mandate that all employees get vaccinated against COVID-19. Dickert led the team to a 3-3 finish to earn the permanent job, then went 20-17 in the three seasons since.",
      "The Athletic first reported that Wake Forest was set to hire Dickert, whose introductory news conference was scheduled for Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe will have a clear focus on retaining our current roster while adding valuable pieces that fit our program and Wake Forest University,\u201d Dickert said in a statement. \u201cAdditionally, I am excited to immerse myself in this special community as throughout this process my belief that this is the perfect place for our family and our program only strengthened.\u201d",
      "Washington State has spent nine weeks in the AP Top 25 poll over the past two seasons, peaking at No. 13 during a five-week run amid a 4-0 start in 2023 and reaching No. 19 in early November of this season.",
      "Washington State went 8-4 this year, the first since the Pac-12 fell apart, with the majority of its schools scattering to the ACC, Big 12 and Big Ten. Now Dickert is back in a power conference again, nine days before his Cougars are set to play No. 22 Syracuse in the Holiday Bowl (Dec. 27).",
      "In a statement Wednesday, Washington State athletic director Anne McCoy said assistant head coach and defensive tackles coach Pete Kaligis would lead the team in the bowl game.",
      "\u201cThis team has worked so hard and accomplished a great deal this year,\u201d McCoy said, \u201cthey deserve to end the season with a memorable bowl game experience.\u201d",
      "Dickert arrived at Washington State after a three-year run at Wyoming in a career with stops at the Division II level, though those generally were at schools in the central part of the country or further west. A job at Southeast Missouri State in 2012 was his farthest east.",
      "He'll relocate to the Eastern Seaboard for the job at Wake Forest, an elite private university in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, with one of the smallest undergraduate enrollments in the Bowl Subdivision ranks (5,471 students in the 2023-24 academic year). It comes as the Demon Deacons have had consecutive 4-8 seasons in Clawson's otherwise successful run, a product of a changing landscape in college sports that hindered Wake Forest's formula of retaining and developing players to compete with schools featuring four- and five-star prospects.",
      "Notably, those changes have included free player movement through the transfer portal and players being able to profit from their athletic fame through name, image and likeness opportunities \u2014 a combination that has led to roster upheaval across college sports.",
      "In Wake Forest's case, the Demon Deacons had an 11-win season that included a trip to the ACC title game in 2021, as well as brief stints in the top 10 of the AP Top 25 in 2021 and 2022 amid a run of seven straight bowl appearances before the two four-win seasons.",
      "In an emotional news conference Tuesday, Clawson said he \u201cjust felt like it was time\u201d to step aside to let Wake Forest take a fresh approach to the changes, which include the looming arrival of revenue sharing with athletes. He said he had \u201cengaged\u201d with some candidates for the job already as he shifts into an advisory role with Currie.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s things I can help with (in) the transition,\u201d Clawson said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be the old coach in the office that\u2019s overlooking you or second-guessing you. I\u2019ve told every one of them: \u2018I will be as involved or uninvolved as you want me to be.\u2019 ... If I can help the new coach with that learning curve, I\u2019ll do it. If the new coach says, \u2018Dave, stay the hell away, it\u2019s my program,\u2019 I will stay the hell away and do nothing but support him.\u201d",
      "Clawson went as far as to say it felt as if it was \u201csomebody else\u2019s job.\u201d",
      "And now, that somebody is Dickert.",

      "LONDON -- The ATP men's tennis tour paid out $1.3 million to a total of 26 players in 2024 under a new financial program called Baseline that guarantees minimum annual incomes for players ranked in the top 250.",
      "Players received money in each of three categories, the tour said Wednesday, without naming most of the individuals: 17 got paid as part of minimum guarantees that make up the difference if players do not reach certain thresholds in singles prize money, three through injury protection that helps those whose tournament participation is limited by health issues, and seven via newcomer investment that provides funds to new members of the top 125.",
      "One player received money from both the minimum guarantee and income protection parts of the plan, which was announced in August 2023. This season was the first of a three-year trial.",

      "Based on 2023 year-end rankings and 2024 earnings, the ATP made up the difference for players who didn't reach certain thresholds: $300,000 for the top 100, $150,000 for men ranked from 101 to 175, and $75,000 for those from 176 to 250.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 10:18:20 -0500",
    "summary": "The group behind a breakaway European soccer competition to rival the Champions League has resurfaced",
    "story": [
      "The group behind a breakaway European soccer competition to rival the Champions League has resurfaced",
      "The group behind a proposed breakaway European soccer competition is back.",
      "They have a new name for their tournament, too, calling it the Unify League this time.",
      "The latest idea for an elite competition for the biggest teams in Europe is being put forward by Madrid-based A22 Sports Management, which is seeking to change the face of the sport in its most lucrative market by creating a rival for the Champions League and other UEFA tournaments.",
      "It comes nearly four years after the initial plan of a European Super League was ambitiously launched and then quickly quashed. It's been a rocky journey, to say the least, and there's still a long way to go before a breakaway league comes to fruition \u2014 if it ever does.",
      "Late one Sunday night in April 2021, a dozen of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs rocked the soccer world by announcing plans to create a breakaway European Super League, which would have effectively replaced the Champions League \u2014 Europe\u2019s elite club competition. The 12 rebel teams were Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Juventus, AC Milan, Inter Milan, Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. They proposed a 20-team elite tournament that was largely closed because 15 were protected from relegation. The plan collapsed within 48 hours after the six English clubs pulled out and issued apologies amid a backlash from their own fans and the government. Three others \u2014 AC Milan, Inter and Atl\u00e9tico \u2014 also quickly backed out.",
      "Well, it never quite went away. Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus carried on the fight behind the scenes, seemingly forlornly. Juventus withdrew midway through 2023 but the two Spanish powers held out, and scored a win in December of that year when the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that UEFA and world governing body FIFA acted contrary to EU competition law by blocking plans for the breakaway league. Emboldened, A22 \u2014 formed to assist the creation and promotion of the Super League \u2014 immediately announced new proposed competitions for men and women, saying young fans are \u201cturning away\u201d from soccer. More details about these competitions came on Tuesday.",
      "A22 said Tuesday it has submitted proposals to UEFA and FIFA for official recognition of its proposed midweek competition, which would contain 96 men's teams across four leagues \u2014 Star, Gold, Blue and Union \u2014 and 32 women's teams in two leagues \u2014 Star and Gold. Eight teams would qualify for the knockout stage in each league. All teams involved in the Unify League are being guaranteed a minimum of 14 matches per season. Qualification will not be automatic but \u201cbased on annual performance\" in the domestic European leagues, A22 said. A key part of the new format would be free streaming of games on a branded \u201cUnify\u201d platform to, in A22\u2019s words, \u201cdirectly connect clubs to their global fan bases\" and \u201cimprove the viewing experience at home by eliminating the need for multiple subscriptions.\" There would also be a premium subscription offered without adverts. If the plans get the green light, it in theory gives Europe\u2019s clubs a choice: Stay with the existing European competitions run by UEFA or join a breakaway competition.",
      "No team has publicly backed the Unify League, strengthening the existing skepticism about the project. A22 said its plans had come after discussions with clubs, leagues and \u201cother parties\u201d but didn\u2019t go into more details. Not even Barcelona or Madrid \u2014 the remaining holdouts from the original Super League \u2014 have commented, though the Spanish league has. As expected, the league's reaction was scathing, saying the project \u201cthreatens the governance of European football\u201d and would \u201cdestroy the economy of national leagues.\u201d \u201cThe project continues to lack support from clubs, federations, players, fans, national governments and European institutions,\u201d La Liga said. There was no official response from any other major league, or from UEFA or FIFA.",
      "It still seems a non-starter at this stage \u2014 and the outcry caused by the original rebellion would likely make most clubs retain the status quo. That is especially the case in England, with the popular and lucrative Premier League having said last year it \u201ccontinues to reject any such concept\u201d of a Super League. Part of the Premier League\u2019s owners\u2019 charter states that clubs \u201cwill not engage in the creation of new competition formats outside of the Premier League\u2019s Rules\u201d and a proposed U.K. government bill would block English teams from trying to join a breakaway league. Financial details about the Unify League remain sketchy \u2013 for example, who is funding this? \u2013 and the latest plans come at a time when there has been a redrawing of the power dynamic in European football. UEFA has a revamped, more lucrative and more open Champions League, FIFA has its big new club competition in the Club World Cup, with financial backing from Saudi Arabia. Put simply, there\u2019s not the widespread discontent in soccer as there was four years ago. However, A22 is confident the rebranded competition complies with UEFA\u2019s required authorization rules because of the revised feature that annual qualification is based on domestic league performance. John Hahn, co-founder of A22, said he had \u201cnot been expecting the public support of clubs at this time.\u201d \u201cLogically,\u201d he said, \u201cthat will come following the official recognition of the Unify League.\u201d",

      "Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo stood side-by-side during the postgame celebration after the NBA Cup final",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo stood side-by-side during the postgame celebration after the NBA Cup final. Antetokounmpo was holding the MVP trophy. Lillard was holding the bigger trophy.",
      "And it was a moment that Lillard had waited a long time to savor.",
      "He's been a rookie of the year, a 3-point contest champion, an All-Star MVP, even a member of the league's 75th anniversary team. And while his biggest goal is still winning an NBA championship, the significance of winning the NBA Cup was not lost on the 13-year veteran.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of experience individually where I\u2019ve had accomplishments and stuff,\u201d Lillard said after the Bucks beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 97-81 on Tuesday night in the Cup final. \u201cBut to have some team success and win something and be the last team standing in this tournament, it feels great.\u201d",
      "The Bucks have a championship coach in Doc Rivers, the core of a team that won a title in 2021 \u2014 Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton among them \u2014 and one of the game's elite guards in Lillard. Starting 1-6 and 2-8 this year might have raised some eyebrows, but the Bucks insisted that they never doubted themselves.",
      "They've been one of the league's hottest teams since that awful start and rolled through the in-season tournament with a 7-0 record. Winning the NBA Cup might be a reminder \u2014 perhaps an unnecessary one \u2014 of the Bucks' potential.",
      "\u201cI think it reminds us that we can beat anybody,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t care if it tells everybody else that. We only care about us. It\u2019s what I said on the first day of camp. I also said we can lose to anybody if we don\u2019t play right.\u201d",
      "Antetokounmpo and Lillard are leading the way, and that can't be a surprise.",
      "Both are playing at their perennial All-Star level. They're the highest-scoring duo in the league, combining to average more than 58 points per game. They were the best two players on the floor in the NBA Cup final, Antetokounmpo getting a triple-double \u2014 26 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists \u2014 on his way to MVP honors, and Lillard scoring 23.",
      "Year 1 of their pairing after Lillard wound up in Milwaukee after 11 years in Portland wasn't perfect. It was good, not great. Year 2 is clearly better. It's another sign of what might be for the Bucks going forward.",
      "\u201cPeople wanted to put me with Giannis and think it was just going to be perfect right away because we\u2019ve both been high-level players,\u201d Lillard said. \"But I come from a situation where I\u2019ve always had the ball, and he\u2019s had a decade of him having the ball and playing a certain way.",
      "\u201cI think time is the No. 1 thing,\u201d he added. \u201cIt just took time for us to get to know each other better as people. You can\u2019t just trust somebody that you\u2019re paired with when you don\u2019t really know who they are, how they think and how they operate. So, I think time has helped us.\u201d",
      "Time has helped Lillard as well.",
      "He averaged 24.3 points and 7 assists per game last year. Those are all-world numbers for just about anyone. He didn't think much of how he played, though, and he never got to the point of feeling totally comfortable in a new role, a new place, with a new team.",
      "He does now.",
      "\u201cGetting healthy, getting my training in and having my mind right coming back into the season was all it really was for me,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cWhen we lost in the playoffs last year, I said it right after the game. \u2018People will see.\u2019\u201d",
      "Seeing is believing.",
      "There's still more than two-thirds of the regular season left. Cleveland \u2014 Milwaukee's first opponent when the Bucks return to regular-season play on Friday \u2014 and defending NBA champion Boston have clearly been the best two teams in the Eastern Conference to this point. There are tons of challenges ahead and there surely will be plenty of ebbs and flows.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so happy for Dame that we got our first trophy together,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cThis is just the beginning. We have to keep on improving and getting better, and we will be better.\u201d",

      "There's already a record number of teams that have clinched a playoff spot with three weeks to play in the NFL season and a record number of teams with three or fewer wins after Week 15 as a league built on parity has become one of haves and have-nots.",
      "Seven playoff spots have been clinched at this point in the season for the first time ever and the 50% of playoff berths filled are the most with three weeks remaining, according to Sportradar. The previous high since the 1970 merger was 42.9% in 2022 when six spots were clinched with three weeks to play.",
      "The entire AFC field could be determined by the end of the games on Sunday afternoon. Baltimore and Denver can clinch spots with wins, while the Chargers need a win and losses by Indianapolis and Miami.",
      "The NFC could have five of the seven playoff spots clinched by the end of this week if Washington beats Philadelphia on Sunday and Green Bay beats New Orleans on Monday night.",
      "But the competition for the No. 1 pick is fierce with a record seven teams having three wins or fewer. There have been three seasons of at least 16 games with six teams with three or fewer wins after 15 weeks with it also happening in 2014, 2008 and 1991.",
      "Las Vegas and the New York Giants have the inside track with 2-12 records and the top pick could come down to strength of schedule if both teams lose out.",
      "There are five other teams \u2014 Carolina, Jacksonville, New England, Cleveland and Tennessee \u2014 tied at 3-11 and in position to get the No. 1 pick if the Giants and Raiders both win.",
      "The back-and-forth shootout between Detroit and Buffalo put Lions quarterback Jared Goff and the Bills in select company.",
      "Goff became the first player in NFL history to lose a game after throwing for at least 400 yards and five TDs with no interceptions in Detroit's 48-42 loss.",
      "Five weeks after becoming the first quarterback in 12 years to win a game after throwing five interceptions, Goff ended up on the losing side of a five-touchdown game. He's the fourth quarterback ever to do both and the only one who did it in the same season.",
      "Matt Ryan and Tony Romo pulled off the feat once, while George Blanda won three games with five interceptions, including the 1961 AFL title game, and lost twice after throwing at least five TD passes.",
      "Since 1950, quarterbacks are now 200-23 when throwing at least five TD passes and 19-191-5 when throwing five or more interceptions.",
      "The Bills have been on a roller coaster of their own, having lost a game in Week 14 to the Rams when they scored 42 points and then won a game against Detroit when they allowed 42.",
      "Buffalo joined the 1966 Giants as the only teams with back-to-back games when both teams scored at least 40 points in the game. New York lost both of those games and the Bills joined the 1983 Packers as the only teams in NFL history to win a game when allowing at least 40 points and lose a game scoring at least 40 in the same season.",
      "Bills quarterback Josh Allen also became the second quarterback with back-to-back games with at least 400 yards rushing and passing, at least four total TDs and no turnovers. Joe Burrow did it in 2021.",
      "Week 15 was the final one of the regular season that featured teams coming off byes with six teams playing on extra rest on Sunday.",
      "Those teams went 4-2 with Baltimore, Denver, Houston and Washington getting wins, while Indianapolis and New England lost.",
      "For the season, coming off the bye proved to be of little benefit with teams playing after a week off going 15-17 with the extra rest. That marked the second time in the last 10 seasons that teams coming off the bye had a losing record, with teams going 11-21 in 2019.",
      "The advantage of the bye has lessened since the 2011 CBA limited the amount of practice time teams could have during the week off. From 2002-10, teams had a .557 win percentage following the bye week compared to .523 since 2011.",
      "On the NFL's most turnover-happy day in eight years, the Tennessee Titans and Cincinnati Bengals took the sloppy play to new lows.",
      "The Titans gave the ball away six times and the Bengals committed four turnovers in Cincinnati's 37-27 win for the first 10-giveaway game in the NFL since Week 2 of the 2007 season when Detroit and Minnesota each had five in a 20-17 overtime win for the Lions.",
      "The game included one of two fumbles this week by a player just before he crossed the goal line and contributed to the 51 turnovers overall on Sunday for the most on any day since there were also 51 on Dec. 11, 2016.",
      "The sloppy play at Tennessee was about more than turnovers with the Bengals getting penalized 14 times and the Titans 12. That made the game the first since the 1970 merger with at least 10 turnovers and 25 penalties.",
      "Caleb WIlliams entered the league with the fanfare of being the answer to Chicago's long search for a franchise quarterback. It hasn't worked out that way so far for the No. 1 overall pick.",
      "Williams lost his eighth straight start for the Bears on Monday night against Minnesota to tie Trevor Lawrence (2021) for the second longest losing streak for a rookie QB picked first overall since the start of the common draft era in 1967. Troy Aikman lost all 11 starts he made as a rookie for Dallas in 1989 before going on to win three Super Bowls.",
      "Williams has lost those games despite not throwing an interception in any of the games for an NFL rookie record 286 straight passes without a pick. That's the most consecutive losses for any QB since the merger without throwing an interception, topping the previous high of five by Jeff George (1993-94) and Cody Kessler (2016).",
      "The Bears were officially eliminated from playoff contention in Week 15, leaving Andrew Luck as the only quarterback picked first in the common draft era to start a playoff game as a rookie.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 17:46:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Global battery maker CATL says it will expand its electric vehicle battery swapping in China in 2025",
    "story": [
      "Global battery maker CATL says it will expand its electric vehicle battery swapping in China in 2025",
      "Detroit -- China will soon see a massive expansion of electric vehicle battery swapping, as global battery maker CATL said Wednesday it is investing heavily in stations there next year.",
      "Battery swapping is not new \u2014 but it's had a challenging journey. Adoption of electric vehicles has varied in regions across the globe over the past several years, and that doesn't always bode well for building new infrastructure.",
      "While the technology could do well in China, it's uncertain whether it could work in other countries.",
      "Battery swapping allows EV drivers to pull into a station on a low battery and receive a swapped, fully-charged battery within minutes.",
      "An EV has to be equipped with the right technology to receive a swap \u2014 and not many models around the world currently have it. Automakers have to buy into the idea, and EV adoption among consumers also has to grow, so that investing in new infrastructure seems worthwhile. Consumers also have to be comfortable not owning their battery.",
      "China is much further along in adopting EVs than other countries.",
      "Not only is it the world's largest auto market, but in July, the country hit a milestone with 50% of new sales electric \u2014 and it accounts for most of this year's global EV sales.",
      "China supports EV growth through government subsidies and mandates. So it makes more sense for companies to invest in unique EV infrastructure there because that's more likely to be needed.",
      "The most notable example might be Israeli startup Better Place, which tried its hand at swapping in 2007.",
      "But the company shut down a few years later after investing a lot of money and coming up against roadblocks with logistics. EV adoption was especially low at the time.",
      "Startup Ample, for example, has a modular battery swapping station that it says can complete a swap in 5 minutes. That\u2019s important as charging time remains a point of concern for prospective EV buyers. Even the fastest fast chargers could take at least 15 minutes for a decent charge.",
      "But in the U.S., pure EVs only accounted for 8% of new vehicle sales as of November.",
      "Meanwhile Nio, a rival Chinese EV brand, has about 60 swap stations in northern Europe, and the EV adoption is higher there than the U.S., but the same challenges remain.",
      "Different automakers put different batteries in their various EV models, so a station would need all of those available if the industry didn't agree to a standardized battery, and not all of those models are out yet in volume. This is something that really needs scale.",
      "Swapping could help with EV cost \u2014 currently a barrier to adoption for many \u2014 because a driver wouldn\u2019t necessarily own the most expensive part of an EV: the battery.",
      "Greg Less, director of the University of Michigan Battery Lab, said with proper framing and education, people might like the idea of battery swapping. To him, it's not unlike buying a propane-fueled grill and purchasing a refilled tank every so often. But it would require a rethinking of car ownership.",
      "\"Where I could see it working is if we went entirely away from vehicle ownership and we went to a use-on-demand model,\" Less added. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet.\u201d",
      "Battery swapping might make most sense for ride-sharing or other fleet vehicles.",
      "Drivers of buses, taxis, Uber or Lyft vehicles want to spend as much time on the road as possible, transporting customers and making money. If battery swapping can shorten the time needed to charge EVs, that makes driving one less disruptive to their business.",

      "The Biden administration imposed export controls to limit the ability of China and Russia to access U.S.-made chips after Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago.",
      "The agency's Bureau of Industry and Security, according to the report, does not have the resources to enforce export controls and has been too reliant on U.S. chip makers voluntarily complying with the rules.",
      "But the push for bolstering Commerce's export control enforcement comes as the incoming Trump administration says it is looking to dramatically reduce the size and scope of federal government. President-elect Donald Trump has tapped entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d to dismantle parts of the federal government.",
      "The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.",

      "\u201cWhile BIS\u2019 budget has been stagnant for a decade, the bureau works diligently around the clock to meet its mission and safeguard U.S. national security,\u201d Commerce Department spokesperson Charlie Andrews said in a statement in response to the report.",
      "Andrews added that with \u201cnecessary resources from Congress\u201d the agency would be \"better equipped to address the challenges that come with our evolving national security environment.\u201d",
      "In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, chair of the subcommittee, pointed to news reports of the Russian military continuing to acquire components from Texas Instruments through front companies in Hong Kong to illustrate how the export controls are failing as an effective tool.",
      "Texas Instruments did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cWhile Congress must provide BIS more resources to undertake its critical mission, it is long past time for BIS to make full use of the enforcement powers Congress has conferred upon it and take aggressive steps to cut the flow of U.S. semiconductors into the Russian war machine,\u201d Blumenthal wrote.",
      "Blumenthal in a separate statement added that he was calling on \"Commerce to take immediate action and crack down on the companies allowing U.S.-made semiconductors to power Russian weapons and Chinese ambition.\u201d",
      "It's not just Texas Instruments that's the issue. The subcommittee in September published a report that found aggregated exports from four major U.S. advanced chip manufacturers nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022 to Armenia and Georgia.",
      "Both of those countries are home to front companies known to assist Russia in acquiring advanced chips made in the U.S. despite export controls.",
      "China, meanwhile, has created \u201cvast, barely disguised smuggling networks which enable it to continue to harness U.S. technology,\u201d the subcommittee report asserts.",
      "Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls in China, as President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of chips in the U.S.",
      "But Chinese companies have found ways to evade export controls in part because of a lack of China subject matter experts and Chinese speakers assigned to Commerce's export control enforcement.",
      "The agency's current budget limits the number of international end-use checks, or physical verification overseas of distributors or companies receiving American-made chips that are the supposed end users of products. Currently, Commerce has only 11 export control officers spread around the globe to conduct such checks.",
      "The committee made several recommendations in its report, including Congress allocating more money for hiring additional personnel to enforce export controls, imposing larger fines on companies that violate controls and requiring periodic reviews of advanced chip companies\u2019 export control plans by outside entities.",

      "SCOTCHTOWN, N.Y. -- Scholars are hailing the discovery of a fossilized mastodon jaw discovered by a man who spotted two giant teeth while gardening at his upstate New York home this year.",
      "The mastodon jaw and some other bone fragments were found in late September in a backyard near Scotchtown, a hamlet about 70 miles (112 kilometers) northwest of New York City, officials from the New York State Museum said.",
      "The owner of the backyard does not want to be identified, said Robert Feranec, the state museum's director of research and collections and curator of Ice Age animals.",
      "The individual spotted what he first thought were baseballs, Feranec said Wednesday. \u201cHe picked them up and realized they were teeth,\u201d he said.",
      "Excavation by staff from the museum and the State University of New York's Orange County campus yielded a full, well-preserved jaw of an adult mastodon as well as a piece of a toe bone and a rib fragment, museum officials said.",
      "\u201cWhile the jaw is the star of the show, the additional toe and rib fragments offer valuable context and the potential for additional research,\u201d said Cory Harris, chair of SUNY Orange's behavioral sciences department. \u201cWe are also hoping to further explore the immediate area to see if there are any additional bones that were preserved.\u201d",
      "Officials with the Albany-based state museum said the jaw was the first complete mastodon jaw found in New York in 11 years.

      "The federal government says that two endangered whales have been spotted entangled in fishing gear off Massachusetts and that one is likely to die from its injuries",
      "Two endangered whales have been spotted entangled in fishing gear off Massachusetts, and one is likely to die from its injuries, the federal government said.",
      "They are North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 400 and face existential threats from entanglement in gear and collisions with ships. An aerial survey found the whales swimming about 50 miles southeast of Nantucket on Dec. 9, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.",
      "One of the whales is a juvenile that has a thick line that passes across its head and back and is likely to succumb to the injury, the agency said in a statement. The other whale is an adult female who biologists think has suffered a sublethal injury from the entanglement, NOAA said.",
      "NOAA said in a statement Tuesday that it would \u201cwork with authorized responders and trained experts to monitor the whales\u201d and that it will \u201cfurther document the entanglements and determine if entanglement responses will be possible.\u201d",
      "The news of the entangled whales follows the release of new data from researchers this fall showing a slight uptick in the whale's population. A group of researchers said two months ago that the population increased about 4% from 2020.",
      "However, those researchers and environmental advocates cautioned at the time that the whales still faced the threat of extinction. The animal's population fell about 25% from 2010 to 2020.",
      "The entanglement of the two whales illustrates the need for new safeguards to protect the animals, said Gib Brogan, campaign director at Oceana. Environmentalists have pushed for new restrictions on commercial fishing and shipping to try to protect the whales.",
      "\u201cThese whales are not statistics; they are living beings enduring unimaginable suffering caused by human activities,\u201d Brogan said.",
      "The whales migrate every year and usually arrive in Cape Cod Bay in early winter and stay until around the middle of May. They give birth off the coasts of Georgia and Florida and are slow to reproduce, which is one of the reasons conservationists say they can't withstand additional mortality.",
      "The whales were once abundant off the East Coast, but they were decimated during the era of commercial whaling. They have been federally protected for decades.",
      "Some scientists have said climate change is a major threat to the whales because it has changed the availability of their food. That has caused them to stray from protected areas of ocean.",
      "\u201cNorth Atlantic right whales continue to be entangled at levels that could push this critically endangered species to extinction. It is distressing that multiple generations of right whales have been affected by the devastating harm of entanglements, which is resulting in deaths, health declines, and slower reproductive rates,\" said Amy Knowlton, senior scientist at the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium.",

    "story": [
      "Barcelona's subway system is using regenerative braking to help power both its convoys but also recharge electric cars at street level",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- The Barcelona subway grinds to a halt, the doors slide open and commuters pour out to go about their daily business.",
      "Little do they know that as they do so, a burst of energy is sent up to street level to help charge an electric car.",
      "Barcelona has put together a package of clean energy technologies to help public transportation go greener, while also doing its part to combat climate change and aid Europe's difficult shift to the privately owned electric vehicle market.",
      "Sixteen stations of Barcelona\u2019s subway system are part of its new MetroCharge project, whereby the energy from the underground trains' brakes is used to power the trains and the stations themselves, while the remainder is sent snaking through cables to the surface to power plug-in stations for privately owned vehicles.",
      "Bernardo Espinoza, a 49-year-old engineer, commutes daily by subway. He also owns a hybrid car and had just found out that he had a new place to plug in.",
      "\u201cI am pleasantly surprised, because I have an electric car and am always looking for where to plug it in,\u201d Espinoza said before catching the subway in a working-class area of southern Barcelona. \u201cAnd if it is from energy from the metro\u2019s brakes, then even better.\u201d",
      "Regenerative brakes have been in trains for decades and are also used in some cars. They consist of an electric motor which captures energy used in the braking action that would be lost as heat by conventional brakes. That energy can be immediately used to accelerate the vehicle or, in the case of the Barcelona subway system, sent along cables to supply electricity for the station or for electric car chargers.",
      "Alvaro Luna, professor of electrical engineering at the Polytechnical University of Catalonia, said that the system is innovative in so far as it allows for recycled energy to be redirected to specific local uses \u2014 in this case powering electric cars parked nearby. That, he says, boosts efficiency.",
      "\u201cSince the recharging stations are installed nearby, the energy, instead of being put back into the general electric network, goes directly to the charging stations, and that allows the provider to potentially offer lower prices,\u201d Luna said. \u201cWe can say that the innovation is one of urban planning, of being able to bring together energy uses within a city.\u201d",
      "Making better use of energy has become a key pillar of reducing rising global temperatures. Last year, countries at U.N. climate talks and the members of the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging-market nations agreed to double energy efficiency by 2030.",
      "Jordi Picas, head of systems for TMB, Barcelona\u2019s subway, said that the public company estimates that it can recover the 7.3 million euros ($7.6 million) spent on MetroCharge, which includes European Union funding, in four years thanks to reduced energy costs.",
      "The system, which also includes solar panels, provides all the energy needs of 28 of the 163 subway stations, from the lights to the elevators and ventilation systems, and saves 6% of the total energy spent by the metro, according to Picas. An average of 2.3 million people take the Barcelona metro on any given workday.",
      "This clever program comes while doubts are emerging about the speed and cost of the EU's green transition as the 27-member bloc seeks to eliminate combustion engines and remain a world leader in standards for environmental protection.",
      "Spain, like other Mediterranean countries, is feeling the burn of climate change, experts say, with the frequency of prolonged droughts and extreme weather events like the recent devastating floods in Valencia set to increase over the coming years.",
      "In 2021, Spain\u2019s government rolled out an ambitious electric car plan backed by the EU\u2019s post-pandemic transition funds. The public incentives have succeeded in encouraging private investment like last week\u2019s announcement by Chinese battery maker CATL and carmaker Stellantis to build a lithium battery factory in Zaragoza. The plan also included help for consumers.",
      "But Spain hasn't been immune to the stumbles in the industry across Europe as the EU moves toward tariffs on Chinese EVs to try to help continental carmakers catch up.",
      "Spain, with its wide expanses for a Western European country, faces the extra challenge of deploying recharging stations. Spain has 37,000 charging points, below the goal of 100,000 the government had set for now in 2021, according to ANFAC, the Spanish Association of Automobile and Truck Manufacturers.",
      "So while the Barcelona subway concept can help chart a course for urban planners, there is still a lot of work to do.",
      "\u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda said that he agreed with the spirt of the initiative while plugging his hybrid taxi into a charging point fed by the Barcelona subway.",
      "But he also said that the government should do more to help shoppers buy electric cars because \u201cpeople don\u2019t really go for electric cars here.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk, clad in tuxedo and black tie, took the stage at President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort shortly after the election with all the swagger of the winning candidate himself.",
      "\u201cThe public has given us a mandate that could not be more clear, the clearest mandate. The people have spoken. The people want change,\" Musk told the audience of Trump's biggest donors, campaign leaders and appointment seekers. \u201cWe are going to shake things up. It's going to be a revolution.\u201d",
      "Musk's attachment to Trump has created an alliance between America's most powerful politician and its richest businessman \u2014 and roughly the same percentages of Americans have favorable views of each, according to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Experts are split on whether that overlap in public opinion is a good or bad thing for Musk\u2019s businesses or for Trump\u2019s politics. But it could have far-reaching effects in both realms.",
      "Musk, whose net worth tops $400 billion, oversees six businesses while continuing to work closely with Trump: electric car manufacturer Tesla, the X social media platform, space technology company SpaceX, brain link company Neuralink, the startup xAI and tunneling operator The Boring Co.",
      "\u201cEven though there\u2019s a negative impact, in terms of potentially alienating some of their customers that might not be fans of Trump, the benefits far outweigh any negatives when it comes to having a right-hand seat next to Trump in the White House,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.",
      "Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, identified himself as an investor in Musk's Tesla and a driver of Tesla\u2019s new Cybertruck, the futuristic pickup that has gotten huge amounts of attention but also been the subject of safety concerns and multiple recalls.",
      "\u201cHaving your CEO not working at your company and working at the job of having to fire government employees ... as a shareholder, I\u2019m paying someone to not work for my company,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a Cybertruck owner with self-driving that sucks and doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude, this isn\u2019t fair.\u2019\u201d",
      "But despite his skepticism, Gerber said he won\u2019t stop investing in Musk\u2019s businesses.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of money with Elon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not in the business of investing based on the popularity of CEOs.\u201d",

      "He is no more popular with the U.S. public than the president-elect himself, and viewed unfavorably by about half of Americans, according to the AP-NORC poll.",
      "About 4 in 10 Americans have a somewhat or very favorable view of the world\u2019s richest person, very similar to the percentage who view Trump positively. Likewise, about half of adults have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Musk \u2014 again, similar to Trump.",
      "Instead, said one political strategist, Musk is the ideal validator for someone who cultivates an image of success in business and who has stocked his Cabinet and key adviser roles with billionaires.",
      "\"Trump has always pushed this narrative that he\u2019s a successful developer and a very successful businessman. I think having Musk with him is his double-down on this business success, good-for-the-economy, good-for-everybody-making money kind of persona,\u201d said Christine Matthews, a national political pollster who has worked for Republicans. \u201cIn this case, Musk is seen as this successful, innovative, tech entrepreneur, frontier-buster.\u201d",
      "Musk also has at his disposal X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that he purchased and turned into a megaphone for conservative ideas. And having spent an estimated $250 million to support Trump in the election, Musk has signaled he is willing to back Republican primary challenges to GOP members in the House and Senate seeking reelection in 2026 who waver on Trump's appointments and agenda.",
      "Trump has tasked him with leading a group to reduce the size of the federal government and reduce the rulemaking authority of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump\u2019s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.",
      "Some analysts believe the billionaire\u2019s role will create a very friendly landscape for Tesla over the coming years. Ives, the analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Musk\u2019s relationship with Trump could \u201crevolutionize the Tesla story, especially around robotics, AI and autonomous.\u201d",
      "Investors, he said, are betting on Musk and see his political ascent as a \u201cchampagne moment.\u201d Unlike Gerber, Ives believes that ending the EV credit and taking subsidies from Detroit carmakers, Hyundai and other companies will create only opportunity for Tesla.",
      "\u201cI think Wall Street is starting to fully digest the potential benefits from Musk,\u201d Ives said.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock price has nearly doubled since Trump\u2019s victory, creating an additional $750 billion shareholder wealth in the past six weeks. But Gerber feels that jump is because investors believe Tesla will have an advantage when it comes to autonomous driving because Trump could grant the company a national autonomy license.",
      "Still, he thinks Tesla will be the \u201cbig loser\u201d of Musk\u2019s businesses because of Trump\u2019s promise to end the EV tax credit for carmakers.",
      "\u201cFor Tesla, I don\u2019t see a ton of benefit from this,\u201d he said. \u201cElon is misleading people to say it hurts the competition if the credit goes away.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s other companies \u2014 including his artificial intelligence company, xAI \u2014 could reap the benefits of working within the Trump administration, he said.",
      "\u201cAI is a transformative investment that will create lots of regulatory and governmental issues, especially around safety and information,\u201d Gerber said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of benefit, from an AI perspective, to having Elon where he is.\u201d",
      "The relationship between the two men has no parallel in U.S. history, said David Nasaw, biographer of American business tycoons Andrew Carnegie and William Randolph Hearst. He noted that Musk, to a level unlike other tycoons, has relied on subsidies and favorable government decisions for his success from Tesla to SpaceX.",

Honda\u2019s share price fell as much as 3%. Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is also part of the talks.",
      "Trading in Nissan\u2019s shares was suspended but then resumed after the companies jointly issued a statement saying they were \u201cconsidering various possibilities for future collaboration, but no decisions have been made.\u201d",

Relatively inexpensive EVs from China's BYD, Great Wall and Nio are eating into the market shares of U.S. and Japanese car companies in China and elsewhere.",
      "Japanese automakers have lagged behind big rivals in EVs and are now trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they will share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March.",

      "Nissan said last month that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan's credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan's share price has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. A report in the Japanese financial magazine Diamond said talks with Honda gained urgency after the Taiwan maker of iPhones Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., better known as Foxconn, began exploring a possible acquisition of Nissan as part of its push into the EV sector.",
      "The company has struggled for years following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.",
      "Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger Toyota would remain the leading Japanese automaker.",
      "All the global automakers are facing potential shocks if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on threats to raise or impose tariffs on imports of foreign products, even from allies like Japan and neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico. Nissan is among the major car companies that have adjusted their supply chains to include vehicles assembled in Mexico.",
      "Meanwhile, analysts say there is an \u201caffordability shift\u201d taking place across the industry, led by people who feel they cannot afford to pay nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle. In American, a vital market for companies like Nissan, Honda and Toyota, that's forcing automakers to consider lower pricing, which will eat further into industry profits.",

      "Neutrinos date back to the Big Bang, and trillions zoom through our bodies every second. They spew from stars like the sun and stream out when atomic bits collide in a particle accelerator.",
      "Scientists have known about the existence of neutrinos for almost a century, but they\u2019re still in the early stages of figuring out what the particles really are.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the least understood particle in our world,\u201d said Cao Jun, who helps manage the detector known as JUNO. \"That\u2019s why we need to study it.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no way to spot the tiny neutrinos whizzing around on their own. Instead, scientists measure what happens when they collide with other bits of matter, producing flashes of light or charged particles.",
      "Neutrinos bump into other particles only very rarely, so to up their chances of catching a collision, physicists have to think big.",
      "\u201cThe solution for how we measure these neutrinos is to build very, very big detectors,\u201d de Gouvea said.",
      "The $300 million detector in Kaiping, China, took over nine years to build. Its location 2,297 feet (700 meters) underground protects from pesky cosmic rays and radiation that could throw off its neutrino-sniffing abilities.",
      "On Wednesday, workers began the final step in construction. Eventually, they'll fill the orb-shaped detector with a liquid designed to emit light when neutrinos pass through and submerge the whole thing in purified water.",
      "It'll study antineutrinos \u2014 an opposite to neutrinos which allow scientists to understand their behavior \u2014 produced from collisions inside two nuclear power plants located over 31 miles (50 kilometers) away. When the antineutrinos come into contact with particles inside the detector, they'll produce a flash of light.",
      "The detector is specially designed to answer a key question about a longstanding mystery. Neutrinos switch between three flavors as they zip through space, and scientists want to rank them from lightest to heaviest.",
      "Sensing these subtle shifts in the already evasive particles will be a challenge, said Kate Scholberg, a physicist at Duke University who is not involved with the project.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very daring thing to even go after it,\u201d she said.",
      "China\u2019s detector is set to operate during the second half of next year. After that, it\u2019ll take some time to collect and analyze the data \u2014 so scientists will have to keep waiting to fully unearth the secret lives of neutrinos.",
      "Two similar neutrino detectors \u2013 Japan\u2019s Hyper-Kamiokande and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment based in the United States \u2013 are under construction. They\u2019re set to go online around 2027 and 2031 and will cross-check the China detector\u2019s results using different approaches.",
      "\u201cIn the end, we have a better understanding of the nature of physics,\u201d said Wang Yifang, chief scientist and project manager of the Chinese effort.",
      "Though neutrinos barely interact with other particles, they\u2019ve been around since the dawn of time. Studying these Big Bang relics can clue scientists into how the universe evolved and expanded billions of years ago.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re part of the big picture,\u201d Scholberg said.",
      "One question researchers hope neutrinos can help answer is why the universe is overwhelmingly made up of matter with its opposing counterpart \u2014 called antimatter \u2014 largely snuffed out.",
      "Scientists don't know how things got to be so out of balance, but they think neutrinos could have helped write the earliest rules of matter.",
      "The proof, scientists say, may lie in the particles. They'll have to catch them to find out.",

      "\u201cPut all the politics aside, everybody wants to reboot some things,\" said Benioff, who stressed he strives to stay nonpartisan because he also owns Time magazine. \u201dWe are just at a very exciting moment, it\u2019s a new chapter for America.

So there\u2019s just a sense of urgency and a sense of understanding in the Trump administration\u2033 to address it.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and AI, and local governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",

In 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract.",

      "Jurors received the case, which started  Oct. 14, on Dec. 4.",

      "The watchdog issued reprimands and \u201cadministrative penalties\u201d worth 251 million euros ($264 million) after it found multiple infringements of the rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation.",
      "The company said it would appeal the decision.",
      "\u201cThis decision relates to an incident from 2018. We took immediate action to fix the problem as soon as it was identified,\u201d Meta said in a statement. The company said it \u201cproactively informed people impacted\u201d as well as the Irish watchdog.",

      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged to $91.4 billion last year",
      "Global security leaders are warning that nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged around the world. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",

A Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 100-page guide on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day.

And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard. He says his bunker factory, in Sulphur Springs, Texas, is the world\u2019s largest. Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",

So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",

      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",

      "Four callers ended up buying bunkers in one day, he said, and more ended up ordering doors and other parts for shelters they were already building.",

      "A loaded shotgun at arm\u2019s length and metal mesh window shields to block Molotov cocktails nearby, Hubbard said he started his company after building his own bunker about 10 years ago. He says callers ask about prices \u2014 $20,000 to multimillions, averaging $500,000 \u2014 and installations \u2014 they can go just about anywhere. He said most days he sells at least one bunker.",

      "For the next 40 minutes there were traffic jams, workers running into and out of buildings, families huddling in their bathrooms, students gathering in gyms, drivers blocking tunnels, all in an attempt to seek shelter, without any clear idea of what \u201cseek immediate shelter\u201d actually meant.",

      "\u201cGently brush your pet\u2019s coat to remove any fallout particles\u201d it says, adding that the 15-minute delay between bomb and fallout allows \u201cenough time for you to be able to prevent significant radiation exposure.\u201d",

This makes people feel vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Lair said building bunkers seems futile, even if they work in the short term.",
      "\u201cEven if a nuclear exchange is perhaps more survivable than many people think, I think the aftermath will be uglier than many people think as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamental wrenching that it would do to our way of life would be profound.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s been a serious concern of Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern for almost 50 years.",

      "\u201cThe stakes, if a nuclear weapon is ever used, is that millions and millions and millions of people will die. It really is shocking that we have world leaders who talk casually about utilizing nuclear weapons. I mean, it would be catastrophic, not just for those that are involved in an exchange of nuclear weapons, but for the entire world.\u201d",
      "McGovern pushed back against FEMA\u2019s efforts to prepare the public for a nuclear attack by advising people to take shelter.",
      "\u201cWhat a stupid thing to say that we all just need to know where to hide and where to avoid the most impacts of nuclear radiation. I mean, really, that\u2019s chilling when you hear people try to rationalize nuclear war that way,\u201d he said.",
      "Nuclear war was far from a couple's mind when they went house-hunting in Southern California a few years ago. They wanted a home to settle down and raise their family, and they needed extra garage space. They spotted an online ad for a home with at least eight parking spots. On the basketball court, there was a metal hatch. Beneath it was a bunker.",
      "This was Jones' former home, which Jones said he put up for sale for family reasons.",
      "The husband, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about his family's privacy, went ahead and bought Jones' home, bunker and all. They aren\u2019t particularly worried about nuclear war, and haven\u2019t spent a night in the bunker, but they have stored food and medical supplies down there.",
      "\u201cWe have told some of our friends, if something goes crazy and gets bad, get over here as fast as possible,\u201d the husband said. \u201cIt does provide a sense of security.\u201d",

      "Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son has joined President-elect Donald Trump in announcing plans by technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son and President-elect Donald Trump have announced plans for technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States over the coming four years.",
      "Trump said the investments in building artificial intelligence infrastructure would create 100,000 jobs, twice the 50,000 promised when Son pledged $50 billion in U.S. investments after Trump's victory in 2016.",
      "Son, a founder and CEO of SoftBank Group, is known for making bold choices that sometimes pay big and sometimes don't. SoftBank has investments in dozens of Silicon Valley startups, along with big companies like semiconductor design company Arm and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The stock market rally and craze for AI has boosted the value of its assets, but it's unclear whether its investments will create that many jobs.",
      "Son founded SoftBank in the 1980s, expanding it from a telecoms carrier to encompass renewable energy and technology ventures. A leading figure in Japan\u2019s business world, he was an early believer in the internet, pouring billions into Silicon Valley start-ups and other technology companies.",
      "Son comes from a humble background. While at the University of California, Berkeley, he invented a pocket translator that he sold for $1 million to Japanese electronics maker Sharp Corp. He has made a career of risk-taking, pushing adoption of broadband services when the internet was still relatively new in Japan. His $20 billion takeover of U.S. mobile phone carrier Sprint Nextel Corp. in 2012 was Japan\u2019s biggest foreign acquisition at the time.",
      "Son is philosophical about his missteps, such as SoftBank's $18.5 billion investment in co-working space provider WeWork, which sought bankruptcy protection last year. SoftBank also invested in the failed robot pizza-making company Zume. Son is canny: SoftBank-related spending on lobbying and donations to U.S. politicians and parties runs into the billions of dollars. And both times Trump was elected, Son was quick to show his support.",
      "SoftBank has benefitted in recent months from rising values of some investments, such as U.S.-based e-commerce company Coupang, Chinese mobility provider DiDi Global and Bytedance, the Chinese developer of TikTok.",
      "Son built his fortune on early investments in search engine Yahoo and China's Alibaba, an astute initial outlay of $20 million in what has become an e-commerce and financial empire with a market cap of more than $200 billion.",
      "SoftBank has investments in T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, Microsoft, Nvidia and ride-sharing platform Uber, among hundreds of other companies that it groups together in its Vision Funds. The Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund and Abu Dhabi national wealth fund are among the biggest investors in those funds.",
      "The hundreds of start-ups that have received SoftBank investments include Nuro, a robo-delivery company; the dog-walking app Wag; South Korean logistics company Coupang; the Southeast Asian ride-sharing app Grab; and the office messaging app Slack.",
      "After several rough years, SoftBank returned to profitability in the last quarter, helped by returns from its Vision Fund investments. A big factor? Royalties and licensing related to its holdings in the UK-based computer chip-designing company Arm, whose business spans smartphones, data centers, networking equipment, automotive, consumer electronic devices, and AI applications.",
      "SoftBank investor presentations have sometimes featured images of a goose labeled \u201cAI Revolution\u201d laying golden eggs.",
      "Son has said he believes artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence within a decade, affecting every industry, from transportation and pharmaceuticals to finance, manufacturing, logistics and others and that companies and people working with AI will be the leaders of the next 10 to 20 years. SoftBank's roughly 90% stake in Arm has positioned it well for expansion of AI applications since most mobile devices operate on Arm-based processors.",
      "Trump and Son said the $100 billion that SoftBank has promised to invest will go to building AI infrastructure, but the nature of that spending remains unclear. The eventual impact of AI on jobs remains an open question, but much of its infrastructure is based on energy-guzzling data processing centers that are likely to employ relatively few people once they are built.",
      "Even if SoftBank actually invested the promised $50 billion last time Trump was headed to the White House, it's unclear how many jobs that created.",
      "Shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic complicated matters. Foxconn Technology Group, a Taiwan company best known for making Apple iPhones, won Trump\u2019s praise after saying in 2017 it would build a $10 billion complex employing 13,000 people in a small town just south of Milwaukee. But that investment was scaled back drastically.",
      "SoftBank itself says it had 65,352 employees as of March.",
      "Officials in Tokyo praised Son's initiative, viewing it as a goodwill gesture at a time of huge concern over whether Trump will impose blanket tariff hikes on imports from allies like Japan, as well as China.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, I believe expansion of investment through steady accumulation of efforts between Japanese and U.S. companies would help further strengthen Japan-U.S. economic ties, so I find it delightful,\u201d said Yoji Muto, Japan's Trade and Industry minister.",

Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster.",
      "Planes and helicopters all have flashing lights and typically at least one red anti-collision light, often two. They also sport navigation lights, which are steady, red and green colored lights like the ones found on boats. Many will also have flashing white strobe lights at their wingtips. And they have bright landing lights.",
      "Drones flying at night are only required to have one bright, anti-collision light that's visible 3 miles (5 kilometers) away. But drone owners can add other lights, so some have more than one. Drones are smaller, so when they have multiple lights they are close together, but at night it's often not possible to figure out precisely how far away they are.",
      "\"A light is just a bright point,\u201d Slaughter said. \u201cAnd it might be 100 yards (90 meters) away, it could be literally 40 miles (65 kilometers) away, and it looks the same.\u201d",
      "Drones tend to be quieter and make a higher-pitched buzzing noise than that generated by the jet engines or propellers that drive planes and helicopters. But bigger drones can be louder, and the sound may be difficult to discern from a distance.",
      "Drones heavier than about a half-pound (0.2 kilograms) may have an identifying number displayed on the outside.",
      "\u201cYou certainly wouldn\u2019t see it at night, and you\u2019d have to be up close to see it, you know, in the daytime,\u201d said Paul R. Snyder, director of the Unmanned Aircraft System program in the University of North Dakota's Aerospace Sciences School.",
      "Planes and even helicopters tend to move smoothly in the air, but multicopter drones can stop on a dime, pivot 90 degrees and reverse course, Slaughter said.",
      "\u201cThat kind of motion can give you a clue that you\u2019re looking at a drone, not an aircraft,\" he said.",
      "And the vast majority of drones will be operating below 400 feet (122 meters), following federal regulations."

      "\"The American Southwest is one of the fastest growing parts of the country \u2014 and it's become a key political battleground every election year. Leaders in these critical states have put their faith in my ability to help our party win again. And I don't take that lightly. I'm grateful to have their support to run the next DNC and won't let them down,\" Martin said in a statement to ABC News.",

      "Martin's track record of winning statewide elections is critical to the party's mission of establishing strong electoral majorities in southwestern states where Democrats have struggled, Arizona Democratic Party Chair Yolanda Bejarano said in a statement first provided to ABC News.",
      "\"Ken's commitment to breaking the transactional organizing model and replacing it with a year-round model built on permanent relationships will be especially important for restoring our strength with Latino and young voters that we need to win in Arizona and throughout the Southwest,\" she said, referencing two demographics that Harris and the Democrats underperformed with this year.",

While Biden lost by only six points to Trump in 2020 and Beto O'Rourke came within striking distance of defeating Ted Cruz in 2018, Harris and Democratic Senate Candidate Colin Allred failed to narrow that margin. Allred lost by 9 points to Cruz, while Harris suffered a 14-point defeat to President-elect Donald Trump and again underperformed a statewide counterpart.",
      "\"Ken has an undefeated track record of winning statewide elections, and that's exactly the leadership we need to build lasting majorities in key states like Arizona,\" Bejarano continued.",
      "The other Southwestern chairpeople echoed Bejarano, finding Martin to be a trusted coalition builder \u2014 an essential skill for a party that saw compromising levels of attrition across key demographic groups, which ultimately led to across-the-board losses, including in all seven battleground states.",
      "\"With Donald Trump looming over the Republican Party, we need someone who understands that our path to victory lies in every corner of this country\u2014not just in major cities, but in rural communities, suburbs, and battlegrounds everywhere,\" Gilberto Hinojosa, Texas Democratic Party chair, said in a statement.",

      "Alicia Andrews, the chair of the Oklahoma Democrats, said Martin \"has the vision, experience, and dedication to lead our Party to meaningful, lasting change.\"",
      "Per Martin's campaign, he currently has the endorsement of over 100 DNC members. They have not released the names of those individuals as of yet.",
      "Chairs need a simple majority of the DNC, at least 224 votes, to win. The leadership elections take place on Feb. 1 outside of Washington, D.C.",

    "story": [
      "The amount nearly triples what Joe Biden's inaugural committee raised in 2021.",
      "The Trump-Vance inaugural committee is on track to set a record in inauguration fundraising, with pledged contributions surpassing its fundraising goal of $150 million as of Monday, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "The inaugural committee had roughly $70 million of that in the bank as of Monday, with the rest of the pledged contributions expected to arrive in the coming weeks as the committee prepares the festivities for President-elect Donald Trump's second inauguration, sources said.",
      "The anticipated haul not only nearly triples the $62 million that President Joe Biden's inaugural committee raised in 2021, but also dwarfs the $107 million that Trump's first inaugural committee raised in 2017 -- which was a record-setting amount at the time.",
      "The inaugural committee is planning three days of festivities and exclusive events for supporters and wealthy donors starting Jan. 18, including a \"Make America Great Again Victory Rally,\" a parade, a Sunday service, and exclusive receptions and candlelight dinners, according to donor packages obtained by ABC News.",
      "Planners say the festivities will be \"bigger than ever\" -- highlighting Trump's status as only the second former president, after Grover Cleveland, to be reelected to a second nonconsecutive term.",
      "\"There is an absolute deluge of interest,\" said one Republican fundraiser, telling ABC News that corporate interests in particular feel more comfortable and motivated to donate to Trump's inaugural this time around.",
      "In addition to longtime donors, there's been heightened interest from younger donors and donors from the tech industry, the fundraiser said.",
      "In recent days, several major tech firms have announced $1 million contributions to the inaugural committee, including Meta and Amazon, as well as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.",
      "Meta -- whose CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, recently met with Trump at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago estate -- is donating to a presidential inaugural committee for the first time. Trump also said he recently met with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook, and that he is scheduled to meet with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos this week.",
      "A Republican lobbyist raising money for the inauguration told ABC News that the \"Make America Great Again Victory Rally,\" which will kick off the inaugural festivities on Jan. 18, will be a signature Trump-style event bringing together a massive crowd that \"keeps him connected to his supporters.\"",
      "In addition to the victory rally, plans for the traditional inaugural events in the nation's capital \"are being enormously well received on the individual donor and corporation level,\" the lobbyist said.",
      "Other planned inaugural events include a \"Cabinet Reception\" that fundraising materials say will \"recognize our most generous Inaugural supporters,\" and a \"Vice President's Dinner\" that's described as \"an intimate dinner with Vice President-elect JD Vance and Mrs. Usha Vance.\"",
      "As was the case for Trump's 2016 inauguration, donors get different levels of access depending on their contribution tier, with supporters in the highest tier giving $1 million or raising $2 million. But this time around, the lowest tier is $50,000, which is double the lowest tier at Trump's first inauguration.",
      "The vice president's dinner on Jan. 18 is open only to those who give at the highest tier, while admission to the \"One America, One Light\" Sunday service, featuring United States military bands and attendance by Trump and Melania Trump, are available to those who give at least $100,000 or raise at least $200,000.",
      "Admission to a \"Candlelight Dinner\" that night, attended by Trump and Melania Trump, is limited to those who give at least $250,000 or raise at least $500,000.",
      "Biden's 2021 inauguration, which was scaled down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, used a similar fundraising approach, but the highest donor tier was $500,000 instead of $1 million.",
      "Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, will include a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue following the swearing-in ceremony, and a black-tie \"Starlight Ball\" that evening. Tickets to the ball are available to big inaugural donors -- although Trump is raising additional funds by offering small-dollar donors a chance to win admission to the event by making a contribution to a Trump fundraising entity that has raised money for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee.",
      "Some of Trump's nominees for incoming cabinet positions -- including treasury secretary pick Scott Bessent and commerce secretary pick Howard Lutnick -- were among Trump's $1 million donors to his 2017 inaugural committee.",
      "That committee ended up being embroiled in multiple court battles, including a lawsuit brought by the D.C. attorney general claiming the committee overpaid for ballrooms at Trump's Old Post Office hotel to enrich Trump and his family business.",

      "She called the allegation \"a malicious and cowardly assault on the truth.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk, chairman of the House Administration's subcommittee on Oversight, in a new report suggests former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney should be investigated for alleged criminal witness tampering, claiming she played an \"integral role\" shaping key witness testimony before the Jan. 6 committee investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump posted early Wednesday morning on his social media platform that \"Liz Cheney could be in a lot of trouble based on the evidence obtained by the subcommittee, which states that 'numerous federal laws were likely broken by Liz Cheney, and these violations should be investigated by the FBI.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Trump, speaking about Jan. 6 committee members,  said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that, \"for what they did, honestly, they should go to jail.\"",
      "The House GOP report released Tuesday marks not only the latest effort by House Republicans to discredit the Jan. 6 committee, but also a possible preview of its oversight efforts in the next session of Congress beginning in January.",
      "Cheney's name appears in the report more than 120 times, excluding the table of contents, going line-by-line to blast her participation as vice chair of the Jan. 6 committee.",
      "\"Without authority and against House Rules -- the role of ranking member, Congress itself must right its former wrongs and declare this appointment of Representative Cheney invalid now,\" the report states.",
      "The report alleges that as Cheney participated in the investigation, she colluded with Cassidy Hutchinson, the former Trump White House aide, about her testimony describing then-President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.",
      "The report contends that Cheney not only \"backchannelled\" with Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House aide and a host of ABC's \"The View,\" to get Hutchinson to change her narrative but also communicated with her \"directly for days.\" After that, the report alleges that Cheney also convinced Hutchinson to fire her attorney, Stefan Passantino.",
      "\"According to text messages, that appear to be from the encrypted messaging app \"Signal,\" between Hutchinson and Farah Griffin obtained by the Subcommittee, Cheney agreed to communicate with Hutchinson through Farah Griffin,\" the subcommittee said.",
      "\"It is unusual -- and potentially unethical -- for a Member of Congress conducting an investigation to contact a witness if the Member knows that the individual is represented by legal counsel,\" the report states. \"This appears to be precisely what Representative Cheney did at this time, and within a matter of days of these secret conversations, Hutchinson would go on to recant her previous testimony and introduce her most outlandish claims.\"",
      "\"What other information was communicated during these phone calls may never be known, but what is known is that Representative Cheney consciously attempted to minimize her contact with Hutchinson in her book, and the most likely reason to try to bury that information would be if Representative Cheney knew that it was improper and unethical to communicate with Hutchinson without her counsel present,\" the report states.",
      "\"It must be emphasized that Representative Cheney would likely have known her communications without the knowledge of Hutchinson's attorney were illicit and unethical at that time,\" the report said. Farah Griffin indicated as much ... in her ... message to Hutchinson ... when she wrote that Representative Cheney's \"one concern\" was that as long as Hutchinson was represented by counsel, \"she [Cheney] can't really ethically talk to you [Hutchinson] without him [Passantino].\" Despite Representative Cheney's initial hesitation, the Subcommittee uncovered evidence of frequent, direct conversations between Hutchinson and Representative Cheney without Passantino's knowledge, and also through their intermediary Farah Griffin.\"",
      "Cheney responded in a statement stressing the testimony \"was painstakingly\" presented in thousands of pages of transcripts, made public along with a \"highly detailed and meticulously sourced 800-page report.\"",
      "\"Chairman Loudermilk's 'Interim Report' intentionally disregards the truth and the Select Committee's tremendous weigh of evidence, and instead fabricates lies and defamatory allegations in an attempt to cover up what Donald Trump did,\" Cheney wrote. \"Their allegations do not reflect a review of the actual evidence, and are a malicious and cowardly assault on the truth.\"",
      "Cheney also did not back off her role and the committee's findings.",
      "\"January 6th showed Donald Trump for who [he] really is \u2013 a cruel and vindictive man who allowed violent attacks to continue against our Capitol and law enforcement officers while he watched television and refused for hours to instruct his supporters to stand down and leave,\" she noted. \"The January 6th Committee's hearings and report featured scores of Republican witnesses, including many of the most senior officials from Trump's own White House, campaign and Administration.\"",
      "Farah Griffin also disputed the GOP report's conclusions.",

I have never felt prouder in my life,\" Hilton told reporters after the vote. \"Just to be here today and see our bill pass in Congress has been one of the most incredible moments of my life and I just know that the teenage me would be so proud of the woman that I am today -- turning my pain into purpose and being a voice for so many people who don't have a voice.\"",
      "Hilton said she traveled to Washington every six to 10 months starting in October 2021 to push for a child abuse bill. She traveled back to the Hill on Monday and has spent the past two days meeting with representatives in order to get the measure across the finish line. She held a press conference outside the Capitol on Monday evening, urging the House's passage of the bill.",
      "Hilton was personally in contact with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise regarding movement on the bill this week.",
      "Hilton for years has been an advocate for reform in congregate care facilities and residential treatment programs for \"troubled\" minors. She's brazenly described her own traumatizing experience at Provo Canyon School in Utah when she was a teenager.",
      "The legislation -- which would ordinarily pass through the House Energy and Commerce committee before it could get called by leaders to the floor -- was fast-tracked by bypassing that step, according to a source familiar with committee business.",
      "\"When the U.S. Senate came together in a rare show of unity to pass the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act unanimously on Wednesday December 11th, it was one of the best moments of my life. It was proof that when we listen to survivors and put politics aside, we can create real, meaningful change. But this journey isn't over. I can't celebrate until this bill becomes law, and now it's up to the U.S House of Representatives to finish what the Senate started,\" Hilton wrote in an open letter shared to her Instagram page on Monday.",
      "\"To Leader Scalise, Speaker Johnson, and every member of the House: I urge you to think about the children who can't speak for themselves. They're relying on us\u2014on you\u2014to stand up for their safety and dignity. Passing this bill would be a testament to what we can achieve when we lead with empathy and courage.\"",
      "Hilton has traveled to Washington every six to 10 months starting in October 2021, according to her spokesperson, each time asking Congress to reform youth residential treatment facilities.",
      "She's met individually with members like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who thanked Hilton after the bill's passage last week for her work on the issue, and Republicans like Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Tim Scott of South Carolina.",
      "Some of her biggest advocates have been the cosponsors of the bill: Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, along with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., Hilton said.",
      "\"A lack of oversight and transparency in residential youth programs has allowed for the abuse of children in facilities across the country for far too long,\" Cornyn said in a statement after the bill passed.",
      "\"I'm proud that the Senate unanimously passed this legislation to ensure the vulnerable children in these facilities are protected, and I want to thank the countless advocates who have bravely shared their stories to help end institutional child abuse.\"",
      "Hilton also testified before the House Ways and Means Committee in June, emotionally recounting her experience being at Provo Canyon School as a teen.",
      "\"These programs promised healing, growth, and support, but instead did not allow me to speak, move freely, or even look out a window for two years,\" she testified in 2023. \"I was force-fed medications and sexually abused by the staff. I was violently restrained and dragged down hallways, stripped naked, and thrown into solitary confinement.\"",
      "The Provo school in Utah, which is still operating today, released an updated statement in June 2024 saying they couldn't comment on the operations or student experiences at the school prior to August 2000, when it had changed ownership shortly after Hilton's stint there. Provo said it did not \"condone or promote any form of abuse,\" in their statement.",
      "Hilton has gone to the White House to advocate for child welfare, meeting with policy staff in May 2022.",
      "\"We have had some prior conversations with the White House about the bill, and we don't have a reason to believe that they wouldn't sign it into law,\" Hilton's spokesperson said.",
      "The socialite's push for congregate-care reform started in 2021, when she came to Washington in support of a similar measure, the Federal Accountability for Congregate Care Act, which was a different bill that was introduced in October 2021 and led by Khanna, Merkley, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., and then-Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.",
      "Before her visit in 2021, Hilton had opened up about her 11-month experience at Provo Canyon school in her 2020 documentary \"This is Paris,\" and in a Washington Post op-ed.",

      "\"I think we are telling them that we're here to govern,\" one Democrat said.",
      "Democrats have a plan to take back power in Washington back from Republicans in two years: work with them now.",
      "Democrats, who are already planning their comeback after being swept out of power in Washington last month, have said they'll oppose President-elect Donald Trump and his allies when their values collide but are open to cooperation on a range of issues, including immigration, federal spending and entitlements.",
      "The strategy marks a turnaround from 2017, when \"resistance\" to Trump was Democrats' rallying cry. But, some lawmakers and operatives said, it also marks a challenge to Republicans for bipartisanship at a time when narrow GOP congressional majorities will likely mandate some level of cooperation.",
      "\"People want to see government work, and we're going to hold Republicans accountable for whether they're willing to help move things forward for the American people. So, if they aren't, then absolutely, that will impact them at the ballot box,\" said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., who led House Democrats' campaign arm this year and will do so again for the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"I think we are telling them that we're here to govern,\" DelBene added. \"And I guess the question is, are they serious about governing?\"",
      "Republicans are cobbling together an aggressive agenda that would extend Trump-era tax cuts, implement strict border measures and more once they take office next month. The efforts will either be split into two measures or combined into one -- but Republicans' intention is to pass them in a way that wouldn't need to meet the 60-vote Senate filibuster rule.",
      "However, for the rest of the upcoming 119th Congress, Republicans will have a 220-215 House majority, once vacancies are filled and barring any absences, and only 53 seats in the Senate, short of the 60 needed to unilaterally pass most legislation.",
      "Democrats have already proposed potential areas of cooperation, even as they lick their wounds from a disappointing election and view Trump as anathema to many of their core beliefs.",
      "\"To win in 2026 and beyond, Democrats must focus on building an economic message centered on good-paying jobs and revitalizing manufacturing,\" California Rep. Ro Khanna said. \"But we have a responsibility now to try and find areas of common ground where we can deliver for Americans. I believe that starts with reducing the Pentagon's oversized defense budget while strongly opposing any cuts to programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\"",
      "\"We are very open to working with the Trump administration,\" added Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, the Democratic Governors Association chair. \"But no doubt if there are things that they push us to do that that we think are wrong, legal, anything like that, we\u2019ll draw the line.\"",
      "That attitude will leave Democrats, especially in purple states and districts, with some leverage -- either to shape legislation, as they say they plan, or to hammer Republicans as obstinate, operatives said.",
      "It's very possible battleground Democrats are at times taken up on offers for bipartisanship or are made themselves to accept offers. Both chambers have their share of moderate Republicans, too, including Reps. Mike Lawler New York and David Valadao of California, and Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.",
      "But each chamber also boasts some Republican hardliners who view bipartisanship as a four-letter word and a sign that a piece of legislation isn't conservative enough.",
      "\"This is how these battleground Democrats are anyway, but I think it will manifest itself in, 'Take me up on this offer, let's go.' And if you don't, then, 'OK, I can work with that, too,'\" said one Democratic strategist working on House races. \"I think for a battleground Democrat, it's a win-win approach. You have the possibility of working on a bill and a law which you can say, 'I delivered,' or you create receipts to bring back to voters to say, 'I kept on trying.'\"",
      "However, some Democrats warned, the party must balance cooperation, even if just offering it, with attacks.",
      "The base still finds Trump -- and Republicans in Congress with similar brands -- abhorrent, and the results in 2026 will be largely fueled by voter attitudes about the GOP's control in Washington.",
      "In 2018, Democrats took back the House in a wave largely fueled among their voters by antipathy for Trump. Capitalizing on that frustration could be key again, strategists told ABC News.",
      "\"The opportunity to work in a bipartisan way, to increase your own bipartisan credentials becomes very important,\" said Dan Sena, the executive director of House Democrats' campaign arm in 2018. \"I just think it's important at large for the caucus to pay attention to the fact that ultimately, in two years from now, the Republican trifecta is going to get a thumb up or a thumb down from the country, and that's ultimately going to dictate who has control of House.\"",
      "\"If I were the Democrats at large,\" Sena added, \"I would be pretty aggressive in holding the Republicans and then the Trump administration accountable.\"",
      "Still, nearly all Democrats agreed that the party should wage a two-pronged strategy, including both cooperation and criticism, and that each will go hand in hand when Democrats find themselves either in congressional majorities next month or having to deal with a Republican president even as they lead their states as governors.",
      "\"I think this openness to working with them is less that you are going to see actual collaboration, I think it's that people are trying to set themselves up to have some credibility in other spaces to be against stuff that they're doing,\" said one former Democratic House aide. \"It carries more weight and legitimacy if you're someone who's open minded to working with them, and then they take a hard right and you speak out.\"",
      "Either way, Democrats are ready to pounce heading into 2026, when both chambers of Congress and 36 governorships will be up for grabs.",
      "\"In politics, it's always the right move to extend a hand,\" said Jared Leopold, a Democratic strategist and former DGA staffer. \"And if somebody chooses to slap you in the face instead, you better make sure you catch it on camera.\"",

      "The DA's office urged an appeals court to reject Trump's immunity claim.",
      "The state prosecution of Donald Trump on election interference charges in Georgia may be able to continue despite his impending inauguration, a lawyer for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis signaled in a court filing that urged an appeals court to reject the president-elect's request to throw out the case based on presidential immunity.",
      "The filing argued that Trump's lawyers failed to demonstrate why a state prosecution would be subject to the Department of Justice memorandum prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting presidents -- which was cited by special counsel Jack Smith when he wound down his federal cases against Trump -- or impede Trump's duties as president.",
      "\"Appellant does not specify or articulate how the appeal -- or indeed, any other aspect of this case -- will constitutionally impede or interfere with his duties once he assumes office,\" Fulton County Chief Senior Assistant District Attorney F. McDonald Wakeford wrote.",
      "\"The notice makes mention of these concepts without actually examining them or applying them to the present circumstances. In other words, Appellant has not done the work but would very much like for this Court to do so,\" the filing said.",
      "According to the filing, state prosecutors are not bound by the Department of Justice's policies, and past court decisions have not clearly established a precedent for state cases proceeding against a sitting president.",
      "\"Given these vague statements, to simply invoke the phrase 'federalism and comity concerns,' without more, offers nothing of substance,\" the filing said, accusing Trump's lawyer of making \"sweeping legal generalizations which are either misleading or oversimplified\" and providing \"a smattering of quotations that are alternately mischaracterized or stripped of context.\"",
      "In a two-page response filed Wednesday, Trump attorney Steve Sadow said that prosecutors failed to address the merits of the president-elect's immunity argument.",
      "\"This is most telling, as the State effectively concedes it cannot continue the prosecution of President Trump, the incoming 47th President of the United States, and must dismiss the indictment against him,\" Sadow wrote.",
      "Trump and 18 others pleaded not guilty last year to all charges in a sweeping racketeering indictment for alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia. Four defendants subsequently took plea deals in exchange for agreeing to testify against other defendants.",
      "Wakeford, in his filing, urged the Georgia Court of Appeals to reject or ignore Trump's request to order the dismissal of the case, describing Trump's recent filing as nothing more than a \"decree.\"",
      "\"The notice thus fails to adequately notify this Court of anything except for the outcome that Appellant would prefer -- and expects -- to see,\" the filing said. \"Such a filing is best understood as a decree. Appellant has provided this Court with half a thought and gestured toward a smattering of constitutional principles, and as a result, he feels entitled to instruct this Court as to what its conclusions are expected to be.\"",
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals took up Trump's case after trial Judge Scott McAfee declined to disqualify Willis over her romantic relationship with a fellow prosecutor, who was forced to resign from the case. Earlier this month, Trump's lawyer sent the court a notice requesting they order the trial judge to dismiss the case based on Trump's presidential immunity, which they argued applied to him as president-elect.",
      "Wakeford, in his filing, categorically denied the existence of president-elect immunity.",
      "\"While the courts' understanding of presidential immunity continues to evolve, 'president-elect immunity' obviously does not exist,\" the filing said.",
      "Wakeford also defended the integrity of the case against Trump, accusing the president-elect of using a \"familiar tactic\" when he argued the case is politically motivated.",
      "\"This case is thus the result of two separate grand juries and years of investigation, and any suggestion it is motivated by 'possible local prejudice' remains utterly unfounded,\" the filing said.",

      "\u201cWe'd like to tell everybody that it's safe to come to Fiji and we have to also find out who has been giving out the negative press about Fiji as a destination. Are they competitors for our tourist visitors?\u201d Rabuka said to reporters."

      "A trailing candidate in a very close election last month for the North Carolina Supreme Court has asked that court to get involved legally in his race",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- A trailing candidate in a very close election for the North Carolina Supreme Court asked that court on Wednesday to step in and prevent election officials from counting in his race over 60,000 ballots that he argues weren't lawfully cast.",
      "Jefferson Griffin, a Republican member of the Court of Appeals, filed the intervention request with the Supreme Court in his race with Democratic Associate Justice Allison Riggs. After recounts and protest hearings initiated by Griffin and other GOP candidates, Riggs leads Griffin by 734 votes out of over 5.5 million ballots cast for the Nov. 5 election. The Associated Press has not yet called the race.",
      "The State Board of Elections last week voted to dismiss the protests. Usually the next step for a dissatisfied trailing candidate seeking to prevent the board from issuing a certification of election to their rival is to appeal to Wake County Superior Court. Riggs has declared herself the winner and his campaign has said that Griffin should concede.",
      "But Griffin went to the Supreme Court instead and asked the justices to rule by this coming Monday on his request to prevent a certificate from being issued to Riggs and to suspend the 10-day deadline to file an appeal in Wake County court.",
      "Griffin's attorneys said the delay will give the justices time to consider his arguments why three categories of ballots cast should not be counted in his race with Riggs. Five Republicans are on the seven-member Supreme Court, which has been a partisan flash point in the state over the past two years in court battles involving redistricting, photo voter identification and other voting rights.",
      "The state Democratic Party sued earlier this month in federal court, seeking to prevent the board from throwing out the ballots, which it says would violate the U.S. Constitution and election laws. Democratic officials have said they fear the Supreme Court could ultimately side with Republicans and remove the challenged ballots, threatening a Riggs victory. Going straight to the Supreme Court with Wednesday's filing would prevent additional delays if state Democrats sought to move the matter to federal court, Griffin's brief said.",
      "The challenges that Griffin advanced again Wednesday focus on three categories of ballots: those cast by people with voter registration records lacking driver\u2019s licenses or containing partial Social Security numbers; overseas voters who have never lived in the U.S. but whose parents were deemed North Carolina residents; and military or overseas voters who did not provide copies of photo identification with their ballots.",
      "The state board, composed of three Democrats and two Republicans, threw out Griffin's protests in a series of votes falling largely along party lines, with all but one by 3-2 counts. The board's written order said in part there was no reasonable basis presented that showed an election law was violated or that irregularities occurred.",
      "Griffin attorney Troy Shelton rejected arguments from Riggs that his client was trying to change election rules after the fact of an election. The registration record requirement took effect in 2004, for example, while residency requirements for voting in North Carolina go back to 1776.",
      "\u201cThe Board was required to discount votes that were cast in violation of state law,\u201d Shelton wrote Wednesday.",
      "But board Chair Alan Hirsch said last week at the protest hearing that the idea of a registered voter having the vote that they cast discarded \"is anathema to the democratic system and simply cannot be tolerated.\u201d",
      "The dismissed protests last week also originated from three Republican legislative candidates trailing in their respective General Assembly races. Appeals of scores of additional protests also filed by Griffin and the legislative candidates \u2014 but were first considered by county boards \u2014 are set to be heard Friday by the State Board of Elections. The AP has not called two of these races.",
      "Once protests are exhausted for General Assembly candidates, their recourse is not to go to court but to formally ask the General Assembly chamber itself to decide who won the seat they are seeking.",
      "In one of the seats, Republican state Rep. Frank Sossamon trails Democratic challenger Bryan Cohn by about 230 votes. A Cohn victory would mean Republicans fall one seat short of retaining their current veto-proof majority starting next month."

      "North Korea demonstrated this year that it could produce ballistic missiles and supply them to Russia for use against Ukraine in a matter of months",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- North Korea demonstrated this year that it could produce ballistic missiles and supply them to Russia for use against Ukraine in a matter of months, the head of a research organization that traces weapons used in the war said Wednesday.",
      "Jonah Leff told the U.N. Security Council that researchers on the ground examined remnants of four missiles from North Korea recovered in Ukraine in July and August, including one that had marks indicating it was produced in 2024.",
      "\u201cThis is the first public evidence of missiles having been produced in North Korea and then used in Ukraine within a matter of months, not years,\u201d he said.",
      "Leff also had briefed the Security Council in late June, telling members that the organization he heads, Conflict Armament Research, had \u201cirrefutably\u201d established that ballistic missile remnants found in Ukraine early this year were from a missile manufactured in North Korea.",
      "The U.K.-based organization, which was established in 2011 to document and trace weapons used in conflicts to assist governments in countering diversion and proliferation, has worked in Ukraine since 2018.",
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed his country would \u201cinvariably support\u201d Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine when he met Russia\u2019s defense chief in late November, the North\u2019s state media reported.",
      "Russia\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia objected to the second appearance of Leff at the council meeting, chaired by Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield of the United States, which holds the council\u2019s rotating presidency this month.",
      "He claimed Leff represents NATO and the European Union, and questioned whether his organization could provide impartial assessments. And he accused Thomas-Greenfield of violating Security Council practices and transforming its meetings \u201cinto a politicized act of buffoonery.\u201d",
      "The U.S. ambassador retorted that Russia had vetoed a resolution that ended the monitoring of sanctions against North Korea by U.N. experts, which she said makes organizations like Conflict Armament Research and its independent, well-regarded experts all the more critical.",
      "She said its reports show why Russia was determined to block the renewal of the mandate for the U.N. experts. Russia and North Korea \u201care engaging in unlawful arms transfers and training, in brazen violation of numerous council resolutions,\" Thomas-Greenfield said.",
      "Leff stood by the organization's research and said its analysis highlights three observations about North Korea\u2019s missile activities.",
      "It confirms the continued use of freshly manufactured North Korean ballistic missiles in Ukraine, he said, and the discovery of the 2024 manufacturing mark on one missile reveals the very short period between the production of these ballistic missiles, their transfer and eventual use in Ukraine.",
      "Leff also said the presence of recently produced missile components not from North Korea, some bearing 2023 production marks, \u201cillustrates North Korea\u2019s robust acquisition network for its ballistic missile program, despite U.N. sanctions prohibiting the transfer of this material for military purpose.\u201d",
      "North Korea\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Kim Song insisted that its relationship with Russia is \u201ca positive contribution to international peace and security and can by no means be subject of the criticism.\u201d",
      "He accused the United States and its allies of inciting \u201cconfrontation and discord among nations,\u201d by intervening militarily across the planet and providing Ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid, including long-range weapons."

    "summary": "For more than a decade, farmers in parts of southwest Georgia haven&rsquo;t been able to drill new irrigation wells to the Floridian aquifer",
    "story": [
      "For more than a decade, farmers in parts of southwest Georgia haven\u2019t been able to drill new irrigation wells to the Floridian aquifer",
      "ATLANTA -- Jason Cox, who grows peanuts and cotton in southwest Georgia, says farming would be economically impossible without water to irrigate his crops.",
      "\u201cI'd be out of business,\u201d said Cox, who farms 3,000 acres (1,200 hectares) acres around Pelham.",
      "For more than a decade, farmers in parts of southwest Georgia haven't been able to drill new irrigation wells to the Floridian aquifer, the groundwater nearest the surface. That's because Georgia put a halt to farmers drilling wells or taking additional water from streams and lakes in 2012.",
      "Farmers like Cox, though, will get a chance to drill new wells beginning in April. Gov. Brian Kemp announced Wednesday that Georgia's Environmental Protection Division will begin accepting applications for new agricultural wells in areas along the lower Flint River starting April 1.",
      "Jeff Cown, the division's director, said in a statement that things have changed since 2012. The moratorium was imposed amid a parching drought and the collapse of the once-prolific oyster fishery in Florida's Apalachicola Bay.",
      "The state of Florida sued in 2013, arguing that Georgia's overuse of water from the Flint was causing negative impacts downstream where the Flint and Chattahoochee River join to become the Apalachicola River. But a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court in 2021 rejected the lawsuit, saying Florida hadn't proved its case that water use by Flint River farmers was at fault.",
      "That was one lawsuit in decades of sprawling litigation that mostly focused on fear that Atlanta\u2019s ever-growing population would suck up all the upstream water and leave little for uses downstream. The suits include the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint system and the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa system, which flows out of Georgia to drain much of Alabama. Georgia also won victories guaranteeing that metro Atlanta had rights to water from the Chattahoochee River's Lake Lanier to quench its thirst.",
      "Georgia officials say new water withdrawals won't disregard conservation. No new withdrawals from streams or lakes will be allowed. And new wells will have to stop sucking up water from the Floridian aquifer when a drought gets too bad, in part to protect water levels in the Flint, where endangered freshwater mussels live. New wells will also be required to be connected to irrigation systems that waste less water and can be monitored electronically, according to a November presentation posted by the environmental agency.",
      "In a statement, Cown said the plans \"support existing water users, including farmers, and set the stage to make room for new ones. We look forward to working with all water users as they obtain these newly, developed permits.\u201d",
      "Georgia had already been taking baby steps in this direction by telling farmers they could withdraw water to spray vulnerable crops like blueberries during freezing temperatures.",
      "Flint Riverkeeper Gordon Rogers, who heads the environmental organization of the same name, said Georgia's action is \u201cgood news.\u201d He has long contended that the ban on new withdrawals was \u201can admission of failure,\" showing how Georgia had mismanaged water use along the river. But he said investments in conservation are paying off: Many farmers are installing less wasteful irrigators and some agreed to stop using existing shallow wells during drought in exchange for subsidies to drill wells to deeper aquifers that don't directly influence river flow.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is make it more efficient, make it more equitable and make it more fair,\" Rogers said. \"And we\u2019re in the middle of doing that.\u201d",
      "A lawyer for Florida environmental groups that contend the Apalachicola River and Bay are being harmed declined comment in an email. Representatives for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and state Attorney General Ashley Moody did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Cox, who lives about 165 miles (265 kilometers) south of Atlanta, said he's interested in drilling a new well on some land that he owns. Right now, that land relies on water from a neighboring farmer's well.",
      "He knows the drought restrictions would mean there would be times he couldn't water his crops, but said data he's seen show there wouldn't have been many days over the last 10 years when he would have been barred from irrigating, and that most of those days wouldn't have been during peak watering times for his crops.",
      "Three years ago, Cox drilled a well for some land into a deeper aquifer, but he said even spending $30,000 or more on a shallower well would boost the productivity and value of his land.",
      "\u201cIt would enhance my property if I had a well myself,\" Cox said."

    "summary": "Arizona's governor wants to repeal the state law requiring an annual abortion report",
    "story": [
      "Arizona's governor wants to repeal the state law requiring an annual abortion report",
      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs is calling for legislators to repeal the state law that requires an annual abortion report, saying that it infringes on patients' privacy, which echoes other Democratic officials' push to reduce or eliminate such requirements.",
      "\u201cThe government has no place in surveilling Arizonans\u2019 medical decision-making or tracking their health history,\u201d Hobbs, a Democrat in a state where Republicans control the Legislature, said in a statement Wednesday as the state released its report covering 2023. \u201cStarting a family is a sensitive and personal experience for a woman and her loved ones; there should be no room for government surveillance and publication of that decision.\u201d",
      "Hobbs is not the only one concerned about the collection of abortion data, especially as Donald Trump prepares to take over as president again, when he could implement policies that are hostile, or at least less favorable, to abortion rights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really worth thinking carefully about the risk and the benefit of collecting data in this new environment,\u201d said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a researcher at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights and does its own voluntary surveys of abortion providers.",
      "A handful of Democratic-controlled states have reduced reporting requirements in recent years out of concern about privacy and also considering the burden it puts on providers to collect it all. Republican-run states generally ask for a lot, though many of them have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy or after roughly the first six weeks, before many people know they're pregnant.",
      "Michigan just released 2023 abortion data but is not collecting it at all going forward. Illinois has switched to aggregate reporting instead of requiring providers to send information about each individual abortion. Minnesota has reduced the number of questions they require to be tallied, eliminating data on marital status, race and ethnicity, among others.",
      "New York City has also cut back on asking the patient demographics questions.",
      "Abortion access has been shifting around the country since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion.",
      "Starting in the months before the Supreme Court ruling was released, the Society of Family Planning, which advocates for abortion rights, launched regular surveys of abortion providers about their work and has generally released the results quarterly. One of the lead researchers, University of California, San Francisco, public health social scientist Ushma Upadhyay, said the next report won't come out as soon as it otherwise might have.",
      "\u201cWe are delaying our next release to give providers time to adjust to the tenor of the new administration,\u201d she said, noting that she hopes providers continue to participate in the survey.",
      "Over the past two years, the report has shown that while abortions have become rare in the states where bans are in place, they've increased slightly overall as people travel for procedures or obtain pills via telemedicine.",
      "Arizona's policy changes have been more turbulent than most. Providers stopped offering abortions in 2022 amid legal questions about whether an 1864 ban on nearly all abortions was valid, then resumed them. Earlier this year, the state Supreme Court ruled that the old law could be enforced, but then put the start of enforcement on hold. Before it took effect, the state \u2014 aided by some GOP lawmakers joining Democrats \u2014 repealed the old law. And in November, voters added a right to abortion to the state constitution.",
      "The Arizona data made public on Wednesday reflects the policy changes \u2014 with the state going from just under 14,000 abortions in 2021 to 11,400 in 2022 to 12,700 last year. The 2024 numbers are not in the state's report, which is published by the Department of Health Services.",
      "The report began with voluntary participation from licensed providers in 1976 and became mandatory in 2010. The state collects detailed information, including whether minors have parental consent, as well as the age, marital status, and race and ethnicity of the patient. It also reports how many previous abortions and live births the patient has had, how far along in pregnancy she was, and whether the abortion involved a procedure or pills. But the data does not include the patient's name, address, birthdate or Social Security number.",
      "For years, four states with generally expansive abortion rights laws have skipped participating in the federal government's roundup of state data. California and Maryland don't collect the data. New Hampshire and New Jersey make it voluntary for hospitals and other providers to supply it.",
      "Rachel Rebouche, dean of the Temple University Beasley School of Law and an abortion law scholar, said states don't need to know personal information such as the name and address of people who receive abortions. And while it's useful to report basic information about abortion, she said, there are risks for abortion rights advocates, particularly in the reports from states with bans where the data mostly shows how often abortions are provided through exceptions.",
      "\u201cThe tension we find ourselves in is patient privacy,\u201d she said, \u201cbut also the looming allegation that exceptions are being misused.\u201d"

(AP) \u2014 Dennis Hernandez, the troubled brother of the late New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, pleaded guilty Wednesday to threatening to carry out a shooting at the University of Connecticut and to kill three people outside of the state, including a judge, in 2023, federal prosecutors said.",
      "Hernandez, 38, who went by \u201cDJ\u201d while playing football for UConn in the mid-2000s, appeared in federal court in Hartford and pleaded guilty to transmitting interstate communications containing a threat to injure, which carries up to five years in prison.

Dennis Hernandez was shocked with a stun gun and taken into custody after he came out of his sister's house with his arms raised, yelling \u201cshoot me\" and threatening to harm officers, police said.",

      "NEW YORK -- New York prosecutors are using a 9/11-era anti-terrorism law in their case against the man charged with gunning down UnitedHealthcare's CEO outside a midtown Manhattan hotel.",
      "Luigi Mangione was indicted on charges of murder as an act of terrorism, under a state law that allows for stiffer sentences when a killing is aimed at terrifying civilians or influencing government.",
      "If it sounds like an unusual application of a terrorism law, it\u2019s not the first time the statute has been applied to a case that wasn't about cross-border extremism or a plot to kill masses of people.",

Essentially an add-on to existing criminal statutes, it says that an underlying offense constitutes \u201ca crime of terrorism\u201d if it's done \u201cwith intent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policy of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion or affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder, assassination or kidnapping.\u201d",
      "If a defendant is convicted, the \u201ccrime of terrorism\u201d designation boosts the underlying offense into a more serious sentencing category. For example, an assault normally punishable by up to 25 years in prison would carry a potential life sentence.",

      "New York does not have the death penalty. The state's highest court threw out a capital punishment law in 2004.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg put it simply: \u201cThe intent was to sow terror.\" The Democratic prosecutor noted that the shooting unfolded early on a workday in a heavily trafficked business and tourist area, and he mentioned Mangione's writings, while declining to get more specific.",
      "When arrested, the 26-year-old was carrying a handwritten letter that called health insurance companies \u201cparasitic\u201d and complained about corporate greed, according to a law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch has said Mangione also was carrying a gun that matched shell casings at the crime scene. Investigators say ammunition found near Thompson\u2019s body bore the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d mimicking a phrase some people use to decry insurers' practices.",
      "Deputy Commissioner Rebecca Weiner said the reaction to Thompson's killing shows it fits within a law against violence designed to intimidate a civilian population.",
      "The shooting prompted a wave of public criticism of the health insurance industry. Much of it is people sharing stories and frustration, but there also have been \u201cwanted\u201d posters targeting other health care honchos. Concerned companies have taken top executives' biographies offline, canceled in-person shareholder meetings and even told employees to work from home temporarily.",
      "His New York attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, has declined to comment.",
      "State lawmakers passed it in 2001, six days after the Sept. 11 attacks, saying the state needed \"legislation that is specifically designed to combat the evils of terrorism\" and that wasn't just for federal courts. Then-state Sen. Michael Balboni, who was among the law's leading proponents, recalls pointing out that many cases could come via state and local law enforcement officers, who far outnumbered federal agents in New York.",
      "Many other states passed similar laws around the same time, and Congress approved the Patriot Act.",
      "There's no comprehensive count of cases where the anti-terrorism statute was used, because it can be layered onto many different types of charges, from weapons possession to murder.",
      "The specific first-degree murder \u201cin furtherance of an act of terrorism\u201d charge against Mangione has been the top count in only three other cases statewide, according to the Division of Criminal Justice Services.",
      "In New York City alone, over a half-dozen cases of various sorts have used the terror law, starting with the 2004 indictment of a Bronx gang member. He was accused of killing a 10-year-old girl and paralyzing a man at a christening party.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors got convictions or guilty pleas in cases including plots to bomb synagogues or open fire on their congregants; a plan to build pipe bombs to try to undermine public support for the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; alleged efforts to recruit support for the Islamic State group and to provide money and knives to Syrian extremists; and a white supremacist who killed a Black man because of racial hatred.",
      "Friedman Agnifilo was a top deputy to Bragg's predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr., when some of those cases were prosecuted.",
      "Lawmakers set the parameters broadly. The law doesn't say that cases have to involve mass casualties or international extremism, Balboni said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re trying to prevent individuals in this country who want to change government and use extremism and violence to that end,\u201d whether what they want to change is foreign policy or health care industry regulation, said.",
      "Courts haven't set out overarching rules for when a case qualifies. However, the state's top court said the Bronx gang member's case did not.",
      "The high court overturned his conviction. Justices were skeptical that the shooting \u2014 allegedly targeting a rival gang member \u2014 was meant to intimidate the broader community. They also worried that the meaning of terrorism could be trivialized if \"applied loosely in situations that do not match our collective understanding of what constitutes a terrorist act.\u201d",
      "The man, who denied involvement in the shooting, was retried on manslaughter and other charges. He was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison.",
      "Yes. The indictment includes another second-degree murder charge that doesn't have the terrorism allegation, as well as eight weapons-possession counts."

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jay-Z\u2019s lawyers asked a judge Wednesday to speedily extract the rapper from a lawsuit in which a woman alleges she was sexually assaulted by Jay-Z and Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs when she was 13.",
      "The unidentified woman recently added Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, to her lawsuit against Combs in Manhattan federal court, alleging that she was attacked by the singers in 2000 after Combs\u2019 limo driver offered her a ride to an MTV Video Music Awards after-party.",
      "In their court filing Wednesday, Jay-Z's lawyers cited a recent television interview in which the woman acknowledged inconsistencies in her story.",
      "The filing came before Combs appeared for a pretrial hearing in his criminal case. After lawyers discussed evidentiary deadlines, prosecutors told Judge Arun Subramanian that any new charges against the hip-hop mogul before a May trial would require minimal new evidence to be shared among lawyers.",
      "In the criminal case, Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that the Bad Boy Records founder coerced and abused women for years with help from associates and employees. Combs, who has been jailed without bail for three months, hugged his lawyers and touched his heart as he acknowledged his children among spectators.",
      "In the civil case, one of several filed against him, the woman originally asserted that she was raped by Combs at the after-party but did not mention Jay-Z.",
      "Last Friday, NBC aired an interview in which she said she spoke with musicians Benji Madden and his brother at the party, and her father picked her up after the alleged assault. NBC also reported that a representative of the Maddens said they were touring the Midwest during the VMAs, and her father said he does not recall what would have been a drive home of more than five hours.",
      "Jay-Z has said the article proves that Tony Buzbee, a personal injury lawyer in Houston, filed a false complaint against him for money and fame. Attorney Teny R. Geragos, representing Combs, has said the TV interview was a part of the \u201cbeginning of the end of this shameful money grab.\u201d",
      "In the newly filed court papers, Jay-Z's lawyers wrote that the allegations \u201chave caused incalculable harm to Mr. Carter, his family, his businesses, his employees, and his legacy.\u201d",
      "Buzzbee told The Associated Press via email that the plaintiffs' lawyers planned to respond in court to the latest filing.",
      "\u201cThey continue to file meritless motions that are contrary to the rules and which have absolutely no merit,\u201d Buzzbee said.",
      "Buzbee announced in October that he represents some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "Jay-Z and Combs gained fame in the 2000s, emerging as wide-ranging entrepreneurs and two of the world\u2019s wealthiest rappers. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated Jay-Z\u2019s net worth to be $2.5 billion.",
      "The artists have collaborated over the years, with Jay-Z featured on Combs\u2019 debut album, \u201cNo Way Out\u201d and Combs appearing on Jay-Z\u2019s sophomore album, \u201cIn My Lifetime, Vol. 1.\u201d"

      "An appeals court says New Jersey\u2019s top law enforcement official overstepped his authority last year when he took control of the police force in the state\u2019s third-largest city soon after Paterson police fatally shot a man barricaded in an apartment bath...",
      "TRENTON, N.J. -- New Jersey's top law enforcement official overstepped his authority last year when he took control of the police force in Paterson, the state's third-largest city, soon after police there fatally shot a man barricaded in an apartment bathroom, an appeals court ruled Wednesday.",
      "The New Jersey Appellate Division said Attorney General Matt Platkin had no authority to \u201csupersede,\u201d or take over, Paterson's police force in March 2023 after the headline-grabbing death of Najee Seabrooks.",
      "The court directed Platkin to return control of the police department to city officials and return Police Chief Engelbert Ribeiro to the city from a police training commission.",
      "\u201cDoes the AG have the authority to directly supersede all operations of a municipal police department without the consent of the municipality?\" the court asked. \u201cWe conclude the answer is no.\u201d",
      "The ruling was put on hold pending appeal, and Platkin vowed to take the case to the state Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply disappointed with today\u2019s ruling,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe are enormously proud of the extraordinary progress the Paterson Police Department has made and we remain deeply committed to Paterson and to the crucial work of making the City safer for all its people.\u201d",
      "The case provides a window into several crosscurrents involving policing, including how Platkin, a Democrat, navigates police accountability issues he's sought to champion. The court's decision also comes as the Biden administration puts other departments under a microscope, including Trenton's, which it said has a pattern and practice of misconduct.",
      "Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh, a fellow Democrat, criticized Platkin's takeover and was part of the lawsuit that prevailed on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThis is a victory for democracy,\u201d Sayegh said in a text message. \u201cWhat Matt Platkin did was unlawful and undemocratic. He disenfranchised Paterson voters to advance his own electoral ambitions.\u201d",
      "The takeover stemmed from a \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d in police in the city, Platkin said last year. Platkin's action came just weeks after Seabrooks' death, though he said no single case led to the takeover.",
      "Police were called to Seabrooks\u2019 brother\u2019s apartment, where he had been holed up in the bathroom. Seabrooks, who was a crisis intervention worker and mentor with the nonprofit Paterson Healing Collective, had called 911 at least seven times and told dispatchers that people were threatening him and he needed immediate help.",
      "Police talked to him through the door, offering to get him water and calling him \u201clove\u201d in one instance. But the tension increased when he told police he was armed with a \u201cpocket rocket\u201d gun and a knife. Police shot Seabrooks when he emerged from the bathroom with a knife, according to the attorney general\u2019s office.",
      "Since the takeover, Platkin placed Isa Abbassi, a 25-year veteran of the New York Police Department, in charge of the department.",
      "Platkin's office said crime in Paterson has diminished since the takeover.",
      "Some activists praised the takeover, including the American Civil Liberties Union, which called it a \u201cwelcome step\u201d because of what it said was the department's history of violent policing. On Wednesday, the group said in a post on X that the court decision threatens to \u201cerode one of the most important tools for police accountability in our state.\u201d",
      "Democratic Assemblymember Benjie Wimberly, who represents the city, said he backed Platkin's appeal.",
      "\u201cThis setback is deeply troubling, especially after nearly two years of concerted efforts and significant investments aimed at strengthening our police department and protecting the people of Paterson,\u201d Wimberly said in a statement.",
      "Paterson has a population of about 160,000 and sits about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan. Its demographics shifted since the middle of the last century when most residents were white. Today, Black residents account for nearly 24% and Hispanics for just over 60% of the population.",
      "As Paterson\u2019s Black population grew, it found itself repeatedly clashing with the city\u2019s white power structure, particularly its police force. Platkin said earlier this year that he wouldn't blame residents for being distrustful of the police.",
      "In the mid-1960s, Paterson was the site of civil unrest between police and Black residents. Paterson was also the inspiration for the 1975 Bob Dylan song \u201cHurricane,\u201d about the boxer Rubin \u201cHurricane\u201d Carter, a Black man who was convicted by an all-white jury in 1967 of killing three white people at a city bar. A federal judge later threw out the conviction, writing that it had been \u201cpredicated upon an appeal to racism rather than reason.\u201d",
      "Since the start of 2019, city police fatally shot four people; two others, including Jameek Lowery, have died after being restrained.",
      "The appeals court's ruling leaves in place Platkin's takeover of the police department's internal affairs unit \u2014 the group charged with investigating the department itself in certain cases. City officials did not challenge the attorney general's takeover of that part of the department."

      "NEW YORK -- A former top aide to New York City Mayor Eric Adams is expected in court Thursday to face corruption charges in the latest blow to an administration beset by searches, resignations and the mayor's own indictment.",
      "Ingrid Lewis-Martin, who resigned Sunday as Adams' chief adviser and one of the most powerful officials in City Hall, is expected to be arraigned Thursday afternoon in state court in Manhattan, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.",
      "The people were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the case and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity. The specific charges against Lewis-Martin were not publicly announced and remain unclear.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and the commissioner of the city's watchdog Department of Investigation, Jocelyn Strauber, have scheduled a news conference for Thursday afternoon. The topic was not announced.",
      "Bragg and Strauber\u2019s offices have been investigating Lewis-Martin. A phone message seeking comment was left with a spokesperson for the district attorney\u2019s office. The Department of Investigation declined comment.",
      "Lewis-Martin's attorney, Arthur Aidala, told reporters this week that she was expected to face criminal charges related to alleged improper gifts.",
      "Lewis-Martin said Monday that she was being \u201cfalsely accused\u201d and that she had \u201cnot made any arrangements in advance to take any gifts or money, or to have any gifts or money given to a family member or friend in order for me to do my job.\u201d",
      "The charges against Lewis-Martin come as the Adams administration has been roiled by criminal investigations.",
      "Adams, a Democrat, has himself been charged with conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery charges in an unrelated federal case scheduled for trial next April. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Lewis-Martin, 63, has been one of the mayor's closest confidants throughout his political career, serving in senior roles under Adams as he ascended the ranks of government in New York over the past nearly two decades. Her most recent post as Adams' chief adviser made her one of the top officials at City Hall.",
      "She has been a target of investigators since at least September, when federal and Manhattan prosecutors met her at an airport in New York as she was getting off a flight from Japan. At the time, federal prosecutors served her with a subpoena while Manhattan prosecutors took her phones and searched her home.",
      "Hours after that search, Lewis-Martin appeared on a radio show hosted by Aidala to discuss the investigation, telling her attorney, \u201cI do believe that in the end that the New York City public will see that we have not done anything illegal to the magnitude or scale that requires the federal government and the DA\u2019s office to investigate us.\u201d",
      "Aidala told reporters on Monday that he believed prosecutors in Manhattan were charging Lewis-Martin to get her to cooperate against Adams. In an unrelated news conference that day, Adams described Lewis-Martin as a \u201clongtime friend and sister.\u201d",
      "Adams was charged in September with accepting luxury travel perks and illegal campaign contributions from a Turkish official and other foreign nationals looking to buy his influence.",
      "The investigation into Adams became public late last year after federal agents searched the home of his top fundraiser, Brianna Suggs. Lewis-Martin has referred to Suggs as her goddaughter.",
      "Since then, the Adams administration has been enveloped by a series of searches and seizures from investigators, leading to the resignations of top officials, including his police commissioner, schools chancellor, multiple deputy mayors and his director of Asian affairs."

    "story": [
      "New filings in a 2022 class-action lawsuit contend that children of the wealthy and connected get special admissions consideration at some elite U.S. universities",
      "Children of the wealthy and connected get special admissions consideration at some elite U.S. universities, according to new filings in a class-action lawsuit originally brought against 17 schools.",
      "Georgetown\u2019s then-president, for example, listed a prospective student on his \u201cpresident\u2019s list\u201d after meeting her and her wealthy father at an Idaho conference known as \u201csummer camp for billionaires,\u201d according to Tuesday court filings in the price-fixing lawsuit filed in Chicago federal court in 2022.",
      "Although it\u2019s always been assumed that such favoritism exists, the filings offer a rare peek at the often secret deliberations of university heads and admissions officials. They show how schools admit otherwise unqualified wealthy children because their parents have connections and could possibly donate large sums down the line, raising questions about fairness.",
      "Stuart Schmill, the dean of admissions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in a 2018 email that the university admitted four out of six applicants recommended by then-board chairman Robert Millard, including two who \u201cwe would really not have otherwise admitted.\u201d The two others were not admitted because they were \u201cnot in the ball park, or the push from him was not as strong.\u201d",
      "In the email, Schmill said Millard was careful to play down his influence on admissions decisions, but he said the chair also sent notes on all six students and later met with Schmill to share insight \u201cinto who he thought was more of a priority.\u201d",
      "The filings are the latest salvo in a lawsuit that claims that 17 of the nation\u2019s most prestigious colleges colluded to reduce the competition for prospective students and drive down the amount of financial aid they would offer, all while giving special preference to the children of wealthy donors.",
      "\u201cThat illegal collusion resulted in the defendants providing far less aid to students than would have been provided in a free market,\u201d said Robert Gilbert, an attorney for the plaintiffs.",
      "Since the lawsuit was filed, 10 of the schools have reached settlements to pay out a total of $284 million, including payments of up to $2,000 to current or former students whose financial aid might have been shortchanged over a period of more than two decades. They are Brown, the University of Chicago, Columbia, Dartmouth, Duke, Emory, Northwestern, Rice, Vanderbilt and Yale.",
      "Johns Hopkins is working on a settlement and the six schools still fighting the lawsuit are the California Institute of Technology, Cornell, Georgetown, MIT, Notre Dame and the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "MIT called the lawsuit and the claims about admissions favoritism baseless.",
      "\u201cMIT has no history of wealth favoritism in its admissions; quite the opposite,\u201d university spokesperson Kimberly Allen said. \u201cAfter years of discovery in which millions of documents were produced that provide an overwhelming record of independence in our admissions process, plaintiffs could cite just a single instance in which the recommendation of a board member helped sway the decisions for two undergraduate applicants.\"",
      "In a statement, Penn also said the case is meritless that the evidence shows that it doesn't favor students whose families have donated or pledged money to the Ivy League school.",
      "\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 whole case is an attempt to embarrass the University about its purported admission practices on issues totally unrelated to this case,\" the school said.",
      "Notre Dame officials also called the case baseless. \u201cWe are confident that every student admitted to Notre Dame is fully qualified and ready to succeed,\u201d a university spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The South Bend, Indiana, school, though, did apparently admit wealthy students with subpar academic backgrounds.",
      "According to the new court filings, Don Bishop, who was then associate vice president for enrollment at Notre Dame, bluntly wrote about the \u201cspecial interest\u201d admits in a 2012 email, saying that year's crop had poorer academic records than the previous year's.",
      "The 2012 group included 38 applicants who were given a \u201cvery low\u201d academic rating, Bishop wrote. He said those students represented \u201cmassive allowances to the power of the family connections and funding history,\u201d adding that \u201cwe allowed their high gifting or potential gifting to influence our choices more this year than last year.\u201d",
      "The final line of his email: \u201cSure hope the wealthy next year raise a few more smart kids!\u201d",
      "Some of the examples pointed to in this week's court filings showed that just being able to pay full tuition would give students an advantage. During a deposition, a former Vanderbilt admissions director said that in some cases, a student would get an edge on the waitlist if they didn\u2019t need financial aid.",
      "The 17 schools were part of a decades-old group that got permission from Congress to come up with a shared approach to awarding financial aid. Such an arrangement might otherwise violate antitrust laws, but Congress allowed it as long as the colleges all had need-blind admissions policies, meaning they wouldn't consider a student\u2019s financial situation when deciding who gets in.",
      "The lawsuit argues that many colleges claimed to be need-blind but routinely favored the children of alumni and donors. In doing so, the suit says, the colleges violated the Congressional exemption and tainted the entire organization.",
      "The group dissolved in recent years when the provision allowing the collaboration expired.",

      "The Washington and U.S. Departments of Agriculture announced the eradication Wednesday, saying there had been no detections of the northern giant hornet in Washington since 2021.",
      "The news represented an enormous success that included residents agreeing to place traps on their properties and reporting sightings, as well as researchers capturing a live hornet, attaching a tiny radio tracking tag to it with dental floss, and following it through a forest to a nest in an alder tree. Scientists destroyed the nest just as a number of queens were just beginning to emerge, officials said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve gotta tell you, as an entomologist \u2014 I\u2019ve been doing this for over 25 years now, and it is a rare day when the humans actually get to win one against the insects,\" Sven Spichiger, pest program manager of the Washington State Department of Agriculture, told a virtual news conference.",
      "The hornets, which can be 2 inches (5 cm) long and were formerly called Asian giant hornets, gained attention in 2013, when they killed 42 people in China and seriously injured 1,675. In the U.S., around 72 people a year die from bee and hornet stings each year, according to data from the National Institutes of Health.",
      "The hornets were first detected in North America in British Columbia, Canada, in August 2019 and confirmed in Washington state in December 2019, when a Whatcom County resident reported a specimen. A beekeeper also reported hives being attacked and turned over specimens in the summer of 2020. The hornets could have traveled to North America in plant pots or shipping containers, experts said.",
      "DNA evidence suggested the populations found in British Columbia and Washington were not related and appeared to originate from different countries. There also have been no confirmed reports in British Columbia since 2021, and the nonprofit Invasive Species Centre in Canada has said the hornet is also considered eradicated there.",
      "Northern giant hornets pose significant threats to pollinators and native insects. They can wipe out a honey bee hive in as little as 90 minutes, decapitating the bees and then defending the hive as their own, taking the brood to feed their own young.",
      "The hornet can sting through most beekeeper suits, deliver nearly seven times the amount of venom as a honey bee, and sting multiple times. At one point the Washington agriculture department ordered special reinforced suits from China.",
      "Washington is the only state that has had confirmed reports of northern giant hornets. Trappers found four nests in 2020 and 2021.",
      "Spichiger said Washington will remain on the lookout, despite reporting the eradication. He noted that entomologists will continue to monitor traps in Kitsap County, where a resident reported an unconfirmed sighting in October but where trapping efforts and public outreach have come up empty.",
      "He noted that other invasive hornets can also pose problems: Officials in Georgia and South Carolina are fighting yellow-legged hornets, and southern giant hornets were recently detected in Spain.",
      "\u201cWe will continue to be vigilant,\u201d Spichiger said."

      "According to investigators, Fisherman helped twins Alon and Oren Alexander rape a woman on Dec. 31, 2016.

      "NEW YORK -- Billionaire author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott acknowledged another $2 billion in donations in a blog post on Wednesday, bringing the total she\u2019s given away since 2019 to $19.2 billion.",
      "She also revealed new information about how she was managing her wealth, saying she had directed advisors to invest her funds into \u201cmission-aligned ventures.\u201d Most of the grants she made in 2024, she said, went to bolstering economic security and opportunities..",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve asked the investment team helping me manage the assets I\u2019m working to give away to source funds and companies focused on for-profit solutions to these challenges,\u201d Scott wrote. That is in contrast to \u201cwithdrawing funds from a bank account, or from a stock portfolio that increases the wealth and influence of leaders who already have it.\u201d",
      "Most of Scott's wealth comes from shares of Amazon that she received when she divorced the company\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos. Forbes estimates her current wealth to be $31.7 billion, even after giving away her money for five years.",
      "Gabrielle Fitzgerald, founder and CEO of The Panorama Group, has researched Scott's giving and provided advice and support for nonprofits who have received Scott's gifts. She said she sees a growing focus in Scott's giving on issues of poverty.",
      "\u201cShe is creating an amazing role model for philanthropists, although I don\u2019t see very many that have followed her role modeling,\" Fitzgerald said. \"But it really shows that it\u2019s easy to give away a lot of money to good groups.\u201d",
      "In announcing the gifts on her Yield Giving website, Scott mulled over the meaning of \u201cinvesting,\u201d writing that it \"seems to have undergone a kind of semantic shriveling. On the list of its big, beautiful, original definitions? To devote resources for a useful purpose. To endow with rights. To clothe.\u201d",
      "Scott, who does not comment on her giving beyond the rare post on her website, has shaken up the nonprofit sector with her embrace of \u201ctrust-based philanthropy,\u201d providing big grants with no strings attached to over 2,450 nonprofits.",
      "In 2024, she also gave repeat gifts to several organizations \u2014 something of a new development in her giving, which has set a high bar for how much and how fast megadonors can give. Two organizations, CAMFED, which supports girls education in Africa, and Undue Medical Debt, which was formerly called RIP Medical Debt, both got third donations from Scott this year.",
      "Grantees say that when Scott's team notifies them of grants they say not to expect additional support. So it was a surprise for Shaun Donovan, CEO of the affordable housing organization Enterprise Community Partners, when he got the news of a second, major donation.",
      "\u201cI was taking my luggage off the security screener at LaGuardia Airport and my phone rang and I was told that MacKenzie Scott was awarding us another $65 million,\u201d Donovan said in an interview in November.",
      "His organization had received $50 million from Scott in 2020, making them one of the nonprofits that has received the most funding from Scott, based on grant data made public on Yield Giving. About 500 organizations have not disclosed the amount of funding they've received from Scott.",
      "\u201cWe were not expecting their second gift. Every time they award this funding, they\u2019re very clear that organizations should not expect it,\u201d Donovan said, adding his advice is, \u201cReally treat it that way. Don\u2019t use it for regular operating expenses. Don\u2019t use it for things that will create a cliff or a hole in your budget for your organization.\u201d",
      "This year was already a standout in Scott's giving because it was the first time that she awarded grants through an application process. In March, she announced the recipients of an \u201copen call\u201d for applications from nonprofits. She surprised recipients by awarding more money to more organizations than she had initially promised, committing $640 million to more than 360 nonprofits.",
      "In one measure of the demand for the large and unrestricted grants she makes, 6,353 nonprofits applied through the nonprofit Lever for Change, which ran the \u201copen call\u201d for Scott. Ultimately, 279 nonprofits were awarded $2 million, while 82 organizations received $1 million each. Previously, organizations have said they've responded to questions from an anonymous donor who turned out to be Scott or just received an email or cold call without any application at all.",
      "The fact that her grants are unrestricted, meaning that nonprofits can use them however they want to further their charitable purpose, is part of what makes them so valuable, Donovan said. Five years into her philanthropic blitz, he said it's now possible to see her impact across whole sectors.",
      "\u201cThe scale of this giving has really not just changed individual organizations but changed entire fields like affordable housing,\u201d he said.",

      "President Joe Biden used his pardon power on Thursday as the Constitution\u2019s framers had intended: as a pre-Christmas act of mercy. He commuted the sentences of nearly 1,500 people who were released to home confinement during the pandemic and whom the president believes have successfully readjusted into society. He pardoned 39 others convicted of nonviolent crimes, such as drug offenses, following a case-by-case review of their applications.",
      "This is a stark contrast to Mr. Biden\u2019s ill-considered pardon of his son Hunter and to the misguided notion, still under discussion within the White House, of preemptive pardons for people who might be at risk of vindictive prosecution by President-elect Donald Trump. Though Mr. Biden has the prerogative to confer broad immunity with what are sometimes called safe harbor or protective pardons, doing so now on a large scale would be difficult to achieve, at least with any principled consistency. And it would unavoidably imply that any beneficiary broke the law in zealous pursuit of Mr. Trump. Perhaps most worrying, it would create a precedent that future presidents would use to justify their own misuses of the pardon power.",
      "To be sure, Democratic fears of retribution from Mr. Trump rose when the president-elect announced his intention to install as FBI director Kash Patel, who published a 60-person enemies list in a book last year and has pledged to pursue vengeance against critics of the incoming president. Pam Bondi, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, said on Fox News last year: \u201cThe prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones.\u201d Adding a sense of urgency to the debate, Mr. Trump said Sunday on NBC that members of the House committee that investigated Jan. 6, 2021, \u201ccommitted a major crime\u201d and \u201cshould go to jail.\u201d Names reportedly under consideration for preemptive pardons include retired Gen. Mark A. Milley, Anthony S. Fauci and former congresswoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyoming).",
      "And yet one reason not to grant them pardons is that alternative protections remain available to possible targets. Lawmakers such as Ms. Cheney are protected by the Constitution\u2019s speech or debate clause, which prohibits the prosecution of a lawmaker for fulfilling their legislative duties. Juries, judges and appellate courts could halt potential miscarriages of justice. The court of public opinion also counts; Republicans will defend their narrow House majority in 2026.",
      "Imagine what might happen if senior administration officials presumed that they would get pardons at the end of every administration. Border Patrol agents could be told they would get away with assaulting migrants. A president could direct an aide to lie under oath to Congress. President Gerald Ford granted his predecessor, Richard M. Nixon, a preemptive pardon after Nixon\u2019s resignation. The blanket pardon probably cost Ford the election two years later \u2014 but history has looked upon it with kinder eyes because it helped the nation heal after Watergate.",
      "In that sense, Ford\u2019s pardon of Nixon is an exception that proves the rule. With sweeping preemptive pardons, however, Mr. Biden would \u2014 in the eyes of roughly half the electorate \u2014 be protecting his cronies from accountability. This would deepen the feeling, exacerbated by the Hunter Biden pardon, that there\u2019s a two-tier system of justice.",
      "And for all that, even the broadest presidential pardon couldn\u2019t fully protect someone Mr. Trump was determined to harass. His IRS could engage in selective audits. The Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division could scrutinize someone\u2019s business. Without the protection of the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination, congressional Republicans could subpoena beneficiaries of the pardons. The hearings that followed would be perjury traps \u2014 and Mr. Biden\u2019s pardons could not cover future crimes. Conservative prosecutors in Republican-run states could try to contrive local charges.",
      "If he follows this course, Mr. Biden will be doing something that Mr. Trump opted not to do when he left office in January 2021 \u2014 at a time when few conceived of his return to the presidency four years later. Mr. Trump considered pardoning himself and his adult children. At least half a dozen Republican members of Congress who were involved in the plot to overturn the 2020 election had also sought preemptive pardons, including then-Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Florida), according to the Jan. 6 committee.",
      "But, on the final Saturday before Mr. Trump left office, White House attorneys convinced him that issuing broad pardons would signal the appearance of guilt, make him more vulnerable to reprisals and increase the odds that Senate Republicans would vote to convict him during his second impeachment trial. This is one case in which Mr. Biden would be well advised to follow Mr. Trump\u2019s example.",

      "Politicians prattle on endlessly about their love for small business, as opposed to the corporate giants it\u2019s easy to denounce. Yet when they get the chance, they saddle small business with laws like the Corporate Transparency Act. A federal court in Texas has handed Donald Trump and the Republican Party an opportunity by imposing a nationwide injunction on the CTA\u2019s reporting mandate.",
      "In 2020 Congress tucked the CTA into the National Defense Authorization Act in the last days of the Trump Administration and it passed over Mr. Trump\u2019s veto. The intent was to combat money launderers and drug dealers. But the result, says the National Federation of Independent Business, is a bill that imposes another compliance burden, makes confidential business data less secure, and does little to deter real criminals.",
      "The law took effect last Jan. 1. It requires corporations or limited liability companies of fewer than 20 employees and $5 million or less in revenue to disclose details about their beneficial owners to the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Failure to comply can result in up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine.",
      "The law defines a beneficial owner as any person who \u201cdirectly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise\u2014(i) exercises substantial control over the entity; or (ii) owns or controls not less than 25 percent of the ownership interests of the entity.\u201d FinCEN estimates the law applies to 32.6 million small businesses and associations.",
      "But the Dec. 3 order by federal Judge Amos Mazzant enjoins FinCEN from enforcing the law as well as its implementing regulations. The judge calls the law \u201cunprecedented\u201d as a federal attempt to monitor companies created under state law and because it ends the anonymity many states designed as a feature of their corporate formation. The plaintiffs, he wrote, are likely to succeed on their claim that the law is unconstitutional.",
      "What\u2019s next? The Biden Administration has asked the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for a stay of Judge Mazzant\u2019s injunction. It also wants the appellate court to rule by Dec. 27, so that businesses would still have to meet the reporting deadline of Dec. 31.",
      "The Fifth Circuit could throw out the CTA on grounds Judge Mazzant lays out, but other courts are split. A federal judge in Alabama has ruled the CTA unconstitutional, while federal judges in Oregon and Virginia made preliminary rulings going the other way. The cases could go to the Supreme Court.",
      "But Congress needn\u2019t wait for courts to remove this looming burden from millions of small businesses. This is the kind of unnecessary regulation that Republicans campaigned to stop. A one-year delay is already under consideration as an amendment to the year-end spending bill being debated in Congress. Congress can adopt this amendment, deliver relief to small business, and give the courts the time they need to resolve this mess.",

      "Bashar al-Assad is safely ensconced in Russia, which had long supported his prison state with arms, fighter jets, and forces from the mercenary Wagner Group.",
      "Meanwhile the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebel group, which led a lightning strike into Damascus, leading to the collapse of Assad\u2019s government over the weekend, has taken control of the presidential palace and of the regime\u2019s notorious prisons \u2014 freeing prisoners, most of them political prisoners, and exposing what amount to the torture chambers within.",
      "So the joy in the streets as statues of the fallen dictator and his father are pulled down is real. The hopes of some of the thousands of displaced Syrians already flooding across the border to return home are also real. Some 6.2 million Syrians have fled their country during the civil war, according to the United Nations.",
      "But we have seen it all before \u2014 more than a decade ago during what came to be known as the Arab Spring, which turned out to be less of a turning point in democratizing the region and more of a reason for autocrats and terrorists to divide and conquer.",
      "Whether Syria can somehow become a functioning nation state is still very much in question. It could yet succumb to chaos or infighting among triumphant rebels. But this moment represents an opportunity for the United States and the international community to reach out, to engage, and to help free Syria from the more cynical ambitions of Assad\u2019s patrons in Iran and Russia.",
      "Ultimately Syria\u2019s future will be in Syria\u2019s hands. But constructive engagement isn\u2019t out of the question.",
      "HTS and its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, a veteran of Al-Qaeda, have long been on the US terrorist and terrorist organization lists. But upon rolling into Damascus al-Golani dropped that nom de guerre and started using his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa. Symbolic, yes, but he has, US officials agree, been saying all the right things \u2014 a process of \u201crehabilitation\u201d he embarked on years ago.",
      "HTS, for example, announced an amnesty for members of the rank and file of the Assad government, and a general amnesty for military conscripts, many of whom shed their uniforms as the rebels approached the capital. But al-Sharaa also made clear in the statement that this did not extend to senior officials.",
      "\u201cWe will not relent in holding accountable the criminals, murderers, and security and military officers involved in torturing the Syrian people,\u201d he said in a statement posted on Telegram.",
      "Coincidentally the Justice Department announced the unsealing of an indictment Monday of two high-ranking members of Assad\u2019s government, charging them with war crimes against American citizens and others. Both military officials, now missing, were accused of leading efforts to detain, torture, and imprison Syrians.",
      "As HTS forces attempt to take over many of the normal functions of government in the areas it controls \u2014 patrolling streets and government buildings (including the newly vacated presidential palace), a caretaker government, headed by a HTS loyalist, was named to lead a transitional government until March.",
      "That\u2019s certainly a start. Meanwhile, other rebel factions \u2014 ranging from pro-democracy Kurds to the terrorist group Islamic State \u2014 continue to jostle for control in other parts of the country. Israel continues to launch bombing raids of Assad\u2019s chemical weapons plants, naval vessels, and Russian-made bombers, which the Israeli government says it is doing to prevent those military assets from falling into the wrong hands amid the chaos. And while Turkey is facilitating the return of Syrian refugees, it\u2019s also keeping a wary eye on the Kurds in Syria\u2019s north, whom President Recep Tayyip Erdogan considers a security threat to his government \u2014 although they are allied with and trained by US forces, also in the region.",
      "Yes, it\u2019s complicated.",
      "Those US forces, about 1,000 Special Operations troops, concentrated in the northeastern and central parts of Syria, continue to conduct airstrikes in the wake of Assad\u2019s departure to keep Islamic State forces in check.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re clear-eyed about the fact that ISIS will try to take advantage of any vacuum to re-establish its capability, to create a safe haven,\u201d President Biden said Sunday. \u201cWe will not let that happen.\u201d",
      "But Biden\u2019s days are numbered and the message from President-elect Trump last week was hardly encouraging. \u201cTHIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED,\u201d he wrote in a social media post.",
      "It\u2019s consistent with his 2019 withdrawal of most American troops from Syria \u2014 except for those Special Forces now on the ground.",
      "But Trump might also be wise to relearn the lessons from the US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, which he also initiated \u2014 and then roundly criticized Biden for following through on \u2014 complete with its disastrous consequences. A US military presence, however small, can make a difference, and American diplomats can help promote stability and democracy in the country while sidelining extremist groups.",
      "Restoring diplomatic ties between the United States and Damascus and possibly removing al-Sharaa from the terrorist list are still a long way off. But that is precisely the kind of constructive engagement that could \u2014 if earned by a new Syrian government \u2014 change the tide in this particularly fraught region. Conversely, it would hardly be in American interests to \u201cnot get involved\u201d if that opens the door for Islamic State to regain a foothold in Syria.",
      "That the rebel victory represents a setback for Assad\u2019s backers, Russia, Iran, and its client Hezbollah makes it good news \u2014 at least for now. Under the theory that \u201cthe enemy of my enemy is my friend,\u201d there is far more to be gained by building toward a new relationship than by giving this new government a diplomatic cold shoulder.",

      "The battle to change the terms of the Murdochs\u2019 irrevocable family trust is very much an internal family affair. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s six children share equal stakes in the family trust, but his youngest daughters, Chloe and Grace, lack voting rights. For now, Mr Murdoch holds ultimate control, with voting power split between him and his four eldest children. After his death, it had been assumed that they would each get one vote and would have to work out the division of labour between themselves.",
      "The trust controls the Murdoch empire, split between Fox \u2013 home to the TV news network accused of rightwing bias and false reporting as well as its broadcast and cable business \u2013 and News Corp, which owns US titles such as the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post; the Times and the Sun in the UK; and more than half of Australia\u2019s biggest dailies.",
      "At the centre of the struggle is Fox News, a $20bn media behemoth central to US conservative politics and Donald Trump\u2019s rise. Mr Murdoch, and Lachlan, pushed Fox sharply rightward, alienating Lachlan\u2019s siblings and leading to a $790m defamation settlement over election falsehoods. Mr Murdoch\u2019s younger son, James, who had been passed over in favour of Lachlan, takes the hardest line against Fox.",
      "In April 2023, Mr Murdoch\u2019s children began planning for his death, spurred by an episode of HBO\u2019s Succession \u2013 a thinly veiled take on their own family \u2013 where a patriarch\u2019s death sparks chaos. Alarmed by the parallels, Elisabeth\u2019s team drafted a \u201cSuccession memo\u201d to avoid art becoming reality. But Lachlan, and his father, moved to head off the proposals by seeking to amend the trust to cement his primacy. Dubbed, ironically, \u201cProject Family Harmony\u201d, it labelled James as the \u201ctroublesome beneficiary\u201d. In a Reno courtroom, a probate commissioner found Mr Murdoch had acted in \u201c bad faith \u201d.",
      "Mr Murdoch will appeal, but the cost is clear: further estrangement from three of his children. Only Lachlan attended his summer wedding to his fifth wife. Mr Murdoch may fail to amend the trust. That would raise the stakes, posthumously. Lachlan might try to buy out his siblings; James and Elisabeth could push to reshape or dismantle Fox News. Selling assets could end tensions but dismantle the legacy Mr Murdoch built \u2013 one in which personal ambition and corporate control are entwined.",

      "The St. Louis Post-Dispatch on a burgeoning industry of untraceable weapons",
      "The murder last week of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan has spotlighted the fury that many Americans feel toward the nation\u2019s dysfunctional health insurance system. It has also tapped a profane undercurrent in national discourse today that makes otherwise rational people think it\u2019s acceptable to express such fury with dehumanizing jokes and memes about the violent taking of a life.",
      "What isn\u2019t getting enough attention, but should, is the alleged instrument of that violence.",
      "Murder suspect Luigi Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania carrying a \u201cghost gun\u201d that authorities believe was the murder weapon. It\u2019s part of a burgeoning industry of untraceable weapons that Congress should have cracked down on years ago \u2014 but that, thanks to congressional paralysis on any issue addressing gun violence, might soon enjoy expanded federal protection.",
      "America\u2019s federal gun laws are woefully inadequate, as proven by our worst-in-the-advanced-world firearms death rates, but there are some current restrictions that help.",
      "Firearms manufacturers are required to stamp each new gun with a serial number. Acquisition and transfer records are required when the weapon is sold and resold. Criminal background checks are required for any gun purchase made through a federally licensed dealer. All of it is designed to both prevent gun violence and to aid police in tracking down perpetrators of violence when it happens.",
      "\u201cGhost guns\u201d are guns assembled by buyers from mail-order kits and/or 3D-printer plans instead of being sold as fully functioning weapons. The only logical reason for this roundabout process is to make it easier for people who aren\u2019t supposed to have weapons to get them \u2014 and to make it harder for police to trace them when they\u2019re used in crimes.",
      "Common sense dictates that, regardless of how a gun came into being, federal requirements regarding serial numbers and the rest should still apply. A gun assembled at home can be used to kill with just as much finality as one bought in a gun shop.",
      "Yet because of the gun lobby\u2019s hold over American politics, the legal status of ghost guns today remains in limbo.",
      "Congress, at the gun lobby\u2019s bidding, has refused to specify in federal law that ghost guns must come under the same restrictions as other guns. The Biden administration responded with administrative rules that require manufacturers of ghost gun components to adhere to the same regulations as firearms manufacturers, including stamping the parts with serial numbers and keeping relevant sales records.",
      "Opponents sued to overturn those restrictions, arguing that gun kits aren\u2019t guns \u2014 never mind that they can be assembled by buyers into functioning weapons in as little as 30 minutes. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in the case (Garland v. VanDerStok) in October; its opinion is pending.",
      "But the incoming Trump administration could render the case moot. During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, he loosened federal regulations on 3D-printer technology related to ghost guns and sided with the gun lobby on most issues. Trump could summarily rescind the Biden administration\u2019s ghost-gun restrictions upon retaking office.",
      "All indications are that his fellow Republicans who will control both chambers of Congress would back such a move. Congressional Republicans have consistently supported a hands-off approach to an industry that exists for literally no reason but to hamper law enforcement in criminal investigations.",
      "More and more criminals are figuring that out. The number of ghost guns recovered at crime scenes has exploded 10-fold in just the past five years, from under 1,800 in 2016 to more than 19,000 in 2021, according to data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "While the assassin in last week\u2019s murder could just as easily have killed Thompson with a standard-issue handgun, the fact that it was apparently a ghost gun could conceivably complicate the case against Mangione.",
      "Police say the ghost gun found on Mangione is \u201cconsistent\u201d with the type of gun used in the killing. But that doesn\u2019t provide the solid link they might be able to establish if they could work with a serial number, manufacturing records, background checks and other law enforcement tools that are, by intentional design, not available for ghost guns.",
      "In other words, the fact that Mangione allegedly used such a gun to carry out the murder could in theory make it more difficult to prosecute him. If so, will Republicans continue to shield the unrestricted proliferation of this made-for-crime industry from even the minimum firearms standards currently on the books?",
      "It\u2019s not a rhetorical question. By failing to pass commonsense legislation stamping ghost-gun restrictions into federal law, Congress aids the criminals who are aided by this niche of the firearms industry. Remember that the next time some gun-lobby politician waxes on about supporting \u201claw and order.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "U.S. safety regulators have backed away from seeking a recall of nearly 50 million air bag inflators",
      "DETROIT -- U.S. auto safety regulators have backed away from seeking a giant recall of nearly 50 million air bag inflators and will investigate further after the auto industry raised questions about whether all of the inflators are defective.",
      "The move Wednesday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is vastly different from a decision reiterated by the agency in July that the inflators made by ARC Automotive Inc. of Tennessee are defective, dangerous and should be recalled.",
      "The agency has said inflators in about 49 million vehicles from 13 manufacturers are at risk of exploding and hurling shrapnel into drivers and passengers. They're responsible for at least seven injuries and two deaths in the U.S. and Canada since 2009, and recalling all of them would have cost millions of dollars.",
      "But in a document posted Wednesday in the Federal Register and dated Dec. 13, the agency said it considered comments on a decision from July seeking the recall. The auto industry pointed to technical and engineering differences between ARC inflators in vehicles made by different manufacturers. The comments also raised manufacturing-process variations at different plants that made the ARC inflators.",
      "\u201cGiven the potential relevance of these issues to the agency's decision making, including the appropriate scope of any recall, further investigation is warranted,\u201d the agency said in the document.",
      "A message was left Wednesday seeking comment from ARC, which is owned by by Yinyi Group of China.",
      "NHTSA said Wednesday that it carefully considered the comments on its decision to seek a recall of all the inflators and decided that more investigation is warranted.",
      "The agency said that in the coming weeks it will send more information request letters to ARC, vehicle manufacturers and air bag-module manufacturing companies.",
      "\u201cNHTSA will evaluate the responses to these information request along with all available information to determine how to proceed,\u201d the agency\u2019s memorandum said. \u201cIf appropriate, NHTSA will provide a further opportunity for public comment prior to considering whether to issue a final decision in this matter.\u201d",
      "The agency has been investigating ARC since 2015 after drivers-side inflators blew apart in a 2004 Kia in Canada and a 2002 Chrysler Town & Country minivan in the U.S., both injuring people.",
      "In a supplemental decision in July, NHTSA said seven ARC inflators have ruptured in the field in the U.S., each showing evidence of insufficient welds or too much pressure in a canister designed to contain the explosion and fill the air bags in a crash.",
      "In addition, the agency said 23 inflators have ruptured in testing with causes common to the inflators that blew apart in the field. Also, four inflators have ruptured outside the U.S., killing at least one person, the agency said.",
      "\u201cTo be sure, the overwhelming majority of the subject inflators will not rupture upon deployment,\u201d NHSTA wrote in July. \u201cHowever, based on the evidence linking past ruptures to the same friction welding process, all of the subject inflators are at risk of rupturing.\u201d",
      "But several automakers argued in public comments that years of investigations by NHTSA did not establish a systemic design defect. Some said none of the millions of inflators in their vehicles have ruptured due to the cause pointed out by the agency.",
      "NHTSA had said the only way to know which of the ARC-designed inflators will blow apart is for them to deploy in a crash. The federal motor vehicle safety act \u201cdoes not allow such a defect to go unaddressed,\u201d the agency said.",
      "One person who died after an ARC inflator explosion was Marlene Beaudoin, a 40-year-old mother of 10 from Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. She was struck by metal fragments when her 2015 Chevrolet Traverse SUV was involved in a minor crash in 2021. Beaudoin and four of her sons had been on their way to get ice cream. The sons were not hurt.",

    "story": [
      "Harland & Wolff, the Belfast shipyard best known for the Titanic, has been saved by a deal with Spain's state-owned shipbuilder.",
      "Navantia had been in exclusive negotiations since October after Harland & Wolff's holding company fell into administration.",
      "About 1,000 jobs are to be saved in the deal, which also includes Harland & Wolff's facilities in Scotland and England.",
      "The UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the deal was \"good for jobs\" and \"good for national security\".",
      "Reynolds said that the deal secures all four Harland & Wolff yards across the UK and guarantees jobs for \"years not months in all four of those yards\".",
      "He added that the deal was \"a major vote of confidence in the UK from Navantia\".",
      "Asked whether the government had sweetened the deal for Navantia by changing the terms of a contract to deliver three Royal Navy support ships, Reynolds said there had been a \"minor revision\" to the contract to include \"more support\" from the government.",
      "The agreement is to be presented as early fruits of the government's post Brexit \"reset\".",
      "Gavin Robinson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP),  said he was \"delighted that this agreement has been reached which will secure the future of jobs in Belfast and in its other sites\".",
      "The MP for East Belfast said that uncertainty over the future of the business had been \"hugely unsettling... particularly for all the staff at the yard\".",
      "Robinson added that Harland & Wolff \"forms part of a wider defence sector that has huge potential for further growth in Northern Ireland\".",
      "Navantia, which is 100% owned by Spain's government, has been a significant recipient of funding from the European Commission as part of the European Defence Fund.",
      "Joining the fund is a possible objective for the UK-EU security reset, set to be discussed at a summit early in the new year.",
      "The Spanish economy minister responsible for its state-owned businesses, Carlos Cuerpo, met with Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds in London last month.",
      "Navantia already has a business relationship with Harland & Wolff. It is the main contractor on a project to build three support ships for the Royal Navy, with Harland & Wolff acting as UK subcontractor.",
      "The company employs a core staff of about 1,000 in Belfast, Appledore in England and Methil and Arnish in Scotland.",
      "Navantia's main shipyard is at Cadiz in southern Spain.",
      "It employs more than 4,000 people and has an annual turnover of about \u20ac1.3bn (\u00a3835m).",
      "What does Harland & Wolff mean to east Belfast?",
      "For people in Belfast, particularly the east of the city where the yellow cranes, Samson and Goliath, cast their shadows, this takeover will be good news.",

      "Analysis: Probably the best result for Harland & Wolff",
      "For some people, a takeover by Spain's national shipbuilder will represent another example of the UK's industrial decline.",
      "For the Harland & Wolff workforce, it is probably the best possible result.",
      "In 2019, the company's Norwegian owner decided the shipyard didn't have a future and it was placed into administration.",
      "It was then bought by a UK company which had ambition but lacked money and expertise.",
      "Now it is heading into the ownership of an established shipbuilder which has the financial backing of the Spanish state.",
      "What is the history of Harland & Wolff?",
      "Harland & Wolff was founded in 1861 by Yorkshireman Edward Harland and his German business partner, Gustav Wolff.",
      "By the early 20th Century, Harland & Wolff dominated global shipbuilding and had become the most prolific builder of ocean liners in the world.",
      "However, in the period since World War Two it has lurched from crisis to crisis and was under UK state control from 1977 to 1989.",
      "In 2019, its then Norwegian owners withdrew financial support and the business fell into insolvency, having not built a ship in a generation.",
      "It was bought by Infrastrata, a small London-based energy firm which did not have significant experience in marine engineering.",
      "Infrastrata later changed its name to Harland & Wolff and in 2022 won the Royal Navy contract as part of a consortium led by Navantia.",
      "However, financial losses mounted as it scaled up its operations and it became increasingly reliant on high-interest borrowings from a specialist US lender, Riverstone.",
      "The company sought a \u00a3200m government loan guarantee to refinance its borrowings but that was rejected for being too risky for taxpayers.",

    "summary": "The EU wants a trade deal with four South American nations, but France is strongly opposed.",
    "story": [
      "As the ink was drying on one of the world's biggest trade deals, signed in Uruguay this month, and hailed as a milestone for the global economy, anger was brewing thousands of miles away in France.",
      "Under the agreement between the EU on one hand, and Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay on the other, tariffs will be greatly reduced and the amounts of imports and exports allowed will be increased.",
      "The deal would affect almost 800 million people.",
      "It comes as a marked contrast to Donald Trump's plans to greatly increase protectionism when he returns to the White House next month.",
      "The deal still needs to be approved by the 27 EU member states, and France is planning to block it, due to fears that it will harm its farming sector.",
      "Alix Heurtault, a 34-year-old French farmer, says she is worried about her future if the planned agreement goes ahead.",
      "\"I fear that the deal will mean making ends meet becoming even more difficult for farmers like me,\" she says.",
      "As a result, she is crossing her fingers that the French government will be able to stop it.",
      "The planned trade agreement will mean more South American beef, chicken and sugar coming to the EU, and at lower prices. While in the opposite direction, the likes of European cars, clothing and wine would have more access to the Mercosur zone.",
      "For France to block the deal it will need to persuade at least three other EU countries, representing at least 35% of the total population to join it. Ireland, Poland and Austria are also opposed, but Italy will likely need to also come on board to achieve the required population quota.",
      "And with the media giving very conflicting reports about Italy's position, we'll have to wait and see which way the Italians go when the vote is held some time in 2025.",
      "In the meantime, French farmers are continuing to put pressure on Paris to not back down. French President Emmanuel Macron is listening, and has described the trade deal as \"unacceptable in its current form\".",
      "Ms Heurtault grows sugar beet, wheat and barley on a 150-hectare farm in the small village of Villeneuve-sur-Auvers located 60km (37 miles) south of Paris.",
      "She says that the deal would see French farmers badly hit in order to help EU manufacturers. \"It feels like we're a bargaining chip. Farmers in the Mercosur countries [the name of the Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay block] have less restrictions regarding pesticides and lower labour costs.\"",
      "Ms Heurtault's view is widely held across the French farming sector, which has been holding regular protests in recent months.",
      "A few weeks ago some 200 farmers dumped bales of straw in front of the Grand Palais museum and exhibition centre in Paris.",
      "They lit up red flares, and chanted slogans like \"We are feeding you, show us some respect\".",
      "The protest was held to coincide with an annual meeting of commodities importers and exporters taking place at the venue.",
      "St\u00e9phane Gallais, a cattle farmer and the national secretary of farmers' union Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Paysanne, which had organised the event, explained why it was being held.",
      "\"Today's demonstration is a stance against free trade, especially the EU-Mercosur agreement that we've been opposing since it was first discussed in the late 1990s,\" he said.",
      "While France is opposed to the trade deal, other EU nations, such as Germany, Spain and Portugal are strongly in favour of it.",
      "Proponents welcome the fact it would be a marked contrast to Trump's threats of increased protectionism.",
      "\"It would be a good signal at a time when we have movement in the opposite direction towards economic fragmentation and protectionism, especially with free-trade sceptic US President Donald Trump re-elected,\" says Uri Dadush, a research professor for trade policy at the University of Maryland in the US.",
      "Prof Dadush adds that while European farmers will be negatively impacted, he says this will be very limited.",
      "\"The deal is a threat for European farmers, as the world's most competitive agricultural sector gets access to their market, but we're talking about a tiny amount of liberalisation spread out over a long period of time,\" he says.",
      "He points out that under the agreement the Mercosur nations would still have limits on what they can export to the EU. Such as their proposed initial increased annual quota of beef exports still only accounting for less than 1% of EU consumption of the meat.",
      "Prof Dadush adds that \"the deal is an opportunity to push for much needed market-orientated reform in the heavily-subsidised EU agricultural sector, and Mercosur's highly-protected factory sector\".",
      "Chris Hegadorn, adjunct professor for global food policies at Paris-based university Sciences Po, and former secretary of the UN's Committee on World Food Security, says the agreement would overall be beneficial to Europe \u2013 including its farmers.",
      "\"It obviously depends on the subcategory you're looking at, but French cheese and wine producers will benefit,\" he says.",
      "He adds that it will also improve health and environmental standards in the Mercosur countries, and increase ties with the EU at a time when \"China is also trying to get a foothold in Latin America\".",
      "But David Cayla, lecturer for economics at Angers University in western France and member of the left-wing collective \"The Dismayed Economists\", doubts the EU will be able to enforce higher standards in Latin American countries.",
      "\"It's impossible to control their implementation,\" he says. \"Our farmers will only face increased competition from countries with a better climate and more fertile soils.",
      "\"But we need to protect European agriculture \u2013 that's also a question of food sovereignty,\" he emphasizes, adding that the Covid-19 pandemic showed how quickly worldwide supply chains could collapse in times of crisis.",
      "Antoine Gomel, who in 2017 took over his family's 24-hectare chicken and beef farm in a small village near Boulogne-sur-Mer in northern France, says that opposing the trade deal is about saving the French countryside.",
      "\"Farms keep disappearing leaving our villages deserted \u2013 the deal will only accelerate that,\" says the 42-year-old.",

      "\"Farms can contribute to bringing them back together, by literally anchoring them.\"",
      "Back in front of the Grand Palais in Paris, cleaners were sweeping away the remaining straw from the protesters.",

      "People mis-sold finance agreements when buying cars could wait months for a decision on whether they should receive compensation.",
      "A decision by judges at the Court of Appeal has blown open an ongoing saga into hidden commission payments, with buyers possibly in line for payouts totalling billions of pounds.",
      "But the higher Supreme Court has now agreed to hear an appeal against the decision.",
      "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has also allowed motor finance providers extra time to deal with complaints.",
      "Lawyers acting for motorists say this could further delay compensation which should be paid to car buyers who may not have given their informed consent for the commission payments.",
      "Who may be in line for payouts?",
      "The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements.",
      "About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle.",
      "In a complicated, and long-running, series of developments, many of these agreements have come under scrutiny.",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "That has created the prospect of banks and other lenders having to make payouts totalling millions of pounds.",
      "Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation, potentially increasing the lenders' final bill to billions of pounds.",
      "Why was the judges' decision so important?",
      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "The hearing included the test case of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017.",
      "He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,\" he told the BBC.",

      "How has the regulator responded?",
      "The FCA said that the decision could lead to dealers and motor finance providers receiving a deluge of new complaints, and it is urging people to make a claim if they feel they were the victims of mis-selling.",
      "Some could come from people previously told they had no claim for compensation because they did not have a discretionary commission arrangement.",
      "The regulator has extended the time providers have to consider complaints until December 2025, aligning the deadline for firms to deal with discretionary and non-discretionary arrangement complaints.",

      "The US government is taking action against the app because of what it says are its links to the Chinese state - links which TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have denied.",
      "The Supreme Court justices did not act on a request by TikTok for an emergency injunction against the law, but will instead allow TikTok and ByteDance to make their case on 10 January - nine days before the ban is due to take effect.",
      "Earlier in December, a federal appeals court rejected an attempt to overturn the legislation, saying it was \"the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents\".",
      "When and why could the US ban TikTok?",
      "The Supreme Court is the highest legal authority in the US, and the decision to take on TikTok's case is significant as it only hears 100 or so cases a year out of the more than 7,000 petitions it receives.",

      "A group of them have made a joint filing to the court urging it to block the banning of a platform which they argue \"millions use every day to communicate, learn about the world, and express themselves.\"",
      "Kelsey Chickering from market research firm Forrester said Instagram's parent company Meta would be a major beneficiary of ban on TikTok.",
      "\"TikTok is central to a thriving creator economy, and a ban would effectively create a Meta monopoly on short-form video,\" Ms Chickering said, citing a Forrester survey that found 56% of TikTok users would switch to Instagram Reels in that event."

      "On average, wages are now rising faster than prices, which helps to relieve the pressure, but of course prices for most things remain significantly higher than they were a few years ago.",
      "Housing costs, whether rents or mortgages, especially are a major source of financial pressure for a lot of people.",
      "Even if the rate of inflation does come down next year, that does not mean prices will fall. They will just rise more slowly, leaving most things more expensive than they were before.",

      "They are not expected to bring rates down from their current 4.75%.",
      "That is because higher interest rates help keep inflation in check by dampening down borrowing and spending. If borrowing gets cheaper, people are likely to have more money to spend which could mean prices rise faster.",
      "So the higher inflation figure, added to the news earlier in the week that wages are growing faster than before, will have given the Bank more reason to wait.",

      "He added that \"90% of those impacted knew about the changes that were taking place\".",
      "However, during Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir was repeatedly pressed on the government's decision, with one MP calling for a vote.",

      "In 2019, Angela Rayner, now the deputy prime minister, told the BBC: \"They [the government] stole their pensions\u2026we've said we'd right that injustice and within the five years of the Labour government we'll compensate them for the money that they've lost.\"",
      "In the first Prime Minister's Questions since the government announced they would not be providing compensation, veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott said the Waspi women had \"fought one of the most sustained and passionate campaigns for justice that I can remember, year in, year out\".",
      "\"Does the prime minister really understand how let down Waspi women feel today?\" she asked.",
      "Ian Byrne, an independent MP, said the women were owed compensation for the \"injustice done to them\" and urged the prime minister to hold a vote on the subject.",
      "And Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Labour had \"played politics\" with the group by previously supporting their campaign.",
      "\"She [Rayner] promised to compensate them in full... now they admit we were right all along.\"",
      "Responding to the criticism, Sir Keir said the delays to telling women about pension changes were \"unacceptable\".",
      "\"I'm afraid to say that taxpayers simply can't afford the tens of billions of pounds in compensation when the evidence shows that 90% of those impacted did know about it, that's because of the state of our economy.\"",
      "Following PMQs, a No 10 spokesman said that since winning the election, the government had \"had the chance\" to look at the ombudsman's report, which said the women \"faced no direct financial loss as a result of the delays\".",
      "The government has said compensation could cost up to \u00a310.5bn.",
      "But Ms De Spon said many Waspi women \"didn't know\" about the pensions changes, and added that even to this day women were saying: \"I never even received a letter, let alone when I received a letter.\"",
      "She added that former Conservative Chancellor George Osborne had saved more than \u00a3180bn by raising the state pension age and \"boasted that it was easiest money he had ever saved\".",
      "\"We're asking for a tiny fraction of that back as compensation for government failure,\" she said.",
      "The Waspi campaign also accused the prime minister of spreading \"dangerous misinformation\" by saying 90% of women had been aware of changes to the pension age.",
      "\"The fact that 90% of women had some general awareness of potential changes in the future does not mean they knew this would impact them personally,\" said Waspi chair Angela Madden.",
      "Diane Abbott is one of a small group of Labour MPs objecting to their leader's approach. Kate Osborne and Emma Lewell-Buck have also publicly opposed the decision.",
      "The SNP is calling for a vote in Parliament on compensation. The party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said: \"Labour Party politicians posed with Waspi women before the election only to leave them high and dry when they got into government.\"",
      "Earlier, Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith also said the decision was \"a betrayal\", adding that Cabinet ministers had \"queued up, had their photo taken with Waspi women, talked about how they were going to remedy that injustice.\"",
      "He said \"we won't know\" whether a Conservative government would have paid compensation as they were voted out of government before making that decision.",
      "The then Conservative-run Department of Work and Pensions told the ombudsman at the time of its report in March why it could not pay out.",
      "It cited \"the costs involved, the time it would take, the amount of resource it would involve, and the negative impact delivering a remedy would have on it being able to maintain other services\".",

      "\"Inflation rose again this month as prices of motor fuel and clothing increased this year but fell a year ago,\" said Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which gathered the data.",
      "\"This was partially offset by air fares, which traditionally dip at this time of year, but saw their largest drop in November since records began at the start of the century.\"",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she recognised that families were still struggling with the cost of living.",
      "\"Today's figures are a reminder that for too long the economy has not worked for working people.\"",
      "\"I am fighting to put more money in the pockets of working people.\"",
      "Inflation, while higher than earlier in the year, is well below its peak in late 2022.",
      "It has fallen steadily over the past two years and undershot the Bank of England's 2% target in September, before rising again in October.",
      "The official forecasting body said in October that inflation was likely to pick up to 2.6% in 2025 in part due to the impact of Budget measures announced in October.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: \"The chancellor has made a series of irresponsible and inflationary decisions.",
      "\"These figures mean higher costs in the shops, less money in working people's pockets and risks keeping mortgage rates higher for longer.\"",
      "Prices for food and non-alcoholic drinks, alcohol and tobacco, and footwear all rose at a faster pace last month.",
      "A wider measure of inflation showed housing and household services costs, including rent, rose by 3.5% over the past year.",
      "Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at the financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Inflation is staying put for now, like an unwelcome Christmas party guest hogging the sofa into the small hours.",
      "\"The question is whether it can be shifted, or if it's going to hang around to ruin our plans for months \u2013 eating us out of house and home and driving up the cost of everything again.\"",
      "'A tough year'",

      "\"It's been a tough year,\" said David Miller.",
      "\"We've taken a hit with our bottom line because of fuel, obviously the utilities going up.",
      "\"But I think the biggest thing overall for any business is wages,\" he said.",
      "Miller's employs 60 people and tries to pay above the minimum wage.",
      "Wage costs for businesses will rise again in April, after measures announced in October's Budget come into force.",
      "Rate decision",
      "The Bank of England will have to weigh up competing arguments over whether to cut interest rates.",
      "Recent figures show the economy shrank in September and October, and the usual response would be to lower interest rates.",
      "That would ease the pressure on mortgage-holders and other borrowers, including businesses and should boost spending and investment.",
      "However, rising prices, combined with figures on Tuesday that showed faster growth in wages, suggest rates may need to remain at their current 4.75% for longer, to keep inflation in check.",
      "Many economists now expect interest rates to fall more slowly next year than had been expected previously.",
      "Paul Dales, chief UK economist at the think tank Capital Economics, said November's higher inflation figure made it very unlikely interest rates would be cut on Thursday.",
      "\"There is almost no chance of the Bank of England delivering an early Christmas present with another interest rate cut tomorrow, \" he said.",
      "\"That's especially the case since domestic inflation pressures appear to be a touch stronger than the Bank expected.\"",
      "Capital Economics predicts inflation will dip in December and then rise again in January, but by the end of next year would have fallen back to close to the Bank of England's 2% target.",

    "story": [
      "The BBC has seen evidence the multinational corporation that owns Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) arranged for a whistleblower to be sacked for raising concerns about the safety of electric cars it designed.",
      "Confidential emails between executives at Tata Group reveal they retaliated against mechanical engineer Hazar Denli for posting concerns on Reddit that lives were being put at risk. He was then blacklisted.",
      "US authorities are now investigating an earlier model of the same car after 28 reports of safety defects and a crash in which a family-of-four were killed.",
      "In response to a detailed right of reply letter from the BBC, both JLR and Tata Group declined to comment.",
      "Mr Denli, from Milton Keynes, first raised concerns internally while working at a different division of Tata Group, its global engineering consultancy Tata Technologies.",
      "He told the BBC that in test-driving prototypes, designed by Tata Technologies for Vietnamese car maker Vinfast, he identified improperly designed components in the car's chassis, including its suspension system.",
      "At low mileages, some of them were snapping off, he said.",
      "That created a risk that under stress, such as hitting a pothole at speed, the wheels could become misaligned, causing the car to veer to the left or right without prompting, and the driver could lose control, Mr Denli added.",
      "\"We saw, for example, the front strut-to-knuckle connection was loosening, which could be extremely dangerous,\" he said. \"It could cause a loosening of the entire structure that could cause wheels to come off.",
      "\"In a crash scenario, it could be completely unsafe. It could cause the vehicle to lose control.\"",
      "'Alarm bells'",
      "Mr Denli, a specialist in chassis design, was appointed to lead the engineering team working on the car's front suspension and chassis from September 2022, halfway through a design and testing phase he says had an unusually tight timetable.",
      "He soon became concerned VinFast was cutting corners with safety, keeping costs down by employing a small team of inexperienced engineers.",
      "His concerns grew when he heard three of his predecessors had quit after short spells on the project.",
      "He says in February and March 2023, while running vigorous testing on VinFast cars at the Mira Technology Park near Nuneaton, two components snapped off and another two failed.",
      "He reported the \"extremely concerning\" incidents to colleagues at Tata Technologies Limited (TTL), the consultancy's UK division, based in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire.",
      "In subsequent testing, he alleges further components failed.",
      "Mr Denli said they were failing after fewer than 25,000 km (15,534 miles), when normally they would be expected to last for at least 150,000 km (93,205 miles).",
      "\"In the drive units, some of the brackets were completely failing and falling out on to the road,\" he said. \"We're talking one or two kilograms worth of aluminium.",
      "\"These [incidents] started causing alarm bells to go off just a short time before we we went into production.\"",
      "He escalated his concerns to senior executives at TTL and VinFast and said he  had recommended they redesign the faulty components and manufacture safer, higher quality parts.",
      "That would have sharply boosted costs and required VinFast Group to postpone production of the car, he added.",
      "But VinFast, which was preparing to sell shares in itself and raise funds by floating on the New York Stock Exchange, instead pushed ahead with production.",
      "Mr Denli asked Tata Technologies to reassign him to another project but senior managers refused.",
      "Unhappy to be associated with the VinFast car, he says, in May last year he resigned.",
      "With his skills as a consultant engineer in demand, Mr Denli later found new work via an agency at JLR in Gaydon, also owned by the Tata Group.",
      "But he said he kept seeing reports online appearing to show serious safety defects in earlier models of the same VinFast car \u2013 including a video that appeared to show a car reversing with no driver in it \u2013 and crashed cars where the wheels had come off.",
      "In another report, a VinFast car at a showroom in Germany caught fire.",
      "The same components he was testing in VinFast's VF6 and VF7 models had been carried over from two earlier models already on sale in the United States, Vietnam and Europe - the VF8 and VF9.",
      "Then on 24 April this year, a family-of-four was killed in a crash in Pleasanton, California. Police reported the vehicle lost control, veered off the road, hit a pole and caught fire.",
      "The following month, US safety regulator the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), announced it was reviewing the VinFast VF8. VinFast said it was cooperating with the investigation.",
      "The reports of the crash prompted Mr Denli to publish the posts on a Reddit account saying he had worked on the design of the car and it was a vehicle he believed endangered lives.",
      "\"I would get into every other vehicle I have designed from other brands\u2026 and every vehicle has flaws\u2026 But Vinfast, I wouldn't get into one\u2026 never will and I won't let my loved ones get into one either,\" he wrote.",
      "Two months later, on 18 July this year, Mr Denli's contract at JLR was terminated.",
      "Internal documents obtained through a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) reveal a senior executive at his former employer Tata Technologies had been in touch with JLR executives to seek his dismissal.",
      "After he saw the Reddit posts, Tata Technologies HR director Patrick Flood discussed his company's wish to have Mr Denli's new employment terminated with JLR's HR director and board member Dave Williams.",
      "Mr Flood told Mr Williams that Tata Group's client VinFast had conducted its own investigation and identified Mr Denli as the author of the Reddit posts: \"The concern is if he has done this now, he could do the same at JLR.\"",
      "The same day he was sacked, Mr Denli was blacklisted on industry recruitment platform Magnit, which told JLR he had been \"red-flagged\" so any applications from him for other work via the platform would be automatically declined.",
      "On 19 July, Mr Flood emailed JLR corporate investigators: \"I just wanted to check whether the individual's services have been terminated with JLR?\" The investigator confirmed they had.",
      "The internal documents show another Tata Technologies engineer had also told JLR there were problems with components Mr Denli had warned about on Reddit.",
      "Mr Denli said his bosses at JLR knew he had done nothing wrong in his JLR employment and told him he had been dismissed because Tata Group was embarrassed by his postings about its client, VinFast.",
      "He is now taking JLR to an employment tribunal.",
      "\"I was distressed as to what was happening around the world where innocent people were paying the price - a very high price,\" he said.",
      "\"I thought that if some people would start to speak up about it, they would actually be forced to make some changes. Unfortunately, their response was not to make these improvements, but, 'Hey, who said this? Let's go and shut him up'.\"",
      "On 12 September, the NHTSA launched an investigation into the Vinfast VF8.",
      "It announced it was looking into 3,118 VinFast vehicles sold in the US after 14 drivers reported the Lane Keep Assist systems were flawed in VF8 cars bought in 2023 and 2024.",
      "The NHTSA said the drivers reported the system \"has difficulty detecting lanes on the roadway, provides improper steering inputs and is difficult to override by the driver\".",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:22:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Palestinian news outlets have seen a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
    "story": [
      "Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war, according to BBC research.",
      "In a comprehensive analysis of Facebook data, we found that newsrooms in the Palestinian territories - in Gaza and the West Bank - had suffered a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
      "The BBC has also seen leaked documents showing that Instagram - another Meta-owned platform - increased its moderation of Palestinian user comments after October 2023.",
      "Meta - the owner of Facebook - says that any implication that it deliberately suppressed particular voices is \"unequivocally false\".",
      "Since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war, just a few outside reporters have been allowed to enter the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza from the outside, and they were only able to do so escorted by the Israeli army.",
      "Social media has filled the gap for those wanting to hear more voices from inside Gaza. Facebook pages for news outlets such as Palestine TV, Wafa news agency and Palestinian Al-Watan News - which operate out of the West Bank territory - became a vital source of updates for many around the world.",
      "BBC News Arabic compiled engagement data on the Facebook pages of 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations in the year leading up to the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and in the year since.",
      "Engagement is a key measure of how much impact a social media account is having and how many people are seeing its content. It includes such factors as the number of comments, reactions and shares.",
      "During a period of war, audience engagement might be expected to rise. However, the data showed a 77% decline after the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.",
      "Palestine TV has 5.8 million followers on Facebook. Journalists at the newsroom shared statistics with us showing a 60% drop in the number of people seeing their posts.",
      "\"Interaction was completely restricted, and our posts stopped reaching people,\" says Tariq Ziad, a journalist at the channel.",
      "Over the past year, Palestinian journalists have raised fears that their online content is being \"shadow-banned\" by Meta - in other words, restricted in how many people see it.",
      "To test this, we carried out the same data analysis on the Facebook pages of 20 Israeli news organisations such as Yediot Ahronot, Israel Hayom and Channel 13. These pages also posted a large amount of war-related content, but their audience engagement increased by nearly 37%.",
      "Meta has previously been accused by Palestinians and human rights groups of failing to moderate online activity fairly.",
      "An independent report in 2021 commissioned by the company said this was not deliberate but because of a lack of Arabic-speaking expertise among moderators. Words and phrases were being interpreted as offensive or violent, when they were in fact innocuous.",
      "For example, the Arabic phrase \"Alhamdulillah\", which means \"Praise be to God\", was sometimes being auto-translated as \"Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom\".",
      "To see if this explained the decline in engagement with Palestinian outlets, the BBC carried out the same analysis on Facebook pages for 30 prominent Arabic-language news sources based elsewhere, such as Sky News Arabia and Al-Jazeera.",
      "However, these pages saw an average increase in engagement of nearly 100%.",
      "Responding to our research, Meta pointed out that it had made no secret of \"temporary product and policy measures\" taken in October 2023.",
      "It said it had faced a challenge balancing the right to freedom of speech, with the fact that Hamas was both US-sanctioned and designated as a dangerous organisation under Meta's own policies.",
      "The tech giant also said that pages posting exclusively about the war were more likely to see engagement impacted.",
      "\"We acknowledge we make mistakes, but any implication that we deliberately suppress a particular voice is unequivocally false,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Leaked Instagram documents",
      "The BBC has also spoken to five former and current employees of Meta about the impact they say their company's policies have had on individual Palestinian users.",
      "One person, who spoke anonymously, shared leaked internal documents about a change made to Instagram's algorithm, which toughened the moderation of Palestinians commenting on Instagram posts.",
      "\"Within a week of the Hamas attack, the code was changed essentially making it more aggressive towards Palestinian people,\" he said.",
      "Internal messages show that an engineer raised concerns about the order, worried that it could be \"introducing a new bias into the system against Palestinian users\".",
      "Meta confirmed it took the measure but said it had been necessary to respond to what it called a \"spike in hateful content\" coming out of the Palestinian territories.",
      "It said that policy changes put in place at the start of the Israel-Gaza war had now been reversed, but did not say when this happened.",
      "At least 137 Palestinian journalists are reported to have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict, but a few carry on despite the dangers.",

      "Sub-postmasters at the inquiry greeted Ms Vennells' words with groans and, when she said she did not want to blame others, with laughter.",
      "More than 900 sub-postmasters were prosecuted for shortfalls in their accounts caused by bugs in the Horizon IT system.",

      "\"Whether the board and the executive knew of these injustices from the start is an irrelevant diversion.",

      "Sipping a glass of local wine is likely not what springs to mind when visiting Scandinavia, but this colder, northerly region is emerging as a new wine frontier.",
      "Hundreds of commercial vineyards are now dotted across Denmark, Sweden, and even Norway, as a first generation of professional winemakers transform what was once a niche hobby into a small but flourishing industry.",
      "Far north of France's Bordeaux or California's Napa Valley, more than 10,000 vines grow on a hillside on Zealand, Denmark's biggest island.",
      "\"People have found out that it is actually possible to grow wine in Denmark, so newcomers are coming, year after year,\" says Nina Fink, as she shows the BBC her three-hectare (seven-acre) winery, Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd.",
      "Nina and her husband Niels started their operation 13 years ago, after retiring from business jobs in Copenhagen. They grow predominantly green grapes, producing floral white wines, as well as sparkling and ros\u00e9.",
      "\"We have longer summer days with more sunlight than you have in France or in Italy, so the conditions are different,\" she explains.",
      "For most Scandinavian vineyards, solaris is the grape of choice - an aromatic, hybrid variety that's well-adapted to colder climes, ripens easily, and is more disease resistant, allowing vineyards to avoid spraying pesticides.",
      "The grape was first bred in Germany in 1975, but only adopted in Scandinavia from 2004, after which winemaking took off.",
      "Niels Fink says that people are positively surprised when they taste the wines from Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd. \"There's a little twinkle in their eye, then comes this half smile,\" he chuckles. \"People like it.\"",
      "The Finks sell their bottles direct from the winery, but they also supply some of Copenhagen's top restaurants, including the three Michelin star Geranium.",
      "Initially they made just 4,000 bottles annually, but now they sell 20,000. \"We are limited by the supply we are able to offer,\" says Mr Fink.",
      "Commercial vineyards in Denmark and Sweden have only been allowed under European Union rules since 2000. Winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production.",
      "Curiosity, and the fact \"it's possible\", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains Jean Becker, from the Danish Wine Association.",
      "\"I was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. We were six growers,\" says Mr Becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "There are now 150 commercial wineries in Denmark with a combined 125 hectares of vines, plus more than 1,000 hobby growers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the Swedish Wine Association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines.",
      "\"I began with 500 vines,\" said Jean Becker, \"Today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. They start bigger in scale. Is there a market for it? The answer is yes.\"",
      "But it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in France, and almost a million hectares in Spain.",
      "In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France.",
      "\"It is very challenging because it's new for us,\" he says. \"We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.\"",
      "Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almost two degrees celsius over the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and a longer fruit-growing season. But there remains a risk of frost damage.",
      "Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. \"We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.\"",
      "But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. \"Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere.\"",
      "However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. \"Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.\"",
      "He is leading a programme called \"FastGrapes\", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.",
      "They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.",
      "\"There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,\" says the researcher. \"Part of that search happens in the lab\u2026 you can see the genes that make it strong.\"",
      "The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium.",
      "But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.",
      "Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.",
      "Now 27, the winemaker works at Thora Vineyard on the country's southwestern Bj\u00e4re peninsula. \"We need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],\" he says.",
      "But ''starting from scratch\" in Sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. \"It's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.\"",
      "Thora's owner, American expat Heather \u00d6berg says all the effort and expense is worth it. \"We can compete with other European wines,\" she says.",
      "Yet, home-grown Scandinavian wine currently makes up just a fraction of the consumer market, and bottles are expensive. Danish wine in Denmark costs from 200 kroner ($27; \u00a322) a bottle upwards, more than twice the price of the cheapest French and Spain imports. Only a negligible amount is exported.",
      "\"We will never get in competition with France, Italy and Spain because they have very low prices,\" says Mr Becker.",
      "At his central Copenhagen wine shop, Vino Fino, owner Nicolai Christiansen mostly sells French wine. Yet he says he has recently sold a case of Danish wine to a bar owner in France.",
      "\"If you can sell it to a French guy, you can probably sell it to everybody,\" he jokes.",
      "However, he is still to be convinced about Danish wine. \"The Danish wine is still too expensive,\" he says. \"It's coming up. but I still think there's some way to go before the quality is there.\"",

    "title": "'The school system is broken': Why more parents are home-educating their children",
    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:58:57 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC speaks with parents who insist the school system is \"broken\" as latest government estimates point to a rise in home education.",
    "story": [
      "\"Toby was so tremendously unhappy in school,\" says his father, Daniel. \"We were standing outside the classroom door for an hour every morning and he just didn't want to go in.",
      "\"[It reached the point where] we thought 'this doesn't work.'\"",
      "Daniel says he tried everything to settle him. Toby, who is now eight, was allowed into the classroom before other children arrived and his teacher also arranged for him to hand out books, but nothing helped.",
      "So, in May 2023 his parents decided to withdraw him from school.",
      "They are not the only ones. Government statistics released on Thursday found that a growing number of parents have withdrawn their children from mainstream education in England. An estimated 111,700 children are being home-educated, based on a census taken this year - marking a 20% rise since last year.",
      "Around 23% say their reasons for home-educating are a result of lifestyle, philosophical or preferential choices, such as religious or cultural beliefs or a rejection of an exam-based education: something that has long been the case.",
      "But 13% of families now say they made this decision because of school dissatisfaction, including a lack of support for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and school bullying.",
      "In addition, 14% say it is due to their child's mental health.",
      "This is the first time the data has become mandatory, which the Department for Education says may account in part for the increase.",
      "Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education charity Education Otherwise, says that she is shocked by the increase in the numbers. \"It's not from parents who are wanting to home-educate,\" she argues, \"but because the school was not meeting their child's needs, and those parents should not be home-educating, because they don't want to be. Home education is not easy.\"",
      "Daniel says that this was the case for Toby. \"We had no alternative\u2026 the system is broken and does not cater for a lot of children.\"",
      "Toby has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), he explains, and requires a very flexible schedule, allowing him to spend a few minutes or a few hours on an activity, or learn \"on the move\" so he is not confined to sitting at a desk.",
      "Two of Daniel's older children, who are both autistic, are doing well at a special school but he says that Toby's educational needs aren't severe enough to qualify him for a place.",
      "\"I don't claim to be a great teacher,\" he continues. \"But I've got enough creativity and inquisitiveness to find learning opportunities as we go.\"",
      "They start the day with 20 minutes of reading. On the day we meet, they're looking at a storybook full of illustrations. Their week so far has also included gymnastics, ice-skating and forest walks.",
      "As Daniel explains all of this, Toby is busy figuring out a puzzle in a maths workshop in a meeting room near their south London home with a group of other home-educated children.",
      "Post-pandemic: a perfect storm",
      "Covid lockdowns gave families a glimpse into the world of home education, as video communication technology suddenly became commonplace in many schools. Digital learning businesses and online schools sprung up too.",
      "What followed was a perfect storm: as schools re-opened, some children found the transition back to the classroom difficult, resulting in an increase in persistently absent children - around double the levels seen before the pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the Department for Education show that nearly one in five children missed school more than 10% of the time in the autumn and spring terms of 2023/24.",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Martyn Oliver, the chief inspector of Ofsted, England's schools regulator, said that the issue of children missing school was a \"stubborn and damaging issue\", and expressed concern over \"flexi-schooling\", where parents educate their children at home for part of the week.",
      "\"Even ten years ago [many people had] quite an idealised vision of home education involving self-directed learners who go off to Cambridge,\" explains Amber Fensham-Smith, co-director of the Open University's Children's Research Centre. \"The situation is a lot more complex now.\"",
      "\"It's plugging a gap,\" she continues. \"If your child is struggling with their mental health, you can't get an NHS referral and you want to keep them safe, what do you do? That's very different to a parent who chooses it.\"",
      "The Department for Education says it knows \"far too many children with SEND aren't having their needs met\" and recently announced \u00a3740m of funding to increase the number of places for pupils within mainstream schools.",
      "More than 1.6 million children have SEND in schools in England, an increase of 101,000 from 2023. Experts say there are various reasons for this, including greater awareness.",
      "In October, the public spending watchdog warned the special educational needs system is broken and families have lost confidence in it. Which begins to explain part of the spike in home education.",
      "What remains unclear is how effective this is as a solution.",
      "In the US, a much larger proportion of the population - an estimated 6% of children - learn at home, and studies there have found that home-educated children perform as well as, or outperform, their peers in most academic tests.",
      "However, some experts point to the fact that participants in surveys tend to be in highly educated, middle-class families with internet access, which leaves out under-represented groups.",
      "In the UK, the Education Committee called on the government in 2021 to commission research on the life chances and social outcomes of home-educated children \u2013 but three years later, the research is still limited.",
      "One challenge with measuring success in the UK is that there is no obligation for home-educated children to follow the national curriculum or sit exams. Parents simply have a duty to provide a \"suitable education\".",
      "Earlier this month, the Education Policy Institute, an independent research organisation, warned that a lack of clarity around the law and what is required, \"potentially risks some children missing out,\" and that not knowing who or where they are \"raises questions about variation in the quality and suitability of home education.\"",
      "Others argue that there should be, for example, a minimum bar required for literacy and numeracy.",
      "But Fadoua Govaerts, who taught her five children at home and has a PhD from the University of Bath that focused on home-education experiences, believes that it's right for it to have the flexibility to be \"more holistic and inclusive\".",
      "\"Outcomes could be anything from being comfortable within their own skin, finding a new talent, become an elite athlete or actor, to gaining national qualifications or becoming an entrepreneur as a teenager,\" she says.",
      "What the children say",
      "Riyad Ozpolat has never been to school. He is 12 years old now and lives in Bristol with his parents and four siblings. His mother Weronika, a speech and language therapist, works one day a week at a school and the rest of the time home-educates three of her children.",
      "\"I've been home-schooled my whole life\", explains Riyad, as he swings on an office chair, while his 18-month old sister wanders around behind him. \"The reason I don't want to go to school is because I don't know if I'll be able to cope with sitting down.\"",
      "He sees his best friends every week at Scouts and says that he doesn't feel he's missing out on anything.",
      "Ms Ozpolat says that home-educating her children gives them a chance to focus on their passions. \"There's so much wasted time at school. I think the earlier that they can focus on their interests the better because it just means they have more expertise and extra knowledge in the thing they want to do when they're older\".",
      "However, she continues: \"As the children get older, we need to pay for them to do the GCSE exams. If they're having extra tuition and you have to pay for all of the books and resources that you need to get in order to do the exam.\"",
      "'I tried everything to get my daughter to go to school'",
      "Homeschooling mum teaches kids while travelling",
      "More families being 'forced' into home education",
      "Parents who choose to home-educate take on full financial responsibility - there is no specific government support for home education.",
      "Children who are home-educated are not obliged by law to sit their GCSE exams, but if they choose to, they normally have to pay an exam board fee and an exam centre fee. Prices vary widely but for example the total cost of sitting all three GCSE maths papers at one private exam centre in London, would be \u00a3225.",
      "Then there is the question around whether a home education always prepares people well for certain workplaces. Rachael Barrow, who is now 31, was home-educated for nine years after being bullied in school, and says she loved being taught away from the traditional classroom, but when she entered the workplace she found certain challenges.",
      "During her first job, in human resources, she struggled to adjust to having a fixed routine. \"I felt as though I was losing some of my autonomy in deciding my own schedule\", she says.",
      "She has since changed careers and is now completing a PhD at Lancaster University. As part of this she has interviewed other adults who were previously home-educated, and found they tended to avoid corporate careers or 9-5 jobs.",
      "Some told her that \"politics in the workplace\" was a struggle.",
      "However she is positive about the experience overall: \"I don't regret being home-educated at all\", she says. \"I think it set me up quite nicely for a career in academia.\"",
      "Safeguarding and registers",
      "Some critics argue that there are gaps around regulating home-education in the UK. The current rules don't require a parent to tell the council if they are home-educating their child from the start; they only stipulate that a school must tell the local authority if a child has been de-registered.",
      "\"The UK is an absolute outlier in being the least regulated in Europe,\" says Daniel Monk, professor of law at Birkbeck, University of London.",
      "The death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif, who was removed from school by her father and stepmother to be home-educated, after her teachers raised concerns with social services, has added to the debate around strengthening regulation.",
      "Dame Rachel de Souza, the Children's Commissioner for England,  said it was \"madness\" that the law currently allowed parents to take a child out of school when concerns had already been raised.",
      "The government has set out plans to introduce a requirement for families subject to a protection plan to get council permission before removing a child from school to be home-educated.",
      "Earlier this year it also announced plans to introduce a national register in England to help account for all home-educated children. This could come into force in 2025.",
      "Where next for Iran now that its 'Axis of Resistance' is shattered",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "No more Mr Nice Guy for Keir Starmer",
      "Dame Rachel has welcomed the decision. \"If we get proper registers, and we have local authorities taking their role seriously to engage with these families, we may find we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be\", she told the Education Committee in November.",
      "But Wendy Charles-Warner argues that it is \"deeply offensive\" to parents to suggest that every child is at risk unless the local authority knows where they are. \"Home education is a big ask of parents. In most cases it's a positive move for their child, because they're acting to protect their child.\"",
      "However she acknowledges: \"Parents should not be home educating in cases where they don't want to.\"",
      "Back in south London, Toby's home education is going well - his father says he is calmer and happier - but he is all too aware that the situation is different for him than for many other families. As he puts it, they have the financial stability to be able to devote this time to educating Toby as a family.",
      "\"My wife's a doctor, we've never been financially vulnerable,\" he says. \"I'm educated, and we're very, very lucky.\"",
      "Despite all of this, he says that it has been \"bloody hard\".",
      "\"All of our kids have spent time out of school, and we have been in crisis,\" he says. \"It's not always easy but we are figuring it out\".",

    "story": [
      "A mother said she was \"scared\" testing out the walking route to school proposed by a council after it said some children would no longer be eligible for free transport.",
      "Surrey County Council (SCC) told the parents of 81 children from West Molesey that free buses to Esher High School would be ending after it had identified a safe walking route of less than three miles (5km).",
      "Parent Plamena Naydenova, who tested the route in \"broad daylight\", said she was \"scared\" and that it was \"dangerous, muddy and isolated\".",
      "SCC told parents in a letter the route \"was found to be safe\" by its safer travel team, explaining it \"considers road safety of a walked route by an accompanied child\".",
      "Children who live more than three miles (5km) from their nearest school are eligible for free buses.",
      "The new route, across the heath and beside the River Mole, brings the distance down to just under that mark, meaning this group no longer qualifies for the service.",
      "Ms Naydenova added: \"The walk took 83 minutes, which I think is unacceptable for children to walk twice a day.\"",
      "Fellow parent Kate Maxwell added: \"I have walked it in the past and felt very unsafe as an adult, so I have no idea how that could be considered safe for a child to do.",
      "\"I believe it to be actually quite dangerous. There's parts of the heath where you lose network coverage.\"",
      "SCC, which said it spent about \u00a365m a year on school transport, said local authorities are \"not legally obliged to provide free transport just because parents perceive the route to be unsafe on the grounds of personal safety and security\".",
      "It told parents that case law said assessments \"must look at the relationship between pedestrians and traffic only\".",
      "Councillor Clare Curran, cabinet member for education, has previously said: \"We are not suggesting that families have to use this route to get to school; they are welcome to use other independent routes or transport methods.\"",

    "summary": "The Hollywood star plays famous opera singer Maria Callas in a new biopic.",
    "story": [
      "Angelina Jolie is notoriously private.",
      "But in a new interview with BBC News, the Hollywood star spoke candidly about her experience of working on set with her eldest sons, saying they saw \"the pain\" she usually hides from them.",
      "The actress is starring in a new biopic, titled Maria, about opera singer Maria Callas.",
      "Two of Jolie's six children with ex-husband Brad Pitt, Maddox and Pax, took on roles as production assistants on the film.",
      "\"The character [Callas] has a lot of pain and they've of course seen me go through a lot of things, but they hadn't experienced me expressing a lot of the pain that usually a parent hides from a child,\" she said.",
      "\"So they were there to witness some of that, but then we would hug or they would bring me cups of tea.\"",
      "Jolie added that it was \"a new way\" of finding out how to be honest with her children about her feelings, \"in an even greater way\".",
      "Written by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight, the film focuses on Callas's final years, in the 1970s, when she was living in Paris.",
      "With Jolie taking on acting roles relatively infrequently in recent years, the film has provided something of a comeback narrative for her and could lead to an Oscar nomination for best actress.",
      "Callas was a US-born Greek soprano, and one of opera's best-known singers.",
      "In Maria, a blend of Jolie's own voice and original recordings by Callas are used in the singing scenes.",
      "The actress learnt to sing opera for the role, something she describes as \"very physically demanding\".",
      "Training took around seven months, she said.",
      "\"We started with regular singing classes and it was challenging in many ways, but when the opera classes began, what it requires with your breathwork and your body and just the force of what you push through yourself, it's just a very different physicality.\"",
      "Jolie, whose previous film credits include Changeling, Maleficent, Salt, and Mr & Mrs Smith, said she hasn't sung before, and was \"actually quite shy about singing\".",
      "\"It was probably one of the areas in my life that I was hesitant,\" she said.",
      "But she indicated that it was also something she enjoyed.",
      "\"One of the greatest privileges of being an actor is you often are supported by a crew to try something and explore something you've never done and this certainly was most challenging,\" she said.",
      "Jolie's sons Maddox, 23, and Pax, 21, have worked on a number of productions with her before, including her film Without Blood.",
      "Both of them accompanied her at the New York City premiere of Maria in September, alongside their younger sister Zahara.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt in September 2016. The pair were engaged in a custody battle that resulted in Pitt being awarded joint custody in 2021.",
      "The Hollywood stars also share daughters Shiloh and Vivienne, and another son Knox.",
      "On the set of the film, both Maddox and Pax were \"very busy\", director Pablo Larra\u00edn said. \"They were good professionals,\" he added.",
      "Jolie said that during filming, Pax recorded a lot of her singing practice \"so he was with me in my early horrible days,\" she laughed.",
      "\"It's always good for your children to watch your mum not do something easily, but swear and fight and fail and have to try again,\" she said.",
      "\"So that's an important and beautiful thing.\"",
      "Maria is the third in a trilogy of films about high-profile, complex women from Larra\u00edn, following his movies about Jacqueline Kennedy and Princess Diana.",
      "The film has received mixed reviews, although critics have generally praised its central performance.",
      "\"Jolie is absolutely spellbinding as Maria Callas, imbuing her with grace and resolve,\" said Sophia Ciminello of AwardsWatch. \"She doesn't disappear into the role, she transcends.\"",
      "Time's Stephanie Zacharek was less keen on her performance, however, saying Jolie \"plays her subject as haughtily cool and deeply insecure, but captures none of her imperious charisma\".",
      "Hailed as La Divina, \"The Divine One\", Maria Callas began singing at 14 years old.",
      "One of her most famous performances was as Tosca, in Covent Garden, in 1964.",
      "But vocal decline, possibly caused by dramatic weight loss, led to the premature end of her career.",
      "She spent her last years living largely in isolation, and died of a heart attack aged 53.",
      "Larra\u00edn said he hoped his film honoured Callas's desire to popularise the art form.",
      "\"If this movie bring attention to opera from one to hundred to a million, it will be a success,\" he said.",
      "\"I don't know if there is an art form as strong as opera,\" Jolie added.",

    "story": [
      "Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war, according to BBC research.",
      "In a comprehensive analysis of Facebook data, we found that newsrooms in the Palestinian territories - in Gaza and the West Bank - had suffered a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
      "The BBC has also seen leaked documents showing that Instagram - another Meta-owned platform - increased its moderation of Palestinian user comments after October 2023.",
      "Meta - the owner of Facebook - says that any implication that it deliberately suppressed particular voices is \"unequivocally false\".",
      "Since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war, just a few outside reporters have been allowed to enter the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza from the outside, and they were only able to do so escorted by the Israeli army.",
      "Social media has filled the gap for those wanting to hear more voices from inside Gaza. Facebook pages for news outlets such as Palestine TV, Wafa news agency and Palestinian Al-Watan News - which operate out of the West Bank territory - became a vital source of updates for many around the world.",
      "BBC News Arabic compiled engagement data on the Facebook pages of 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations in the year leading up to the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and in the year since.",
      "Engagement is a key measure of how much impact a social media account is having and how many people are seeing its content. It includes such factors as the number of comments, reactions and shares.",
      "During a period of war, audience engagement might be expected to rise. However, the data showed a 77% decline after the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.",
      "Palestine TV has 5.8 million followers on Facebook. Journalists at the newsroom shared statistics with us showing a 60% drop in the number of people seeing their posts.",
      "\"Interaction was completely restricted, and our posts stopped reaching people,\" says Tariq Ziad, a journalist at the channel.",
      "Over the past year, Palestinian journalists have raised fears that their online content is being \"shadow-banned\" by Meta - in other words, restricted in how many people see it.",
      "To test this, we carried out the same data analysis on the Facebook pages of 20 Israeli news organisations such as Yediot Ahronot, Israel Hayom and Channel 13. These pages also posted a large amount of war-related content, but their audience engagement increased by nearly 37%.",
      "Meta has previously been accused by Palestinians and human rights groups of failing to moderate online activity fairly.",
      "An independent report in 2021 commissioned by the company said this was not deliberate but because of a lack of Arabic-speaking expertise among moderators. Words and phrases were being interpreted as offensive or violent, when they were in fact innocuous.",
      "For example, the Arabic phrase \"Alhamdulillah\", which means \"Praise be to God\", was sometimes being auto-translated as \"Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom\".",
      "To see if this explained the decline in engagement with Palestinian outlets, the BBC carried out the same analysis on Facebook pages for 30 prominent Arabic-language news sources based elsewhere, such as Sky News Arabia and Al-Jazeera.",
      "However, these pages saw an average increase in engagement of nearly 100%.",
      "Responding to our research, Meta pointed out that it had made no secret of \"temporary product and policy measures\" taken in October 2023.",
      "It said it had faced a challenge balancing the right to freedom of speech, with the fact that Hamas was both US-sanctioned and designated as a dangerous organisation under Meta's own policies.",
      "The tech giant also said that pages posting exclusively about the war were more likely to see engagement impacted.",
      "\"We acknowledge we make mistakes, but any implication that we deliberately suppress a particular voice is unequivocally false,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Leaked Instagram documents",

      "The twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey.",
      "At least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. If Sir David Attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing Angels and Rock DJ is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail.",

      "\"There have been a lot of musical biopics,\" says Gracey. \"I wanted to come at this with a different lens.",
      "\"Quite often Rob will say, 'I'm just like a performing monkey' or 'I'm up the back like a performing monkey'.",
      "\"It just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see Rob, but how he sees himself.",
      "\"And so I pitched the idea to Rob. I said, 'You know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'\"",
      "Williams takes up the story: \"I was looking for some self-worth at the time and I was like, 'I am a lion'. And he just cocked his head and went, 'Mmmm.'",
      "\"I went, 'Monkey?'",

They used a combination of motion capture and CGI, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by English actor Jonno Davies, best known as Tobias in the Al Pacino TV series Hunters.",

      "The death earlier this year of One Direction's Liam Payne, who he mentored on The X Factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after.",
      "\"It's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and I want to head that. I want to do that,\" he says.",
      "\"It has to be creative people, not members of Parliament or record company bosses. I think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.\"",

      "\"I realised this was going to be 10 years of my life as a games developer and I was a little torn,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.",
      "As video games have become more advanced the time - and budgets - needed to create them have grown.",
      "For the people in charge of those projects it can mean committing a big chunk of your life, career and identity to them.",
      "And there are few projects on the scale of the new Final Fantasy VII series.",
      "A trilogy of games remaking the beloved 1997 classic with updated visuals, full voice-acting and a wealth of side content, it is a massive undertaking.",
      "So far, it has gone well. The first two games, subtitled Remake and Rebirth, released to excellent reviews and both were nominated for a string of awards.",
      "Mr Hamaguchi most recently accepted a Game Award for best score and music at the industry's biggest ceremony in Los Angeles.",
      "Newsbeat speaks to him at the Golden Joysticks in London, where Rebirth scoops prizes for Best Soundtrack, Best Storytelling and performance.",
      "The initial announcement of developer Square Enix's intention to split the project into three was met with some scepticism - the original game could be completed in about 40 hours.",

      "For example, emerging markets such as the Middle East and South East Asia \"are undergoing very rapid economic growth\" and creating a new generation of gamers.",
      "\"It's really interesting to see so many young people getting into gaming in these regions,\" he says.",
      "In contrast to making a game 20 years ago, developers need to make sure cultural references work across regions where video games are more popular than they once were.",
      "The games market is tougher, too.",
      "Square Enix has said Rebirth - which released exclusively on PlayStation 5 - did not perform as well as it had hoped, and it recently confirmed a PC version would be coming soon.",
      "People play on more platforms and there's evidence that many gamers are sticking with a \"home game\" such as Fortnite, Roblox or Call of Duty for longer periods.",
      "Drawing them away is hard, but Mr Hamaguchi says the buzz from an awards nomination can give a game a boost.",
      "\"Previously we'd release a game on a console and it would sell very well for the first couple of weeks,\" he says.",

      "Zakir Hussain, the legendary tabla virtuoso and global ambassador of Indian classical music who has died aged 73, leaves behind a timeless rhythmic legacy that will inspire generations.",
      "A child prodigy, he collaborated with Indian classical icons like Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan, and Shivkumar Sharma and global musicians like John McLaughlin and George Harrison.",
      "Born on 9 March, 1951, in Mahim, Mumbai, he was the eldest son of Ustad Allarakha, one of history's most iconic players of the tabla - a pair of traditional Indian hand played drums.",
      "Hussain's journey, from a child prodigy to an internationally celebrated percussionist, was a masterclass in balancing tradition and innovation.",
      "Hussain's life revolved around rhythm from the very beginning.",
      "The sound of the tabla was his first language, his earliest \"words\". By the age of 12, he was already performing globally, accompanying stalwarts like Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan during his teenage years.",
      "While rooted in the Hindustani classical tradition, Hussain possessed an insatiable curiosity that propelled him to explore other genres, leading to ground-breaking collaborations across the world.",
      "In 1973, he co-founded Shakti with guitarist John McLaughlin, a group that fused Indian classical music with jazz and Western traditions, creating a new global sound.",
      "Over five decades, Shakti evolved, featuring luminaries like violinist L Shankar, percussionist Vikku Vinayakram, and mandolin maestro U Srinivas.",
      "Their first studio album in 46 years, This Moment, won the Grammy for Best Global Music Album in 2024, marking a fitting finale to their 50th-anniversary tour. Hussain's virtuosity on the tabla was pivotal to Shakti's success and to the global appreciation of Indian rhythms.",
      "Zakir Hussain's contributions extended far beyond Shakti.",
      "He was a key collaborator in Planet Drum and Global Drum Project, both with Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, earning him Grammy Awards in 1991 and 2008.",

He also collaborated with musicians as diverse as Yo-Yo Ma, George Harrison, Van Morrison and Billy Cobham, bringing Indian classical music to global audiences.",
      "His ventures like Tabla Beat Science, a fusion of Indian classical music with electronic and world music, and orchestral works such as Peshkar for the Symphony Orchestra of India showcased his unrelenting drive to innovate while respecting his roots.",
      "\"The moment you think you're a maestro, you are distancing yourself from the others,\" Hussain told Rolling Stone India magazine earlier this year. \"You have to be part of a group, and not dominate it.\"",
      "This philosophy made him not only a consummate artist but also a lifelong learner and mentor.",
      "Hussain's flamboyance and speed and precision of his performances earned him widespread admiration.",
      "The New York Times, in its review of a 2009 jazz performance at Carnegie Hall, described his artistry as embodying \"an impish strain of virtuosity\".",
      "\"He's a fearsome technician but also a whimsical inventor, devoted to exuberant play. So he rarely seems overbearing, even when the blur of his fingers rivals the beat of a hummingbird's wings.\"",
      "His accolades are as numerous as the beats he crafted.",
      "A recipient of the Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri, Hussain was also a National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellow in the United States. He delighted audiences at prestigious venues like Carnegie Hall and collaborated with jazz legends, Western classical orchestras, and Carnatic music maestros.",
      "Despite his global acclaim, Hussain remained deeply connected to his Indian roots. His early years in a modest chawl - large tenement complexes - in Mahim shaped his values.",
      "\"For the first three-and-a-half years of my life, we all lived in one room that had no toilet. We had to use the common toilets,\" Hussain told Nasreen Munni Kabir.",
      "Offstage, Hussain was an avid reader and a fan of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. He loved poetry, cricket, and tennis, counting Roger Federer among his heroes. His curiosity extended to biographies of musical greats like Ravi Shankar and Miles Davis, reflecting his hunger for stories that transcended boundaries. Hussain would also later say that his TV advert for a popular tea brand - Taj Mahal - \"made me famous in India\".",
      "Hussain's death marks the end of an era but leaves an indelible mark on global music. Kabir, who chronicled his life, aptly captured his essence: \"Zakir's extraordinary playing and the extreme sense of rigour he brought to his art made him a phenomenon.\"",
      "Music for Hussain was not just a career but a spiritual journey - a way to connect with people, traditions, and cultures across the globe.",
      "In his final years, Hussain remained as active as ever, performing, mentoring, and composing.",
      "\"Being a student and having a drive to learn keeps me going. The opportunity to get inspired by all the young musicians out there helps me revamp myself. Age doesn't affect my energy and drive,\" he said last year."

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 02:35:49 GMT",
    "summary": "The girl group scored a top 10 album last month, but say UK R&amp;B groups \"can feel under-appreciated\".",
    "story": [
      "2023 was supposed to be Flo's year.",
      "A few months before the calendar flipped over, the London-based girl band made a huge splash with their debut single, Cardboard Box, a sassy kiss-off to a cheating ex that drew on the girl group sounds of En Vogue, SWV and Destiny's Child.",
      "Selling 205,000 copies, the song helped the trio top the BBC's Sound Of 2023 poll (beating Fred Again into second place) and become the first girl group to win the Brits' Rising Star prize.",
      "Hot on the heels of those accolades, they scored their first Top 40 hit with Fly Girl \u2013 featuring a rare guest spot from the elusive Missy Elliot.",
      "Then... silence.",
      "The band's debut album Access All Areas was originally slated to drop last year, but it kept getting pushed back. Usually, that means trouble behind the scenes. Internal squabbles, personnel issues, record label skullduggery.",
      "But Jorja Douglas, Ren\u00e9e Downer and Stella Quaresma dismiss those clich\u00e9s.",
      "Instead, they say they were laser-focused on making the best album possible, even if it meant keeping fans waiting.",
      "\"We can't just release any old piece of music,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"We take it very seriously and, especially for our first album, we want to represent ourselves in the best way with the best message.\"",
      "In the end, that meant scrapping a huge number of completed tracks half-way through the recording sessions.",
      "They did so on the advice of LVRN (Love Renaissance), the US management company who helped launch the careers of Summer Walker and 6lack.",
      "\"They came on board during the recording process and they were like, 'Come on, guys, this ain't gonna cut it',\" recalls Downer.",
      "\"It was hard to hear because you become biased [towards the songs you have] but they really opened our eyes to the fact that we could do better.",
      "\"We're very open to criticism, even if we felt a little emotional at the time.",
      "\"But then we quickly realised that, OK, this is for the good.\"",
      "Reinvigorated, they doubled their efforts, criss-crossing the Atlantic to work with new writers and producers while \"filling in the blanks\" in their lyrical themes and \"honing their sound\".",
      "\"It was a long process because it was very detailed,\" explains Downer.",
      "The wait was worth it.",
      "Released last month, Flo's debut album Access All Areas quickly picked up rave reviews.",
      "\"If a girl group's main job is to supply harmonies for days and kick out songs that roll around your head like marble, Access All Areas achieves it all,\" said Pitchfork, awarding the album 8 out of 10.",
      "DIY called it \"a definitive debut\" while Rolling Stone asked \"Are Flo the next great girl group?\"",
      "In the UK, the album entered the charts at number three \u2013 making Flo the highest-charting British R&B girl group in 23 years (matching the chart position of Mis-Teeq's debut album Lickin' On Both Sides).",
      "\"We're grateful everyone's enjoying it,\" says Douglas. \"It feels like our artistry is a bit more real, like we've got a bit more credit to our names and we're moving in the right direction.\"",
      "From a certain perspective, their success seems pre-ordained.",
      "Since the demise of Little Mix, there's been a girl band-shaped hole in the pop charts. And, because pop always travels in 20-year cycles, there's a renewed interest in the harmony-driven hits of the 2000s.",
      "Flo know those songs back-to-front. Although Quaresma \"wasn't even born\" when Mis-Teeq made the top three, the girls were all raised on the music of Brandy, Faith Evans and Mariah Carey.",
      "That education came at home. All three are only children, and all three were raised by music-loving single mums.",
      "The shared background helped them forge a unique bond \u2013 first at stage school, where Renee and Stella met, then during auditions for Flo, where they hooked up with Jorja.",
      "\"Being in a girl group is one thing, but finding each other has given it a totally different meaning,\" says Jorja.",
      "\"I wouldn't feel the same if I was with two other girls that kind of came from a different background.",
      "\"It's like we're one person that's got some kind of personality disorder!\"",
      "'Hardest music to sell'",
      "That strength helped them hold firm when, in the early days, managers tried to change the band's line-up; and it made them fight for Cardboard Box to be their debut single, against record label advice.",
      "Studying R&B taught them more than how to harmonise \u2013 it showed them how the music industry, particularly in the UK, can be stacked against black women.",
      "Time after time, promising artists like Jamelia, Sadie Ama and even Raye have been let down by labels that don't know how to promote R&B to a UK audience. Others, like Mahalia and Ella Mai, have focused on breaking the US, where the genre has deeper roots.",
      "\"That's the music I love the most, and it's probably the hardest music to sell in this country,\" Radio 2's Trevor Nelson told The Guardian last year. \"It just is. It's always been.\"",
      "On the album track, I'm Just A Girl, Flo address that situation over a dark, electronic beat.",
      "\"How many black girls do you see on centre stage now? / Yet you wonder why they going to the States now.\"",
      "\"I actually think we've been pretty lucky, but we've definitely seen little comments here and there, or people not being accustomed to the music that we make,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"When we go out in the UK, people love R&B, but I think people who make the decisions in the industry in the UK aren't so familiar with it. So I think it can make people feel a little bit unappreciated.",
      "\"I think what sets us apart is that we speak about it,\" says Downer. \"We're all thinking it, all the R&B artists in the UK. We're not content with making music and it reaching fewer people.",
      "\"We're very happy that we're starting to be seen as the catalyst for change,\" adds Quaresma, \"but it's obviously a problem\".",
      "For now, the trio are playing the game. The first single from Access All Areas was the irresistibly catchy Walk Like This, a pop hit in R&B clothing. Then they targeted urban radio with the slinky, serpentine grooves of Caught Up.",
      "\"We're constantly doing  a push and pull between 'this is a bit more pop-leaning, and this is more R&B',\" says Downer.",
      "\"We have to be open to putting our pop foot first sometimes, because of the world that we live in. But a few years down the line, it's gonna be different.\"",
      "R&B aficionados have already locked on to the band's deliciously seductive grooves.",
      "Wicked star Cynthia Erivo voices the introduction to their album, while the deluxe edition features guest appearances from Chl\u00f6e and Halle, GloRilla and Bree Runway.",
      "Last year, they were VIP guests on Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance tour (\"Right next to her dad. It was a bit nerve-wracking, to be honest\") and they spent autumn on the road with US soul star Kehlani.",
      "\"It shows us the trajectory,\" says Downer. \"Obviously, we're not going to be doing anything like Renaissance for years \u2013 but it's nice to start envisioning the road map of our live shows.\"",
      "Which reminds me: The last time we spoke to Flo was in 2022, and they'd just been given treadmills, so they could build up the stamina to sing and run at the same time. How did that work out?",
      "\"It didn't last that long,\" admits Quaresma. \"Mine got sold.\"",
      "The lack of stamina came back to bite them on their US tour - not on stage, but at an afterparty.",
      "\"We were in New Orleans and Kehlani insisted we try out a mechanical bull,\" says Downer.",
      "\"We were all very bad,\" laughs Quaresma. \"It's much harder than it looks.\"",
      "\"I thought I had the core strength but, really, I did not,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"It's not just core strength,\" Downer adds. \"It's thighs, it's legs, it's arms.\"",
      "\"Maybe, for the next tour, we should just get mechanical bulls instead of treadmills.\"",
      "Watch this space."

      "\"We were really panicked, we were really worried.... [thinking] 'What have we done, is she okay, is it long-term damage?'\"",

      "This premium is meant to cover the administrative burden of identifying patients and pursuing payment.",
      "While aimed at tackling \"health tourism\", the charging system has exemptions for vulnerable groups including asylum seekers and trafficking victims.",

      "There has been \"a catastrophic rise\" in deaths caused solely by alcohol in England over the past four years, government figures suggest.",
      "More than 8,200 people died because of alcohol in 2023 - a 42% rise on 2019 - with the North East having the highest rates.",

      "The government says it's unacceptable that alcohol deaths are at record high levels and it will prioritise public health in its 10-year plan for the NHS in England.",
      "What is minimum pricing for alcohol and how does it work?",
      "During the pandemic, deaths caused by alcohol rose sharply across the UK. Heavier drinkers were drinking more while others, including more moderate drinkers cut down or gave up entirely.",
      "And when pubs were shut, many people started buying alcohol in shops and drinking at home.",
      "Since then, deaths have continued to go up in England - although more slowly than in previous years. Most deaths are among men, who are dying early - before the age of 75 - from alcohol-related liver disease.",
      "Analysis by the Institute of Alcohol Studies suggests 55-74-year-olds \"are now the heaviest-drinking age group\", which it says could be driving current trends.",
      "Another factor could be the cost-of-living crisis which may have triggered heavier drinking among people faced with higher bills.",

      "Its chairman, Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, said: \"Without bold, decisive action, these preventable deaths will continue to climb. Addressing alcohol harm must be a top public-health priority in 2025, and it requires a cross-government effort to turn the tide on this public-health crisis.\"",

      "The Alliance says minimum unit pricing of alcohol in Scotland, introduced in 2018, \"has proven effective in reducing alcohol-related harm\".",
      "The minimum cost of a unit of alcohol there has risen from 50p to 65p in recent months. This means no alcoholic drink can be sold for anything below this price.",

      "The provisional figures cover spending from April next year, and will be subject to consultation and potential further revision in February.",

      "Ministers argue this will make the system fairer because councils in poorer areas are less able to raise income locally, but it has prompted a backlash from the County Councils Network, which represents large county authorities.",
      "The CCN said rural areas were set to lose out, and argued that deprivation is not a \"key indicator of which councils are under the most financial distress\".",
      "This argument is set to grow louder next year, when the government consults on introducing a stronger link between overall funding and deprivation from 2026 as part of a wider shake-up of council financing.",

      "Next year's settlement includes an extra \u00a3200m to help councils with responsibility for adult social care to provide subsidies for care costs, taking total funding in this area to \u00a33.7bn next year.",

      "The LGA has also argued extra costs for contractors will mean some council services will become more expensive to deliver.",
      "Shadow local government minister David Simmonds said the government's funding boost was \"beautifully packaged\" but councils would find the \"box is somewhat emptier than people were expecting\" given funding pressures.",
      "He added that councils also faced uncertainty over the costs of funding local elections next year, after the government confirmed plans this week to merge councils as part of a major shake-up of the council map."

      "MPs regularly meet constituents as part of their job and often advocate for them if they are having problems accessing local services.",

      "Tens of thousands of pensioners are unlikely to receive their Winter Fuel Payments before the end of the year as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has been grappling with a growing backlog of new claims for Pension Credit, analysis by BBC Verify suggests.",
      "There has been a surge in applications for Pension Credit since Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in July that Winter Fuel Payments for this year would be mainly limited to those receiving Pension Credit.",
      "There was a backlog of 90,000 unprocessed claims as of mid-November with around 9,000 being processed each week, according to the latest official figures.",
      "With a likely similar amount of new applications each week since then, there is a  risk that there will still be a backlog of tens of thousands by the end of the year.",
      "The DWP said it had deployed 500 additional staff to speed up processing.",
      "Gary Jameson in Oxford applied for Pension Credit in early September, well in advance of his 66th birthday, so he wouldn't lose out when his disability benefits stopped. But his birthday has been and gone and he has still not had a decision.",
      "\"I'm having to transfer money from my own private savings, which are not very much anyway,\" he told BBC Verify.",
      "He was originally told it would take six to 10 weeks to process his claim, \"but I think with all the delays it will probably be months,\" he added.",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "How much is the state pension going up?",
      "Pensioners encouraged to claim",
      "On 18 December, MPs are launching an inquiry into how changes to the Winter Fuel Payment are affecting pensioner poverty.",
      "Before the chancellor's announcement on 29 July, the average number of weekly applications in the UK for Pension Credit, where the government tops up a pensioner's income, was 3,800.",
      "Since August, it's been averaging around 9,400 following campaigns by the government and charities, encouraging people to claim.",
      "The DWP has released data showing there were around 150,000 new applications for Pension Credit in the UK between 29 July and 17 November.",
      "However, the Pensions Minister, Emma Reynolds, told Parliament on 4 December that the total number of unprocessed Pension Credit applications in the end of week commencing 18th November was 91,075.",
      "Not all applications, once processed, are successful and get awarded Pension Credit - around 45% of applications processed since 29 July have been approved.",
      "BBC Verify heard from Simon Livingston in Brighton, who told us he had applied for Pension Credit for his mother in March and was still waiting for a decision.",
      "And Jackie Newberry in Hook in Hampshire applied for Pension Credit for her 95-year-old mother Ena in February and was told she would get a decision by mid-March.",
      "After chasing several times she was finally told her claim had been approved in early December.",
      "'Manage through Christmas'",
      "DWP data shows that in the week of 18 November, the average processing time for a Pension Credit application was 65 working days, or 13 weeks, up from 9 weeks at the end of July.",
      "That average processing time, unless it has picked up, would mean eligible people who submitted an application in November or December would likely not receive their \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 Winter Fuel Payment - and backdated Pension Credit payment -  until February or March 2025.",
      "The former pensions minister, Steve Webb, who is now a partner at pension consultants LCP said: \"Although they will eventually receive arrears once Pension Credit comes into payment, including any Winter Fuel Payment to which they would have been entitled, most who were on the waiting list by mid November are likely to have to manage through Christmas and the New Year on a very modest income until their claim is processed\".",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"Over a million pensioners will still receive the Winter Fuel Payment, and our drive to boost Pension Credit take up has seen applications more than double with over 40,000 more pensioners now receiving it, as well as the Winter Fuel Payment.\"",
      "\"We have deployed additional staff to support processing applications, seeing a 51% increase in the number of cleared claims since the Chancellor's announcement.\"",
      "The Scottish government has announced that from late 2025 every Scottish pensioner household will receive a winter fuel payment.",
      "The numbers in the UK at risk of delayed payments this year are uncertain because it depends on the rate at which DWP officials are working through the backlog.",
      "More claims processed",
      "The DWP data does point to a significant pick up in the rate at which claims are being processed.",
      "In August, it was processing around 4,500 claims per week. In the first half of November, it was getting through an average of around 9,000.",
      "However, the official backlog figures only go up to the middle of November. There are likely to have been tens of thousands more applications since then.",
      "BBC Verify asked the DWP for the most up-to-date figures for the size of the backlog and the average processing time and they pointed us to the published figures from the middle of November.",
      "The government has set 21 December as the deadline by which eligible people can apply for Pension Credit in time to receive the 2024-25 Winter Fuel Payment.",
      "In 2022, only 63% of those eligible for Pension Credit are estimated by DWP to have claimed it.",
      "After the means-testing of the Winter Fuel Payment was announced in July, the government estimated its awareness campaign would push the take-up rate to 68% - equivalent to an additional 100,000 people.",
      "However, this would still leave roughly 780,000 eligible pensioners who would not be receiving either the Pension Credit or Winter Fuel Payment to which they are entitled because they have not applied.",

      "Senior judges have upheld a decision by MI5 to warn that an alleged Chinese agent had infiltrated Parliament and funded a Labour MP and others.",
      "In a highly significant judgment, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) said that the security service had acted within the law when it named Christine Lee as a threat to national security, in an \"interference alert\" distributed to Parliamentarians and consequently made public.",
      "The IPT said that naming Ms Lee had been \"necessary in a democratic society\" and \"a proportionate response to the threat she posed\".",
      "The January 2022 alert warned that Christine Ching Kui Lee had established links for the Chinese Communist Party with current and aspiring MPs.",
      "Why did MI5 go public with an alert about this woman?",
      "China denies 'agent' infiltrated UK parliament",
      "Foreign lobbying may be next big scandal, MPs warn",
      "The alert also said she had organised donations to politicians.",
      "The ruling from the IPT is the second in days, underlining the scale of suspected Chinese state infiltration in the British state.",
      "It comes hours after the naming of Yang Tengbo as the businessman who was said, in a separate court ruling last week, to have won an unusual degree of trust from Prince Andrew.",
      "Neither Ms Lee nor Mr Yang are facing prosecution over the separate allegations made against them and both have denied wrongdoing.",
      "Ms Lee, a solicitor, had said that her involvement with Parliament had been to \"represent the UK Chinese and increase diversity\".",
      "But the MI5 alert to parliamentarians said that she was \"knowingly engaged in political interference and activities on behalf of the United Front Work Department (UFWD) of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\".",
      "The UFWD is an arm of the CCP's intelligence network that seeks to wider influence and poverty interfere in British society by targeting leading figures in British society, from politicians through to business and academia.",
      "Ms Lee's alleged work for the UFWD included facilitating financial donations to political parties, parliamentarians and aspiring MPs - donations that had come from sources in China and Hong Kong.",
      "One of the MPs funded by Ms Lee was Labour's Barry Gardiner, who received more than \u00a3420,000 from her in five years.",
      "He employed Ms Lee's son, Daniel Wilkes, until the alert emerged.",
      "Mr Gardiner has said that he had always made the security services aware of the donations.",
      "After the alert was issued, Mr Gardiner sacked Mr Wilkes from his office staff. The pair later reached an out-of-court settlement.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Politics Live, Mr Gardiner said that while he had been Ms Lee's friend for many years before the alert, he had ceased contact with her afterwards.",
      "He stressed that he had received no illegal money into his office.",
      "\"MI5 were quite clear about that,\" the MP said. \"[Ms Lee] paid directly for people who I appointed, and who had no dealings with her, to work for the public good in my office.",
      "\"But none of that money came from an illegal source. She has never been charged with any offence.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey also received a \u00a35,000 donation when he was energy secretary - but he said the money had been accepted by his local association and the alert had been \"the first time\" had had been made aware of concerns.",
      "In Tuesday's judgment, the IPT rejected claims from Ms Lee and Mr Wilkes that their rights had been breached by MI5.",
      "Lord Justice Singh and two other IPT panel members said that the interference in Ms Lee's private life, by publicising her name, did not breach her human rights.",
      "\"There is no ... positive obligations on the state to take action to prevent treatment by others, here in particular the media and private individuals who sent abusive messages to the First Claimant [Ms Lee],\" said the IPT.",
      "\"The Respondent [MI5] had no particular control over the actions of the media or other third parties.",
      "\"The Respondent was entitled to issue the Interference Alert, and indeed had an obligation to do in order to fulfil its statutory function of protecting Parliamentary democracy.",
      "\"There is no evidence that the abusive messages and social media commentary directed to or received by [Ms Lee] represented a genuine and ongoing threat to her safety and, even if they did, there is no evidence that the police or other state authorities are unable or unwilling to provide [her] with reasonable protection.",
      "\"The decision to issue the Interference Alert did not interfere with [her] right to respect for her private life.\""

    "story": [
      "Campaigners have reacted with fury to what they call the government's \"unjustified\" rejection of compensation for women hit by changes to the state pension age.",
      "They say 3.6 million women born in the 1950s were not properly informed of the rise in state pension age to bring them into line with men.",
      "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall apologised for a 28-month delay in sending letters, but has rejected any kind of financial payouts.",
      "Nine months ago, a parliamentary ombudsman recommended compensation of between \u00a31,000 and \u00a32,950 for each of those affected.",
      "The Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) campaign described the government's decision as an \"insult\".",
      "\"The government has today made an unprecedented political choice to ignore the clear recommendations of an independent watchdog,\" said Angela Madden, who chairs the campaign group.",
      "\"This is a bizarre and totally unjustified move which will leave everyone asking what the point of an ombudsman is if ministers can simply ignore their decisions.\"",
      "The Waspi campaign had called for payments of at least \u00a310,000 each.",
      "But Kendall said there was evidence that there was \"considerable awareness\" of the changes to the pension age, and sending letters earlier would not have made a difference to their ability to make retirement choices.",
      "She also said that there was no evidence of \"direct financial loss\" resulting from the government's decision, and that Labour did not believe \"paying a flat rate to all women at a cost of up to \u00a310.5bn would be fair or proportionate to taxpayers\".",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he understood the Waspi women's concerns, but had to take into account whether it was right \"to impose a further burden on the taxpayer\".",
      "However, former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who pledged to compensate the women in the party's 2019 manifesto, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that the money would not have had to be paid in a year but over \"quite a long period of time\".",
      "\"These Waspi women... are actually taxpayers also, and they're people that have made an enormous contribution to our lives and society,\" he said.",
      "How the saga unfolded",
      "The age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer, and currently stands at 66 for men and women.",
      "But for decades, men had received their state pension at 65 and women at the age of 60.",
      "Under the 1995 Pensions Act a timetable was drawn up to equalise the age at which men and women could draw their state pension. The plan was to raise the qualifying age for women to 65 and to phase in that change from 2010 to 2020.",
      "But the coalition government of 2010 decided to speed that up. Under the 2011 Pensions Act the new qualifying age of 65 for women was brought forward to 2018.",
      "The increases have been controversial. Campaigners say women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by the rapid changes and the way they were communicated to those affected.",
      "Many thousands said they had no idea they would have to wait longer to receive their state pension, and had suffered financial and emotional distress as a result.",
      "What is the row over women's state pension?",
      "While the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) could recommend compensation, it could not enforce it.",
      "The work and pensions secretary said the government would develop an action plan to fix problems identified in the ombudsman's report, and set a clear notice of any future changes to the state pension age.",
      "She said that future pension communications would also use \"the most up to date methods\" to contact those affected.",
      "Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling said the government had \"turned its back on millions of pension-age women who were wronged through no fault of their own\".",
      "For the Conservatives, who did not respond to the ombudsman's report when in power, shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately said ministers must \"own\" the decision not to give payouts.",
      "A petition to Parliament for a compensation system to be introduced had reached 135,000 signatures before Tuesday's announcement.",
      "Change of tack",
      "The Waspi campaign and others have highlighted previous comments made by the the prime minister, as well as Kendall, before they came to power.",
      "Both spoke of the \"injustice\" that the women faced, with such a post from 2019 still on the latter's website.",
      "Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said:  \"The fact that many of the women affected will also be coping with the loss of their Winter Fuel Payment this year will intensify their sense of injustice.\"",

    "summary": "Navin Ramgoolam says the original agreement did not benefit his nation enough.",
    "story": [
      "Mauritius says it has submitted changes to a proposed deal over the future of the Chagos Islands, with the country's new PM saying the original agreement did not benefit his country enough.",
      "Under the terms of the original agreement, which was announced in October, the UK would relinquish sovereignty to Mauritius over the archipelago but maintain a 99-year lease over Diego Garcia, home to a major UK-US military airbase.",
      "It was finalised shortly before an election which then-Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth lost in a landslide defeat.",
      "His successor Navin Ramgoolam has since said he had reservations about the deal, which has also attracted criticism from the opposition Conservative party in the UK and officials in the incoming Trump administration.",
      "When the agreement was first made public after years of talks, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Jugnauth called it a \"seminal moment in our relationship and a demonstration of our enduring commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes and the rule of law\".",
      "The British government has said that it also \"protects the long term secure operation of [the military] base\".",
      "Soon after coming into office last month, however, Ramgoolam asked legal experts to review the terms of the deal.",
      "Speaking in the Mauritian parliament on Tuesday, Ramgoolam said that his government had submitted counter-proposals aimed at ensuring that the final agreement aligned with the nation's interests.",
      "\"During the discussions, Mauritius made clear that while it is still willing to conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom, the draft agreement which was shown to us after the general elections is one which, in our view, would not produce the benefits that the nation could expect from such an agreement,\" Ramgoolam told MPs.",
      "He did not spell out what the counter-proposals were or the exact nature of the objections.",
      "Ramgoolam confirmed that the UK's response to these proposals was received on Monday and is currently under review.",
      "A delegation of senior officials from the UK, led by Harriet Mathews, director general for Africa, the Americas, and Overseas Territories at the Foreign Office, visited Mauritius last week.",
      "Accompanied by British High Commissioner Charlotte Pierre, she met Ramgoolam on 11 December to further the negotiations.",
      "\"We remain confident the agreement is in both sides interests and will continue to work with the new Mauritius government to finalise the deal. We've always said we'll engage with the new administration in order to finalise the deal,\" Sir Keir's spokesperson said, adding that there was no timeline on the deal.",
      "The only hint at what might be the issue from the Mauritian side are comments made last month by Arvin Boolell, the minister of agro-industry and fisheries.",
      "He criticised the former prime minister for granting the UK a long lease over Diego Garcia - he said it was 200 years, though the publicised timeframe was an initial period of 99 years.",
      "\"In other words,\" Boolell remarked to a newspaper, \"the tenant has become the owner of Diego Garcia for 200 years.\"",
      "In the UK meanwhile, the opposition Conservative party said on Tuesday that the terms of the proposed deal were \"disadvantageous to the United Kingdom\".",
      "In a letter to Sir Keir, the shadow defence and foreign secretaries said they had \"grave concerns about your Government's plan to surrender sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory - and to pay for the privilege of doing so\".",
      "\"Our view remains that the legal justification you have used for giving away sovereignty is flawed, and it is therefore no surprise that the terms reached are so disadvantageous to the United Kingdom,\" James Cartlidge and Priti Patel said.",
      "In recent years, the UK has faced rising diplomatic isolation over its claim to what it refers to as the British Indian Ocean Territory, with various United Nations bodies - including its top court and general assembly - overwhelmingly siding with Mauritius and demanding the UK surrender what some have called its \"last colony in Africa\".",
      "The government of Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the Chagos Islands away in return for its own independence from the UK in 1968.",
      "At the time, the British government had already negotiated a secret deal with the US, agreeing to lease it the largest atoll, Diego Garcia, for use as a military base.",
      "Britain later apologised for forcibly removing more than 1,000 islanders from the entire archipelago and promised to hand the islands to Mauritius when they were no longer needed for strategic purposes.",
      "Until very recently, the UK insisted that Mauritius itself had no legitimate claim to the islands.",

      "Regular pay grew at a faster-than-expected annual pace of 5.2% between August and October, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, with wages continuing to grow faster than prices.",
      "Analysts say the latest figures mean the Bank of England will almost certainly not cut interest rates when it meets this week.",
      "The ONS data also suggested the jobs market is weakening, with job vacancies falling again and a drop in the number of people on payrolls.",
      "The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.3%, although there are questions over the reliability of the jobs figures from the ONS due to problems with gathering the data.",
      "\"After slowing steadily for over a year, growth in pay excluding bonuses increased slightly in the latest period driven by stronger growth in private sector pay,\" said Liz McKeown, director of statistics at the ONS.",
      "Private sector pay grew at an annual pace of 5.4%, the ONS said, while in the public sector it was 4.3%.",
      "The Bank of England watches the pay and jobs data closely when making decisions on interest rates.",
      "It has cut rates twice this year as inflation - which measures the rate at which prices are increasing - has fallen.",
      "The Bank meets to discuss rates again this week, but it is not expected to make a further cut given the strength in pay growth.",
      "\"The latest UK jobs report provides yet more justification, if any were needed, for the Bank of England to keep rates on hold at its meeting this week,\" said James Smith, developed markets economist at ING.",
      "Mr Smith noted that the jump in wage growth was entirely down to the private sector.",

      "Monica George Michail, associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: \"With low inflation, workers have been making real income gains.",

      "He works in building materials supply, and says for the last two years, his average pay rise has been about 1%.",
      "He thinks some people must be getting very large wage rises for the average increase to be 5.2%.",
      "\"If I were to get anything over 2%, I'd think it was a mistake,\" he says.",
      "Even with a small Christmas bonus last year his average salary rises have \"always been below\" the average.",
      "The number of job vacancies fell by 31,000 to 818,000 in the September-to-November period, the ONS said, although the total remains above pre-pandemic figures.",
      "Liz McKeown from the ONS said the while the number of people on payrolls grew slightly in October, the annual growth rates \"continue to slow\".",
      "The ONS also said provisional data indicated that the number of staff on payrolls fell by 35,000 last month, although analysts said this figure is volatile and can be subject to large revisions.",
      "Many firms have argued the increase in National Insurance Contributions for employers that was announced in the Budget will lead them to cut back on hiring.",
      "At the weekend, the boss of Reed, one of the UK's largest recruitment firms, told the BBC the economy was \"cooling\", suggesting a recession may be \"around the corner\".",

      "Angela Rayner has said she wants every region of England to get a mayor, as she outlined plans for a major redesign of local government.",
      "The deputy prime minister told the BBC giving regional mayors more powers over housing, transport, education and employment would help drive economic growth.",
      "Under the proposals, the government also wants to merge areas where there are currently two tiers of local authority - smaller district and larger county councils - in a bid to streamline services.",
      "But the body representing district councils has warned the plans could spark \"turmoil\" and argued \"mega-councils\" could undermine local decision-making.",
      "In a speech announcing the plans, Rayner said devolution would be the \"default\" rather than \"at the whim of a minister in Whitehall\".",
      "She described the UK as the \"most centralised\" country in Europe and pledged to end \"micromanaging by central government\".",
      "Rayner said the government would work with local leaders to deliver its plans but where they are unable to agree on a way forward, ministers would get the power in law to \"knock heads together\" and create larger authorities.",

      "In some places, responsibility for local services is shared between county councils, which manage areas including social care and education; and district councils, which cover smaller areas and are responsible for services such as bin collections.",
      "Some areas, particularly larger towns and some cities, have \"unitary\" authorities responsible for both - while the regions surrounding big cities are increasingly covered by multi-council \"combined\" authorities with greater powers in areas such as transport policy, planning and housing.",
      "The Conservatives created 11 such areas, which have an elected \"metro\" mayor, and set a target that every part of England that wanted greater powers in some form would get a devolution deal by 2030.",
      "Despite this, around half of England's population live in an area not covered by a devolution deal.",
      "The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more homes.",
      "It has now outlined its ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals.",
      "Ministers see streamlining local government as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, in an attempt to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment.",
      "Elected mayors would then oversee areas representing two\u00a0or more councils, and be handed more powers over things such as planning decisions and public transport.",
      "Dozens of district councils could be abolished as a result \u2013 prompting some to claim it would deprive people of genuinely localised decision-making.",
      "It would require a series of deals nationwide emulating North Yorkshire, which now has a unitary authority after eight councils were merged together last year.",
      "This would mark a scale of reorganisation that goes beyond what Labour promised in its election manifesto, and amount to arguably the biggest shake-up of local government since the 1970s.",
      "Labour argues the overhaul will make local government simpler and produce savings by making the delivery of services more efficient.",
      "The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved.",
      "Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\".",
      "She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\".",
      "The Conservatives said Rayner's announcement was part of a plan to \"strip councils of their powers\" and to impose reorganisation from Westminster \"without local consent\".",
      "The Liberal Democrats said council budgets were \"on the brink\" and without properly investing in social care more vital services would disappear.",
      "However, the proposals have been welcomed by the County Councils Network, which says its members \"now recognise the need to embrace the benefits\" of devolution in the face of \"significant financial challenges\".",
      "Cllr Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association, said \"genuine devolution of powers and resources can play a huge role in promoting inclusive economic growth, creating jobs, and improving public services\".",
      "She said her members were \"open to change\" but \"remain clear that local government reorganisation should be a matter for councils and local areas to decide\".",
      "Since returning to office in July, Labour has announced four devolution deals: Greater Lincolnshire, Hull and East Yorkshire, Devon and Torbay, and Lancashire.",

      "It means inflation has been above the Bank of England's target for two months in a row.",
      "The Bank moves interest rates up and down to try to keep inflation at 2%, and has cut twice in 2024, taking rates to 4.75%.",
      "What is inflation?",
      "Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time.",
      "For example, if a bottle of milk costs \u00a31 but is \u00a31.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%.",

      "Inflation has fallen significantly since it hit 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years.",
      "However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly.",
      "Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine.",

      "The Bank also considers other measures, external, such as \"core inflation\" when deciding whether and how to change rates.",
      "Core inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends. The measure was 3.5% in November, up from 3.3% in the year to October.",

      "However, after the Budget at the end of that month, the Bank predicted that the policies it contained - such as an increase in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers -  would lift inflation slightly as businesses would pass on their increased costs through higher prices.",
      "Announcing the November rate decision, Mr Bailey indicated any further cuts were likely to be gradual, adding: \"We need to make sure inflation stays close to target, so we can't cut interest rates too quickly or by too much.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 15:56:14 GMT",
    "summary": "What difference could the biggest shake up of local government in 50 years make to your area?",
    "story": [
      "The deputy prime minister has announced plans for the biggest reorganisation of local government in England in over 50 years.",
      "Angela Rayner wants to give everyone a directly elected mayor, and incorporate district councils into wider authorities.",
      "She hailed the proposals as a \"turning point when we finally see communities, people and places across England begin to take back control over the things that matter to them\", to an audience of regional mayors, local government and business leaders.",
      "But what difference could it make to your local area?",
      "Bins, libraries, parks \u2013 all delivered by one council",
      "Local government across England is often referred to as a patchwork.",
      "Some places have both district and county councils that each provide some services; some places have one council that does everything, and some places have a mayor who oversees that.",
      "Rayner's plan is to make the system similar across England. So bins and libraries, planning and leisure centres will all fall under one, single council.",
      "The government says merging councils could save \u00a32bn. That comes amid a bleak picture of council finances across the country.",
      "Neighbouring areas would then be grouped together under what's called a strategic authority with a directly elected metro mayor. Recent examples of this include Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, who now fall under the East Midlands Combined County Authority, and elected their first mayor, Labour's Claire Ward, in May.",
      "Half of the population of England currently have an elected mayor, with research suggesting they're well known locally.",
      "Polling from the non-partisan think tank the Centre for Cities suggests that mayors are the most recognisable local political figures in their area, with three-quarters of people knowing who they are - way ahead of MPs or council leaders.",
      "Powers over local economies \u2013 and more money from Whitehall",
      "Mayors will have to come up with local growth plans for their areas to help kickstart the economy.",
      "They'll have to work with major employers, universities, colleges and industry bodies in their areas, identifying sectors for growth in the region.",
      "Local leaders will then need to put in place the conditions for growth, like college courses and Jobcentre support that match local skills gaps. The hope is all of this will create jobs, with the government saying that local leaders have a better understanding of the strengths and ambitions of an area than Whitehall.",
      "\"We must rewire England and end the hoarding in Whitehall by devolving power and money from central government to those with skin in the game,\" Rayner said.",
      "Mayoral devolution deals also usually come with a 30-year investment fund of hundreds of millions of pounds. Some mayors also have powers to charge their own precept on council tax - although not all those that do have that power actually charge one.",
      "Areas that can demonstrate sound financial management will get so-called integrated settlements. That means they get one pot of money from Whitehall and can choose to allocate it how they see fit, rather than specific budgets for specific things.",
      "London-style transport networks across the country",
      "Local mayors are to be given powers over their area's transport under the plans.",
      "It could mean London-style networks, where buses and light commuter trains are all run as part of the same system.",
      "Some areas which already have mayors are doing this already. Greater Manchester has taken all bus services back under control as part of the Bee Network alongside its Meterolink tram, with plans to add commuter trains to the system by 2028.",
      "And in West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin is bringing buses back under her control, with plans to build a mass tram system as well.",
      "Research by the Centre for Cities suggests that transport has the most cut-through of all policies mayors had put in place.",
      "Mayors would also have more powers over e-bike schemes under the plans, with the ability to fine users and companies whose cycles were left in a hazardous way.",
      "More roads, junctions and reservoirs?",
      "Mayors would be given responsibilities for strategic planning. That means they'd have to come up with plans for building housing and infrastructure.",
      "Housing is one of the government's top priorities, with a pledge to build 1.5m more houses in England before the next election.",
      "Local authorities wouldn't get a say in how many houses they have to build, after areas were given targets. But they would get a say in how to manage housing growth in their region, helping identify areas for building and making decisions on affordable housing.",
      "They'd also be able to charge developers a levy to help pay for the infrastructure needed to support the increase in homes, such as roads, major junctions and reservoirs. They'd also have a say in freight and logistics.",
      "And mayors would be able to intervene in planning applications they see to be strategically important to an area - similar to the government saying they'll intervene in applications that are strategically important to the whole country, like prisons.",
      "A right to buy pubs, historic buildings and sports facilities",
      "Local communities currently have a right to bid for local community assets that are at risk of being lost.",
      "This includes things like sports facilities, historic buildings, pubs, libraries and cafes, as well as local news outlets and youth clubs.",
      "The government says it wants to replace this right to bid with a right to buy, with funding available to purchase community assets.",
      "Local communities and businesses will also be given powers to rent shops that have been vacant for a long time, helping to revitalise high streets."

    "story": [
      "\"There isn't an easy or nice way of doing it.\"",
      "It's a blunt reality check from a former Home Office minister describing one of the government's most pressing dilemmas - how to crack down on the illegal trade of smuggling people into Britain.",
      "The prime minister, his cabinet colleagues and nearly all their political rivals agree that this trade must end. People from all over the world risk their lives to try and get here - and hundreds of communities are affected when those who make it are sent to live in hotels or other accommodation while their cases are dealt with.",
      "But there's huge disagreement over what should be done.",
      "Labour replaced Rishi Sunak's \"stop the boats\" slogan with its own three word mantra: \"smash the gangs\". One of Sir Keir Starmer's first acts was to ditch the Conservatives' plan to send people who arrived in the UK without permission straight to Rwanda.",
      "Conservatives fume that Labour got rid of what might, theoretically, have stopped smugglers and migrants in their tracks. Frankly, we don't even know if the first plane would have left the tarmac, and Conservatives can't be sure that it would have worked as a deterrent \u2013 but the government can't be sure that it wouldn't have.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who will be on our show on Sunday morning, has instead concentrated on trying to do deals with other countries to stop the criminals who exploit the distress and ambition of those desperate to come to the UK. This weekend we're with her in Italy as she brokers more cooperation with other governments.",
      "The jargon is to \"disrupt at source\", to hamper the gangs, and cut the number of people who get into flimsy rubber boats in the cold seas in the hope of making it to the UK.",
      "There's been no shortage of activity. The measures agreed so far range from the UK paying to help train border security forces in Iraq to a new criminal offence being created to prosecute people smugglers in Germany. There have also been deals with Slovakia, Slovenia, and Kurdistan, as well as cash for Sudan, Chad, Vietnam, and Egypt.",
      "She's also focused on speeding up the system that decides what happens to those who make it here and are living in a horrible limbo, and on returning more people back home. For years the backlog of cases has run to the tens of thousands \u2013 an unhappy status quo.",

      "Starmer confirms Rwanda deportation plan 'dead'",
      "'Stop the boats' slogan was error, says Cleverly",
      "So the overall approach is pretty clear: make it harder for people to get here without permission, and sort out what happens to those who do much faster.",
      "But clear is not the same as effective.",
      "Since Labour's been in power the number of people making the crossing in small boats has gone up. More than 20,000 have arrived since July, up from 17,000 in the same period last year. And the government has admitted that the number of hotels being used to house asylum seekers has also risen since the election, to more than 35,000 people as of September.",
      "The government is well aware of the unhappiness this causes to some of the public, seeing migrants \"walk on to the coast like they're getting ferries\", one insider says. And there is acknowledgement that this hotel housing causes a \"major problem with social cohesion\", says the same source.",
      "It's not unheard of for Labour MPs and even some now ministers to object publicly to groups of new arrivals, who aren't allowed to work, being put up at the taxpayers' expense in communities without the right support or infrastructure, and without full explanation or support for local people either.",
      "But ending the use of these hotels has become one of the promises Labour made during the election that is proving harder than they suggested to keep.",
      "Cooper's team, though, point to increasing number of failed asylum seekers being returned to their countries, and progress they have made in cutting the backlog of cases stuck in the system.",
      "Neither stopping using hotels nor specifically cutting migration numbers or stopping the boats have made it on to Sir Keir's very public list of \"milestones\". Never fear, say sources in his operation \u2013 it's not a milestone but a \"foundation\". What on earth does that mean? In short, the government is well aware of how important it is that it gets a grip on illegal immigration and sources suggest the PM himself is spending a lot of time concentrating on it, and that it's on the agenda with every world leader he sees.",
      "But No 10 won't repeat the practice of previous administrations, creating specific targets or setting lofty goals on immigration. Maybe it's trap they won't set for themselves.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "That lack of a visible measure of success, however, leaves the government open to accusations that they are not taking the public's concern seriously enough. If there are targets for health, why not immigration? If there are numbers for kids' education, why not boats?",
      "With Nigel Farage's Reform Party on the march in some polls, Labour's opponents are on the hunt for any sniff of a lack of commitment to making immigration a top concern. The Conservatives fume that Labour gave up the chance of a deterrent that may or may not have prevented cross channel journeys taking place. They cite Australia, where boats were turned around and Belgium, where police have intercepted boats in the water.",
      "One Tory strategist said there has been a \"lack of political will\" to solve the problem. The economy relies on migration, so gearing up the government machine to confront legal and illegal immigration requires a more fundamental level of honesty about the trade-offs that are needed, they say.",
      "The criticism comes from inside Labour itself, too.",
      "\"There's a fear, a lack of courage,\" one source in the party tells me \u2013 with others describing Cooper as cautious. The only way to solve the hideous problem of vulnerable people arriving into the UK in a chaotic manner would be to do something entirely different, some argue, such as opening up more safe routes for people to come to the UK or developing so-called humanitarian visas to help those in danger flee their countries (although that wouldn't necessarily stop others making the dangerous small boats journey).",
      "Sir Keir's leadership does not want to argue that it should be easier for people in desperately poor countries to move to the UK. Yet there are Labour voices who say a more grown up and honest conversation is required. Last year, I spoke to five former home secretaries about how hard it was to manage immigration, and they all felt they'd been hampered by the politics of the issue.",
      "Labour, right now, does not want to pick a bolder deterrent, like the Conservatives' Rwanda plan, or a more radical humanitarian approach. As so often, Sir Keir is picking what seems a pragmatic tack \u2013 do reasonable things better, and hope (like hell) that with enough effort, it works.",
      "It is, critics on the right and left say, a muddle in the middle.",
      "As 2025 approaches there is little doubt about the importance or the political emotion that surrounds the issue of illegal immigration. But nothing's obvious about the viability of the government's solutions \u2013 or the success or failure of what they are trying to do.",

      "The UK has joined a trade pact with several countries in Asia and the Pacific, including Japan and Australia.",
      "The name of this pact - CPTPP - is a mouthful, but it's a club of more than 500 million people the UK will have greater access to.",
      "So what does it mean for businesses and households?",
      "What is the CPTPP?",
      "The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is a trade agreement between 11 nations: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.",
      "Those founding members signed the Pacific trade pact in March 2018.",
      "Between them, they generate 13% of the world's income.",
      "The UK is the first non-founding country to join, and will be the pact's second biggest economy after Japan. It takes the value of the new grouping to \u00a311 trillion.",
      "Representatives from CPTPP countries signed the rebranded Pacific trade pact in March 2018",
      "What's in it for the UK?",
      "The short-term gains are marginal.",
      "The UK already had deals with the majority of these nations as part of its EU membership which have been carried over.",
      "Since Brexit, the UK has added Australia and New Zealand to its trade deal tally.",
      "It was just Brunei and Malaysia left that the UK didn't have a deal with and between them those two account for less than 0.5% of the total of UK trade.",
      "Even with some changes to the trading arrangements with other countries, the gains from the expanded accord is expected to be fairly small - around 0.08% of GDP over 10 years, according to the government's best stab at an estimate, external.",
      "However the Business and Trade Secretary likens CPTPP to a start-up, indicating the estimates do not account for the fact that some members - for example, Vietnam - are rapidly growing in importance in global trade.",
      "Even so, by contrast, leaving the EU, the government's independent forecasters reckon, will have reduced the UK's growth by far more - perhaps 4% of our income, external.",
      "In total, the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019 - less than we sold to Germany.",
      "What changes?",
      "The key perk is greater access to each others' markets, and a pledge to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges or tariffs.",
      "But some are kept to protect sensitive domestic areas, such as Japan's rice farming industry.",
      "Also, manufacturers that get components from lots of different places can claim their products qualify for preferential treatment.",
      "That means they can tick the so-called \"rules of origin\" box, as long as 70% of those components come from any of the participating countries.",
      "The provisions could help UK producers of items such as machinery and medicines - our most valuable exports to those nations - by reducing their costs and allowing them to expand their supply chains across the constituent countries.",
      "Away from trade, membership means investors from CPTPP countries get the same treatment as domestic firms when they put money into projects taking place in other member states, which could benefit UK firms.",
      "In 2017, the CPTPP nations accounted for about \u00a31 in every \u00a312 of foreign investment in the UK, and the same going the other way - supporting business and jobs.",
      "In return, countries must co-operate on regulations, such as food standards.",
      "However, unlike the European Union, the CPTPP is neither a single market nor a customs union.",
      "So countries are not required to have identical regulations and standards.",
      "And countries can strike their own trade deals with others, as the UK has with the EU - although membership of the CPTPP would not be compatible with re-joining the EU itself.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "In short, what has the UK had to agree to as the price of admission?",
      "Some, including members of a House of Lords committee, want to know how the UK intends, for example, to ensure environmental and animal welfare standards will be met.",
      "The government has pointed out that CPTPP allows members to set their own levels of protection and it would not compromise the UK's standards.",
      "As part of the agreement, the UK will grant Canadian farmers more access to UK markets - but hormone-treated meat will still be banned.",
      "And it is conceding to lower tariffs on imports of Malaysian palm oil - which has been blamed for aiding deforestation. Those charges currently can be up to 12%.",
      "Trade unions have voiced concerns that plans to encourage more investment could allow multinational companies to legally challenge British policies - although trade experts say this capacity exists in other trade deals, and hasn't ever been successfully exercised against the government.",
      "What about the future?",
      "The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year.",
      "It is the partnership's potential that is key.",
      "The agreement will loosen restrictions on services and digital trade, which matches the UK's ambitions, and ties it in with some of the faster-growing nations.",
      "But the biggest rewards - and challenges - could occur if others join the club.",
      "China is among those vying to sign up, as is Taiwan.",
      "Could the UK veto China's membership? Or use its membership to shape China's access and ambitions?",
      "The real prize would be if the US reverses the decision made by President Trump not to sign up.",
      "America buys about double the amount of UK exports than the current CPTPP nations put together, but membership doesn't appear to be on President Biden's to-do list.",
      "At present, membership of the CPTPP is a mainly symbolic win for post-Brexit Britain.",

    "summary": "Climate change makes it trickier for Churchill's residents to co-exist with increasingly hungry predators",
    "story": [
      "\"Can I give you some polar bear advice?\" asks Tee, a confident 13-year-old we meet during a visit to a high school in Churchill, Canada.",
      "\"If there's a bear this close to you,\" she says as she measures a distance of about 30cm with her hands, \"make a fist - and punch it in the nose.",
      "\"Polar bears have very sensitive noses - it'll just run away.\"",
      "Tee has not had to put this advice to the test. But growing up here - alongside the planet's largest land predator - means bear safety is part of everyday life.",
      "Signs - in shops and cafes  - remind anyone heading outside to be \"bear aware\". My favourite reads: \"If a polar bear attacks you must fight back.\"",
      "Running away from a charging polar bear is \u2013 perhaps counterintuitively - dangerous. A bear's instinct is to chase prey and polar bears can run at 25mph (40kmph).",
      "Key advice: Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Don't walk alone at night.",
      "Churchill is known as the polar bear capital of the world. Every year, the Hudson Bay - on the western edge of which the town is perched - thaws, and forces the bears on shore. As the freeze sets in in Autumn, hundreds of bears gather here, waiting.",
      "\"We have freshwater rivers flowing into the area and cold water coming in from the Arctic,\" explains Alysa McCall from Polar Bears International (PBI). \"So freeze-up happens here first.",
      "\"For polar bears, sea ice is a big dinner plate - it's access to their main prey, seals. They're probably excited for a big meal of seal blubber - they haven't been eating much all summer on land.\"",
      "There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. This is one of the most southerly and best studied.",
      "\"They're our fat, white, hairy canaries in the coal mine,\" Alysa explains. \"We had about 1,200 polar bears here in the 1980s and we've lost almost half of them.\"",
      "The decline is tied to the amount of time the bay is now ice-free, a period that is getting longer as the climate warms. No sea ice means no frozen seal-hunting platform.",
      "\"Bears here are now on land about a month longer than their grandparents were,\" explains Alysa. \"That puts pressure on mothers. [With less food] it's harder to stay pregnant and to sustain those babies.\"",
      "While their long-term survival is precarious, the bears draw conservation scientists and thousands of tourists to Churchill every year.",
      "We tag along with a group from PBI to search for bears on the sub-Arctic tundra - just a few miles from town. The team travels in a tundra buggy, a type of off-road bus with huge tyres.",
      "After a few distant sightings, we have a heart-stopping close encounter. A young  bear approaches and investigates our slow two-buggy convoy. He sidles up, sniffs one of the vehicles, then jumps up and plants two giant paws up on the side of the buggy.",
      "The bear casually slumps back down onto all fours, then looks up and gazes at me briefly. It is deeply confusing to look into the face of an animal that is simultaneously adorable and potentially deadly.",
      "\"You could see him sniffing and even licking the vehicle - using all his senses to investigate,\" says PBI's Geoff York, who has worked in the Arctic for more than three decades.",
      "Being here in 'bear season' means Geoff and his colleagues can test new technologies to detect bears and protect people. The PBI team is currently fine-tuning a radar-based system dubbed 'bear-dar'.",
      "The experimental rig - a tall antenna with detectors scanning 360 degrees - is installed on the roof of a lodge in the middle of the tundra, near Churchill.",
      "\"It has artificial intelligence, so here we can basically teach it what a polar bear is,\" Geoff explains. \"This works 24/7, it can see at night and in poor visibility.\"",
      "Polar bear attacks are rare, but they are a risk for people who live and work in isolated Arctic environments. Earlier this year, a Canadian worker was killed by two polar bears near a remote defence station in Canada's northern Nunavut territory.",
      "Co-existing with these ice-dependent predators, when the Arctic climate is changing faster than at any time in history, creates a paradoxical challenge for Churchill: The polar bear population here faces long-term decline. But, in the short term, the bears are spending more of their year on shore, increasing the probability of bears and people coming into contact.",
      "Protecting the community is the task of the polar bear alert team - trained rangers who patrol Churchill every day.",
      "We ride along with ranger Ian Van Nest, who is looking for a stubborn bear that he and his colleagues tried to chase away earlier that day. \"It turned around and came back [towards] Churchill. He doesn't seem interested in going away.\"",
      "For bears that are intent on hanging around town, the team can use a live trap: A  tube-shaped container, baited with seal meat, with a door that the bear triggers when it climbs inside.",
      "\"Then we put them in the holding facility,\" Ian explains. Bears are held for 30 days, a period set to teach a bear that it is a negative thing to come to town looking for food, but that doesn't put the animal's health at risk.",
      "They are then moved - either on the back of a trailer or occasionally air-lifted by helicopter \u2013 and released further along the bay, away from people.",
      "Cyril Fredlund, who works at Churchill's new scientific observatory, remembers the last time a person was killed by a polar bear in Churchill, in 1983.",
      "\"It was right in town,\" he says. \"The man was homeless and was in an abandoned building at night. There was a young bear in there too - it took him down with its paw, like he was a seal.\"",
      "People came to help, Cyril recalls, but they couldn't get the bear away from the man. \"It was like it was guarding its meal.\"",
      "The polar bear alert program was set up around that time. No-one has been killed by a polar bear here since.",
      "Cyril is now a technician at the new Churchill Marine Observatory (CMO). Part of its remit is to understand exactly how this environment will respond to climate change.",

      "\"We can do all kinds of controlled experimental studies looking into changes in the Arctic,\" says Prof Feiyue Wang.",
      "One implication of a less icy Hudson Bay is a longer operating season for the port, which is currently closed for nine months of the year. A longer season during which the bay thaws and becomes open water could mean more ships coming in and out of Churchill.",
      "Studies at the observatory are setting out to improve the accuracy of the sea ice forecast. Research will also examine the risks associated with expanding the port. One of the first investigations is an experimental oil spill. Scientists plan to release oil into one of the pools, test clean-up techniques and measure how quickly the oil degrades in the cold water.",
      "For Churchill's mayor, Mike Spence, understanding how to plan for the future, particularly when it comes to shipping goods in and out of Churchill, is vital for the town's future in a warming world.",
      "\"We're already looking into extending the season,\" he says, gesturing towards the port, which has ceased operating for the winter. \"In ten years' time, this will be bustling.\"",
      "Climate change poses a challenge for the polar bear capital of the world, but the mayor is optimistic. \"We have a great town,\" he says, \"a wonderful community. And the summer season - [when people come to see the Beluga whales in the bay] - is growing.\"",
      "\"We're all being challenged by climate change,\" he adds. \"Does that mean you stop existing? No - you adapt. You work out how to take advantage of it.\"",
      "While Mike Spence says \"the future is bright\" for Churchill, it might not be so bright for the polar bears.",
      "Tee and her friends look out over the bay, from a window at the back of the school building. The polar bear alert team's vehicles are gathering outside, trying to move a bear away from town.",
      "\"If climate change continues,\" muses Tee's classmate Charlie, \"the polar bears might just stop coming here.\"",
      "The teacher approaches to make sure the children have someone coming to pick them up - that they're not walking home alone. All part of the daily routine in the polar bear capital of the world.",

      "Around eight million properties in England - or one in four - could be at risk of flooding by 2050 as the danger increases due to climate change, the Environment Agency (EA) has said.",
      "In its first assessment of how a warming world could affect flooding, the EA warned of increasing threats from heavier rainfall and rising sea levels.",
      "The number of at-risk properties could be even higher if more houses are built on floodplains, but could be lower if flood defences are improved.",

      "\"The frequency and severity of the kind of flood events that we've been experiencing are likely to become more and more challenging,\" Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency, said.",
      "The EA considers flooding from three main sources: rivers, the sea and surface water - where heavy rainfall overwhelms drainage systems.",
      "It defines properties as being \"at risk\" when the yearly chance of flooding is greater than one-in-1,000.",
      "Currently, the EA says that 4.6 million homes and businesses are at risk of surface flooding, with London the most affected region.",
      "This is a 43% rise on its previous estimate, but this is almost entirely due to improved datasets and computer modelling techniques, rather than a real-world increase in flood risk.",
      "However, the EA says that climate change could raise the number of properties at risk of surface flooding to around 6.1 million by the middle of the century.",
      "It is well-documented that a warming world generally increases the intensity of heavy rainfall.",
      "Between October 2023 and March 2024, for example, the amount of rainfall on the stormiest days in the UK increased by an estimated 20% on average due to climate change.",
      "The report also highlights a rising risk of flooding from rivers and the sea - from 2.4 million properties today to around 3.1 million by mid-century.",
      "The East Midlands, Yorkshire and The Humber, and south-east England are particularly at risk.",
      "This type of flooding - from rivers bursting their banks or storm surges bringing seawater onto shore - can be particularly damaging as it often brings deeper floodwaters.",
      "Wetter winters increase the chances of river flooding, while sea-level rise makes coastal flooding more likely.",
      "Global sea levels are rising mainly due to a combination of melting glaciers and ice sheets, and the fact that warmer water takes up more space. They are expected to continue rising for centuries to come.",
      "Average sea levels around the UK have already risen by nearly 20cm since 1900, with most of that occurring since 1990.",
      "This also has knock-on effects for coastal erosion - the displacement of land along coastlines due to the action of waves.",
      "The UK already has some of the fastest eroding coastlines in Europe.",
      "But climate change could increase the number of properties at risk of effectively being lost into the sea to nearly 20,000 by 2100, even if adequate shoreline management plans are put in place, the EA says.",
      "That would be up from 3,500 between now and mid-century.",
      "Preparations for flooding",
      "This report only considers how climate change affects future flood risk.",
      "There are many other factors, from building on floodplains to improvements to flood defences, that could shape the impacts of flooding in the future.",

      "Villages in early Bronze Age Britain were made up of around 50 to 100 people, so the experts think this could have equated to wiping-out almost one entire community.",
      "The Bronze Age in Britain lasted from about 2500\u20132000 BC until 800BC, and was a time when bronze replaced stone for making tools and weapons. People developed new agricultural methods, creating large and permanent farms.",
      "In the newly-identified attack there was no evidence of a fight back, suggesting the victims were taken by surprise.",
      "Scrape and cut marks on the bones indicate that the attackers systematically dismembered their victims using stone tools and likely consumed them.",
      "\"If we saw these marks on animal bones, we'd have no question that they were butchered,\" says Prof Schulting.",
      "The scientists do not believe the attackers ate the remains out of hunger because the fragments were found alongside animal bones, indicating there was sufficient food.",
      "The extensive dismembering of the bodies is the first documented case for this era.",
      "There is limited evidence that tension in this era was caused by a fight over resources.",
      "That led the experts to suspect this violence was caused by a huge breakdown in relationships.",
      "\"This was something exceptional. This level of almost erasing the person, literally chopping them into pieces, seems like something you would only do if fuelled by anger, fear and resentment,\" Prof Schulting suggests.",
      "One theory was that someone did \"something horrible that justified this in the eyes of those doing it\", he says.",
      "\"This is not a homicidal maniac. This is a community of people that came together to do this to another community,\" Prof Schulting adds.",
      "He says perhaps a culture of honour led to the attack.",
      "\"If you felt wronged, it was ultimately your responsibility to do something about it. It's not like you could go to the magistrate and ask for something to be done,\" Prof Schulting says.",
      "He suggests that this looks like a case where \"things cycled out of control and normal checks and balances failed.\"",
      "That could be because of one particularly antagonistic person who didn't \"let things rest\" or \"had their own agenda\".",
      "\"If you have those kinds of people on two sides of a conflict, it starts to spiral out of control,\" he suggests.",
      "Experts have usually believed that early Bronze Age England was not particularly violent because very limited signs of conflict have been found.",
      "There is no evidence of weapons like swords or of fortifications that would suggest communities needed to protect themselves.",
      "Before this discovery, only about 10 victims of violent attacks had been found from the period, Prof Schulting says.",
      "The scientists said they do not believe this would have been a one-off attack because \"there would have been repercussions\".",
      "\"But at some point calmer heads probably prevailed and people got on with their lives and some sense of normality returned,\" Prof Schulting suggests.",
      "He cautions that the attack should not be seen as a sign that the past was \"particularly savage and bloody\" or that \"we're beyond all of that now.\"",
      "\"I hope it gives us insights into human nature that extend beyond just the Bronze Age,\" he adds.",
      "The research is published in the academic journal Antiquity."

      "The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear last-ditch legal arguments from TikTok as to why it should not be banned or sold in the US.",
      "The US government is taking action against the app because of what it says are its links to the Chinese state - links which TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have denied.",
      "The Supreme Court justices did not act on a request by TikTok for an emergency injunction against the law, but will instead allow TikTok and ByteDance to make their case on 10 January - nine days before the ban is due to take effect.",
      "Earlier in December, a federal appeals court rejected an attempt to overturn the legislation, saying it was \"the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents\".",
      "When and why could the US ban TikTok?",
      "The Supreme Court is the highest legal authority in the US, and the decision to take on TikTok's case is significant as it only hears 100 or so cases a year out of the more than 7,000 petitions it receives.",
      "TikTok had previously argued that the attempt to ban it was unconstitutional because it would impact the free speech of its users in the country.",
      "TikTok said Wednesday it was pleased with the Supreme Court's order.",
      "\"We believe the Court will find the TikTok ban unconstitutional so the over 170 million Americans on our platform can continue to exercise their free speech rights,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to the BBC.",
      "The appeal sets up a clash between free speech and national security, according to University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias.",
      "\"The appeals court found that national security was stronger than the First Amendment contentions. However, the Justices will scrutinize the potentially conflicting, but significant, values,\" Mr Tobias said in an email.",
      "While it is difficult to predict the outcome, Cornell professor Sarah Kreps said it would be surprising to the court to overturn the prior rulings and go against the wills of both congress and the White House.",
      "\"The case has already gone through the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the lower court, all of which upheld the argument that TikTok's ownership by China-based ByteDance poses a national security risk,\" Dr Kreps said.",

      "Trump has publicly said he opposes the ban, despite supporting one in his first term as president.",
      "But he will not take office until 20 January, the day after the deadline for TikTok to be banned or sold.",

      "A group of them have made a joint filing to the court urging it to block the banning of a platform which they argue \"millions use every day to communicate, learn about the world, and express themselves.\"",
      "Kelsey Chickering from market research firm Forrester said Instagram's parent company Meta would be a major beneficiary of ban on TikTok.",
      "\"TikTok is central to a thriving creator economy, and a ban would effectively create a Meta monopoly on short-form video,\" Ms Chickering said, citing a Forrester survey that found 56% of TikTok users would switch to Instagram Reels in that event."

      "Meta - the owner of Facebook - says that any implication that it deliberately suppressed particular voices is \"unequivocally false\".",
      "Since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war, just a few outside reporters have been allowed to enter the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza from the outside, and they were only able to do so escorted by the Israeli army.",
      "Social media has filled the gap for those wanting to hear more voices from inside Gaza. Facebook pages for news outlets such as Palestine TV, Wafa news agency and Palestinian Al-Watan News - which operate out of the West Bank territory - became a vital source of updates for many around the world.",
      "BBC News Arabic compiled engagement data on the Facebook pages of 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations in the year leading up to the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and in the year since.",
      "Engagement is a key measure of how much impact a social media account is having and how many people are seeing its content. It includes such factors as the number of comments, reactions and shares.",
      "During a period of war, audience engagement might be expected to rise. However, the data showed a 77% decline after the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.",
      "Palestine TV has 5.8 million followers on Facebook. Journalists at the newsroom shared statistics with us showing a 60% drop in the number of people seeing their posts.",
      "\"Interaction was completely restricted, and our posts stopped reaching people,\" says Tariq Ziad, a journalist at the channel.",
      "Over the past year, Palestinian journalists have raised fears that their online content is being \"shadow-banned\" by Meta - in other words, restricted in how many people see it.",
      "To test this, we carried out the same data analysis on the Facebook pages of 20 Israeli news organisations such as Yediot Ahronot, Israel Hayom and Channel 13. These pages also posted a large amount of war-related content, but their audience engagement increased by nearly 37%.",
      "Meta has previously been accused by Palestinians and human rights groups of failing to moderate online activity fairly.",
      "An independent report in 2021 commissioned by the company said this was not deliberate but because of a lack of Arabic-speaking expertise among moderators. Words and phrases were being interpreted as offensive or violent, when they were in fact innocuous.",
      "For example, the Arabic phrase \"Alhamdulillah\", which means \"Praise be to God\", was sometimes being auto-translated as \"Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom\".",

      "Terry Quinn was only in his teens when he was diagnosed with diabetes. In some ways he rebelled against the label and frequent tests, not wanting to feel different.",
      "His biggest fear was of someday needing to have his foot amputated. Vision loss, another possible complication of diabetes, wasn\u2019t really on his radar. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d lose my sight,\u201d says Quinn, who lives in West Yorkshire.",
      "But one day he noticed bleeding in his eye. Doctors told him he had diabetic retinopathy: diabetes-related damage to blood vessels in the retinas. This required laser treatments and then injections.",
      "Eventually the treatments weren\u2019t enough to prevent the deterioration of his vision. He would hurt his shoulder walking into lampposts. He couldn\u2019t make out his son\u2019s face. And he had to give up driving.",
      "\u201cI felt pathetic. I felt like this shadow of a man that couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he remembers.",
      "One thing that helped him climb out of his despair was the support of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, which connected him with a black Labrador named Spencer. \u201cHe saved my life,\u201d says Quinn, who is now a fundraiser for Guide Dogs.",
      "In the UK the NHS invites patients for diabetic eye screening every one or two years.",
      "US guidelines are that every adult with type 2 diabetes should be screened at diagnosis of diabetes, and then annually if there are no issues. Yet for many people, that doesn\u2019t happen in practice.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s very clear evidence that screening prevents vision loss,\u201d says Roomasa Channa, a retina specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US.",
      "In the US barriers include cost, communication and convenience. Dr Channa believes that making the tests easier to access would help patients.",
      "To screen for diabetic retinopathy health professionals take pictures of the rear interior wall of the eye, known as the fundus.",
      "Currently, interpreting fundus images manually is \u201ca lot of repetitive work\u201d, Dr Channa says.",
      "But some think that artificial intelligence (AI) could speed up the process and make it cheaper.",
      "Diabetic retinopathy develops in fairly clear stages, which means that AI can be trained to pick it up.",
      "In some cases, AI could decide whether a referral to an eye specialist is needed, or work in tandem with human image graders.",
      "One such system was developed by the health technology company Retmarker, based in Portugal.",
      "Its system identifies fundus images that could be problematic and sends them to a human expert for further investigation.",
      "\u201cNormally we use it more as a support tool to give information to the human to make a decision,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o Diogo Ramos, Retmarker\u2019s chief executive.",
      "He believes that fear of change is limiting the take-up of AI-powered diagnostic tools like this.",
      "Independent studies have suggested that systems like Retmarker Screening and Eyenuk\u2019s EyeArt have acceptable rates of sensitivity and specificity.",
      "Sensitivity is how good a test is at detecting disease, while specificity is how good it is at detecting the absence of disease.",
      "In general, very high sensitivity could be linked to more false positives. False positives create both anxiety and expense, as they lead to unnecessary specialist visits. In general, poor-quality images can lead to false positives in AI systems.",
      "Google Health researchers have been examining the weaknesses of an AI system they developed to detect diabetic retinopathy.",
      "It performed very differently when trialled in Thailand, compared to hypothetical scenarios.",
      "One problem is that the algorithm required pristine fundus images. This was a far cry from the realities of occasionally dirty lenses, unpredictable lighting, and camera operators with different levels of training.",
      "Researchers say they have learned lessons about the importance of working with better data and consulting a wide range of people.",
      "Google is confident enough in its model that in October, the company announced that it was licensing it to partners in Thailand and India. Google also said that it was working with the Thai Ministry of Public Health to assess the cost-effectiveness of the tool.",

      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Cost is a very important aspect of the new technology.",
      "Mr Ramos says that Retmarker's service could cost around \u20ac5 per screening, though with variations according to volume and location. In the US, medical billing codes are set considerably higher.",
      "In Singapore, Daniel S W Ting and colleagues compared the costs of three models of diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "The most expensive was human assessment. However, full automation was not the cheapest, because it had more false positives.",
      "The most affordable was a hybrid model, where the initial filtering of results was performed by AI, before humans took over.",
      "This model has now been integrated into the Singapore Health Service\u2019s national IT platform and will be going live in 2025.",
      "However, Prof Ting believes that Singapore has been able to achieve cost savings because it already had robust infrastructure for diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "So the cost-effectiveness is likely to vary greatly.",
      "Bilal Mateen, the chief AI officer at the health NGO PATH, says that the cost-effectiveness data around AI tools to preserve eyesight has been fairly strong in rich countries like the UK, or a few middle-income countries like China. But that isn\u2019t the case for the rest of the world.",
      "\u201cWith the rapid advances in what AI is capable of doing, we need to ask less if it\u2019s possible, but more and more whether we\u2019re building for everyone or just the privileged few. We need more than just effectiveness data for effective decision-making,\u201d Dr Mateen urges.",
      "Dr Channa points to the health equity gap even within the US, which she hopes that this tech can help bridge. \u201cWe do need to expand it to places that have even more limited access to eye care.\u201d",
      "She also stresses that older people and people with vision problems should see eye doctors, and the convenience of AI for routinely detecting diabetic eye disease should not deter attention to all the other eye diseases. Other eye conditions, like myopia and glaucoma, have proven tougher for AI algorithms to detect.",
      "But even with those caveats, \u201cthe technology is very exciting,\u201d says Dr Channa.",
      "\u201cI would love to see all our patients with diabetes screened in a timely fashion. And I think given the burden of diabetes, this is a really potentially great solution.\u201d",
      "Back in Yorkshire, Mr Quinn certainly hopes the new tech takes off.",

    "story": [
      "Judges in the French city of Avignon have sentenced Dominique Pelicot to 20 years in prison for aggravated rape after he drugged and abused his then wife, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, and invited dozens of strangers to rape her.",
      "Dominique stood accused alongside 50 other men, of whom 47 were found guilty of rape, two guilty of attempted rape, and two guilty of sexual assault.",
      "For almost a decade, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was unknowingly given sedatives by her ex-husband, who has admitted to raping her and inviting men he had recruited online to have sex with her in her bed at home while she was unconscious and unaware.",
      "Although Dominique Pelicot admitted the charges against him, most of the other men on trial denied what they did was rape.",
      "It was Gis\u00e8le's decision to waive her anonymity and throw this trial into the open - in her words, making \"shame swap sides\" from the victim to the rapist - something which has turned the 72-year-old into a feminist icon.",
      "Dominique has also been found guilty of attempted aggravated rape of the wife of one of the co-accused, Jean-Pierre Marechal - who admitted drugging and raping his own wife, Cillia, and inviting Dominique to rape her too.",
      "Marechal was found guilty of attempted rape and aggravated rape.",
      "Dominique Pelicot was further convicted of taking indecent images of his daughter, Caroline, and his daughters-in-law, Aurore and Celine.",
      "\"I am a rapist,\" he previously told the judges. \"I acknowledge all the facts [of the case] in their entirety.\" He had begged his ex-wife and three children for forgiveness, but his actions have torn the Pelicot family apart.",
      "Prosecutors had asked for jail sentences for the defendants ranging from four years to 20 years, the maximum sentence for a charge of aggravated rape.",
      "One of the defendants, who has admitted the charges, previously called the trial rushed and \"botched\".",
      "Campaigners said this case proved the need for consent to be built into France's rape laws, as in other European countries.",
      "What is the case all about?",
      "From 2011 to 2020, Dominique Pelicot plied his wife with tranquilising drugs and sleeping pills without her knowledge, crushed them into powder and added them to her food and drink.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot suffered memory loss and blackouts because of the drugs and she has spoken of 10 years of her life that have been lost.",
      "He was eventually caught because a security guard reported him to police for taking photographs under women's skirts in a supermarket.",
      "\"I thought we were a close couple,\" she once told the court. Instead, her husband was going on a notorious but now banned website called Coco.fr to invite local men to their home to have sex with her while she was comatose.",
      "\"I was sacrificed on the altar of vice,\" Gis\u00e8le Pelicot said early in the trial.",

      "The other defendants come from all walks of life and most of them are from a 50km (30-mile) radius of the Pelicots' village of Mazan. The fact they are firefighters, security guards and lorry drivers has earned them the name Monsieur-Tout-Le-Monde (Mr Everyman). Most of them have children too.",

    "story": [
      "Crouched alone on the floor, in a tiny, windowless cell, Nasim could hear what sounded like other prisoners being tortured. The guard would bang on the door and say: \"Can you hear that beating? Get ready, you're next.\"",
      "She was \"interrogated for 10 to 12 hours every day\" and repeatedly threatened with execution.",
      "The bare cell, no more than two metres across, had no bed or toilet. Four months in solitary confinement was the 36-year-old hairdresser's introduction to Iran's notorious Evin prison. The only people she saw were her interrogators. She thought that she would \"die and no-one would know\".",
      "We have pieced together accounts from multiple reliable sources to build a picture of everyday life for Nasim and other women, who are currently being held in Evin prison.",
      "Many were among the tens of thousands of people arrested in connection with the \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" protests that followed the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September 2022. Mahsa had been arrested for allegedly breaking Iranian laws that require women to wear the hijab and she died in police custody.",
      "While people have spoken about conditions in Evin after they have been released, it is rare to get details of inmates' lives while they are still inside.",
      "What we have heard reveals not only brutality, but a place of complex contrasts where the prisoners continue to campaign for women's rights and defiantly challenge restrictions imposed on them. There are surprising moments too - one inmate, occasionally allowed time alone with her husband, has even got pregnant.",
      "Nasim - who loves rap music and make-up - was taken into custody in April 2023 after joining protests with her friends, one of whom was killed in the government crackdown. She survived interrogations \"by thinking about those who died on the street\". People who saw Nasim when she came out of solitary confinement have described cuts and bruises on her body and how she was tortured to make false confessions.",
      "Rezvaneh was also arrested following the protests, along with her husband, in 2023. They both ended up in Evin, which has separate sections for men and women. Her interrogators said they would kill her husband and \"hit him so much that he would turn black like coal, and purple like an aubergine\".",
      "After solitary confinement, interrogations and humiliation, Nasim was moved to the women's wing, that houses about 70 people, including Rezvaneh, most of whom were arrested on political charges.",
      "It is where the British-Iranian citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcilffe, who was allowed to return to the UK in 2022, spent nearly four years of her sentence.",
      "Most of the women there have been sentenced because of their activism, for offences including spreading propaganda, drawing arms against the regime, and endangering national security.",
      "They live in four crowded cells with up to 20 people in each one and bunk beds stacked three- high.",
      "Living together in cramped quarters often causes friction, and sometimes fights - both physical and verbal - break out. But the women also forge tight bonds.",
      "In winter, \"everyone is freezing\" and the women \"walk around with hot water bottles\" to stay warm. In summer, they swelter in the heat.",
      "There is a small kitchen area with a couple of hobs where - if they have enough money to buy food from the prison shop - they can cook for themselves to supplement the basic prison meals that are brought to their cells.",
      "A dark, dirty area at the end of a corridor serves as a place to smoke. A small cemented yard with a little area for plants and a volleyball net provides a bit of outside space.",
      "They can wear their own clothes and are free to move around their living quarters which have two bathrooms. Every evening, they queue to use the toilet and brush their teeth.",
      "It was here, after she had been in prison for about four months, that Rezvaneh found out she was pregnant.",
      "She had struggled with infertility for years and had given up on ever having a baby. But according to Evin's rules, she and her husband - who is still a prisoner in the men's wing - were occasionally allowed to meet in private and, on one of these occasions, she conceived.",
      "When she realised she was pregnant she \"cried for several days\".",
      "She found \"the worst thing was the mental pressure and tensions inside the prison\". Finding a quiet place in the crowded cells, where people spend most of their days sitting on their beds, was a constant challenge.",
      "The prison food left her craving apple juice, bread, and meat, which were hard to get hold of. When she could get some meat from the prison shop it was at least twice the price of meat on the outside.",
      "The prison eventually allowed her to have an ultrasound scan at four months, and doctors told her she was having a girl.",
      "As she listened to \"each heartbeat the sense of hope became stronger\". But she was afraid that the conditions in prison would endanger the baby's health. Rezvaneh was not just concerned about her diet - she has epilepsy and needed to avoid stress. Prison doctors told her she had a high risk of miscarriage.",
      "Vida, a journalist, loves to paint. She uses bedsheets for canvases and paints portraits of the other women.",
      "One, which was smuggled out of Evin, is of Kurdish prisoner Pakhshan Azizi who travelled to Kurdish areas of Iraq and Syria to help victims of the Islamic State group. Pakhshan has been sentenced to death, following charges of using arms to fight the Iranian regime, and there is great concern this sentence could be carried out soon.",
      "Vida has been warned not to draw anything with a hidden meaning. On one of the walls in the yard she painted crumbling bricks with a green forest behind them. The authorities sprayed over it.",
      "In a corridor she painted a picture of an Iranian cheetah running. Some of the women \"kept saying how much good energy they got from it\". But one night the authorities \"went and painted over it\" and restricted Vida's access to painting supplies.",
      "One of her murals has been left intact though - huge, blue ocean waves on the walls of the corridor where the women go to smoke.",
      "Getting medical care has been a constant battle for the women. One of the inmates, human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, has life-threatening heart and lung conditions.",
      "But in prison she has had to fight long and hard for access to a doctor. Relatives said that officials repeatedly blocked treatment because she refused to wear a headscarf to a medical appointment. The authorities only relented after fellow prisoners went on hunger strike for two weeks. Narges was released for 21 days at the start of December on medical grounds.",
      "Behind bars, she and the others have carried out protests, pushing the boundaries and continuing to fight for their rights. Although the law requires them to wear headscarves, many refuse. And after a long fight with the authorities, the women were allowed curtains around the beds so they could have some privacy, out of view of CCTV cameras.",
      "One of the toughest things for the women is waiting to hear their sentences. Nasim's interrogators had threatened her with the death penalty and she had to wait nearly 500 days to find out her fate.",
      "She found solace in her fellow prisoners - who she has described as sisters who give her life and act as \"a balm on the wounds\" of her wings.",
      "Every morning, one of her friends pulls aside the bed curtain and makes her get up for breakfast.",
      "\"Each day we think of something to do, so by the end of the day we can tell ourselves, 'We lived today,'\" one of our sources explains.",
      "Others spend their time reading poetry, singing, playing homemade card games and watching TV - there are two televisions where they can watch Iranian channels showing drama, documentaries and football.",
      "It is these small things that kept Nasim going while she waited for her sentence, under the constant threat of execution. When the sentence finally came, she was given six years in prison, 74 lashes and 20 years in exile in a small town far from Tehran. She had been charged with distributing propaganda and drawing arms against the Islamic Republic.",
      "Despite the severity of the sentence, Nasim felt she could breathe again, and embrace the life she thought she had lost.",
      "Three other women in the wing have been sentenced to death for drawing arms against the regime or affiliation to armed groups. However one of them has had her sentence overturned.",
      "More than 800 people were executed in Iran last year - the highest number in eight years, according to Amnesty International. Most were for crimes involving violence and drugs. A handful were women.",
      "So every Tuesday, the women protest against executions, chanting in the prison yard, refusing to move all night and staging hunger strikes. The campaign has spread through jails across Iran, gaining international support. On the anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death the women in Evin burned headscarves.",
      "There have been repercussions - sometimes the guards raid their cells and women have been beaten and injured. They can also be taken for further interrogations, put back in solitary confinement or have phone calls and visits blocked. Most of the guards are women and \"sometimes they are kind, sometimes they are cruel and hard-hearted, depending on what orders they receive from a higher authority\", says one of our sources.",
      "The Iranian government routinely denies allegations of human rights violations, saying conditions inside Evin prison meet all necessary standards and prisoners are not mistreated.",
      "As Rezvaneh's due date approached, the prison authorities allowed her to temporarily leave prison for the birth. In October, she had a baby girl.",
      "But her joy and relief at the safe arrival of her daughter is mingled with fear, sadness and anger. Her husband was not allowed out of prison with her, although she has been able to take their daughter to visit him in Evin.",
      "And because of the stress, Rezvaneh has struggled to produce breastmilk. She is expecting to be recalled to Evin prison soon with her baby daughter to serve the rest of her five-year sentence - if she's not granted an early release, that could be nearly four years.",
      "Babies are usually allowed to stay with their mothers in jail until the age of two. After that they are often sent to a close relative, or if that is not possible, they might be placed in a children's home.",
      "But rather than stop the inmates, one prisoner has said the challenges they face have made her  \"braver and stronger,\" supporting their belief that \"the future is clear: to fight, even in prison\".",

      "Israel has said its fighter jets conducted a series of strikes against military targets in Yemen belonging to the Iran-backed Houthi movement.",
      "An Israeli military spokesman said the targets included Red Sea ports and energy infrastructure in the capital Sanaa.",
      "Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported that nine people were killed in the port of Salif and the Ras Issa oil terminal, which are both in Hudaydah province.",
      "The strikes came hours after a missile fired from Yemen was intercepted over central Israel. A school and several cars were damaged in Ramat Gan on the edge of Tel Aviv.",
      "The Houthis, who control north-western Yemen, began attacking Israel and international shipping shortly after the start of the Gaza war in October 2023, saying they were acting in solidarity with Palestinians.",
      "Israel's military says hundreds of missiles and drones have since been launched at the country from Yemen, most of which have been intercepted.",
      "In the early hours of Thursday, Israelis in Tel Aviv and the surrounding area were sent rushing to bomb shelters as an incoming missile was shot down by air defences.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a missile was fired from Yemen towards Israeli territory and that damage to a school in the Ramat Efel neighbourhood of Ramat Gan was identified following the interception. No injuries were reported, it added.",
      "The IDF is investigating whether the school building collapsed after being hit by part of the missile or fragments from the interceptor missile. Education Minister Yoav Kisch said he believed it was \"a direct hit from a warhead, after it was likely intercepted\".",
      "Two hours after the attack, the IDF announced that its fighter jets had struck Houthi military targets on Yemen's west coast and inland.",
      "According to Houthi-run Al Masirah, seven people were killed by an Israeli strike on the Red Sea port of Salif, while two people were killed and one injured at the nearby Ras Issa oil terminal. Another two were reportedly injured at the port of Hudaydah, just to the south.",
      "The TV channel also said that the power stations in Haiz and Dhahban, to the south and north of Sanaa, had been struck.",
      "The director of the General Electricity Corporation, Meshaal al-Rifi, was cited as saying that the local electricity supply had been affected by damage to electricity distribution stations and fuel tanks.",
      "\"The Houthis have been carrying out attacks against Israel in violation of international law, and the Houthi regime is a threat to peace and security in the region,\" IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said.",
      "\"Today, the IDF conducted precise strikes on Houthi military targets in Yemen - including ports and energy infrastructure in Sanaa, which the Houthis have been using in ways that effectively contributed to their military actions.\"",
      "An Israeli military official said the operation was \"planned\" and that the 14 jets and other aircraft involved were \"already in the air\" when the Houthis launched their missile, according to the Financial Times.",
      "Defence Minister Israel Katz meanwhile warned Houthi leaders that \"Israel's long hand will reach you too\".",
      "\"Whoever raises a hand against the State of Israel - his hand will be cut off. Whoever harms us - will be harmed sevenfold,\" he added.",
      "Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said the group had launched two \"hypersonic\" ballistic missiles at two \"sensitive military targets\" in the Tel Aviv area at the same time as the Israeli strikes, and that the operation had \"successfully achieved its objectives\".",
      "\"The Israeli aggression will not deter Yemen and the Yemenis from performing their religious and moral duty in responding to its massacres in the Gaza Strip, as well as responding to this brutal aggression by continuing support and striking all hostile targets with appropriate weapons,\" he added.",
      "It was the third direct attack by Israel against the Houthis in five months.",
      "In July, the Israeli military struck Hudaydah's port and oil infrastructure after a Houthi drone attack killed one person in Tel Aviv. It bombed Hudaydah again in September after a Houthi missile targeted Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion international airport.",
      "The US and UK have also carried out strikes on Houthi weapons and other military targets over the past year in response to attacks on global shipping in the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.",
      "On Monday, US Central Command said it had targeted a \"key command-and-control facility\" in Sanaa that had been a hub for co-ordinating attacks.",
      "The Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks since November 2023. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third and killed four crew members.",
      "They say they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. They have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK."

      "For the uninitiated, sorting one's rubbish can be a convoluted process in Japan - a country that boasts one of the world's strictest waste disposal rules.",
      "But in the city of Fukushima, things are about to get even tougher.",
      "Starting in March, the city government will go through bags of rubbish that fall afoul of regulations - such as those which have not been sorted correctly, or which exceed size limits - and in some cases publicly identify their owners.",
      "The new regulations, passed in a municipal meeting on Tuesday, comes amid Japan's long push to enhance its waste management system.",
      "While many cities in Japan open rubbish bags to inspect them, and some allow for the disclosure of offending businesses, Fukushima is believed to be the first city that plans to disclose the names of both individuals and businesses.",
      "In a statement to the BBC,  the Fukushima Waste Reduction Promotion Division said that waste which had not been properly disposed has previously led to scattered rubbish and the proliferation of crows.",
      "\"The improper disposal of waste is a major concern as it deteriorates the living environment of local residents,\" said the department.",
      "Waste which is not properly sorted also leads to more landfill, the department added, \"which imposes a burden on future generations\".",

      "Last year, Fukushima reported over 9,000 cases of non-compliant rubbish.",
      "Currently, instead of collecting rubbish that does not comply with disposal rules, workers usually paste stickers on the bags informing residents of the violation. Residents would then have to take them back inside, re-sort it and hope they get it right the next time collectors come around.",
      "Under Fukushima's new rules, if the rubbish remains unsorted for a week, city workers can go through it and try to identify the offenders via items such as mail. The violators will be issued a verbal warning, followed by a written advisory, before the last resort: having their names published on the government website.",
      "Amid privacy concerns, Fukushima authorities said that the inspection of the rubbish would be carried out in private.",
      "Japanese cities each have their own guides on how to dispose of rubbish. In Fukushima, rubbish bags have to be placed at collection points every morning by 0830 - but cannot be left out from the night before.",
      "Different types of waste - separated into combustibles, non-combustibles, and recyclables - are collected according to different schedules.",
      "For items that exceed stipulated dimensions, like household appliances and furniture, residents have to make an appointment for them to be collected separately.",
      "Fukushima's mayor, Hiroshi Kohata, said that the new rules were meant to promote waste reduction and proper disposal methods.",
      "\"There is nothing illegal about publicising malicious waste generators who do not abide by the rules and do not follow the city's guidance and advisory,\" the Mainichi quoted authorities as saying.",
      "Rubbish is taken very seriously in Japan, where since the 1990s the government has made it a national goal to shift away from landfills, reduce waste and promote recycling. Local authorities have introduced their own initiatives in line with this goal.",
      "Residents in Kamikatsu, a Japanese town with an ambitious zero-waste goal, proudly sort their rubbish into 45 categories. Kagoshima prefecture has made it mandatory for residents to write their names on their rubbish bags. And last year the city of Chiba piloted an AI assistant to help residents dispose their rubbish properly."

      "It is vital that Syria's new leadership keeps its promises to respect the rights of all the country's diverse religious and ethnic groups, according to UN Special Envoy Geir Pedersen.",
      "Mr Pedersen, speaking to the BBC in Damascus, said Syrians were experiencing \"a lot of hope and a lot of fear... at the same time\".",
      "He called for all parties, inside and outside Syria, to do all they could to create stability in the country.",
      "Bashar al-Assad's regime was overthrown less than two weeks ago by a rebel coalition led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, known as HTS, a Sunni Islamist group that claims to have disavowed its jihadist extremist past since it split from al-Qaeda in 2016.",
      "HTS is designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU, the UK and others.",
      "Symbolically, its leader has dropped his wartime pseudonym of Abu Mohammed al-Jolani and reverted to his real name of Ahmed al-Sharaa.",

      "\"I must be honest. I'm hearing from many Syrians that they're asking questions whether this will actually be implemented. They've got their doubts.\"",
      "That, he said, was not surprising, given the speed of change in Syria.",
      "\"If the transition is to succeed, this needs to be a process that is co-operative.\"",
      "\"[Sharaa] needs to work with the different armed factions that went in together with him. He needs to work with a broader group of former opposition. He needs to make sure that he's working with a broad group of civil society women. And as we all agree with the broadest spectrum possible of Syrian society.\"",

      "He emphasised that hopes of lifting sanctions on Syria and taking HTS off the terrorist list depended on its behaviour.",
      "He hoped to give it the benefit of the doubt for three months - the time HTS has said its interim government will rule before a more long-term arrangement.",
      "\"I think there is an understanding that for Syria really to be successful, we need to see a delisting, and we need to see sanctions lifted. But I think also it's very important that it's understood that this will not just happen because everyone wants positive things.\"",
      "\"Member states are following very carefully what will be happening on the ground, but I do believe that if what has been said in public is actually being implemented in practice, yes, then I think we can see the delisting and the end of sanctions.\"",
      "As for Syria's neighbours, Mr Pedersen said that Israel's actions since the fall of Assad had been \"highly irresponsible\".",
      "Since the 1967 Middle East war, Israel has occupied and later annexed the area of southern Syria known as the Golan Heights. Most other states, other than the US, consider the Golan to be occupied land.",
      "Israel's current bombing campaign against Syrian military facilities and its occupation of more Syrian land in the Golan Heights demilitarised buffer zone and neighbouring areas were, Mr Pedersen said, \"a danger to the future of Syria, and these activities need to stop immediately\".",
      "\"There is no reason that Israel should occupy new Syrian territory. The Golan is already occupied. They don't need new land to be occupied. So what we need to see is that also Israel acts in a manner that don't destabilise this very, very fragile transitional process,\" he added.",
      "Mr Pedersen is also concerned about the complex web of power in northern Syria.",
      "Turkey has a well-established relationship with HTS. It has troops in the north-west, as well as a militia known as the Syrian National Army (SNA), made up of rebel factions that it backs.",
      "Since Assad was overthrown, the SNA has attacked the other force in Syria's north, a Kurdish-led militia alliance called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) which is supported by the US.",
      "Mr Pedersen said it was Turkey's interests to follow certain key principles, along with other foreign powers.",
      "\"What is it that we all need to see in Syria now? We need to see stability. We need to see that there are not new population groups that are displaced. We need to see that people are not running away from Syria as refugees. We need to see that refugees are returning, that... internally displaced can be returning to their homes.\"",
      "After 54 years under the rule of two authoritarian Assad presidents, Syria is fragmented, with towns and villages heavily damaged by almost 14 years of war and a population traumatised by war and the deadly cruelty of the regime.",
      "Mr Pedersen said it was vital for HTS to start a process that will bring justice to all the families of more than 100,000 Syrians who disappeared after detention by the regime since 2011. Most are presumed dead.",
      "\"If this process is not moving in the right direction, there is a huge danger that this anger can erupt in a manner that is in no one's interest.\"",
      "Syrians, Mr Pedersen said, wanted to own the process of rebuilding their country. That might be difficult given the turbulence across the Middle East and propensity of Syria's neighbours and other big powers to interfere.",
      "Time is short. If HTS keeps its promises, \"within the next few weeks and months there is hope that Syria can have a bright future\", he said.",
      "He warned that if that doesn't happen, \"there is also a danger of new strife and even civil war.\"",
      "\"But we need to bet that the future for Syria can now be fixed. And that we can start the process of healing.\""

      "\"To date, they haven't found anything that would indicate that there's foreign influence, foreign actors, or even little green men who are working on the American people,\" she was quoted as saying by The Hill.",
      "Another lawmaker, Connecticut Representative Jim Himes, said \"there is zero evidence of laws being broken\" by the drones.",
      "He added that the \"vast majority\" of sightings were normal aircraft or drones being operated lawfully.",
      "Himes said that \"millions\" of unregistered drones were operating across the US, in addition to 800,000 registered drones that weigh more than half a pound.",
      "In his own comments to the media, Biden said: \"We're following this closely, but so far, no sense of danger.\"",
      "He stressed that the sightings were not evidence of any wrongdoing. \"There's a lot of drones authorised up there,\" he said. \"I think one started it and they all - everybody wanted to get in the deal.\"",

      "In recent days, the sightings have led to the temporary closures of a Stewart International Airport in New York and of Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.",
      "Government agencies previously said they had \"not identified anything anomalous\". They agreed with Biden that many drones that had been sighted were lawfully flown by hobbyists and law enforcement - adding that people were also spotting \"manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and stars mistakenly reported as drones\".",
      "But questions from the public remain. Earlier in the week, New Jersey man Noel Thomas described to the BBC his experience of spotting a mystery object in the sky. He said it was the size of a school bus, rectangular with blinking lights, and \"definitely something I've never seen\".",
      "A police officer in the same state said: \"We're just looking for some sound, reasonable answers so that people could go about their life and not live in this hysteria that we have going.\"",
      "As the mystery persists, state governments are calling for more power to deal with the small, uncrewed aircraft being spotted in the skies. Earlier this week, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said officials were sending her a drone detection system.",
      "Among those who have voiced their suspicions are President-elect Donald Trump, who has said the government \"knows what it happening\", but \"for some reason they don't want to comment\". However, he said he \"can't imagine it's the enemy\".",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 22:15:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The UFWD is a decades-old - and increasingly controversial - arm of China's Communist Party. What does it do?",
    "story": [
      "The People's Republic of China has a \"magic weapon\", according to its founding leader Mao Zedong and its current president Xi Jinping.",
      "It is called the United Front Work Department - and it is raising as much alarm in the West as Beijing's growing military arsenal.",
      "Yang Tengbo, a prominent businessman who has been linked to Prince Andrew, is the latest overseas Chinese citizen to be scrutinised - and sanctioned - for his links to the UFWD.",
      "The existence of the department is far from a secret. A decades-old and well-documented arm of the Chinese Communist Party, it has been mired in controversy before. Investigators from the US to Australia have cited the UFWD in multiple espionage cases, often accusing Beijing of using it for foreign interference.",
      "Beijing has denied all espionage allegations, calling them ludicrous.",
      "So what is the UFWD and what does it do?",
      "'Controlling China's message'",
      "The United Front - originally referring to a broad communist alliance - was once hailed by Mao as the key to the Communist Party's triumph in the decades-long Chinese Civil War.",
      "After the war ended in 1949 and the party began ruling China, United Front activities took a backseat to other priorities. But in the last decade under Xi, the United Front has seen a renaissance of sorts.",
      "Xi's version of the United Front is broadly consistent with earlier incarnations: to \"build the broadest possible coalition with all social forces that are relevant\", according to Mareike Ohlberg, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund.",
      "On the face of it, the UFWD is not shadowy - it even has a website and reports many of its activities on it. But the extent of its work - and its reach - is less clear.",
      "While a large part of that work is domestic, Dr Ohlberg said, \"a key target that has been defined for United Front work is overseas Chinese\".",
      "Today, the UFWD seeks to influence public discussions about sensitive issues ranging from Taiwan - which China claims as its territory - to  the suppression of ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang.",
      "It also tries to shape narratives about China in foreign media, target Chinese government critics abroad and co-opt influential overseas Chinese figures.",
      "\"United Front work can include espionage but [it] is broader than espionage,\" Audrye Wong, assistant professor of politics at the University of Southern California, tells the BBC.",
      "\"Beyond the act of acquiring covert information from a foreign government, United Front activities centre on the broader mobilisation of overseas Chinese,\" she said, adding that China is \"unique in the scale and scope\" of such influence activities.",
      "China has always had the ambition for such influence, but its rise in recent decades has given Beijing the ability to exercise it.",
      "Since Xi became president in 2012, he has been especially proactive in crafting China's message to the world, enouraging a confrontational \"wolf warrior\" approach to diplomacy and urging his country's diaspora to \"tell China's story well\".",
      "The UFWD operates through various overseas Chinese community organisations, which have vigorously defended the Communist Party beyond its shores. They have censored anti-CCP artwork and protested at the activities of Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama. The UFWD has also been linked to threats against members of persecuted minorities abroad, such as Tibetans and Uyghurs.",
      "But much of the UFWD's work overlaps with other party agencies, operating under what observers have described as \"plausible deniability\".",
      "It is this murkiness that is causing so much suspicion and apprehension about the UFWD.",
      "When Yang appealed against his ban, judges agreed with the then secretary of state's report that Yang \"represented a risk to national security\" - citing the fact that he downplayed his ties with the UFWD as one of the reasons that led them to that conclusion.",
      "Yang, however, maintains that he has not done anything unlawful and that the spy allegations are \"entirely untrue\".",
      "Cases like Yang's are becoming increasingly common. In 2022, British Chinese lawyer Christine Lee was accused by the MI5 of acting through the UFWD to cultivate relationships with influential people in the UK. The following year, Liang Litang, a US citizen who ran a Chinese restaurant in Boston, was indicted for providing information about Chinese dissidents in the area to his contacts in the UFWD.",
      "And in September, Linda Sun, a former aide in the New York governor's office, was charged with using her position to serve Chinese government interests - receiving benefits, including travel, in return. According to Chinese state media reports, she had met a top UFWD official in 2017, who told her to \"be an ambassador of Sino-American friendship\".",
      "It is not uncommon for prominent and successful Chinese people to be associated with the party, whose approval they often need, especially in the business world.",
      "But where is the line between peddling influence and espionage?",
      "\"The boundary between influence and espionage is blurry\" when it comes to Beijing's operations, said Ho-fung Hung, a politics professor at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Yang Tengbo: Who is alleged Chinese spy linked to Prince Andrew?",
      "Spy allegations pose dilemma for UK's China policy",
      "This ambiguity has intensified after China passed a law in 2017 mandating Chinese nationals and companies to co-operate with intelligence probes, including sharing information with the Chinese government - a move that Dr Hung said \"effectively turns everyone into potential spies\".",
      "The Ministry of State Security has released dramatic propaganda videos warning the public that foreign spies are everywhere and \"they are cunning and sneaky \".",
      "Some students who were sent on special trips abroad were told by their universities to limit contact with foreigners and were asked for a report of their activities on their return.",
      "And yet Xi is keen to promote China to the world. So he has tasked a trusted arm of the party to project strength abroad.",
      "And that is becoming a challenge for Western powers - how do they balance doing business with the world's second-largest economy alongside serious security concerns?",
      "Wrestling with the long arm of Beijing",
      "Genuine fears over China's overseas influence are playing into more hawkish sentiments in the West, often leaving governments in a dilemma.",
      "Some, like Australia, have tried to protect themselves with fresh foreign interference laws that criminalise individuals deemed to be meddling in domestic affairs. In 2020, the US imposed visa restrictions on people seen as active in UFWD activities.",
      "An irked Beijing has warned that such laws - and the prosecutions they have spurred - hinder bilateral relations.",
      "\"The so-called allegations of Chinese espionage are utterly absurd,\" a foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters on Tuesday in response to a question about Yang. \"The development of China-UK relations serves the common interests of both countries.\"",
      "Some experts say that the long arm of China's United Front is indeed concerning.",
      "\"Western governments now need to be less naive about China's United Front work and take it as a serious threat not only to national security but also to the safety and freedom of many ethnic Chinese citizens,\" Dr Hung says.",
      "But, he adds, \"governments also need to be vigilant against anti-Chinese racism and work hard to build trust and co-operation with ethnic Chinese communities in countering the threat together.\"",
      "Last December, Di Sanh Duong, a Vietnam-born ethnic Chinese community leader in Australia, was convicted of planning foreign interference for trying to cosy up to an Australian minister. Prosecutors argued that he was an \"ideal target\" for the UFWD because he had run for office in the 1990s and boasted ties with Chinese officials.",
      "Duong's trial had centred around what he meant when he said the inclusion of the minister at a charity event would be beneficial to \"us Chinese\" - did he mean the Chinese community in Australia, or mainland China?",
      "In the end, Duong's conviction - and a prison sentence - raised serious concerns that such broad anti-espionage laws and prosecutions can easily become weapons for targeting ethnic Chinese people.",
      "\"It's important to remember that not everyone who is ethnically Chinese is a supporter of the Chinese Communist Party. And not everyone who is involved in these diaspora organisations is driven by fervent loyalty to China,\" Dr Wong says.",
      "\"Overly aggressive policies based on racial profiling will only legitimise the Chinese government's propaganda that ethnic Chinese are not welcome and end up pushing diaspora communities further into Beijing's arms.\"",
      "What is behind Starmer's meeting with China's president?",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",

    "summary": "The EU wants a trade deal with four South American nations, but France is strongly opposed.",
    "story": [
      "As the ink was drying on one of the world's biggest trade deals, signed in Uruguay this month, and hailed as a milestone for the global economy, anger was brewing thousands of miles away in France.",
      "Under the agreement between the EU on one hand, and Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay on the other, tariffs will be greatly reduced and the amounts of imports and exports allowed will be increased.",
      "The deal would affect almost 800 million people.",
      "It comes as a marked contrast to Donald Trump's plans to greatly increase protectionism when he returns to the White House next month.",
      "The deal still needs to be approved by the 27 EU member states, and France is planning to block it, due to fears that it will harm its farming sector.",
      "Alix Heurtault, a 34-year-old French farmer, says she is worried about her future if the planned agreement goes ahead.",
      "\"I fear that the deal will mean making ends meet becoming even more difficult for farmers like me,\" she says.",
      "As a result, she is crossing her fingers that the French government will be able to stop it.",
      "The planned trade agreement will mean more South American beef, chicken and sugar coming to the EU, and at lower prices. While in the opposite direction, the likes of European cars, clothing and wine would have more access to the Mercosur zone.",
      "For France to block the deal it will need to persuade at least three other EU countries, representing at least 35% of the total population to join it. Ireland, Poland and Austria are also opposed, but Italy will likely need to also come on board to achieve the required population quota.",
      "And with the media giving very conflicting reports about Italy's position, we'll have to wait and see which way the Italians go when the vote is held some time in 2025.",
      "In the meantime, French farmers are continuing to put pressure on Paris to not back down. French President Emmanuel Macron is listening, and has described the trade deal as \"unacceptable in its current form\".",
      "Ms Heurtault grows sugar beet, wheat and barley on a 150-hectare farm in the small village of Villeneuve-sur-Auvers located 60km (37 miles) south of Paris.",
      "She says that the deal would see French farmers badly hit in order to help EU manufacturers. \"It feels like we're a bargaining chip. Farmers in the Mercosur countries [the name of the Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay block] have less restrictions regarding pesticides and lower labour costs.\"",
      "Ms Heurtault's view is widely held across the French farming sector, which has been holding regular protests in recent months.",
      "A few weeks ago some 200 farmers dumped bales of straw in front of the Grand Palais museum and exhibition centre in Paris.",
      "They lit up red flares, and chanted slogans like \"We are feeding you, show us some respect\".",
      "The protest was held to coincide with an annual meeting of commodities importers and exporters taking place at the venue.",
      "St\u00e9phane Gallais, a cattle farmer and the national secretary of farmers' union Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Paysanne, which had organised the event, explained why it was being held.",
      "\"Today's demonstration is a stance against free trade, especially the EU-Mercosur agreement that we've been opposing since it was first discussed in the late 1990s,\" he said.",
      "While France is opposed to the trade deal, other EU nations, such as Germany, Spain and Portugal are strongly in favour of it.",
      "Proponents welcome the fact it would be a marked contrast to Trump's threats of increased protectionism.",
      "\"It would be a good signal at a time when we have movement in the opposite direction towards economic fragmentation and protectionism, especially with free-trade sceptic US President Donald Trump re-elected,\" says Uri Dadush, a research professor for trade policy at the University of Maryland in the US.",
      "Prof Dadush adds that while European farmers will be negatively impacted, he says this will be very limited.",
      "\"The deal is a threat for European farmers, as the world's most competitive agricultural sector gets access to their market, but we're talking about a tiny amount of liberalisation spread out over a long period of time,\" he says.",
      "He points out that under the agreement the Mercosur nations would still have limits on what they can export to the EU. Such as their proposed initial increased annual quota of beef exports still only accounting for less than 1% of EU consumption of the meat.",
      "Prof Dadush adds that \"the deal is an opportunity to push for much needed market-orientated reform in the heavily-subsidised EU agricultural sector, and Mercosur's highly-protected factory sector\".",
      "Chris Hegadorn, adjunct professor for global food policies at Paris-based university Sciences Po, and former secretary of the UN's Committee on World Food Security, says the agreement would overall be beneficial to Europe \u2013 including its farmers.",
      "\"It obviously depends on the subcategory you're looking at, but French cheese and wine producers will benefit,\" he says.",
      "He adds that it will also improve health and environmental standards in the Mercosur countries, and increase ties with the EU at a time when \"China is also trying to get a foothold in Latin America\".",
      "But David Cayla, lecturer for economics at Angers University in western France and member of the left-wing collective \"The Dismayed Economists\", doubts the EU will be able to enforce higher standards in Latin American countries.",
      "\"It's impossible to control their implementation,\" he says. \"Our farmers will only face increased competition from countries with a better climate and more fertile soils.",
      "\"But we need to protect European agriculture \u2013 that's also a question of food sovereignty,\" he emphasizes, adding that the Covid-19 pandemic showed how quickly worldwide supply chains could collapse in times of crisis.",
      "Antoine Gomel, who in 2017 took over his family's 24-hectare chicken and beef farm in a small village near Boulogne-sur-Mer in northern France, says that opposing the trade deal is about saving the French countryside.",
      "\"Farms keep disappearing leaving our villages deserted \u2013 the deal will only accelerate that,\" says the 42-year-old.",
      "\"But farms are crucial to cohesion in the countryside, not least as they create jobs. People in France and abroad increasingly vote for the far right because they feel disorientated and alone.",

    "summary": "Climate change makes it trickier for Churchill's residents to co-exist with increasingly hungry predators",
    "story": [
      "\"Can I give you some polar bear advice?\" asks Tee, a confident 13-year-old we meet during a visit to a high school in Churchill, Canada.",
      "\"If there's a bear this close to you,\" she says as she measures a distance of about 30cm with her hands, \"make a fist - and punch it in the nose.",
      "\"Polar bears have very sensitive noses - it'll just run away.\"",
      "Tee has not had to put this advice to the test. But growing up here - alongside the planet's largest land predator - means bear safety is part of everyday life.",
      "Signs - in shops and cafes  - remind anyone heading outside to be \"bear aware\". My favourite reads: \"If a polar bear attacks you must fight back.\"",
      "Running away from a charging polar bear is \u2013 perhaps counterintuitively - dangerous. A bear's instinct is to chase prey and polar bears can run at 25mph (40kmph).",
      "Key advice: Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Don't walk alone at night.",
      "Churchill is known as the polar bear capital of the world. Every year, the Hudson Bay - on the western edge of which the town is perched - thaws, and forces the bears on shore. As the freeze sets in in Autumn, hundreds of bears gather here, waiting.",
      "\"We have freshwater rivers flowing into the area and cold water coming in from the Arctic,\" explains Alysa McCall from Polar Bears International (PBI). \"So freeze-up happens here first.",
      "\"For polar bears, sea ice is a big dinner plate - it's access to their main prey, seals. They're probably excited for a big meal of seal blubber - they haven't been eating much all summer on land.\"",
      "There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. This is one of the most southerly and best studied.",
      "\"They're our fat, white, hairy canaries in the coal mine,\" Alysa explains. \"We had about 1,200 polar bears here in the 1980s and we've lost almost half of them.\"",
      "The decline is tied to the amount of time the bay is now ice-free, a period that is getting longer as the climate warms. No sea ice means no frozen seal-hunting platform.",
      "\"Bears here are now on land about a month longer than their grandparents were,\" explains Alysa. \"That puts pressure on mothers. [With less food] it's harder to stay pregnant and to sustain those babies.\"",
      "While their long-term survival is precarious, the bears draw conservation scientists and thousands of tourists to Churchill every year.",
      "We tag along with a group from PBI to search for bears on the sub-Arctic tundra - just a few miles from town. The team travels in a tundra buggy, a type of off-road bus with huge tyres.",
      "After a few distant sightings, we have a heart-stopping close encounter. A young  bear approaches and investigates our slow two-buggy convoy. He sidles up, sniffs one of the vehicles, then jumps up and plants two giant paws up on the side of the buggy.",
      "The bear casually slumps back down onto all fours, then looks up and gazes at me briefly. It is deeply confusing to look into the face of an animal that is simultaneously adorable and potentially deadly.",
      "\"You could see him sniffing and even licking the vehicle - using all his senses to investigate,\" says PBI's Geoff York, who has worked in the Arctic for more than three decades.",
      "Being here in 'bear season' means Geoff and his colleagues can test new technologies to detect bears and protect people. The PBI team is currently fine-tuning a radar-based system dubbed 'bear-dar'.",
      "The experimental rig - a tall antenna with detectors scanning 360 degrees - is installed on the roof of a lodge in the middle of the tundra, near Churchill.",
      "\"It has artificial intelligence, so here we can basically teach it what a polar bear is,\" Geoff explains. \"This works 24/7, it can see at night and in poor visibility.\"",
      "Polar bear attacks are rare, but they are a risk for people who live and work in isolated Arctic environments. Earlier this year, a Canadian worker was killed by two polar bears near a remote defence station in Canada's northern Nunavut territory.",
      "Co-existing with these ice-dependent predators, when the Arctic climate is changing faster than at any time in history, creates a paradoxical challenge for Churchill: The polar bear population here faces long-term decline. But, in the short term, the bears are spending more of their year on shore, increasing the probability of bears and people coming into contact.",
      "Protecting the community is the task of the polar bear alert team - trained rangers who patrol Churchill every day.",
      "We ride along with ranger Ian Van Nest, who is looking for a stubborn bear that he and his colleagues tried to chase away earlier that day. \"It turned around and came back [towards] Churchill. He doesn't seem interested in going away.\"",
      "For bears that are intent on hanging around town, the team can use a live trap: A  tube-shaped container, baited with seal meat, with a door that the bear triggers when it climbs inside.",
      "\"Then we put them in the holding facility,\" Ian explains. Bears are held for 30 days, a period set to teach a bear that it is a negative thing to come to town looking for food, but that doesn't put the animal's health at risk.",
      "They are then moved - either on the back of a trailer or occasionally air-lifted by helicopter \u2013 and released further along the bay, away from people.",
      "Cyril Fredlund, who works at Churchill's new scientific observatory, remembers the last time a person was killed by a polar bear in Churchill, in 1983.",
      "\"It was right in town,\" he says. \"The man was homeless and was in an abandoned building at night. There was a young bear in there too - it took him down with its paw, like he was a seal.\"",
      "People came to help, Cyril recalls, but they couldn't get the bear away from the man. \"It was like it was guarding its meal.\"",
      "The polar bear alert program was set up around that time. No-one has been killed by a polar bear here since.",
      "Cyril is now a technician at the new Churchill Marine Observatory (CMO). Part of its remit is to understand exactly how this environment will respond to climate change.",
      "Under its retractable roof are two giant pools filled with water pumped in directly from the Hudson Bay.",
      "\"We can do all kinds of controlled experimental studies looking into changes in the Arctic,\" says Prof Feiyue Wang.",
      "One implication of a less icy Hudson Bay is a longer operating season for the port, which is currently closed for nine months of the year. A longer season during which the bay thaws and becomes open water could mean more ships coming in and out of Churchill.",
      "Studies at the observatory are setting out to improve the accuracy of the sea ice forecast. Research will also examine the risks associated with expanding the port. One of the first investigations is an experimental oil spill. Scientists plan to release oil into one of the pools, test clean-up techniques and measure how quickly the oil degrades in the cold water.",
      "For Churchill's mayor, Mike Spence, understanding how to plan for the future, particularly when it comes to shipping goods in and out of Churchill, is vital for the town's future in a warming world.",
      "\"We're already looking into extending the season,\" he says, gesturing towards the port, which has ceased operating for the winter. \"In ten years' time, this will be bustling.\"",
      "Climate change poses a challenge for the polar bear capital of the world, but the mayor is optimistic. \"We have a great town,\" he says, \"a wonderful community. And the summer season - [when people come to see the Beluga whales in the bay] - is growing.\"",
      "\"We're all being challenged by climate change,\" he adds. \"Does that mean you stop existing? No - you adapt. You work out how to take advantage of it.\"",
      "While Mike Spence says \"the future is bright\" for Churchill, it might not be so bright for the polar bears.",
      "Tee and her friends look out over the bay, from a window at the back of the school building. The polar bear alert team's vehicles are gathering outside, trying to move a bear away from town.",
      "\"If climate change continues,\" muses Tee's classmate Charlie, \"the polar bears might just stop coming here.\"",
      "The teacher approaches to make sure the children have someone coming to pick them up - that they're not walking home alone. All part of the daily routine in the polar bear capital of the world.",

      "Built with space-grade Teflon and insulated with industrial-use foam, Hab-1 has a bed, a stowaway tray which can be pulled out and used as a workstation, storage space to keep supplies and emergency kits, a kitchenette for heating meals and a toilet. An astronaut in simulation spent three weeks holed up in the facility.",
      "\"Hab-1 is designed keeping in mind that space is going to be very limited on the Moon or Mars,\" Ms Kacha-Jhala says. \"The astronaut will also have very limited water so we designed a dry toilet.

      "The filing says bloggers acting on Lanez's behalf continue to cast doubt on her allegations, making false claims including that the gun and bullet fragments in the case are missing.

      "\"Angels With Dirty Faces\" (1938)",

No longer could James Cagney break the law and get away with it! Director Michael Curtiz's film about childhood friends who follow different paths \u2014 Cagney, as gangster Rocky Sullivan, and Pat O'Brien, as Father Connolly \u2014 offers a redemptive tale in which young hoodlums idolize Rocky. But when the condemned criminal is being led to the execution chamber, his change of heart \u2014 pretending to die a coward's death \u2014 offers a way out for the impressionable youth. One of Cagney's best performances, the film also features Humphrey Bogart as a crooked lawyer, Ann Sheridan, and the Dead End Kids (whose Hollywood careers would turn from kitchen sink drama to slapstick comedy).",

      "Eddie Murphy had already appeared in two hit films \u2014 \"48 HRS.,\" opposite Nick Nolte, and \"Trading Places,\" pairing off against Dan Aykroyd \u2014 but in \"Beverly Hills Cop\" Murphy carried the film on his own as Detroit detective Axel Foley, a fish-out-of-water who has gone to Los Angeles on the trail of a killer. Buoyed by Murphy's screen charisma and Harold Faltermeyer's electronic score, the mix of action and comedy was a blockbuster, a formula carried forth in three sequels starring Murphy.",
      "\"The Chelsea Girls\" (1966)",
      "Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey's 16mm feature was a proto-typical underground movie \u2014 heavily improvised, with rough edits (or no edits), multiple and split screens, and a leisurely 3.5-hour length. Being banned in Boston at least added to its allure. Today, the film, set in the landmark Chelsea Hotel in New York City, and featuring Nico, Ondine, Brigid Berlin, International Velvet, Mario Montez, Mary Woronov, Dorothy Dean and other Warhol \"Superstars,\" offers a unique time capsule of the bohemian 1960s.",

      "\"Dirty Dancing\" (1987)",
      "At a 1960s Catskills resort, a teenage girl vacationing with family hits the dance floor with a hot instructor, and summers would never be the same.

Alas, there is a lever that warns, if pulled, it will mean the end of the Earth! Restored by the UCLA Film & Television Archive primarily from the original nitrate negative, this is a hilarious take on the End Times \u2014 and the problem of pets that refuse to obey. Bad, BAD dog! [You can watch the restored film here.]",

      "\"The Miracle Worker\" (1962)",
      "Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke each won Academy Awards for their performances in the true story of Anne Sullivan and her attempts to teach Helen Keller, a child deaf and blind since she was a toddler. Keller's autobiography was originally adapted for television and later Broadway (Bancroft and Duke both starred in the stage version). Director Arthur Penn's black-and-white film version preserved the actresses' performances in a cooly unsentimental story of determination and human connection.",
      "\"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991)",
      "Gus Van Sant (\"Drugstore Cowboy\") wrote and directed this haunting tale of friendship, loosely based on plays of Shakespeare, starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves as street hustlers searching for family and connection.",
      "\"No Country for Old Men\" (2007)",
      "The Coen Brothers' sharp precision and keen eye for irony is beautifully on display in this enthralling modern-day Western, in which Josh Brolin's hunter comes across the scene of a drug deal gone very bad. Alas, that satchel containing mounds of currency with no living owner is just a little too tempting to pass by. Enter Javier Bardem's sinister hit man, hot on Brolin's trail, who will let nothing deter him from his prey. Based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, the film won four Academy Awards, including best picture, best direction, and best supporting actor for Bardem, weird haircut and all.",
      "\"Powwow Highway\" (1989)",
      "A prize-winner at the Sundance Film Festival, Jonathan Wacks' comic-drama was remarkable in its time for telling a humanistic story of Native Americans without resorting to stereotypes. Gary Farmer and A. Martinez star as former childhood friends who reconnect for a road trip in a dilapidated car, a journey that is by turns spiritual and criminal.",
      "\"The Pride of the Yankees\" (1942)",
      "An inspirational biopic of one of sports' true legends, this story of New York Yankee Lou Gehrig, whose life came undone with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS (what came to become known as Lou Gehrig's disease), stars Gary Cooper and Teresa Wright, and features several of Gehrig's teammates (including Babe Ruth) as themselves. Cooper's reenactment of Gehrig's farewell speech at Yankee Stadium (in which he states, \"Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth\") became one of the actor's most memorable moments.",
      "\"The Social Network\" (2010)",
      "Like the Akira Kurosawa classic \"Rashomon,\" \"The Social Network\" uses competing points of view to decipher the origins of Facebook, as told through legal depositions being filed years after the revolutionary website was born, by former friends now suing each other. Based on Ben Mezrich's \"The Accidental Billionaires,\" David Fincher's classic is a tale of genius, hubris and ethics, involving a paradox: A site founded on the notion of exclusivity which grew to host hundreds of millions of members. Starring Jessie Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, with Andrew Garfield, Max Minghella, Armie Hammer, and Justin Timberlake, and an Oscar-winning script by Aaron Sorkin. Oscars also went to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for their haunting score, and to editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall.",
      "\"Spy Kids\" (2001)",
      "Writer-director Robert Rodriguez made a splash with his debut feature, \"El Mariachi,\" and followed with \"Desperado\" and \"From Dusk till Dawn.\" But for the fantasy \"Spy Kids,\" he connected with his inner kid, in a story about two children of secret agents who go out on a mission to rescue their captured parents. Starring Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino as mom-and-pop spies, and Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara as their budding young agents, the film was a hit, spawning a franchise (including a 3-D entry starring Sylvester Stallone).",
      "\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" (1982)",
      "The first film of the \"Star Trek\" franchise to be inducted in the National Film Registry, it's considered by most to be the best movie, in capturing both the zing of the original TV series and the camaraderie of the Enterprise crew. Directed by Nicholas Meyer, it's a sequel of sorts to the 1967 episode \"Space Seed,\" in which a 20th century villain in hibernation is thawed out, stirring much interplanetary trouble. In \"Wrath of Khan,\" Ricardo Montalban returns in the role of Khan, who sets his sights not just on destroying worlds, but also in taking revenge against Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner). There is action galore, but it's Kirk's friendship with Spock (Leonard Nimoy) that gives this film its emotional heft.",
      "\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (1974)",
      "Among exploitation movies, horror is a genre that has enticed many aspiring filmmakers with little money but lots of fake blood at hand. But Tobe Hooper's grand guignol tale of a group of young people who find themselves at the wrong isolated farmhouse went far beyond typical drive-in fare. It would give rise to countless slasher films (from \"Halloween\" to \"Friday the 13th\") in which a weapon-wielding bad guy (in this case Leatherface) ticks off cast members one by one. Nasty, bloody and weirdly funny, the film even found itself projected onto the screen of the Museum of Modern Art in New York \u2014 a fact it heralded in newspaper ads, as if that would give a low-budget horror film more street cred.",
      "\"Up in Smoke\" (1978)",

    "story": [
      "Francis Ford Coppola, the visionary director behind \"The Godfather\" and \"Apocalypse Now,\" was named a 2024 Kennedy Center honoree earlier this year, celebrating his lifetime of artistic achievements. Over a career spanning more than half a century, the 85-year-old filmmaker has earned five Oscars, six Golden Globes, two Palme d'Or awards and a BAFTA.",
      "When asked if there is a signature \"Coppola style,\" the director said, \"I think I was always someone even as a 17-year-old, 18-year-old film director who wanted to poeticize the work I did, but then take it to the very brink where if I took it any further, it would fall off the cliff.\"",
      "The daring creative philosophy has shaped some of the most influential films in history, including \"The Conversation\" and \"The Godfather\" trilogy.",
      "Coppola's journey began in Detroit, where he was born into an Italian-American family. Raised in Queens, New York, he was heavily influenced by his parents, especially his father Carmine, a flutist for Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra. That is where he learned that music and pictures are not always connected.",
      "While in college, Coppola was deeply inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's silent film \"October: 10 Days That Shook the World.\"",
      "\"It was a silent picture, but they weren't playing any accompaniment,\" he said. \"And I was amazed at how the film itself sort of made you think you were hearing it because of the way it was cut. I came out of that experience absolutely bowled over.\"",
      "Coppola followed his passion for film to UCLA. \"I had no money. I had no car. I had no girlfriend. I had nothing,\" he said.",
      "After graduating, Warner Brothers hired him to direct \"Finian's Rainbow,\" and in 1970, his screenplay for \"Patton\" earned him his first Academy Award.",
      "At just 29, Coppola signed on to co-write and direct \"The Godfather,\" a film that became a cornerstone of modern cinema. \"I really was an Italian-American. So although I didn't know gangsters, I knew that to the detail of what life was like in that kind of household,\" he said.",
      "Casting Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone proved challenging. \"I was ordered by the head of the studio that I couldn't even mention Brando,\" Coppola said. Eventually, the studio agreed \u2014 on three conditions. \"He has to do the movie for nothing, no fee; he has to shoot a screen test; he has to put up a million-dollar bond. So, I said, 'I accept.'\"",
      "Brando's transformation into the character astonished the studio. The studio dropped all conditions after seeing Brando's screen test, and the rest is history.",
      "\"The Godfather\" earned Coppola an Oscar nomination for Best Director and a win for Best Adapted Screenplay. He continued his streak with adaptations like \"The Outsiders.\"",
      "Coppola went on to adapt S.E. Hinton's \"The Outsiders\" and \"Rumble Fish,\" which featured his nephew, Nicolas Cage.",
      "Cage is just one of many members of the Coppola family who have pursued successful careers in the arts. Reflecting on his priorities, Coppola said, \"I want my children to be healthy, and I want them to be happy in their work, which they seem to be. I'm now more concerned that there's going to be an Earth here that's going to sustain itself.\"",
      "Now, as a Kennedy Center honoree, Coppola reflected on how he views himself, saying, \"I think of someone who loved his human family \u2014 not just my immediate family, but the entire human family. That's who I am. I am the one who loves everybody.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors\u00a0ceremony, which took place on Dec. 8, 2024, will be broadcast on CBS on Dec. 22.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:21:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The singer-songwriter went from being an NYU music student wowing Pharrell Williams in a viral video, to selling out Madison Square Garden. She talks about musical obsessions, and her appreciation for listeners with patience.",
    "story": [
      "In a nondescript building in a tiny Pennsylvania town, Maggie Rogers was getting ready for her big moment. Lititz, Pa., is where arena acts come to rehearse their shows before heading out on national tour, and every detail matters. \"Sunday Morning\" caught up with Rogers there, just weeks away from her concerts at Madison Square Garden.",
      "In a career-defining event, she sold out the New York City venue. \"Twice!\" she laughed. \"I don't know how to, like, compute that in my brain. I don't understand it fundamentally!\"",
      "To be clear, it wasn't Rogers' first time on a big stage; she'd already shared them with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Joan Baez, and a stint opening for Coldplay. She was also a 2020 Grammy-nominee for best new artist.",
      "But for Rogers, who studied music at New York University, playing Madison Square Garden was a homecoming of sorts. Walking through Washington Square Park, not far from her former dorm room, she pointed out the benches where she used to write songs. It was at NYU where Rogers got what you might call her big break \u2013 or at least a big break, when superstar producer and musician Pharrell Williams visited her class. Rogers played him a song she'd been working on called \"Alaska.\" \"What I remember is really just staring at my shoes and, like, holding on tight,\" she said.",
      "Williams' response: \"Wow! Wow! I have zero, zero, zero notes for that, and I'll tell you why: you're doing your own thing. It's singular.\"",
      "The video clip of Williams' master class went viral, but Rogers \u2013 who actually started out studying music engineering \u2013 still needed to learn the craft of writing and performing, which is just what she did. \"I've played, like, every bar and club on the Lower East Side, and every DIY venue in Brooklyn that existed in my time here,\" she said.",
      "Now, at the age of 30, Rogers has built a close relationship with her fans, many of whom watched her go from small clubs to being an artist that record labels were fighting over.",
      "Remember that demo she played for Pharrell Williams as a college student? So far, the music video of the finished version of \"Alaska\" has been viewed more than 23 million times.",
      "It's all been an incredible journey, considering Rogers says she didn't actually play music publicly all that much as she was growing up on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Her interest was more personal, private and quirky: \"Basically, as soon as I could ask for music lessons, all I wanted to do was play the harp,\" she said. \"My first CD purchase was a double-purchase of the orchestral score to 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' and Britney's 'Baby One More Time.' Which, like, maybe is all you need to know about me!\"",
      "And you hear it in her songs \u2013 a pop sensibility with a tremendous intellect behind it. Rogers says the whole arena thing is fun, but what she's really hoping to do is form a deep, long-term connection with her listeners along the themes of love and heartbreak and the weird wondrous thing that it is just to be alive. \"I really prefer to work in long form,\" Rogers said. \"And I really feel a lot of gratitude for listeners that want to have an active listening practice, and who also have the patience to want to spend an hour of their time listening to the way that I, you know, sequence the record, or who has appreciation for those things. I've always loved art that takes time.\"",
      "Something else that separates Rogers from your typical pop star: Back in 2021, she took time away from her music to enroll in a graduate program at Harvard University focusing on religion and public life. \"I really needed a second,\" she said. \"I needed to sort of reorient my life, and I needed to be new at something. I had been living in a world where everything was about me and my career for, like, five years, and then applying that to music, and to concerts, and to these really large public gatherings.\"",
      "Large public gatherings that have become, for both Rogers and her fans, something almost spiritual: \"This couldn't have happened in any different way,\" she said. \"Like, I'm reaching Madison Square Garden and stepping on that stage, and being like, 'I'm really ready for this.' And that, in itself, is such a gift that I've sort of tried to keep from contextualizing this for myself. Because as soon as you figure out what it is, it changes, you know? I'm always at the eye of the storm! It's really calm where I sit. And I'll never, ever be able to know what it looks like from the outside. But what I can know is when I've really dedicated myself to my art, and when I think I'm at my best. And I like to think that I'm doing both of those things as much as possible.\"",

    "summary": "In her latest film, Nicole Kidman plays a successful CEO who takes up with a much younger intern. She talks about how she chooses such intense and challenging roles.",
    "story": [
      "I last talked with Nicole Kidman for \"Sunday Morning\" several years ago. Not much has happened since then. Just kidding! Kidman is in the middle of a \"golden era,\" following her Emmy-winning turn in the TV series \"Big Little Lies.\"",
      "To name just two of her recent projects: the TV series \"The Perfect Couple,\" co-starring Liev Schreiber; and \"Special Ops: Lioness,\" with Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "Is the sense that time is fleeting part of why she has been so prolific? \"Yeah, probably,\" Kidman said.",
      "She's still the better half of country great Keith Urban. But the thing Kidman is getting the most attention for these days is a film coming out on Christmas \u2026 and what a film it is. In \"Babygirl,\" Kidman plays a happily married, successful CEO who is in some ways unfulfilled, so she takes up with a handsome intern (Harris Dickinson, of \"Triangle of Sadness\") who knows just how to scratch her particular itch.",
      "I asked, \"Was there any point where you thought, 'Oh, I don't know if I can do this'?\"",
      "\"Yeah, yeah. And a lot of it is stamina, 'cause I'm in every frame of the film,\" she replied.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Babygirl,\" click on the video player below:",
      "Kidman is committed to working a lot with female directors, and in Halina Reijn's hands, the film is intense and relentless.",
      "I asked: \"Do you think part of what makes you do your job \u2013 \"",
      "\"Weird?\" Kidman offered.",
      "\"Well \u2026 weird, yeah, that's where I was going with that?\"",
      "\"You can say it!\"",
      "\"Do you think part of what makes you a good actor is that ability to feel intensely?\"",
      "\"Probably the thing that I have is the ability to feel, like, really feel,\" Kidman said. \"I go into hospitals. Keith and I will work where we go \u2026 he'll bring his guitar and we'll just, you know, in the oncology units. And I have to not absorb someone else's emotions.\"",
      "\"Because that's your tendency? That's what you tend to do?\"",
      "\"Yeah. And Keith's always said, 'You're like a raw egg that I have to be the shell for.'\"",
      "Kidman doesn't look all that vulnerable, but when she's not out being a global superstar, she's a complete homebody. In fact, the daily routine at her Nashville home, with Keith and their two daughters, might sound a lot like yours. \"We have breakfast together every morning, so even if I'm working, I'm up. And then dinners. I also like putting on my jammies and coming home.\"",
      "\"Are you a homebody?\"",
      "\"Yeah, putting on my bed socks. But we do have a rule: You can't put your pajamas on before 5:00 p.m.\"",
      "\"Why do you have that rule?\"",
      "\"Because otherwise, you can get into them a lot earlier. Not a good thing!\"",
      "But there have been moments, Kidman says, when she seriously thought about being a full-time stay-at-home mom \u2013 giving up the whole acting thing. She says that in 2008, after she gave birth to her daughter, Sunday, \"I was like, 'Well, I think I'm pretty much done now.' I had moved to Nashville. We were living on a farm. And that's when my mom actually said, 'I wouldn't give up completely. Keep a finger sort of in it.' And I'm like, 'No, no. I'm done now. I'm done.' She's going, 'Just listen to me. I think, keep moving forward. Not saying that you have to do it to the level you've been doing it, but I wouldn't give it up completely.'\"",
      "After that, Kidman went on to do some of the best work of her career, and this past April she received the lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute.\u00a0 Her pal Meryl Streep did the honors that night, speaking of Nicole: \"The hardest part is when you come up against, or you're acting with another person who is also really, really, really, really, really, really great. That's difficult for me!\"",
      "Kidman said the honor felt strange. \"'Cause at first I was like, 'I'm not sure I want this right now. Does that mean it's over?'\"",
      "But for Kidman, who's already picked up a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in \"Babygirl,\" the year's stratospheric highs have been tempered by a devastating loss: Her mother, Jannele, died in September at age 84, as Kidman was en route to the Venice Film Festival for a screening of \"Babygirl.\"",
      "I asked Kidman, \"Did you share with her what it was about?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She knew. She knew everything,\" she replied. \"That's probably the biggest loss, is you lose the person that knows everything, that loves you anyway. I love when people say, 'There is no limit to your grief. You don't have to have a time limit on it. You don't have to be all better by this time.' So, you're allowed to constantly let it pass through in waves. \u2026 People go, 'Oh, well, whatever.' But it's my mama, my life, and I'm allowed to process it and grieve in the way I want to.\"",
      "\"Yeah, there is no time limit. And it does come in waves.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's weird.\"",
      "\"And you never know when it's gonna hit.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's like it's a different road,\" Kidman said. \"When my papa passed \u2013 and I suppose it's good to talk about it all, because so many people in the world are going through it \u2013 but it's just a whole other thing, both parents gone. Just like, 'Whoa. Okay. Wow.'\"",
      "\"But that's okay. And I appreciate your sharing it. Because, like you said, people \u2013\"",
      "\"Move on quick!\" Kidman laughed. \"Now I'm embarrassed!\"",
      "Kidman may keep her emotions within easy reach, but that's not a bad thing: In the same face that you might see torrents of rage and grief, you can just as easily see happiness and hope.",
      "I asked her, \"Do you feel like this now is a moment \u2013 you know, all of these awards, the festivals, several hit television series \u2013 do you feel like you're in this moment right now?\"",
      "\"No,\" Kidman replied. \"I'm just me. But I think 'cause I've had so many years of so many different things happening and I'm fully cognizant of where I am, I'm wide awake. I'm in this world. I'm curious, and grateful, and amazed. I love the word wonder, 'cause I still have a lot of wonder, and a lot of excitement about what's to come.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 09:38:36 -0500",
    "summary": "In the new Broadway revival of \"Gypsy,\" six-time Tony Award-winner Audra McDonald takes on one of musical theater's most demanding roles: stage mother Rose, who pushes daughter Gypsy Rose Lee into becoming a striptease artist.",
    "story": [
      "She's the mother of all stage mothers: Rose, a single mom hellbent on turning her two young daughters into stars during the waning days of vaudeville. But in the musical \"Gypsy,\" she gets top billing. Rosalind Russell played her in the 1962 movie; Bette Midler in the 1993 TV version; and on stage, where it all started, Rose has been played by some of Broadway's greats, including Ethel Merman, Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, Bernadette Peters and Patti LuPone.",
      "And opening this week, six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald will take on one of musical theater's most demanding roles. \"It's a high gear the entire time,\" she said. \"And instead of someone sweeping me up in the tornado, I'm the tornado!\"",
      "It's a part that's been compared to Shakespeare's King Lear. According to Erick Neher, cultural editor for the Hudson Review, \"What Lear is to classical actors, that is what Rose is to musical theater. It's the Everest. It's the summit. It's an impossible role in a way, and yet every great musical theatre actress wants to test herself with it.\"",
      "McDonald said, \"Everest is there for a reason. People want to climb it, right? I mean, it's there because it's majestic and it's incredible, and people are like, 'I want to figure out if I can get up there.' And that's what I'm trying to do.\"",
      "The musical was inspired by the memoir of Gypsy Rose Lee, one of the world's most famous striptease artists. But the musical's creators, including writer Arthur Laurents, weren't interested in telling her story. Neher said, \"The really interesting thing about the show 'Gypsy' is that it's not really about Gypsy Rose Lee or even her sister June, who became a very well-known actress, June Havoc. It's about their mother, a tyrannical, insane, fabulous woman who pushed these two young girls onto the stage.\"",
      "It's Rose who volunteers her older daughter to perform a striptease for the first time. Were audiences shocked by the idea of a mother who would push her daughter to basically become a stripper? \"It's still shocking today, I think, when we see it,\" said Neher.",
      "Before \"Gypsy,\" stage mothers were largely played for laughs, as they still are today; think reality shows like \"Dance Moms.\" Neher said, \"What really differentiates 'Gypsy' is that it's the first work in any genre that I can think of that takes this comic character of the pushy stage mother and then does this psychological deep-dive into it.\"",
      "\"I admire the ferocity,\" said five-time Tony Award-winner George C. Wolfe, who is directing this production. \"I think it's about not enough, people living with not enough: Not enough money, not enough space, not enough love, not enough approval, not enough success. And it becomes this dynamic of people wanting that thing, desperately wanting that thing that is just beyond their reach.\"",
      "The question that looms over any production of \"Gypsy\" is, why does this woman drive her children so hard \u2026 and ultimately away from her?",
      "McDonald said, \"I think she is a dedicated mother. I think she is a fiercely protective mother. I think she is a mother who does not realize that the umbilical cord has been cut. I don't see Rose as a monster mother at all.\"",
      "So, is she in this for her kids, or for herself? \"I don't think she can differentiate between the two,\" McDonald said.",
      "Rose may stop at nothing in pursuit of her dream. But the director and star of this production \u2013 the first on Broadway in which mother and daughters are played by Black actors \u2013 say there's a good reason.",
      "According to Wolfe, \"It's not a selfish dream. It's not a 'my' dream. It's a wonderful dream for me and my kids.\"",
      "McDonald adds, \"Which is so interesting, too, then, why society has the audacity to say, 'How dare she have that dream for her kids?' I did what society laid out for me: 'No.' And look where it got me: 'No.' My kids are just supposed to go to school like other girls, and cook and clean and sit and die? And especially that feels like that hits hard, too, as a Black woman saying, 'No, they're not gonna do that.'\"",
      "It may all sound pretty serious for a musical. But did we mention there are some real showstoppers in \"Gypsy\" \u2026 and an adorable pooch?",
      "\"She really, really sweet,\" McDonald said, who introduced us to the dog who plays Chowsie. \"We saw a lotta dogs. It took a while before we found the right one. No one's watching you when they're on stage, that much I do know!\" she laughed.",

      "Paula Abdul and former \"American Idol\" producer Nigel Lythgoe have agreed to settle a\u00a0lawsuit in which she alleged he sexually assaulted\u00a0her in the early 2000s when she was a judge on the show.",
      "Abdul filed a notice of settlement of the case in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday. It still must be approved by a judge.",
      "\"I am grateful that this chapter has successfully come to a close and is now something I can now put behind me,\" Abdul said in a statement Friday. \"This has been a long and hard-fought personal battle. I hope my experience can serve to inspire other women, facing similar struggles, to overcome their own challenges with dignity and respect, so that they too can turn the page and begin a new chapter of their lives.\"",
      "The court filing said the settlement was unconditional, but did not reveal the terms, and Abdul's attorney Melissa Eubanks said she could not comment on them.",
      "An email seeking comment from attorneys for Lythgoe was not immediately answered.",
      "The lawsuit filed nearly a year ago had also accused Lythgoe of sexually assaulting Abdul after she left \"American Idol\" and became a judge on Lythgoe's other competition show, \"So You Think You Can Dance.\"",
      "Lythgoe said at the time that he was \"shocked and saddened\" by the allegations, which he called \"an appalling smear.\"",
      "After other lawsuits were filed alleging sexual misconduct, Lythgoe\u00a0stepped down in January from his role\u00a0as a judge on \"So You Think You Can Dance.\"",
      "The 75-year-old English-born producer has been a prominent TV producer for decades in both the U.K. and the U.S., working on reality competition shows including \"American Idol.\"",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly, as Abdul has done.",
      "Abdul, a Grammy and Emmy-winning singer and dancer, said in the lawsuit that she remained silent for years about the alleged assaults out of fear of retaliation by \"one of the most well-known producers of television competition shows.\"",
      "She alleged that the first sexual assault occurred while Abdul and Lythgoe were on the road filming auditions for an early season of \"American Idol,\" which premiered in 2002.",
      "Abdul says Lythgoe groped her in the elevator of their hotel after a day of filming and \"began shoving his tongue down her throat.\" Abdul pushed him away and ran to her hotel room when the elevator doors opened.",
      "\"In tears, Abdul quickly called one of her representatives to inform them of the assault,\" the lawsuit says, \"but ultimately decided not to take action for fear that Lythgoe would have her fired.\"",
      "Abdul starred as a judge for the first eight seasons, leaving in 2009.",
      "In 2015, Abdul became a judge on \"So You Think You Can Dance,\" appearing alongside Lythgoe.",
      "Around that time, Abdul alleged in the lawsuit, Lythgoe forced himself on top of her during a dinner at his home and tried to kiss her. Abdul said she again pushed Lythgoe away and immediately left.",
      "Abdul left that reality show after two seasons. She has not worked with Lythgoe since.",
      "In a statement at the time of the suit, Lythgoe said \"While Paula's history of erratic behavior is well known, I can't pretend to understand exactly why she would file a lawsuit that she must know is untrue.\""

      "\"The mystery has finally been solved,\" Congo's health ministry declared in a statement on Tuesday. \"It's a case of severe malaria in the form of a respiratory illness.\"",

      "The Congo's health minister had told journalists the country was on \"maximum alert\" over the spread of the previously unidentified disease, and health officials told CBS News in early December that the remoteness of the epicenter of the outbreak and lack of a diagnosis made it difficult to launch a concerted response.",
      "At least 592 cases were reported after the alert was first raised by Congo's health ministry on Oct. 29. The ministry said the disease had a fatality rate of 6.25%.

    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 09:55:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA's top food official says the safety of the dye called Red 40 hasn't been assessed in over a decade, despite concerns over its potential behavioral health effects.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has not formally reevaluated the safety of a food dye called Red 40 in over a decade, the agency's top food official said this month when asked about renewed worries over its potential behavioral health effects.",
      "The agency has launched a new effort to take a second look at some previously approved additives. But Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, warned their budget was too small and that it would take years to catch up to other countries.",
      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized,\" Jones told Sen. Tommy Tuberville at a hearing of the Senate's health committee.",
      "Tuberville also asked Jones about a different food dye called Red 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned against due to studies showing it causes cancer in animals. Jones suggested the agency could be weeks away from moving to ban it.",
      "The decades-old controversy over synthetic food dyes has gained renewed attention on Capitol Hill, thanks in part to outspoken criticism from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the department overseeing the FDA and other health agencies.",
      "\"Senator Tuberville looks forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to Make America Healthy Again,\" a spokesperson for the Alabama Republican said, referring to the slogan RFK Jr. has promoted Tuberville was \"shocked to learn\" the FDA had not reviewed Red 40's safety for so long, his spokesperson said.",
      "What is red dye 40?",
      "FD&C Red No. 40, or Red 40 for short, is the FDA's name to refer to a color additive first registered with the agency in the 1970s. The chemical is known as Allura Red AC in the food industry and E 129 in Europe.",
      "It is now mostly synthesized from petroleum.",
      "Further chemical reactions to combine the dye with aluminum create what's known as \"Red 40 Lake.\" Lakes are often used for products like chewing gum where there is not enough moisture to dissolve the dye into the product, or in products like frostings to help prevent the colors from bleeding.",
      "The FDA says it subjects production of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes to stepped-up scrutiny, screening each batch for any contaminants from its production process.",
      "Among the dyes that undergo this purity certification, Red 40 consistently ranks as the one with the highest quantity produced each quarter.",
      "\"People think that 'I know which foods have dyes and which don't,' but no you do not. White foods can contain dyes, foods marketed as healthy and natural can contain dyes, egg noodles can contain dyes, it's just very hard to know and avoid them, unless you look at the label,\" said environmental health consultant Lisa Lefferts.",
      "Lefferts was closely involved with a push by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for the FDA to curb use of synthetic food dyes, as well as a new law in California that will ban Red 40 and some other dyes from school meals starting in 2028.",
      "\"If you talk to parents whose kids are sensitive to dyes, they'll tell you how difficult it is to avoid dyes and what a huge change it was for their entire household to try to get these dyes out of their kids' diets,\" she said.",
      "What is red dye 3?",
      "The dye called Red No. 3, also made of petroleum, is what gives a bright cherry-red color to a lot of foods and candies.",
      "\"There seems to be an increased risk, at least in rats, of thyroid cancer. We also see an association with hyperactivity in kids,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said on \"CBS Mornings\" Tuesday.",
      "Scientists, consumer protection groups and food safety groups have petitioned the FDA to withdraw their approval for Red No. 3, and the FDA is expected to act sometime in the next few weeks, Gounder said.",
      "This dye has already been banned in cosmetics and topical medications since 1990.",
      "What foods and drinks have red dye 40?",
      "An FDA study published in 2016 estimated that children are exposed to Red 40 the most from drinks, frozen desserts and cereal.",
      "Databases published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and nonprofit Environmental Working Group tally thousands of foods with Red 40. Medications and cosmetics also have it.",
      "They include products like Kellogg's Froot Loops, a cereal brand that Kennedy has criticized. The foodmaker has faced calls to remove artificial colors, like it did for less fluorescent versions of Froot Loops sold in other countries like Canada. Other major cereal brands like Lucky Charms from General Mills also have Red 40.",
      "Froot Loops maker WK Kellogg\u00a0has said\u00a0that its foods are safe and its ingredients all comply with federal regulations.",
      "Several frozen dessert products also rely on Red 40, including Turkey Hill's Black Raspberry Premium Ice Cream, Breyers' M&M's Minis Caramel Fudge Light Ice Cream, Blue Bell's Birthday Cake Vanilla Flavored Ice Cream Cups and Blue Bunny's Strawberry Flavored Soft Frozen Dairy Dessert.",
      "A number of soft drinks also use Red 40, like Gatorade Fruit Punch and Fanta Soda. Other kinds of beverages also can contain the dye, like several strawberry milk brands or various generic manufacturers of pink lemonade mixes.",
      "Gounder said it's important to look at labels since it's the only way to know if there are synthetic dyes in a product.",
      "\"You can't look at the color. Even white foods may have synthetic dyes to make it brighter,\" she said.",
      "Why are there calls to ban red dye 40?",
      "Most calls to restrict Red 40 stem from research commissioned by British food authorities in 2007, which linked increases of hyperactivity in children to mixtures of synthetic dyes.",
      "After the findings, authorities in Europe did not ban the dyes across the continent. Canada also continues to permit use of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes.",
      "But the United Kingdom and Europe did add warnings to labels for foods containing any of the dyes from the tested mixtures, including Red 40, saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "A review by California's Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 looking at dozens of studies agreed \"that synthetic food dyes can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children,\" including Red 40.",
      "Lefferts said it was \"a no-brainer\" that synthetic dyes should be pulled from the food supply, given concerns over this risk. She praised California's review for integrating data from animal and lab studies, helping to fill in gaps from human research to prove a causal link.",
      "\"Synthetic food dyes are completely unnecessary. They can be omitted entirely or replaced with safe alternatives. Their purpose is purely cosmetic and we have all this evidence,\" said Lefferts.",
      "In a statement, the International Association of Color Manufacturers cited past FDA advisory panels, as well as findings by European and international health authorities, which have stopped short of concluding there was a causal link between Red 40 and hyperactivity.",
      "\"The FDA regulates the safety and labeling of all color additives, and it does so based on scientific evidence. As such, the FDA has determined and continues to maintain that FD&C Red No. 40 is safe,\" said Sarah Codrea, the trade group's executive director.",
      "Why isn't red dye 40 banned in the U.S.?",
      "After the British study led authorities in Europe to warn about dyes like Red 40, the FDA convened a meeting of its food advisers in 2011 to review their safety.",
      "The panel voted narrowly against a similar kind of warning. Most said they thought studies had fallen short of proving a causal link, but were split on whether the studies warranted a warning.",
      "\"Causality is a distant aspiration, but certainly these data don't give us any confidence that we can say there's nothing to worry about here,\" committee member Dr. Francisco Xavier Castellanos said during the meeting.",
      "A meeting of the agency's science board later in 2019 concluded that \"most children have no effects from consuming foods containing color additives, though some evidence suggested that certain children may be part of a sensitive subpopulation,\" an FDA spokesperson said.",
      "\"Reassessing the safety of chemicals in food as new, relevant data become available is a priority for the FDA,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Pulling previously approved chemicals off the market is an uphill battle through the cumbersome federal \"rulemaking\" process, which requires the agency to defend its answers to any question or concern raised by opponents of the measure \u2014 often companies with millions of dollars at stake.",
      "\"The agency can't just wave a wand and say, we don't like these anymore. There's whole industries that have been developed using this color additive with the understanding that it's safe,\" said Dennis Keefe, the former director of the FDA's office of food additive safety.",
      "Keefe said adding a warning requires the agency's lawyers to argue a \"compelling public health reason,\" given the high bar set by the First Amendment to compel speech on labels.",
      "Short of Congress stepping in to mandate changes or fund the kind of pricey studies to fill the gaps from previous research, Keefe said the agency faced more pressing public health priorities for its limited food budget.",
      "\"The agency needs to defend, scientifically, in the courts, to take the action. And they would have to have good data that Red 40 in particular is causing these hyperactivities. And the data just really aren't that tight,\" said Keefe.",

    "story": [
      "Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell issued an apparent warning Friday to Robert F. Kennedy, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Health and Human Services Department, after The New York Times reported that one of Kennedy's top advisers had filed petitions to revoke the approval of a polio vaccine and several other shots.",
      "\"Anyone seeking the Senate's consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\" McConnell said in a statement.",
      "McConnell, a polio survivor, denounced efforts \"to undermine public confidence in proven cures\" like the polio vaccine.",
      "\"The polio vaccine has saved millions of lives and held out the promise of eradicating a terrible disease. Efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they're dangerous,\" McConnell said.",
      "McConnell credited the \"miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother's love\" with saving him from paralysis when he contracted the disease at two years of age, and he praised\u00a0 the \"miracle\" of \"the saving power of the polio vaccine\" for the millions of children who came after him.",
      "The\u00a0Times article focused in large part on the work of attorney Aaron Siri for the nonprofit Informed Consent Action Network, or ICAN, which petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 \"demanding that the FDA suspend or withdraw approval\" of Sanofi Pasteur's inactivated polio vaccine, called IPOL.",
      "Siri has been acting as an adviser to the transition team for Kennedy, who, if confirmed by the Senate, would oversee the FDA and the nation's other public health agencies.",
      "Siri called the Times article a \"hit piece\" that did not engage with the substance of the \"legitimate\" concern at the center of the petition he filed for ICAN.",
      "\"ICAN's petition, filed in 2022, makes the reasonable request that the FDA, as required by federal law, require a proper clinical trial for IPOL prior to licensure,\" Siri posted on X.",
      "The Times report on Siri's work sparked a renewed round of backlash against Kennedy by Democrats, too, who have criticized Trump for months over his ties with Kennedy.",
      "As HHS secretary, Kennedy would have significant direct authority as the nation's health secretary over how vaccines are studied, approved and recommended in the U.S. He and his FDA commissioner would also oversee how government lawyers respond to many of the legal battles Siri has launched against the agency over vaccines.",
      "Kennedy himself has said he would not ban vaccines and has tried to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, instead calling for further study of the shots. He recently resigned as chair of Children's Health Defense, a nonprofit that watchdog groups have found for years to be spreading misinformation over fears about vaccines.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has said he might be open to getting rid of some vaccines \"if I think it's dangerous,\" pledging to listen to Kennedy.",
      "\"We're going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there's something causing it,\" Trump said in an interview with Time magazine published this week, when he was asked if he'd sign off on a move by Kennedy to end childhood vaccination programs.",
      "Extensive medical research has conclusively shown that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "Siri's petition for ICAN has not progressed much at the FDA since it was filed in 2022. It is one of several legal efforts Siri has filed for groups against several shots, including a petition in 2020 over hepatitis B vaccines.",
      "In a 2023 letter responding to the polio petition, the agency's top vaccine official, Dr. Peter Marks, wrote that the FDA \"has been unable to reach a decision on your petition because it raises issues requiring further review and analysis by agency officials.\"",
      "Siri's petition targets IPOL, which is the only \"single-antigen\" polio vaccine currently recommended for use in the U.S. The vaccine was approved in the 1990s.",
      "Many children who receive immunizations for polio often do not receive IPOL, but rather, one of several combination vaccines that blend a harmless version of the poliovirus with other recommended antigens for various vaccine-preventable diseases.",
      "The CDC says IPOL is \"mainly used as a travel vaccine for adults.\" The agency says that the \"body of scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports\" the safety of polio vaccines.",
      "Siri has hinted at plans for more petitions to the FDA, after Kennedy is in charge at HHS.",
      "\"It will help if there are outsiders, from the outside attacking in. For example, the FDA acts on petitions. If you want to license a product, you have to petition them. If you want a product to be withdrawn or reevaluated, you typically often have to petition them,\" Siri told Del Bigtree, ICAN's founder and a former campaign spokesperson for Kennedy, on his podcast last month.",

      "The Teamsters say the workers, who authorized walkouts in the past few days, are hitting the pavement after Amazon ignored a Dec. 15 deadline the union set for contract negotiations.

    "story": [
      "U.S. stocks plummeted in one of their worst days of the year after the Federal Reserve forecast Wednesday it may deliver fewer shots of adrenaline  for the economy in 2025 than it had earlier projected.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 178 points, or 3%, pulling it further from its all-time high  set a couple weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1,123 points, or 2.6%, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 3.6%.",
      "The Fed said Wednesday it's cutting its benchmark interest rate for a third time this year, continuing the sharp turnaround begun in September when it started lowering rates  from a two-decade high to support the job market. Wall Street loves lower interest rates, but the Dec. 18 cut had been widely expected by Wall Street.",
      "Why is the stock market down today?",
      "Investors were unsettled by the Fed's forecast for fewer cuts in 2025, even though many economists had already been paring their expectations given sticky inflation.",
      "\"Markets have a really bad of habit of overreacting to Fed policy moves,\" Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said in an analyst note. \"The Fed didn't do or say anything that deviated from what the market expected\u2014this seems more like, I'm leaving for Christmas break, so I'll sell and start up next year.\"",
      "The bigger question centers on how much more the Fed could cut next year. A lot is riding on it, particularly after expectations for a series of cuts in 2025 helped the U.S. stock market set an all-time high 57 times so far in 2024.",
      "Fed officials released projections on Wednesday showing the median expectation among them is for two more cuts to the federal funds rate in 2025, or half a percentage point's worth. That's down from the four cuts they had expected just three months ago.",
      "\"We are in a new phase of the process,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. The central bank has already quickly eased its main interest rate by a full percentage point, to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%, since September.",
      "What happened to the stock market today?",
      "Asked why Fed officials are looking to slow their pace of cuts, Powell pointed to how the job market looks to be performing well overall and how recent inflation readings have picked up. He also cited uncertainties that will require policy makers to react to upcoming, to-be-determined changes in the economy.",
      "While lower rates can goose the economy by making it cheaper to borrow and boosting prices for investments, they can also offer more fuel for inflation.",
      "Powell said some Fed officials, but not all, are also already trying to incorporate uncertainties inherent in a new administration coming into the White House. Worries are rising on Wall Street that President-elect Donald Trump's  preference for tariffs and other policies could further juice inflation, along with economic growth.",
      "\"When the path is uncertain, you go a little slower,\" Powell said. It's \"not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down.\"",
      "One official, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, thought the central bank should not have even cut rates this time around. She was the lone vote against Wednesday's rate cut.",
      "Wall Street's worst performers",
      "The reduced expectations for 2025 rate cuts sent Treasury yields rising in the bond market, squeezing the stock market.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.51% from 4.40% late Tuesday, which is a notable move for the bond market. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, climbed to 4.35% from 4.25%.",
      "On Wall Street, stocks of companies that can feel the most pressure from higher interest rates fell to some of the worst losses.",
      "Stocks of smaller companies did particularly poorly, for example. Many need to borrow to fuel their growth, meaning they can feel more pain when having to pay higher interest rates for loans. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks tumbled 4.4%.",
      "Elsewhere on Wall Street, General Mills dropped 3.1% despite reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. The maker of Progresso soups and Cheerios said it will increase its investments in brands to help them grow, which pushed it to cut its forecast for profit this fiscal year.",
      "Nvidia, the superstar stock  responsible for a chunk of Wall Street's rally to records in recent years, fell 1.1% to extend its weekslong funk. It has dropped more than 13% from its record set last month and fallen in nine of the last 10 days as its big momentum slows.",
      "\"As we wrote in our 2025 outlook a couple of weeks ago, stretched positioning and sentiment left stocks vulnerable to a sell-off,\" Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial said in a note about today's market sell-off. \"The big jump in inflation expectations and related bond sell-off was a convenient excuse.

      "The rate cut, which was expected, was the \"least important component\" of today's Fed meeting, noted Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, in an email. Instead, Wall Street was focused on the Fed's forecasts for 2025 and beyond, with the central bank's new forecasts signaling the Fed has entered \"a new phase of monetary policy, the pause phase,\" McIntyre added.",
      "Wednesday's move marks the Fed's final interest rate decision prior to President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. While price increases have cooled from their June 2022 peak, opening the door to Fed rate cuts this year, inflation has remained sticky and well above the Fed's 2% annual target.",
      "Given that inflation has been sticky this year, many analysts have predicted that the Fed was likely to make fewer rate cuts in 2025 amid concerns that could cause the economy to overheat.",
      "Still, the Fed has so far defied forecasters' warnings that its rate hikes could trigger a recession.",
      "The Fed's first rate meeting of 2025 is scheduled for Jan. 28-29, or after Trump's inauguration. About eight in 10 economists expect the Fed to hold rates steady at that meeting, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "Powell's bullish economic outlook",
      "While Powell said that the slow progress in grinding down inflation has been \"a bit frustrating,\" he also sounded an optimistic note about the U.S. economy, stressing that the nation's growth has far outpaced that of other developed economies.",
      "\"It's pretty clear we've avoided a recession \u2014 growth this year has been solid,\" Powell said. \"Again, the U.S. economy has just been remarkable,\" while other countries have contended with slow growth and \"struggles with inflation.\"",
      "He added, \"I expect another good year next year.\"",
      "As far as Trump's stated plans to enact broad-based tariffs, which many economists forecast could prove inflationary, if enacted, Powell said the Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach. The Fed is examining the potential impact from tariffs, but it will be \"quite some time\" until there are policies put into place by the second Trump administration for the central bank to examine, Powell added.",
      "\"We just don't know very much at all about the actual policies \u2014 we don't know how much will be tariffed, from which countries,\" he noted. \"We don't know if there will be retaliatory tariffs.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 17:07:18 -0500",
    "summary": "\"In essence, this money has been stolen from all of us for all these years,\" said an 84-year-old woman whose late husband's Social Security benefits were slashed. \"It's not fair.\"",
    "story": [
      "At 84 years old, Evelyn Paternostro spends her days working part time as a cashier at Dollar Tree. For decades, she dedicated her life to education, serving as a teacher and principal in Louisiana. But despite years of her public service, she now struggles to make ends meet.",
      "\"People at the store ask me all the time, 'Are you doing this for fun? Why aren't you retired?'\" she said. \"Because I need to eat.\"",
      "After her husband died, Paternostro discovered she couldn't collect his Social Security benefits due to a pair of federal policies called the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset.",
      "These provisions reduce or eliminate Social Security\u00a0benefits\u00a0for millions of Americans if they receive a public pension that didn't withhold Social Security tax. Retired teachers, firefighters and other public servants are some of the most impacted.",
      "\"I was really blindsided,\" she said. \"I knew I was going to have a teacher's retirement. I was going to be part of the Louisiana Teachers Retirement System. And I never really thought about my husband's income and what that would mean to me.\"",
      "Who is affected?",
      "Nearly 2.8 million individuals across the United States are impacted by WEP and GPO. Its effects extend to all employees of state, county, municipal and special districts in 26 states. Teachers in 13 of those states, including specific districts in Kentucky and Georgia, also feel its impact.",
      "In Massachusetts and certain districts in Rhode Island, not all municipal employees, but only teachers are impacted.",
      "The purpose of these two 1980s-era programs was \"so that there was no way you could 'double dip' into both a federal pension and Social Security,\" explains Jill Schlesinger, CBS News business analyst.",
      "The Windfall Elimination Provision affects people who qualify for Social Security benefits through their job but also receive a pension from another job where they didn't pay into Social Security.",
      "It may decrease their Social Security payments by up to half the value of their pension.",
      "For example, Michelle Cosgrove's benefits will be cut nearly in half \u2014 reduced by $557, to $601.",
      "Cosgrove spent the first half of her career as a paralegal, contributing to Social Security, before staying home to raise her children.",
      "Later, she became a public school teacher in the San Francisco Bay Area, paying into CalSTRS, California's educator pension fund. However, her plans for retirement took an unexpected turn when she discovered the intricacies of the pension system.",
      "When she retired, Cosgrove's reduced payments affected her ability to pay bills and cover expenses.",
      "The other program, the Government Pension Offset, further impacted Cosgrove after her husband, Mike, passed away in 2022. Despite working in the private sector for decades and contributing to Social Security, his benefits were largely inaccessible to her due to the GPO. Mike, a welding supervisor, was diagnosed with a rare cancer at 52 but continued working until his health worsened. He died at the age of 63.",
      "If pension recipients are a widow or widower of someone who received Social Security benefits, that pension recipient may have reduced survivors benefits or may not receive benefits at all.",
      "\"If I'd have stayed home and done nothing, I'd have gotten all the money,\" Cosgrove said. \"Had I known this, I might not have gone into teaching. I'd have picked something different.\"",
      "The GPO mainly affects women, with 83% of those impacted by GPO being female, according data from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"When you see the numbers of the GPO elevated, it's because many of those people were probably teachers and married to somebody who worked in a Social Security job,\" said Joslyn DeLancey, vice president of the Connecticut Education Association. \"They're not going to get that spousal Social Security. \u2026 It's such a messy and nuanced thing.\"",
      "Paternostro estimates she would have received $2,500 a month in Social Security benefits \u2014 about $300,000 over the last decade.",
      "\"That's a lot of money,\" she said. \"That's more money than I can imagine.\"",
      "But these policies brought a different kind of heartache for Dede Ruel, a retired school psychologist in Illinois.",
      "She said she recently received a letter from Social Security informing her that she owed more than $13,000, reducing her Social Security checks by 21%.",
      "According to a CBS News analysis of federal data, these policies are one of the most common reasons for Social Security overpayments, which have totaled more than $450 million in fiscal years 2017-2021.",
      "\"I have been trying to appeal it through their process and I've been denied at every level,\" Ruel said.",
      "The Social Security Administration's press office provided comments after the initial publication of this story, stating that \"state and local government employers are\u00a0required\u00a0to disclose potential effects of WEP/GPO on newly hired non-covered employees.\"",
      "\"We work to pay the right people the right amounts at the right time, and Social Security issues correct payments in most cases,\" a Social Security spokesperson said. \"However, there is room to improve, as people count on the agency to prevent overpayments and underpayments from happening.\"",
      "Bipartisan support for the Social Security Fairness Act",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act, one of the most bipartisan bills in Congress this session, aims to repeal WEP and GPO.",
      "The House\u00a0voted\u00a0to pass the legislation Nov. 12. The Senate is expected to vote on the Social Security Fairness Act this week.",
      "Social Security is projected to run out of funds in 2035 unless there is a change made to the fund's cost and revenue system.",
      "Even though supporters of the Social Security Fairness Act argue it will only drain the Social Security fund six months earlier than otherwise expected, some critics believe there are better solutions, suggesting states should restructure their retirement systems to address the root causes rather than rely on federal fixes.",
      "\"A lot of the critics say this is gonna cost a lot of money, almost $200 billion dollars over the next 10 years,\" explains Schlesinger. \"Critics say there is a reason why we force people to pay into the Social Security system. These are two separate systems. If we need to fix Social Security, let's fix it. Let's not just do a repeal which is essentially a Band-Aid.\"",
      "Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican from Louisiana who spearheaded the bill, said, \"People should receive benefits based on what they paid into the system. That's what the formula should largely be based upon. I understand the efforts back in the '70s and '80s, but the overcorrection has likely taken $600 to $700 billion in benefits from these folks.\"",
      "Devin Carroll, a financial planner, encounters many clients who are \"completely taken by surprise.\" Carroll often instructs his clients to use the Social Security Administration's WEP calculator, a tool that calculates benefits with the impact of the WEP factored in.",
      "Carroll explains that it can be challenging to figure out future Social Security benefits. The benefits formula includes \"bend points,\" which are adjusted annually based on wage inflation.",
      "These adjustments are crucial because the actual amount of the WEP reduction is determined the year a person turns 62.",
      "\"You have to make some projections, some assumptions about forward-looking inflation, both price inflation and wage inflation,\" Carroll explained. \"Once you do, then you can start to work through that and use a calculator like the SSA has that will do a lot of that for you, and it will tell you what your WEP adjusted for retirement age benefit should be.\"",
      "Carroll also gets to see the impacts of these provisions firsthand. His daughter-in-law is a teacher in Texas and his son is a firefighter in Texas.",
      "\"In essence, this money has been stolen from all of us for all these years,\" Paternostro said. \"It's not fair.\"",
      "Editor's note: This story has been updated to correct the amount of Michelle Cosgrove's benefits.",

    "story": [
      "Legislation to expand Social Security benefits to millions of Americans cleared a key procedural hurdle in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday afternoon and is now headed toward a final vote, with the clock ticking and only days left in the current session of Congress.",
      "Senators voted 73-27 to approve a motion to proceed with consideration of the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, according to an unofficial Senate tally shown in a\u00a0webcast\u00a0on the floor of the chamber.",
      "\"We will vote on taking up the Social Security Fairness Act to repeal flawed policies that eat away at the benefits of those who've worked as teachers, firefighters, postal workers, or public sector workers,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on social media shortly before the vote. \"Retirees deprived of their hard-earned benefits will be watching closely.\"",
      "The New York Democrat has pushed to bring the measure up for a full vote, which would eliminate two federal policies that prevent million of Americans, including police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension from collecting their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Social Security is a bedrock of our middle class. You pay into it for 40 quarters, you earned it, it should be there when you retire,\" Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who lost his seat in the November election, told the chamber ahead of Wednesday's vote. \"All these workers are asking for is for what they earned.\"",
      "Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican relayed having a retired teacher cry in his office, \"not understanding why she was getting less in Social Security spousal benefits than if she had never worked at all.\"",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis spoke against measure, saying that while a small percentage of people are not getting what they should from Social Security, enacting what he framed as an unfunded government mandate that would increase the federal deficit \"is not the way to fix it.\"",
      "\"This bill will take $200 billion during the 10-year period out of the Social Security trust fund without any way to pay for it,\" the North Carolina Republican added.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that broadly reduce payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.

      "The measure, which passed the House in November, had 62 cosponsors when it was introduced in the Senate last year. Yet the bill's bipartisan support eroded some in recent days, with some Republican lawmakers voicing doubts due to its cost.

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 14:32:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve announced a third rate cut today, but also cautioned it expects fewer cuts in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve today made its final interest rate decision of 2024, capping a year during which the central bank provided some financial relief to inflation-weary borrowers in September by ushering in its first rate reduction in four years.",
      "On Dec. 18, the Federal Reserve made its third consecutive cut of 2024, reducing the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points. Yet the Fed also projected a slower pace of cuts in 2025, a move that had been expected by economists given the nation's still-sticky inflation rate and some of President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies, which, if enacted, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been battling inflation since March 2022, when it began ratcheting up rates to cool the economy, eventually pushing its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years. While inflation has moderated considerably since then, November's Consumer Price Index rose 2.7%, outpacing the Fed's goal of driving down inflation to a 2% annual rate.",
      "That signals the battle against inflation isn't yet over, though the November inflation report was in line with economists' expectations. At the same time, the unemployment rate has inched higher this year, sparking concerns from the Fed about weaknesses in the labor market, and helping open the door to its recent rate reductions, noted one economist.",
      "\"Higher for longer is the mantra headed into 2025,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, in an email. \"The Fed's quarterly projections indicate a common expectation of just two interest rate cuts for next year, a change of thinking from September when the median expectation was four rate cuts.\"",
      "What was the Fed rate decision today?",
      "The Fed cut its federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by 0.25 percentage points, lowered the rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, down from its previous target range of 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That marks the Fed's third consecutive rate cut this year, which kicked off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September, followed by a 0.25 percentage point cut at its November meeting. With today's cut, the Fed has lowered rates by a full percentage point since September.",
      "How will another rate cut impact my money?",
      "Any reduction in the federal funds rate could ease borrowing costs for millions of Americans. But a 0.25 percentage point cut isn't likely to make that much of a difference, with LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz noting that it \"may knock a dollar or two off your monthly debt payment.\"",
      "\"Another rate cut is welcome news at the end of a chaotic year, but it ultimately doesn't amount to much for those with debt,\" Schulz said.",
      "Still, new APR rates on credit cards have declined to 24.43% from 24.92% in September, according to LendingTree data. Loan rates for other products, such as home equity lines of credit, have also declined.",
      "Despite the rate cuts, mortgage rates haven't budged much and continue to hover near 20-year highs, leaving many would-be homebuyers disappointed. While the Fed's benchmark rate influences home borrowing costs, mortgages are also impacted by broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "\"Going forward, mortgage rates will likely continue to fluctuate on a week-to-week basis and it's impossible to say for certain where they'll end up,\" LendingTree's Channel said.",
      "What's going on with inflation and the economy?",
      "Inflation, or the rate at which prices for goods and services change over time, has cooled since it reached a 40-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "The Fed began pushing its benchmark rate higher in 2022 in order to dampen economic demand and tame inflation. But while inflation has eased since its 2022 peak, prices for many products and services remain considerably higher than they were before the pandemic.",
      "And prices are likely to stay high unless there's a period of deflation, which typically only happens during a steep economic downturn, such as a recession.",
      "That has left many Americans feeling financially tapped out, with millions taking their frustrations to the ballot box last month and voting for Trump's economic vision of ending \"the inflation nightmare.\"",
      "How might Trump's economic plans impact the Fed?",
      "While Trump has vowed to tackle rising prices, some of his policies could prove to be inflationary, according to Wall Street economists. For instance, Trump last month unveiled plans to place a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada on his inauguration day,\u00a0January 20.",
      "The president-elect also said he intends to levy an additional 10% fee on all imports from China.",
      "But tariffs are essentially consumption taxes that are most often paid by consumers. In other words, American shoppers could end up paying more for everything from avocados imported from Mexico to TV sets manufactured in China.",
      "Because of the potential for inflation to tick higher in 2025 if Trump enacts widespread tariffs, many economists expect the Fed to slow or pause in its rate decisions next year in a wait-and-see approach.",
      "\"Fed officials might prefer to be cautious in light of uncertainty about the new administration's policies, especially possible tariff increases,\" noted Goldman Sachs economists in a Dec. 15 research report.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve cut rates in 2025?",
      "The Fed expects to continue cutting rates next year, although it is now penciling in two rate cuts, down from the four it had forecast in September.",
      "At his Wednesday press conference, Powell could \"reiterate the familiar metaphor of moving slowly in a dark room full of objects to justify a potential rate cut 'skip' at the January meeting,\" \u00a0EY chief economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "When is the first FOMC meeting of 2025?",

      "As millions prepare to fly for the holidays, the Federal Aviation Administration is warning travelers about a hidden danger in their luggage:\u00a0lithium-ion batteries. Found in everyday devices like laptops, tablets and even electric toothbrushes, these batteries can catch fire if they overheat or are damaged.",
      "Last July, panic erupted on an American Airlines flight from San Francisco to Miami after a laptop battery in a carry-on bag ignited.",
      "\"It was absolute chaos. It truly felt like every man for themselves. And it was terrifying,\" said Shilpa Patel, a passenger on the flight. \"I don't know if we're going to explode. All I know is I need to get out and I need to survive.\"",
      "FAA data shows that\u00a0lithium battery fires on U.S. flights have risen 388% since 2015, now occurring nearly twice a week.",
      "\"Any fire at 30,000 feet is unacceptable,\" said David Wroth of UL Standards & Engagement, a safety research organization.",
      "A survey of more than 800 flight attendants conducted by UL found that 87% are concerned about lithium battery risks on airplanes, and more than a third believe airlines should do more to ensure passenger safety. While the FAA requires airlines to include general safety information in preflight announcements, those warnings often don't address the specific risk of\u00a0battery fires.",
      "\"It's a balance we probably need to do a better job striking with the airlines,\" said Ben Supko, who oversees hazardous materials safety for the FAA. \"Passengers don't fully understand how serious the risk is.\"",
      "Supko said passengers need to monitor devices during a flight and immediately notify the crew if a device becomes warm, discolors, or bulges. Passengers are also warned not to pack lithium batteries\u00a0in checked luggage, as fires in the cargo hold are harder to extinguish.",
      "\"When you don't know what's going to happen, you act erratically,\" said Patel. \"It costs us nothing just to say, 'Hey, the reason why we're so serious about this is because it could be really dangerous. It could catch fire.'\"",
      "The UL survey also found that one in four passengers admits to packing lithium batteries in their checked bags. It is a dangerous practice for one reason in particular: It would be even harder to put out a fire in the plane's cargo hold.",

The airline did not address the question directly but stated that its flight attendants receive thorough and ongoing training to handle emergencies onboard.",

      "\"My bill would simplify and modernize the consumer bankruptcy system to make it easier and less expensive for people to get relief,\" Warren added.",
      "Bankruptcies rising",
      "The measure comes as personal bankruptcies\u00a0compared this year with 2023 levels. More than 400,000 Americans have filed for bankruptcy in 2024, although that figure is far below their pre-pandemic average of about 750,000 personal bankruptcy filings a year.",
      "Warren said her bill would help families \"avoid eviction, keep homes and cars and discharge local government fines.\" It would also create a repayment plan for unsecured debt, including student loans, as well as eliminate a restriction that bars people from shedding private and public student debt in bankruptcy, like other types of consumer loans.",
      "Rep. Nadler, a New York Democrat, and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, are co-leading a House version of the bill, while Rhode Island Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse will cosponsor the measure in the Senate. The bill has been endorsed by a wide range of groups including the AFL-CIO, a labor union, and consumer advocacy groups Public Citizen and National Consumer Law Center.",
      "\"Big corporate debtors continue to reap the rewards of our broken bankruptcy system while everyday Rhode Islanders facing financial hardship struggle to obtain basic relief. I'm pleased to support this bill that makes the consumer bankruptcy system fairer and easier to access for those facing crushing personal debt,\" Whitehouse said in a statement.",

      "No-payment discharge. For low-income filers, this option would wipe out unsecured debt other than child support or debts incurred by fraud.Debt-specific plans.\u00a0This would let individuals resolve debts specific to their financial situation, pausing debt collection efforts\u00a0 paused while filer remains current on loans.",

      "It costs about $1,500 to file Chapter 7, and most attorneys require that their fees be paid upfront. Chapter 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy, where the filer's nonexempt property and assets \u2014 possessions not protected by bankruptcy \u2014 are turned over to a trustee, and debt is discharged in three to six months.",
      "With a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, payments can be spread out, but the overall costs for filers is significantly higher, running an average of $4,500. Only about a third of people who file Chapter 13 make it to the end and have their debts discharged, research shows.",

      "To be eligible, pass holders must be U.S. residents and members of Frontier Miles, the airline's loyalty program, before they purchase the annual membership. If they're not members, they'll automatically be enrolled.",
      "\"The GoWild! Pass is perfect for spontaneous adventurers, budget-savvy travelers and anyone dreaming of limitless journeys,\" Frontier Airlines chief commercial officer Bobby Schroeter said in a statement. \"At $299, this is the lowest price we've ever offered, making it easier than ever to explore amazing destinations across the U.S., Caribbean, Mexico and Latin America. This limited-time pricing will only be offered to those who act fast!\"",
      "Here's how the \"Go Wild!\" pass works",
      "Once you purchase the $299 deal, you can book tickets on select Frontier flights for just a penny.",
      "The airline warns that not every flight operated by Frontier is available for booking through the GoWild! pass. Additionally, pass holders must pay any taxes and fees associated with the airfare.",
      "What kind of seat do you get?",
      "GoWild! pass holders cannot reserve seats in advance, nor do their fares include carry-on or checked baggage, although these extras may be purchased separately.",
      "When can I book flights?",
      "The unlimited pass allows travelers to make reservations the day before a flight's departure for domestic travel, and ten days before an international flight's departure date.",
      "The pass is valid for travel between May 1, 2025, and April 30, 2026, Frontier said.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 12:37:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Social Security's full retirement age reflects the point at which people can claim their full benefits. It's going up in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Most Americans may consider the standard retirement age to be 65, but the so-called \"full retirement age\" for Social Security is already older than that \u2014 and it's about to hit an even higher age in 2025.",
      "Social Security's full retirement age (FRA) refers to when workers can start claiming their full benefits, which is based on the number of years they've worked as well as their income during their working years. The longer someone works and the higher their income, the more they can receive from Social Security when they finally claim their benefits.",
      "While the FRA used to be 65 years old, Congress overhauled the program in 1983 to raise the retirement age threshold in order to account for longer life expectancies.",
      "As part of that revamp, the FRA has been inching higher by two months at a time, based on a person's birth year. For instance, people who were born in 1957 reached their FRA when they turned 66 years and 6 months old, or starting in 2023; but people born in 1958 must turn 66 years and 8 months old to qualify for their full benefits, or starting in September 2024.",
      "The full retirement age is set to\u00a0increase again by two months, to 66 years and 10 months old, for people born in 1959. That means the higher FRA for that cohort will go into effect in 2025, with people born in 1959 starting to qualify for their full benefits in November 2025. (You can calculate when you could get your full benefits on this Social Security Administration page.)",
      "To be sure, there is flexibility about when to claim Social Security benefits. People can claim as soon as they turn 62 years old, but the trade-off is a reduced benefit that's locked in for the rest of their retirement.",
      "For instance, claiming at 62 will result in a benefit that's about 30% less than your full benefit \u2014 a sacrifice that many older Americans opt for, given that many are forced into retirement earlier than they expected\u00a0or because they believe it makes more sense to claim more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower amount.",
      "Each year, Social Security benefits are adjusted to account for inflation so beneficiaries' purchasing power doesn't erode over time. In 2025, the annual\u00a0cost-of-living adjustment\u00a0will be 2.5%, the smallest annual COLA hike since 2021 due to cooling inflation.",
      "For most Social Security beneficiaries, the new COLA goes into effect with their January payment.",
      "Young boomers and Gen Xers",
      "The increase in the FRA for people born in 1959 marks the penultimate age change, with the final jump occurring for workers born in or after 1960. Those Americans won't be able to claim their FRA until they hit 67 years old, which means that someone born in January 1960 must hold off until January 2027 to get their full retirement benefits.",
      "That will mostly impact the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers, with the latter generation spanning 1965 to 1980.",
      "These workers, however, are among the least prepared for retirement, according to recent research. The youngest boomers \u2014 those born between 1959 and 1965 \u2014 started to hit 65 this year, but many of them lack adequate savings to support themselves in old age, the ALI Retirement Income Institute found earlier this year.",
      "About 1 in 3 of these younger boomers will rely on Social Security benefits for at least 90% of their retirement income when they are 70, the study found. But Social Security benefits are designed to replace about 40% of a person's working income.",
      "Gen X, meanwhile, is also shaping up to hit retirement without enough saved for their golden years. The average retirement savings of Gen X households is about $150,000 \u2014 far below the roughly\u00a0$1.5 million\u00a0that Americans say they need to retire comfortably. Another study found that about 40% of Gen Xers don't have a penny saved for retirement.",
      "Meanwhile, older Americans can also maximize their Social Security benefits by delaying claiming until they turn 70 years old. At that point, one's benefits are boosted about 25% higher than their full benefits. But only about 4% of Americans wait until they're 70 to claim the maximum Social Security benefit, according to a recent study from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.",

      "Ever booked a hotel room for $200 only to be surprised by an extra $40 \"resort fee\" at checkout? A new Federal Trade Commission rule aims to put a stop to such surprise charges by banning so-called junk fees on short-term lodging as well as on tickets to live events.",
      "The rule bans businesses from using such tactics to disguise prices and mislead customers who rent short-term lodging, such as hotels and vacation homes, along with consumers who buy tickets to concerts, sports and other live events, the FTC announced Tuesday.",
      "\"People deserve to know upfront what they're being asked to pay \u2014 without worrying that they'll later be saddled with mysterious fees that they haven't budgeted for and can't avoid,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement. \"The FTC's rule will put an end to junk fees around live event tickets, hotels and vacation rentals, saving Americans billions of dollars and millions of hours in wasted time.\"",
      "Under the new rule, total prices for short-term lodging and event tickets must be presented to consumers in a \"timely, transparent and truthful\" manner, the FTC said. That's meant to ensure people are longer surprised by extra charges including \"resort,\" \"convenience\" or \"service\" fees that inflate prices. It's also designed to make comparing costs easier, according to the agency.",
      "Hotels commonly tack on resort fees to cover costs like cleaning or the use of amenities such as fitness or aquatic centers. But the FTC said such fees are deceptive, estimating that the new rule will save consumers both time and billions of dollars.",
      "To be sure, businesses may still charge additional fees for service, but they must disclose such charges to consumers up-front, rather than burying them in fine print, and \"clearly and conspicuously\" advertise a hotel room or live event ticket's total price including all fees, versus simply displaying a base rate or price, the FTC explained. The total cost also must be displayed more prominently than any other pricing information, the rule stipulates.",
      "Longstanding consumer protection laws prohibit business in other industries from deceiving consumers about fees and pricing.",
      "President Biden weighed in on the FTC's action banning hidden junk fees Tuesday, saying he's prioritized lowering costs for American families.",

Those fees add up, taking real money out of the pockets of Americans,\" he said in a statement. \"Today's announcement builds on work across my administration to ban junk fees and lower costs \u2014 saving many families hundreds of dollars each year.\"",
      "The Department of Transportation also has proposed a ban on family-seating fees, and required that airlines disclose baggage and change fees upfront.",

    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump pledged expedited approvals for any company that invests at least $1 billion in the U.S. SoftBank's investment will focus on AI and emerging technology.",
    "story": [
      "Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S. and create 100,000 jobs in artificial intelligence and technology, President-elect Donald Trump announced Monday at Mar-a-Lago alongside SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son.",
      "\"Today, I am thrilled to announce that SoftBank will be investing $100 billion America, creating 100,000 American jobs at a minimum,\" Trump said, adding that Son was announcing the investment \"because he feels very optimistic about our country since the election.\"",
      "The investment \"will help insure that artificial intelligence, emerging technologies and other industries of tomorrow are built, created right here in the U.S.A.,\" Trump said.",
      "\"I\"m very, very excited,\" Son said. \"I would really like to celebrate the great victory of President Trump. And my confidence level to the economy of the United States has tremendously increased with his victory.\"",
      "During their announcement, Trump asked Son to double the investment.",
      "\"I'm going to ask him right now, will you make it $200 billion, believe it or not, he can actually afford to do that,\" Trump said. Son responded, \"With your leadership and my parternship and your support, I will try to make it happen.\"",
      "After Trump's 2016 victory, the two announced his firm would invest $50 billion in the U.S. Tokyo-based SoftBank is an investment company that focuses on financial, tech and energy companies.",
      "Trump has touted other investments from major foreign companies that didn't pan out during his presidency. In 2017, he\u00a0announced\u00a0that Taiwanese electronics maker Foxconn \u2014 known for manufacturing Apple's iPhone and iPod devices \u2014 would build a $10 billion campus in Wisconsin in exchange for billions in tax incentives. The venture was forecast to employ more than 10,000 people, bringing high-paying tech jobs to the Midwestern state.",
      "Trump heralded the major tech partnership as \"transformational\" and the \"eighth wonder of the world.\" But seven years later, that vision has \u2014 so far \u2014 failed to flourish. Foxconn did build a small plant on the site, but far smaller than the one Trump and Foxconn initially announced.",
      "In 2019, the campus was scaled back to a \"research hub\" that employed far fewer people than initially promised. The effort instead ended up employing about 1,000 workers,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Wisconsin, for its part,\u00a0said\u00a0in 2020 it would scale back its promise of billions in tax credits, given that Foxconn had failed to deliver on its original plan.",
      "Meanwhile, another major tech company \u2014 Microsoft \u2014 stepped in to fill some of the gap left by Foxconn. In 2024, Microsoft\u00a0said\u00a0it would build a $3.3 billion data center on on 315 acres adjacent to where Foxconn had planned to construct its campus. Microsoft expects its first building on its new Wisconsin site to be completed in 2026,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.",
      "Trump made the SoftBank announcement Monday in a statement to the press that turned into extended remarks about his economic plans. Trump pledged to make more tax cuts, even beyond the ones he and Congress enacted in 2017. Trump said any company that invests at least $1 billion in the U.S. will be eligible for fully expedited permit approvals, including environmental approvals, Trump said.",
      "\"This will be the most exciting and successful period of reform and renewal in all of American history, maybe of global history, the golden age of America, I call it, it's begun,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump expressed hope there wouldn't be \"intervening\" issues in his second term, mentioning the COVID-19 pandemic that ravaged the economy in his first term.",

      "President Biden earlier this year signed into law a bill passed by Congress requiring TikTok and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, face a Jan. 19 deadline to cut ties or be banned in the U.S. The companies have tried to delay the deadline pending a Supreme Court review, but a federal appeals court, which upheld the law, denied the request last week.

    "summary": "E-commerce giant executives allegedly rejected safety recommendations urging production quotas be curtailed.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon knew of the link between increased worker injuries and the company's production quotas, but its executives allegedly rejected safety recommendations to loosen its mandates, an investigation by lawmakers found.",
      "The findings are based on Internal Amazon documents compiled by the Senate Committee on Health Education, Labor and Pensions, which is chaired by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.",
      "\"The shockingly dangerous working conditions at Amazon's warehouses revealed in this 160-page report are beyond unacceptable,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"Amazon's executives repeatedly chose to put profits ahead of the health and safety of its workers by ignoring recommendations that would substantially reduce injuries.\"",
      "Amazon disputes the findings and accused Sanders of misrepresenting the company's safety record.",
      "The \"report is wrong on the facts and weaves together out-of-date-documents and unverifiable anecdotes to create a preconceived narrative,\" a company spokesperson said.",
      "According to the Senate panel, Amazon in 2021 began studying the impact of repetitive motions on warehouse workers, including how many products they could pick from robotic shelving units. The internal research found that employees who were trying to keep pace with company production quotas usually exceeded the limit beyond which injury rates increased, the report found.",
      "That same study also advised using software to monitor the rate at which workers were picking products and to institute additional breaks to ensure employees were not overdoing the repeated motions. But that recommendation and others aimed at improving workplace safety at Amazon were rejected by senior executives concerned about the \"customer experience,\" the Senate committee said.",
      "A separate investigation by CBS News found that Amazon trucking contractors have higher\u00a0rates of safety violations. Questions about the e-commerce company's practices for moving packages between facilities surfaced after the January death of a 19-year-old Texas college student who was killed in a crash with an Amazon contract driver.",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal safety data found that Amazon contractors in the company's delivery network had monthly violation rates \u2014 such as speeding and texting while driving \u2014 that were usually double those of carriers who didn't transport for Amazon.",
      "In the past two years, at least 57 people have died in more than four dozen crashes involving federally regulated carriers shipping for Amazon, according to data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), though the data does not indicate who was at fault in these incidents.",
      "Amazon disputes those findings. Tim Goodman, Amazon's global legal director for road safety, told CBS News that although the company requires background checks for contracted drivers who deliver directly to customers' homes, said Amazon relies on the FMCSA to oversee so-called middle-mile contractors who move freight between facilities in larger vehicles.",

      "According to a source at Google, the company donated $285,000 to Biden's inaugural fund four years ago. Google has not announced plans, so far, to donate to Trump's. The Information, a tech news site, and The Wall Street Journal reported that Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, had plans to meet with Trump.",

      "But Trump has dialed back his public hostility toward the company, and Bezos \u2014 who previously said Trump's treatment of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and refusal to accept the election results in 2020 \"erodes our democracy around the edges\" \u2014 has softened, too.",

Musk reinstated Trump's X account in November 2022 after taking over the company, although Trump has largely posted to his own social media platform, Truth Social. Facebook and Instagram restored Trump's accounts\u00a0in early 2023.",

      "For Trump's 2017 inauguration, which raised an eye-popping $107 million, his biggest donors were largely affiliated with sports teams, casinos, venture capital firms and banks. His most generous donor, at $5 million, was the late Las Vegas Sands founder Sheldon Adelson, who died in 2021. But, other than GoDaddy.com founder Bob Parsons, the leaders of big-name tech companies weren't giving $1 million to Trump the first time around.",
      "Trump's inaugural committee, officially known as the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, Inc., is a nonprofit 501(c)(4) entity that's responsible for planning inaugural events, and can accept limitless donations. Trump allies former Sen. Kelly Loeffler and investor Steve Witkoff are the committee's co-chairs. When he announced his inaugural committee and co-chairs, Trump said the committee will \"honor\" the \"magnificent victory\" he and his team had to kick off his administration.",
      "Inaugural committees add the pomp and circumstance to an inauguration, but not at taxpayers' expense. They also offer a way for donors to curry favor with an incoming administration. Donors who give $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee can expect not only tickets but face-time with the incoming president and vice president, as well as Cabinet officials.",
      "A president-elect's inaugural committee is different from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, established by Congress, which is underwritten by taxpayers. The congressional committee, composed of members of both parties, plans and carries out the swearing-in ceremony, as well as an inaugural luncheon for the president and vice president at the Capitol.",

      "The latest version of American firm Cushman & Wakefield's annual global index, which ranks shopping areas based on the rent prices they command, is a sign of Via MonteNapoleone's desirability as an address for luxury ready-to-wear, jewelry and even pastry brands.",
      "The average rent on the Milan street has surged to 20,000 euros per square meter ($2,047 per square foot), compared with 19,537 euros per square meter ($2,000 per square foot) on an 11-block stretch of upper Fifth Avenue.",
      "Via MonteNapoleone's small size - it's less than one-quarter mile long - and walking distance to services and top cultural sites are among the street's key advantages, according to Guglielmo Miani, president of the MonteNapoleone District association.",
      "\"Not everything can fit, which is a benefit'' since the limited space makes the street even more exclusive and dynamic, said Miani, whose group also represents businesses on the intersecting side streets that together with Via MonteNapoleone form an area known as Milan's Fashion Quadrilateral.",
      "The biggest brands on the street make 50 million euros ($52.4 million) to 100 million euros in annual sales, Miani said, which goes a long way to paying the rent. Tiffany & Co. is preparing to take up residence on Via Montenapoleone, and long-time tenant Fendi is expanding.",
      "The MonteNapoleone District says 11 million people visited the area this year through November, but there's no way to say how many were big spenders vs. window shoppers. The average shopper on Via MonteNapoleone spent 2,500 euros ($2,624) per purchase between August and November - the highest average receipt in the world, according to the tax-free shopping firm Global Blue.",
      "The street is a magnet for holiday shoppers who arrive in Maseratis, Porsches and even Ferraris, the sports car's limited trunk space notwithstanding. Lights twinkle overhead, boutique windows feature mannequins engaged in warm scenes of holiday fun, and passersby snap photos of expertly decorated cakes in pastry shop displays.",
      "A visitor from China, Chen Xinghan, waited for a taxi with a half-dozen shopping bags lined up next to him on the sidewalk. He said he paid half the price for a luxury Fendi coat that he purchased in Milan than he would have at home.",
      "\"I got a lot,'' Chen acknowledged. \"It's a fantastic place, a good place for shopping.\"",
      "A few store windows down, Franca Da Rold, who was visiting Milan from Belluno, an Italian city in the Dolomites mountain range, marveled at a chunky, meters-long knit scarf priced at 980 euros ($1,028).",
      "\"I could knit that in one hour, using 12-gauge knitting needles as thick as my fingers, and thick wool. Maximum two hours,'' Da Rold said, but acknowledged the brand appeal.",
      "Despite upper Fifth Avenue getting bumped to the No. 2 spot on the Cushman & Wakefield list, the organization that serves as the Manhattan street's guardian and chief promoter had praise for MonteNapoleone's achievement.",
      "\"Milan's investment in its public realm is paying off, which is a win for their shoppers, businesses and city as a whole,'' said Madelyn Wils, the interim president of the Fifth Avenue Association.",
      "But she also expressed confidence that with new investments and a record year for sales on Fifth Avenue, \"we'll be back on top in no time.\""

      "This year's crop of newly public artistic creations lacks the landmark vibes of last year's entrance of into the public domain of Mickey Mouse. But they include a deep well of canonical works whose 95-year copyright maximums will expire. And the Disney icon's public domain presence expands.",
      "\"It's a trove! There are a dozen new Mickey cartoons - he speaks for the first time and dons the familiar white gloves,\" said Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke's Center for the Study of the Public Domain. \"There are masterpieces from Faulkner and Hemingway, the first sound films from Alfred Hitchcock, Cecil B. DeMille, and John Ford, and amazing music from Fats Waller, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin. Pretty exciting!\"",
      "A closer look at this year's crop",
      "Popeye the Sailor, with his bulging forearms, mealy-mouthed speech, and propensity for fistfights, was created by E.C. Segar and made his first appearance in the newspaper strip \"Thimble Theater\" in 1929, speaking his first words, \"'Ja think I'm a cowboy?\" when asked if he was a sailor. What was supposed to be a one-off appearance became permanent, and the strip would be renamed \"Popeye.\"",
      "But as with Mickey Mouse last year and Winnie the Pooh in 2022, only the earliest version is free for reuse. The spinach that gave the sailor his super-strength wasn't there from the start and is the kind of character element that could spawn legal disputes. And the animated shorts featuring his distinctive mumbly voice didn't begin until 1933 and remain under copyright. As does director Robert Altman's 1980 film starring Robin Williams as Popeye and Shelley Duvall as his oft-fought-over sweetheart Olive Oyl.",
      "That movie was tepidly received initially. So was director Steven Spielberg's \"Adventures of Tintin\" in 2011. But the comics about the boy reporter that inspired it, the creation of Belgian artist Herg\u00e9, were among the most popular in Europe for much of the 20th century.",
      "The simply drawn teen with dots for eyes and bangs like an ocean wave first appeared in a supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and became a weekly feature.",
      "The comic also first appeared in the U.S. in 1929. Its signature bright colors - including Tintin's red hair - didn't appear until years later, and could, like Popeye's spinach, be the subject of legal disputes.",
      "And in much of the world, Tintin won't become public property until 70 years after the 1983 death of his creator.",
      "The books becoming public this year read like the syllabus for an American literature seminar.",
      "\"The Sound and the Fury,\" arguably William Faulkner's quintessential novel with its modernist stream-of-consciousness style, was a sensation after its publication despite being famously difficult for readers. It uses multiple non-linear narratives to tell the story of a prominent family's ruin in the author's native Mississippi, and would help lead to Faulkner's Nobel Prize.",
      "And Ernest Hemingway's \"A Farewell to Arms\" joins his earlier \"The Sun Also Rises\" in the public domain. The partly autobiographical story of an ambulance driver in Italy during the First World War cemented Hemingway's status in the American literary canon. It has been frequently adapted for film, TV and radio, which can now be done without permission.",
      "John Steinbeck's first novel, \"A Cup of Gold,\" from 1929, will also enter the public domain.",
      "The British novelist Virginia Woolf's \"A Room of One's Own,\" an extended essay that would become a landmark in feminism from the modernist literary luminary, is also on the list. Her novel \"Mrs. Dalloway\" is already in the U.S. public domain.",
      "While a host of truly major movies will become public in the coming decade, for now early works by major figures from the not-always-stellar early sound era will have to suffice.",
      "A decade before he would move to Hollywood and make films like \"Psycho,\" and \"Vertigo,\" Alfred Hitchcock made \"Blackmail\" in Britain. The film was begun as a silent but shifted to sound during production, resulting in two different versions, one of them the U.K.'s - and Hitchcock's - first sound film.",
      "John Ford, whose later Westerns would put him among film's most vaunted directors, also made his first foray into sound with 1929's \"The Black Watch,\" an adventure epic that includes Ford's future chief collaborator John Wayne as a young extra.",
      "Cecil B. DeMille, already a Hollywood bigwig through silents, made his first talkie with the melodrama \"Dynamite.\"",
      "Groucho, Harpo and the other Marx Brothers had their first starring movie roles in 1929's \"The Cocoanuts,\" a forerunner to future classics like \"Animal Crackers\" and \"Duck Soup.\"",
      "\"The Broadway Melody,\" the first sound film and the second film ever to win the Oscar for best picture - known as \"outstanding production\" at the time - will also become public, though it's often ranked among the worst of best picture winners.",
      "And after \"Steamboat Willie\" made the earliest Mickey Mouse public, a dozen more of his animations will get the same status, including \"The Karnival Kid,\" where he spoke for the first time.",
      "Songs from the last year of the Roaring Twenties are also about to become public property.",
      "Cole Porter's compositions \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" and \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" are among the highlights, as is the jazz classic \"Ain't Misbehavin', written by Fats Waller and Harry Brooks.",
      "\"Singin' in the Rain,\" which would later forever be associated with the 1952 Gene Kelly film, made its debut in the 1929 movie \"The Hollywood Revue\" and will now be public domain.",
      "Different laws regulate sound recordings, and those newly in the public domain date to 1924. They include a recording of \"Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\" from future star and civil rights icon Marian Anderson, and \"Rhapsody in Blue\" performed by its composer, George Gershwin."

      "In the final days of his administration, President Biden has set a new climate goal for slashing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. However, it comes as his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, has signaled he is not interested in global climate negotiations.",
      "The U.S. formally submitted its new goal Thursday to the United Nations. It calls for a 61% to 66% reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 compared to 2005 levels, the White House said, with an overarching goal of achieving net zero emissions by no later than 2050.",

The only binding requirement is that nations accurately report on their efforts. First signed in 2016 by nearly 200 nations, it seeks to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.",
      "The new climate commitment \"marks an ambitious capstone to President Biden's climate legacy,\" the White House said in a news release, adding that it will help grow a new clean energy economy focused on investment, innovation, and jobs.",
      "\"The United States' new climate commitment offers a clear path forward for states, cities, businesses, and other leaders dedicated to ramping up action over the next four years,\" said Debbie Weyl, U.S. acting director for the nonprofit environmental group the World Resource Institute, in a statement. \"Even though the Trump administration may not lift a finger to deliver on this plan, it sets a north star for what the U.S. should be aiming for and could help guide the federal government's priorities once Trump leaves office in 2029,\" Weyl said.",
      "In 2017, then-President Trump announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, a process which took until nearly the end of his first term to complete.

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 05:00:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Democrats elect a new party chair on Feb. 1, following the loss of the presidency and the Senate and the narrow failure to win the House in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Martin O'Malley has the kind of experience that would typically benefit a Democrat who wants to guide the party's future after devastating losses in the last election.",
      "He's a former governor, former mayor and a 2016 presidential candidate who until recently was serving in President Joe Biden's administration. Yet O'Malley is facing a difficult path in the race to try and become the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee as the party reckons with the reality that key pockets of voters turned against it.",
      "Vital to O'Malley's attempt is a campaign platform, first reported by CBS News, that calls for reconnecting the Democratic Party \"to the kitchen table of every American family.\"",
      "\"We suffered a very bad loss,\" O'Malley said in an interview, urging Democrats \"to learn from it in order to win the next battles ahead.\"",
      "His vision is centered on a 57-state and territory strategy along with plans to give campaigns \"world-class AI tools for voter outreach, research, communications, and financial management, eliminating barriers to effective campaigning.\" O'Malley's pitch is also focused on \"re-investing in direct voter registration,\" as part of his pledge for the party to make \"voter protection and registration the pillars of the change we need to win.\"",
      "Democrats weathered a chaotic election cycle in 2024, punctuated by the push within the party to convince President Biden to end his reelection run after a dismal debate performance in June. While Mr. Biden eventually ended his bid in July and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place at the top of the ticket, the 107-day sprint that followed resulted in Democrats losing the White House and Senate while failing, albeit narrowly, to win control of the House.",
      "Now the party is essentially leaderless and preparing for an emboldened Donald Trump to return to Washington, where he'll be able to benefit from Republicans' unified control of Congress and the White House. Those dynamics will be well in play at the time of the election for DNC chair on Feb. 1 given the unease among Democrats that has been abundantly clear in the weeks following the presidential election.",
      "\"I want to see someone who doesn't come from the Washington circuit, who actually has been out there in the tissue of the country,\" Ohio Rep. Marcy Kaptur, a battleground district Democrat, said of the DNC chair race.",
      "Failure can mean opportunity. The party's struggles means O'Malley, as well as other ambitious Democrats, have a chance to become the next chair and carry wide ranging influence during a critical time for the party as it looks to regain ground in the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election. For all his apparent vulnerabilities, Trump was far more successful in this election than ever before, winning all seven presidential battlegrounds. Whether what happened in 2024 will become a tangible turning point for Democrats is likely to loom over the chair race in the coming weeks.",
      "\"That's the big shift that's happened with this election going the wrong way on us,\" O'Malley said. \"We're now in a mode of needing a changemaker, not a caretaker.\"",
      "Among those running for chair, Ken Martin, the leader of Minnesota's arm of the Democratic Party and a DNC vice chair, as well as Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, are seen as frontrunners. Martin has deep relationships within the DNC and can boast a statewide winning streak for candidates in Minnesota, while Wikler carries the political gravitas of helping lead the party in one of the nation's seven presidential battlegrounds.",
      "Earlier this month, Martin announced a framework which includes his drive for a \"Democratic infrastructure in all 3,244 counties,\" across the country, as well as taking on the branding problem evident from the 2024 election results.",
      "\"The majority of Americans now believe the Republican Party best represents the interests of the working class and the poor, and the Democratic Party is the party of the wealthy and the elites,\" Martin said in his framework. \"It's a damning indictment on our party brand. We must be willing to dig deep and recenter the Democratic agenda to unite families across race, age, background, and class.\"",
      "During a brief pitch to party leaders at a meeting in Washington D.C. last week where Martin and O'Malley also spoke, Wikler told his fellow Democrats \"we need to build the battle plan to change how we communicate, so we show what we mean when we say we fight for working folks.\"",
      "This isn't the first time O'Malley has been linked to leading the party. Days after the 2016 election, he posted on social media that despite encouragement, he would not run for chair. Eight years later, he's navigating a short window to make his case as he emphasizes his lengthy career in politics.",
      "O'Malley served as mayor of Baltimore from 1999 to 2007 and went on to win two terms as governor of Maryland, which included a stint leading the Democratic Governors Association. His political power has faded since then however, illustrated most notably by the struggles he faced during his campaign for president in the 2016 Democratic primary. Before announcing his run for chair, O'Malley spent nearly a year working in the federal government as commissioner of Social Security.",
      "That experience is intertwined in O'Malley's platform, which also calls for creating \"a feedback loop for our local and state elected officials to ensure that they can help inform our messaging and tactics.\"",
      "\"We all know we need to restore our credibility,\" O'Malley said. \"We need to learn from our failings, as well as our candidates who succeeded. But only one of us [in the race for DNC chair] has actually proven an ability to effectuate a rapid turnaround like we need to do right now in order to win the next election.\"",

    "summary": "House Speaker Mike Johnson is facing a revolt from fellow Republicans over a last-minute measure to keep the government funded and avoid a shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson scrapped a last-minute measure to avoid a government shutdown after facing opposition from fellow Republicans \u2014 including President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 who objected to billions of dollars in spending that had been added to the bill.",
      "Lawmakers are facing a Friday deadline to approve new spending. The measure released Tuesday would have extended funding through March 14, but it also included disaster aid, health care policy extenders and a pay raise for members of Congress, among other provisions. The disaster relief portion of the bill alone carried a price tag of $110 billion.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, confirmed that the\u00a0stopgap funding measure\u00a0is dead and that the path forward is unclear.",
      "\"There's no new agreement right now,\" Scalise said.",
      "In a statement on Wednesday, Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance criticized Johnson's approach and said Republicans should pass \"a streamlined spending bill that doesn't give Chuck Schumer and the Democrats everything they want.\" They also called for House Republicans to increase the debt ceiling, which limits how much the government can borrow to pay its bills.",
      "\"Republicans want to support our farmers, pay for disaster relief, and set our country up for success in 2025. The only way to do that is with a temporary funding bill WITHOUT DEMOCRAT GIVEAWAYS combined with an increase in the debt ceiling,\" they said. \"Anything else is a betrayal of our country.\"",
      "The debt ceiling has not been a part of these negotiations, and Republicans typically oppose increasing it. Trump's decision to inject the issue into shutdown talks adds a new dimension to the legislative fight with just two days to go before funding lapses.",
      "\"Increasing the debt ceiling is not great but we'd rather do it on Biden's watch,\" Trump and Vance wrote. \"If Democrats won't cooperate on the debt ceiling now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration? Let's have this debate now.\" Under legislation passed in June 2023, the debt ceiling was suspended until the first quarter of 2025.",
      "At the U.S. Capitol, Vance did not answer when asked if he and Trump supported a shutdown.",
      "The Office of Management and Budget told federal agencies to start communicating with employees about shutdown procedures starting at 10am tomorrow, sources familiar told CBS News late Wednesday.",
      "Last Friday, the agencies were told to have their shutdown preparations in order and ready to go.",
      "The continuing resolution",
      "When it was unveiled on Tuesday, the spending legislation immediately sparked anger from multiple members of the House Republican conference, mostly targeted at Johnson. While the speaker had pledged to avoid the kind of massive, end-of-year spending bills that conservatives loathe, the final product resembled a scaled-down version of what the party's right flank has railed against for years now.",
      "But the Republicans' slim majority in the House means Johnson would have needed Democratic votes to pass the bill, a dynamic that gave the minority more leverage to extract concessions during negotiations. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hinted at Democrats' influence amid reports that Johnson could scale back the bill, writing in a post on X: \"You break the bipartisan agreement, you own the consequences that follow.\"",
      "\"Republicans have now unilaterally decided to break a bipartisan agreement that they made,\" Jeffries, a New York Democrat, told reporters Wednesday night. \"House Republicans will now own any harm that is visited upon the American people that results from a government shutdown or worse. An agreement is an agreement. It was bipartisan. And there is nothing more to say.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also called on Republicans to \"keep their word.\"",
      "\"Republicans need to stop playing politics with this bipartisan agreement or they will hurt hardworking Americans and create instability across the country,\" she said in statement.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, acknowledged that the bill was intended to be \"very skinny\" before a \"couple of intervening things\" occurred, citing the devastation left by hurricanes earlier this year.",
      "Before the text of the bill was released, Johnson dismissed Republican concerns that the continuing resolution was equivalent to an \"omnibus\" bill, a term used when Congress packages the annual appropriations bills that fund many federal government agencies into one large piece of legislation.",
      "\"This is not an omnibus, OK?\" Johnson said at his weekly news conference on Tuesday. \"This is a small [continuing resolution] that we had to add things to that were out of our control. These are not man-made disasters. These are things that the federal government has an appropriate role to do.\"",
      "Johnson had also vowed to give members 72 hours to read the bill before a vote, but lawmakers said they were expecting a vote as soon as Wednesday, which would give them less than 24 hours to get through the nearly 1,550-page text. The path forward was cast into doubt by Trump's statement, with speculation growing that Johnson could scrap the current version of the bill and bring up a narrower funding extension that includes disaster relief.",
      "Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, on Tuesday called the process \"a total dumpster fire.\" He said he was \"disappointed\" in Johnson and called on him to \"communicate better.\" Other members, like Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, have dubbed the bill the \"Cramnibus.\" Rep. Kat Cammack, a Florida Republican, said the measure was \"a band-aid that is laced with fentanyl.\"",
      "\"There's a certain sandwich that's made of feces, and that's what I would compare this to,\" said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, also of Florida. She argued that pairing disaster relief with the measure puts members in a tough spot. \"This is a s**t sandwich. I don't know how else to say that we're being forced into this position.\"",
      "The fight could prompt a challenge to Johnson's speakership when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, said Wednesday that he won't support Johnson in the speaker's election.",
      "\"I'm not voting for him,\" Massie said. \"This solidifies it.\"",
      "Massie said he's spoken with other members who have a similar stance.",
      "Johnson ran into a buzzsaw of opposition outside the House as well. Elon Musk, the co-head of Trump's advisory Department of Government Efficiency, said in a post on X that any lawmaker \"who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years.\" Musk posted dozens of times throughout the day calling for lawmakers to oppose the bill, which he called \"criminal.\"",
      "The speaker told Fox News earlier in the day that he had discussed the situation with Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the other DOGE co-head, on Tuesday evening. Johnson said he emphasized to them that passing a continuing resolution now would be \"clearing the decks\" and allow the incoming GOP majorities to \"put our fingerprints on the spending\" in March.",
      "Both Musk and Ramaswamy came out strongly against the bill anyway.",
      "The stopgap measure would expire about two months into Trump's second term, setting up another budget fight as Republicans try to pass Trump's top priorities during his first 100 days. Though they'll have control of both chambers of Congress, House Republicans will be operating with a thinner majority until vacant seats held by members joining the Trump administration are filled.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will take up a challenge to a new law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S, setting up a showdown over access to a widely popular app used by tens of millions of Americans.",
      "Arguments will be heard by the high court on Jan. 10, an expedited timeline that allows for the court to consider the issue before the law takes effect on Jan. 19.",
      "The Supreme Court said in a brief order that the Justice Department and lawyers for TikTok, as well as a group of users who separately challenged the law, should be prepared to argue whether the ban passed by Congress violates the First Amendment.",
      "TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance,\u00a0asked the high court earlier this week to temporarily block enforcement of the law while it appealed a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Supreme Court said in its order that consideration of that request for emergency relief is deferred pending oral argument.",
      "The TikTok ban",
      "\"Congress's unprecedented attempt to single out applicants and bar them from operating one of the most significant speech platforms in this Nation presents grave constitutional problems that this Court likely will not allow to stand,\" lawyers for TikTok wrote in their request to the Supreme Court.",
      "TikTok suffered a blow on Dec. 6 when a panel of three judges from the D.C. Circuit denied its bid to overturn the law. A week later, the appeals court denied TikTok's request to delay the law from taking effect pending a Supreme Court review.",
      "The law, which Congress passed in April as part of a foreign assistance package, gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with ByteDance, its Chinese parent company, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, and it is set to take effect on Jan. 19, with the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok during his first term in office, but reversed his position during the presidential campaign and vowed to \"save\" the app. He told reporters during a press conference Monday that the platform played a role in helping him win the youth vote in the November election and said he would \"take a look at TikTok.\"",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump\u00a0met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew\u00a0at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "With arguments before the Supreme Court set for Jan. 10, it will be the Biden administration that will present the government's case. TikTok is represented before the high court by Noel Francisco, who served as solicitor general during Trump's first term.",
      "Still, TikTok is hoping either the Supreme Court or Trump will save it.",
      "In its Dec. 6 ruling, the appeals court determined that the U.S. government's concerns about the Chinese government's collection of Americans' data and the ability for it to covertly manipulate content on the platform constitute a \"compelling national security interest.\" The court called the government's concerns \"well founded,\" pushing back on TikTok's arguments that the risks were speculative.",
      "The appeals court said that it recognized its decision will have \"significant implications\" for TikTok and its users.",
      "\"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote for the court. \"That burden is attributable to the [People's Republic of China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\"",
      "When it challenged the law in May, TikTok asserted that it never had a choice between divestment or a ban because a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\" The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. The petition said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",

    "summary": "The 1,500-page measure would have done much more than prevent a government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congressional leaders unveiled a stopgap measure late Tuesday to keep the government funded for three months. It survived less than 24 hours after it faced growing Republican opposition, including from President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The 1,500 page measure, known as a continuing resolution, would have done more than keep the government funded at current levels to prevent a government shutdown. The bill was laden with dozens of add-ons making it resemble the massive end-of-year spending packages that GOP leaders have vowed to avoid.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said ahead of the measure's release on Tuesday that it was originally intended to be \"a very simple, very clean\" stopgap funding measure to get the party into the new year. He is now left to deal with growing discontent among members of his own party as a Friday deadline looms.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, confirmed Wednesday evening that the measure is dead and that the path forward is unclear.",
      "\"There's no new agreement right now,\" Scalise said.",
      "Here is a look at\u00a0some of the bill's major add-ons:",
      "Disaster funding",
      "The legislation included $110.4 billion in disaster aid: $29 billion for FEMA's disaster relief fund; $8 billion for federal highways and roads; $12 billion for the Community Development Block grants and disaster relief; and $3.25 billion for Tribal Assistance grants. It also replenishes the Small Business Administration's disaster loan program with $2.2 billion. The program was exhausted in the aftermath of Hurricanes Milton and Helene earlier this year.",
      "The measure also included $21 billion in disaster relief for farmers and $10 billion in economic assistance for farmers, along with a one-year extension of the farm bill.",
      "RFK stadium transfer",
      "The legislation would clear the way for a long-sought priority in Washington, D.C.: transferring administrative jurisdiction over the RFK Memorial Stadium Campus to the district, which will allow the city to negotiate the return of the Washington Commanders football team.",
      "The Commanders currently play in Landover, Maryland, and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has vowed to bring the team back to the District.",
      "Baltimore bridge rebuilding",
      "The measure also included a commitment from the federal government to pay the entire cost of rebuilding Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed in March.",
      "Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin of Maryland said in a joint statement Tuesday that the provision \"will allow the bridge to be built as quickly as possible.\" And they noted that federal taxpayers will be reimbursed by insurance payments and through the results of litigation against the company that operated the cargo ship that crashed into the bridge.",
      "Pay raise for members of Congress",
      "After more than a decade of blocking pay raises in Congress amid concern over the issue becoming a political liability, the continuing resolution included a provision that allows an automatic cost of living increase to go into effect for lawmakers.",
      "Since 2009, lawmakers have earned $174,000 annually, with higher salaries for some members of leadership.",
      "Health care policy extenders and reforms",
      "Within the legislation is a health care package that spans hundreds of pages. It takes on a number of priorities for lawmakers, from extending telehealth flexibility under Medicare to a five-year reauthorization of legislation aimed at combatting the opioid crisis and a measure to prevent pandemics. The legislation also would require pharmacy benefit managers to provide detailed data on drug spending and pass on the full amount of rebates to lower drug costs for American consumers.",
      "Transparency in ticket and hotel prices",
      "The funding measure also included provisions aimed at making hotel and live-event ticket prices more transparent by prohibiting deceptive advertising. The legislation would require that ticket sellers and hotels must disclose the full price, while the ticket sellers must guarantee refunds in the event of cancellation or postponement.",
      "Addressing drone threats",
      "Another provision in the bill would\u00a0counter threats from drones following a slew of mysterious drone sightings on the East Coast that have prompted concern. The legislation would extend a portion of the Homeland Security Act that authorizes officials to track unmanned aircrafts and disrupt their control.",

    "story": [
      "Legislation to expand Social Security benefits to millions of Americans cleared a key procedural hurdle in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday afternoon and is now headed toward a final vote, with the clock ticking and only days left in the current session of Congress.",
      "Senators voted 73-27 to approve a motion to proceed with consideration of the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, according to an unofficial Senate tally shown in a\u00a0webcast\u00a0on the floor of the chamber.",
      "\"We will vote on taking up the Social Security Fairness Act to repeal flawed policies that eat away at the benefits of those who've worked as teachers, firefighters, postal workers, or public sector workers,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on social media shortly before the vote. \"Retirees deprived of their hard-earned benefits will be watching closely.\"",
      "The New York Democrat has pushed to bring the measure up for a full vote, which would eliminate two federal policies that prevent million of Americans, including police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension from collecting their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Social Security is a bedrock of our middle class. You pay into it for 40 quarters, you earned it, it should be there when you retire,\" Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who lost his seat in the November election, told the chamber ahead of Wednesday's vote. \"All these workers are asking for is for what they earned.\"",
      "Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican relayed having a retired teacher cry in his office, \"not understanding why she was getting less in Social Security spousal benefits than if she had never worked at all.\"",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis spoke against measure, saying that while a small percentage of people are not getting what they should from Social Security, enacting what he framed as an unfunded government mandate that would increase the federal deficit \"is not the way to fix it.\"",
      "\"This bill will take $200 billion during the 10-year period out of the Social Security trust fund without any way to pay for it,\" the North Carolina Republican added.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that broadly reduce payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "\"This stuff takes time, but 21 years is ridiculous,\" said Brown of the process. The Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The measure, which passed the House in November, had 62 cosponsors when it was introduced in the Senate last year. Yet the bill's bipartisan support eroded some in recent days, with some Republican lawmakers voicing doubts due to its cost. According\u00a0to\u00a0the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "At least one GOP senator who signed onto similar legislation last year, Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana, said he was still \"weighing\" whether to vote for the bill. \"Nothing ever gets paid for, so it's further indebtedness, I don't know,\" Braun said last week, the Associated Press reported.",
      "\"In the end it's going to come down to individual members are going to make their own decisions about where they want to come down on that,\" incoming Republican leader John Thune said at a press conference Tuesday. \"Obviously I am concerned about the long-term solvency of Social Security and that is an issue I think we need to address.\"",
      "Without Senate approval, the bill's fate would end with the current session of Congress, and would need to be re-introduced in the next Congress.",

Hernandez, a teacher who fled his home country in the 1990s, was granted legal status and a work permit under the Temporary Protection Status program.",
      "The program, created by Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush, allows immigrants to temporarily remain in the U.S. if they're from countries designated as unsafe. TPS allows migrants to apply for work permits and shields them from deportation, but does not offer a pathway to citizenship.",

He will deliver.\" Leavitt said. But she did not address what the Trump administration plans to do with migrants who have temporary legal U.S. status.",

      "\"It is very important that anybody who is under Temporary Protection Status sits down with an attorney to evaluate every possible avenue to obtain a permanent status, or to change status, and figure it out,\" said Haim Vasquez, an immigration lawyer in Dallas, Texas. \"If there's anything that can be done, they must do it sooner than later.\"",

      "Extensions, known as designations, for TPS are announced two months before the expiration date, Vasquez said. In this case, Biden would have to issue a new designation for Salvadorans by Jan. 9.",
      "As for how much time immigrants would have in the country before they face deportation if Trump were to fulfill his promises and revoke TPS, Vasquez says it depends on how Trump terminates the program. He could allow the status to run through expiration dates previously set; any revocation is sure to be met with lawsuits.",
      "\"A hundred percent, we expect that there will be legal challenges,\" Vasquez said.",
      "During his first administration, Trump tried to terminate TPS for beneficiaries from six countries, including Haiti, Honduras, El Salvador, Nepal, Nicaragua and Sudan. Trump's attempts, however, were immediately met with legal challenges, and a judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the TPS terminations.",

      "The report will likely be unveiled in the coming days, after the final votes of the 118th Congress, the sources said. Lawmakers face a Friday deadline to approve new government funding and avoid a shutdown before heading home for the holidays.\u00a0CNN first reported on Thursday that the committee voted behind closed doors earlier this month to release the report.",
      "Republicans in the full House recently blocked\u00a0two Democratic resolutions that would have compelled the Ethics Committee to release the potentially damaging report on its investigation into Gaetz, voting to refer the matter back to the committee.",
      "Gaetz resigned from Congress shortly after President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to\u00a0nominate\u00a0Gaetz to be attorney general in November. But Gaetz soon withdrew from consideration, facing a likely contentious confirmation process. Gaetz has said he does not intend to take the oath of office for the same seat in the 119th Congress, and is launching a new show on the pro-Trump One America News Network in January.",
      "It's highly unusual, but not unprecedented, for the House Ethics Committee to release a report on a member who is no longer in office. In other investigations, the prospect of a report's release has been enough to prompt the target of the probe to resign from Congress to keep it under wraps. Senior lawmakers, including some Democrats, have expressed concerns about the precedent set by unveiling the Gaetz findings after he has already stepped down.",
      "In June, the committee\u00a0released a statement\u00a0saying it was investigating allegations against Gaetz that included sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, and bribery.",
      "Multiple sources at the time told CBS News that\u00a0four women\u00a0had informed the Ethics Committee that they had been paid to go to parties that included sex and drugs, and that Gaetz had also attended. The committee has Gaetz's Venmo transactions that allegedly show payments for the women.",
      "Gaetz has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and has called the committee's investigation a \"frivolous\" smear campaign.",
      "The House Ethics Committee declined to comment. Gaetz released a lengthy statement on X in response, saying he \"probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked\" more than he should have, but did nothing illegal.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to consider the South Carolina health department's effort to cut off funding from Planned Parenthood because it performs abortions, wading into another dispute over access to the procedure in the wake of its reversal of Roe v. Wade.",
      "The case, known as Kerr v. Edwards, stems from the state's decision in 2018 to end Planned Parenthood South Atlantic's participation in its Medicaid program. Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, directed the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services to deem abortion clinics unqualified to provide family planning services and end their Medicaid agreements.",
      "Planned Parenthood operates two facilities in the state, one in Charleston and the other in Columbia, and provides hundreds of Medicaid patients with services like physicals, cancer and other health screenings, pregnancy testing and contraception. Federal law prohibits Medicaid from paying for abortions except in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother.",
      "Planned Parenthood and one of its patients, Julie Edwards, sued the state, arguing that cutting off its funding violated a provision of the Medicaid Act that gives beneficiaries the right to choose their provider.",
      "A federal district court blocked South Carolina from ending Planned Parenthood's participation in its Medicaid program, and a U.S. appeals court upheld that decision, finding that Edwards could sue the state to enforce the Medicaid Act's free-choice-of-provider requirement.",
      "The legal battle has already been before the Supreme Court in the past, with the high court last year ordering additional proceedings after deciding in a separate case that nursing home residents could sue their state-owned health care facility over alleged violations of civil rights.",
      "After reconsidering its earlier decision, the three-judge appeals court panel ruled unanimously in March that Edwards' lawsuit against the state could go forward and said South Carolina couldn't strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funds.",
      "\"This case is, and always has been, about whether Congress conferred an individually enforceable right for Medicaid beneficiaries to freely choose their healthcare provider. Preserving access to Planned Parenthood and other providers means preserving an affordable choice and quality care for an untold number of mothers and infants in South Carolina,\" Judge Harvie Wilkinson wrote for the panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.",
      "South Carolina officials asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, marking the third time the case has been before the justices. The justices agreed to take up the question of whether \"the Medicaid Act's any-qualified provider provision unambiguously confers a private right upon a Medicaid beneficiary to choose a specific provider.\"",
      "South Carolina is among the more than two dozen that have passed laws restricting access to abortion in the wake of the Supreme Court's June 2022 decision reversing Roe v. Wade. In South Carolina, abortion is outlawed after six weeks of pregnancy with some exceptions.",
      "Several states have also enacted laws blocking Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funding, including Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi and Texas.",

    "summary": "A new Pentagon report says China is continuing to expand its nuclear force and has strengthened its ties with Russia over the past year.",
    "story": [
      "China is continuing its nuclear expansion, is strengthening its ties with Russia, and has increased military pressure against Taiwan over the past year, according to a new Defense Department report that examines actions accelerating key areas of conflict with the U.S.",
      "The report, released Wednesday, also noted that the recent rash of corruption allegations within China's powerful Central Military Commission, which oversees the People's Liberation Army, is hurting Beijing's military growth and could slow its modernization campaign.",
      "A senior defense official said China has made progress in some of its programs but slid back in others.",
      "The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the U.S. assessment, warned that Beijing is working toward developing a more diverse and technologically sophisticated nuclear force. While the expected number of nuclear warheads has maintained consistent growth, China is broadening its targeting abilities.",
      "Beijing is going to be able to go after more and different types of targets, do greater damage and have more options for multiple rounds of counterstrikes, the official said. The U.S. is urging China to be more transparent about its nuclear program, while also warning that America will defend its allies and take appropriate steps in response.",
      "According to the report, which provides the annual U.S. assessment of China's military power and is required by Congress, By mid-2024, China had over 600 operational nuclear warheads, and the Pentagon expects it will have more than 1,000 by 2030. The Pentagon's estimate of China's current stock of nuclear warheads is about 100 higher than disclosed in last year's report, but that is a reflection in the change in the estimate, not the pace of production.",
      "The Biden administration has worked to maintain a balance with China, building up the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region to be ready to counter Beijing while also encouraging increased communications between the two countries at the diplomatic and military levels.",
      "That uptick in talks has coincided with a decrease in coercive and risky intercepts of U.S. aircraft since late 2023, compared with the previous two years. China still, however, does what the U.S. military considers \"unsafe\" flights near American and allied forces in the region.",
      "The Pentagon's national defense strategy is built around the assessment that China poses the greatest security challenge for the U.S., and the threat from Beijing influences how the U.S. military is equipped and organized for the future.",
      "Corruption within the PLA has resulted in the ouster of at least 15 high-ranking officials in a major shakeup of China's defense establishment.",
      "\"This wave of corruption touches every service in the PLA, and it may have shaken Beijing's confidence,\" the report said.",
      "In June, China announced that former Defense Minister Li Shangfu and his predecessor, Wei Fenghe, were expelled from the ruling Communist Party and accused of corruption. Last month, another senior official, Miao Hua, was suspended and put under investigation, according to China's Defense Ministry.",
      "The U.S. report points to a persistent increased military presence by China around Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own. It said China's navy has been in the region more and that there have been increased crossings into the island's air defense identification zone and major military exercises in the area.",
      "Just last week, a large deployment of Chinese navy and coast guard vessels in the waters around Taiwan triggered alarm as Taiwanese officials said it looked like China was simulating a blockade. Officials have said there were as many as 90 ships involved in what Taiwan described as two walls designed to demonstrate that the waters belong to China.",
      "Taiwan split from communist China in 1949 and has rejected Beijing's demands that it accept unification. China says it will do so by force if necessary, and leaders have said they want to be ready to do so by 2027.",
      "The United States is obligated under domestic law to help defend Taiwan and give it weapons and technology to deter invasion.",
      "The island democracy has been the chief source of tension between Washington and Beijing for decades and is widely seen as the most likely trigger for a potentially catastrophic U.S.-China war.",
      "More broadly, the report concluded that the PLA continued its drive to develop greater military capabilities but \"made uneven progress toward its 2027\" milestone for modernization.",
      "One area of expansion, the report said, is with unmanned aerial systems, which officials said are \"quickly approaching U.S. standards.\"",
      "Regarding Russia, the report said China has supported Russia's war against Ukraine and sold Russia dual-use items that Moscow's military industry relies on. Dual use items can be used for both civilian and military purposes.",

      "Continuing a decades-long effort to change the nation's bankruptcy system, Sen. Elizabeth Warren plans to propose legislation on Wednesday aimed at making the process less costly and complicated for the hundreds of thousands of individuals who seek court-sanctioned relief from debt each year.",
      "\"People typically file for bankruptcy for one of three reasons: a job loss, a medical problem or a family breakup \u2014 and when they do, they're faced with an expensive and complicated system,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement in reintroducing the bill, known as the \"Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act.\"",
      "\"My bill would simplify and modernize the consumer bankruptcy system to make it easier and less expensive for people to get relief,\" Warren added.",
      "Bankruptcies rising",
      "The measure comes as personal bankruptcies\u00a0compared this year with 2023 levels. More than 400,000 Americans have filed for bankruptcy in 2024, although that figure is far below their pre-pandemic average of about 750,000 personal bankruptcy filings a year.",
      "Warren said her bill would help families \"avoid eviction, keep homes and cars and discharge local government fines.\" It would also create a repayment plan for unsecured debt, including student loans, as well as eliminate a restriction that bars people from shedding private and public student debt in bankruptcy, like other types of consumer loans.",
      "Rep. Nadler, a New York Democrat, and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, are co-leading a House version of the bill, while Rhode Island Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse will cosponsor the measure in the Senate. The bill has been endorsed by a wide range of groups including the AFL-CIO, a labor union, and consumer advocacy groups Public Citizen and National Consumer Law Center.",
      "\"Big corporate debtors continue to reap the rewards of our broken bankruptcy system while everyday Rhode Islanders facing financial hardship struggle to obtain basic relief. I'm pleased to support this bill that makes the consumer bankruptcy system fairer and easier to access for those facing crushing personal debt,\" Whitehouse said in a statement.",
      "Among other things, Warren's proposal would provide two routes for individuals to file for bankruptcy:",
      "No-payment discharge. For low-income filers, this option would wipe out unsecured debt other than child support or debts incurred by fraud.Debt-specific plans.\u00a0This would let individuals resolve debts specific to their financial situation, pausing debt collection efforts\u00a0 paused while filer remains current on loans.",

      "The change would be a welcome one, according to advocates, who say the current bankruptcy rules can steer people in the wrong direction.",
      "It costs about $1,500 to file Chapter 7, and most attorneys require that their fees be paid upfront. Chapter 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy, where the filer's nonexempt property and assets \u2014 possessions not protected by bankruptcy \u2014 are turned over to a trustee, and debt is discharged in three to six months.",
      "With a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, payments can be spread out, but the overall costs for filers is significantly higher, running an average of $4,500. Only about a third of people who file Chapter 13 make it to the end and have their debts discharged, research shows.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Leaders in Congress on Tuesday unveiled a lengthy stopgap measure to keep the government funded into the spring, with just days to go to prevent a government shutdown.",
      "Congress has until Friday night to stave off a funding lapse, since lawmakers approved a continuing resolution in September to keep the government funded through Dec. 20. The new stopgap measure, with approval from the House, Senate and President Biden, would keep the government funded through March 14, giving lawmakers more time to reach agreement on new spending bills when the GOP controls both the House and the Senate.",
      "The 1,500 page stopgap measure also includes a one-year extension of the farm bill, around $100 billion in disaster aid and $10 billion in economic assistance to farmers.",
      "The continuing resolution's release comes under the wire, with House leaders under pressure to abide by a 72-hour rule for members to review legislation before it's brought to the floor. Johnson said Tuesday morning that he believes in adhering to the rule, but with the end of week deadline fast approaching, he may be out of options.",
      "The speaker also said that House Republican leadership is committed to passing the continuing resolution through the regular process, including by going through the House Rules Committee, where it's almost certain to face opposition from GOP hardliners that could further slow the path to passage.",
      "In a statement late Tuesday night, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that he was \"pleased these negotiations led to a bipartisan government funding agreement free of cuts and poison pills, while also securing Democratic priorities like millions for child care, workforce training and job placement, assistance for the Key Bridge rebuild, additional disaster relief funding and more.\"",
      "Even before its release, lawmakers on the party's right flank had begun expressing opposition to the stopgap measure. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican who sits on the Rules Committee, told reporters after the House GOP conference meeting Tuesday morning that \"this is not the process that we signed up for,\" saying lawmakers are supposed to be able to amend and debate key legislation on the House floor.",
      "\"We get this negotiated crap and we're forced to eat this crap sandwich,\" Roy said. \"Why? Because freaking Christmas is right around the corner. It's the same dang thing every year \u2014 legislate by crisis, legislate by calendar, not legislate because it's the right thing to do.\"",
      "Leadership could instead opt to bring the legislation to the floor under a procedure known as suspension of the rules, leaning on Democrats to reach a two-thirds majority needed for passage in order to get the legislation more swiftly to the Senate before the end-of-week deadline.",
      "House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar acknowledged Tuesday morning that Republicans will need Democrats to approve government funding, saying the dynamic \"has been the case this Congress,\" and \"it will continue to be the case in the next Congress.\"",
      "\"This is a lesson for Speaker Johnson,\" Aguilar said. \"Let's find solutions, let's tune out the most extreme voices in your conference, and let's find that consensus that will be necessary to fund government.\"",
      "Johnson has previously expressed distaste for large end-of-year funding measures known as omnibuses, and pledged to avoid the practice of pushing through spending before the holiday recess. He defended the continuing resolution Tuesday, saying \"it is not an omnibus\" and arguing that it will put the party in a position to \"put our fingerprints on what those final spending bills are\" in the new year. And he noted that House Republicans are aiming to resolve the government funding fight earlier in the year, before the March 14 deadline.",
      "Even with this week's tight timeline, lawmakers are expected to thwart the threat of a shutdown, with little appetite in Washington for a funding lapse.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said ahead of the legislation's release Tuesday afternoon that negotiators should have already finished their work, but were delayed by \"an eleventh-hour demand from the speaker.\"",
      "\"We are heading into the holidays and the nation really needs a bipartisan package that will prevent a needless shutdown, keep our government open, and get much needed support to areas across the country that are recovering from disaster,\" Murray said.",
      "The speaker said lawmakers have been \"working around the clock to get the CR done,\" noting that it was intended to be \"a very simple, very clean\" stopgap funding measure to get the party into the new year. But the Louisiana Republican said a \"couple of intervening things\" occurred, citing the devastation caused by hurricanes Helene and Milton earlier this year. Johnson said the stopgap measure includes disaster relief that is \"critically important,\" and provides aid to farmers.",

If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

      "Connolly, 74, defeated 35-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0in a 131-84 vote to become the ranking member of the powerful committee. Connolly, who came to Congress in 2009, will replace Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who will serve as the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3.",
      "\"I think my colleagues were measuring their votes by who's got experience, who's seasoned, who can be trusted, who's capable and who's got a record of productivity,\" Connolly told reporters after the meeting. \"And I think that prevailed.\"",
      "While Democrats will remain in the minority in the new year, Connolly's elevation to ranking member places him in line to chair the Oversight Committee if Democrats retake the House in 2026, halfway through President-elect Donald Trump's second term. The committee led numerous investigations into the first Trump administration after Democrats won the House in 2018.",

      "Ever booked a hotel room for $200 only to be surprised by an extra $40 \"resort fee\" at checkout? A new Federal Trade Commission rule aims to put a stop to such surprise charges by banning so-called junk fees on short-term lodging as well as on tickets to live events.",
      "The rule bans businesses from using such tactics to disguise prices and mislead customers who rent short-term lodging, such as hotels and vacation homes, along with consumers who buy tickets to concerts, sports and other live events, the FTC announced Tuesday.",
      "\"People deserve to know upfront what they're being asked to pay \u2014 without worrying that they'll later be saddled with mysterious fees that they haven't budgeted for and can't avoid,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement. \"The FTC's rule will put an end to junk fees around live event tickets, hotels and vacation rentals, saving Americans billions of dollars and millions of hours in wasted time.\"",
      "Under the new rule, total prices for short-term lodging and event tickets must be presented to consumers in a \"timely, transparent and truthful\" manner, the FTC said. That's meant to ensure people are longer surprised by extra charges including \"resort,\" \"convenience\" or \"service\" fees that inflate prices. It's also designed to make comparing costs easier, according to the agency.",
      "Hotels commonly tack on resort fees to cover costs like cleaning or the use of amenities such as fitness or aquatic centers. But the FTC said such fees are deceptive, estimating that the new rule will save consumers both time and billions of dollars.",
      "To be sure, businesses may still charge additional fees for service, but they must disclose such charges to consumers up-front, rather than burying them in fine print, and \"clearly and conspicuously\" advertise a hotel room or live event ticket's total price including all fees, versus simply displaying a base rate or price, the FTC explained. The total cost also must be displayed more prominently than any other pricing information, the rule stipulates.",
      "Longstanding consumer protection laws prohibit business in other industries from deceiving consumers about fees and pricing.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:21:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

Merchan said at the time he wanted to hear from prosecutors about how to proceed with the case, which entered uncharted terrain when Trump was reelected president.",
      "Since then, Trump filed another motion to dismiss the case, arguing that his forthcoming return to the White House required it.",
      "Prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg have fought that effort, saying there's no law that requires dismissing a state case after conviction because the defendant was elected to the presidency.",
      "Trump is the first person in American history to win the presidency after being convicted of crimes. He was also the first former president to face trial for crimes.",
      "A unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May. Weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts. The nation's highest court said in that decision that evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",

      "Bragg's office said in opposing the motion to dismiss that the testimony called into question was, \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence in the case.",
      "Merchan wrote in his ruling that Trump's lawyers failed to object during the trial to testimony it considered improperly admitted.",
      "The jury found that Trump committed 34 felonies in authorizing a plan to conceal reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.",
      "\"Is a President's in-office conduct to conceal payments to an adult film actress to keep information from the public eye relating to an encounter that occurred prior to his Presidency official or unofficial?\" Merchan asked at one point in his ruling. He concluded they were unofficial acts, but later added, even if they hadn't been, \"use of these acts as evidence of the decidedly personal acts of falsifying business records poses no danger\" to the presidency.",
      "Trump entered a not guilty plea and vehemently denies Daniels' story. Trump has promised to appeal the conviction. He is separately able to appeal Merchan's ruling on presidential immunity.",

      "The Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 also requires that each state determine a state official \u2014 the governor unless specified otherwise \u2014 to be responsible for submitting the \"certificate of ascertainment\" that identifies the state's electors and includes a security feature.",
      "What were the 2024 Electoral College results?",
      "Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Harris' 226. See state-by-state results here and below.",
      "Nationally, Trump also won the popular vote, winning 77.2 million votes to Harris' 75 million.",
      "How many electoral votes does each state have?",
      "The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and a majority of 270 is needed to become president.",
      "Each state's electoral votes are equal to the number of representatives they have in the House, plus two senators.",
      "While the number of Electoral College votes has remained at 538 since 1964, the number of votes per state changes to match congressional apportionment after the decennial census. Between the 2020 election and the 2024 election, Texas gained two Electoral College votes, while five other states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon \u2014 gained one electoral vote each. Six states lost an electoral vote: California, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.",
      "The map below shows the changes by state between the 2020 election and the 2024 election.",
      "Does each elector have to vote with the state election results?",
      "Forty-eight states and Washington, D.C., are winner-take-all, so the winner of the popular vote in the state wins all of the state's electoral votes. Maine and Nebraska allocate their electors based on the winner of the popular vote within each Congressional District and then two \"at-large\" electors are determined based on winner of the statewide popular vote.",
      "The electors are supposed to vote in accordance with the outcome of the popular vote in their state. The Constitution does not require electors to vote with the winner of the popular vote, but most states have laws that nullify the votes of \"faithless electors.\" The Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that states can punish these \"faithless electors.\"",
      "According to FairVote, there have been 90 \"deviant\" votes cast by electors for president since the founding of the Electoral College, although the majority of these were due to the death of a party's nominee rather than a true deviation from the voters' intent.",
      "There have also been 75 faithless electors for vice president, for a total of 165 faithless electors throughout history, according to FairVote.",
      "After the 2020 election, so-called \"fake\"\u00a0Republican electors in seven battleground states won by President Biden met anyway and cast phony votes for Trump. State criminal charges have been filed against fake electors in Georgia, Michigan and Nevada. In charging Trump for attempting the overturn the election results, special counsel Jack Smith said these fake electors were part of a plan to overturn the election, orchestrated by pro-Trump attorneys with Trump's support. Those charges\u00a0have been dismissed since Trump's victory in the 2024 election.",
      "What's next after the Electoral College certification?",
      "After the results are signed and certified, they are sent to Harris, acting as the president of the Senate. The vote certificates must be received by the fourth Wednesday in December, which this year is Dec. 25. The archivist then transmits the sets of certificates to Congress on or before the new Congress meets on Jan. 3, 2025.",
      "On Jan. 6, 2025, Congress meets in a joint session to count the Electoral College votes, overseen by Harris. After the votes are counted, the vice president announces the winner of the election.",

    "title": "\"Murder hornets\" eradicated in the U.S., agriculture officials say",
    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 16:10:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Giant hornets, dubbed \"murder hornets,\" have been eradicated in the U.S., five years after the invasive species was first detected in Washington state.",
    "story": [
      "The Northern giant hornet, more commonly known as the \"murder hornet,\" has been eradicated in the U.S., agriculture officials said Wednesday.",
      "The ominously nicknamed invasive species was confirmed to be in the U.S. in 2019 after officials in Washington state received and verified two reports of the hornet. Efforts quickly began to track and get rid of them.",
      "The 2-inch-long hornet, with a stinger longer than that of a typical wasp, can deliver potent venom, but is largely dangerous to bees and other insects, not humans. Eradication efforts started because of the threat the hornet posed to bees and agriculture across the country.",
      "\"By tackling this threat head-on, we protected not only pollinators and crops, but also the industries, communities, and ecosystems that depend on them,\" Dr. Mark Davidson, deputy administrator at USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said in a news statement.",
      "How \"murder hornets\" were eradicated",
      "State, federal and international government agencies worked together to eradicate \"murder hornets\" in the U.S., the officials said.",
      "To do so, first entomologists had to find the hornets' nests.\u00a0Finding the nests can be a challenge, because the hornets typically build their nests in forested areas, often in an underground cavity, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In some cases, entomologists captured a live hornet, attached a radio tag to it, released it, and tracked the hornet back to its nest. Figuring out how to securely attach a radio tag to a hornet without harming it was a hurdle.",
      "After finding a nest in a tree, a team plugged the nest with foam, wrapped the tree in plastic and vacuumed out the hornets. They also injected carbon dioxide into the tree to kill any remaining hornets.",
      "In 2022, scientists said they were setting about 1,000 hornet traps in Washington. Hornets caught in traps help scientists find the location of nests. The previous year, Washington state officials destroyed a nest, finding nearly 1,500 hornets \"in various stages of development.\"",
      "The public also helped officials track down hornet nests. If not for help from the public, there's a good chance that the hornet could have been around for years to come, Sven Spichiger, Washington State Department of Agriculture pest program manager, said during a news conference Wednesday.",
      "\"All of our nest detections resulted directly or indirectly from public reports,\" Spichiger said in a press release. \"And half of our confirmed detections came from the public.",
      "Could the hornet come back to the U.S.?",
      "While officials in Washington celebrated the eradication of the invasive hornet species, Spichiger acknowledged they could come back to the U.S. He said officials would continue to keep an eye out for the hornet and encouraged members of the community to do the same.",
      "\"They got here once and they could do it again,\" Spichiger said.",
      "CBS News previously reported that it was unclear how the hornets first arrived in the U.S., though invasive species can be \"unwitting hitchhikers\" on things like shipping containers.",
      "Even now, five years after the hornets appeared in the U.S., Spichiger said officials will never know exactly how they got to the country.",
      "What makes \"murder hornets\" unique?",
      "The hornet, an invasive species from Asia, can kill an entire hive of honeybees in as little as 90 minutes, according to agriculture officials.",
      "\"The hornets can enter a 'slaughter phase' where they kill entire hives by decapitating the bees. The hornets then defend the hive as their own, taking the brood to feed their own young,\" according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture. \"They also attack other insects but are not known to destroy entire colonies of those insects.\"",
      "The hornets typically only attack people or pets when threatened, but can sting repeatedly.",
      "The hornet species has a large orange or yellow head and black-and-orange stripes across its body.",
      "They were first detected in North America in British Columbia, Canada ,in August 2019, authorities said, and then were confirmed in Washington state by the end of 2019.",
      "When the species first arrived in the U.S., it was known as the Asian giant hornet. But in July of 2022, the Entomological Society of America adopted \"Northern giant hornet\" as the common name for the species. The organization also adopted the names Southern giant hornet as the name for a closely related species.",
      "\"Common names are an important tool for entomologists to communicate with the public about insects and insect science,\" organization President Jessica Ware said at the time. \"Northern giant hornet is both scientifically accurate and easy to understand, and it avoids evoking fear or discrimination.\"",
      "While the U.S. appears to have gotten rid of them, at least for now, scientists in Spain last month reported sightings of the hornet species in Europe. They described two sightings of the hornet in the journal Ecology and Evolution.",

      "Published on Wednesday, the IEA's \"Coal 2024\" report does, however, predict the world will hit peak coal use in 2027 after topping 8.77 billion tons this year.",
      "But that would be dependent on China, which for the past quarter-century has consumed 30 percent more coal than the rest of the world's countries combined, the IEA said.",
      "China's demand for electricity was the most significant driving force behind the increase, with more than a third of coal burnt worldwide carbonized in that country's power plants.",
      "Though Beijing has sought to diversify its electricity sources, including a massive expansion of solar and wind power, the IEA said China's coal demand in 2024 will still hit 4.9 billion tones \u2014 itself another record.",
      "Increasing coal demand in China, as well as in emerging economies such as India and Indonesia, made up for a continued decline in advanced economies.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:23:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers determined that dozens of men, women and children were violently killed and cannibalized in Bronze Age-era England.",
    "story": [
      "New research suggests that dozens of Bronze-Age era Britons were killed in an attack unlike any previous known to archaelogists studying that time period and location.",
      "The research on human remains from Charterhouse Warren in southwest England, conducted by a team of researchers from multiple institutions including Oxford University, was published in Antiquity, a journal of world archaeology. It found that at least 37 Bronze Age-era men, women and children were \"killed and butchered\" and then cannibalized, with their bodies then thrown down a nearly 50-foot deep natural shaft. While archaeologists have found the remains of Bronze Age and later Britons who died violently, those incidents were largely isolated. Mass graves from this era have also been found, but the remains were laid to rest respectfully, unlike those studied.",
      "Researchers first became aware of the shaft in the 1970s. Two excavations were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The human remains, as well as some artifacts including a flint dagger, were found at multiple spots in the shaft during these digs. More than 3,000 individual human bones and bone fragments have been recovered overall. Those bones were used to estimate that at least 37 individual sets of remains were in the shaft. Different bone lengths show that the people killed were both male and female, and ranged in age from infants to grown adults. Ongoing research is working to determine how the people were related to each other.",
      "The way the remains were disposed of made the detailed examination possible, the researchers said. The shaft helped preserve the bones and keep them grouped together.",
      "The bones \"display clear evidence of blunt force trauma,\" according to researchers, suggesting that many of the people in the shaft \"suffered a violent death.\" Other injuries, including removal of the scalp and severed muscles in the jaw suggesting removal of the tongue or lower jaw, also likely occurred, evidenced by marks on the bones, the researchers said. Some of the victims may have been beheaded or dismembered.",
      "It's possible that the victims were held captive or ambushed, because of the severity of the injuries, the researchers said. It's not clear who could have carried out the attacks.",
      "There is also evidence that the bodies were cannibalized, the researchers said, including human teethmarks on the bones and indicators that marrow, the soft tissue inside bones, was removed. The researchers said the cannibalism was likely conducted \"within a context of a violent conflict, in which individuals are dehumanized and treated as animals.\"",
      "\"Some 37 men, women and children\u2014and possibly many more\u2014were killed at close quarters with blunt instruments and then systematically dismembered and defleshed, their long bones fractured in a way that can only be described as butchery,\" the researchers said.",
      "Later in the publication, the researchers referred to the scene as a \"massacre,\" and suggested it may have even been a \"political statement\" of violence so brazen it would have \"resonated across the wider region and over time.\" However, it's not clear what could have led to the violence: \"Neither climate change, ethnic conflict nor competition over material resources seem to offer convincing explanations,\" according to the researchers, leaving the only likely option that the violence broke out as part of a pattern of revenge or violence between communities.",
      "\"At this stage, our investigation has raised as many questions as it has answered,\" the researchers said. \"Work is ongoing to shed more light on this decidedly dark episode in British prehistory.\"",

    "summary": "Here's why NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are stuck, but not stranded, at the International Space Station after launching into space in June.",
    "story": [
      "Two NASA astronauts who flew up to the International Space Station in a Boeing Starliner capsule for a round trip that was supposed to last just over a week will be stuck in space for closer to a year before they can come home. Despite the astronauts' longer-than-expected stay at the space station, officials have insisted that Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore aren't stranded in space.",
      "Here's what we know about the stuck astronauts:",
      "Why are the astronauts stuck in space?",
      "Williams and Wilmore blasted off to the space station in June. Their mission was supposed to take between eight and 10 days, but helium leaks in the capsule's propulsion system and degraded thrusters, which are important for re-entry, upended plans for bringing the astronauts back to Earth.",
      "\"Eight days to eight months or nine months or 10 months, whatever it is, we're going to do the very best job we can do every single day,\" Wilmore told CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann in September. At the time, they were expected to leave the space station in late February 2025.",
      "The capsule safely returned to Earth in September with no one onboard.",
      "Who are the astronauts who are stuck in space?",
      "Williams turned 59 on the space station in September. She joined NASA in 1998 after serving in the Navy for over a decade, retiring as a captain. As a naval aviator, she logged over 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft. At NASA, she had set a record for women with four spacewalks lasting a total of 29 hours, 17 minutes, but it was broken by Peggy Whitson with her fifth spacewalk in 2008.",
      "Wilmore also retired from the Navy as a captain, recording over 8,000 flight hours as a naval aviator. During Operation Desert Storm in Iraq in 1991, Wilmore flew 21 combat missions. He joined NASA in 2000 and accumulated 178 days in space before the Starliner mission. Like Williams, he has also performed four spacewalks, totaling 25 hours, 36 minutes.",
      "Why did the Boeing Starliner crew go to the International Space Station in the first place?",
      "The June launch was the Starliner's first piloted test flight. NASA has funded the development of the capsule and SpaceX's Crew Dragon as the space agency looks to stop using Russian Soyuz flights to transport astronauts to and from the space station.",
      "When will the astronauts be able to return to Earth?",
      "On Tuesday, Dec. 17, NASA announced Williams and Wilmore would return to Earth after the agency's new SpaceX crew arrives at the space station. That won't happen until late March at the earliest so NASA and SpaceX can have more time to finish a new Dragon spacecraft for the mission, NASA said.",
      "Have other astronauts been stuck in the International Space Station before?",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 14:26:37 -0500",
    "summary": "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson says he's optimistic the Trump administration will support the space agency's agenda.",
    "story": [
      "Outgoing NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Wednesday he is optimistic SpaceX founder Elon Musk's relationship with President-Elect Donald Trump will help ensure NASA receives the funding needed to support a robust agenda, including returning U.S. astronauts to the moon.",
      "Trump has nominated billionaire Jared Isaacman, veteran of two SpaceX Crew Dragon flights to low-Earth orbit, to serve as NASA's next administrator, prompting speculation Musk's connections to both men might give him even more influence over NASA space policy than he currently wields.",
      "\"On the one hand, I am optimistic because of the relationship that Musk has with Trump that NASA will get the funding that it needs because Musk will be advocating,\" Nelson said in an interview with CBS News. \"On the other hand, if Musk were to want to cut out other companies in the competition for rockets, that would not be a good thing. And I think Musk is smarter than that.\"",
      "SpaceX already delivers cargo to the International Space Station with its unpiloted Dragon capsules and ferries astronauts to and from the outpost aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft.",
      "Critical to the Artemis moon program, SpaceX also is building a variant of its Starship rocket to carry astronauts back to the lunar surface in 2027. It will be NASA's first such landing since the final Apollo mission in 1972.",
      "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' company, Blue Origin, also is building a moon lander for NASA, giving the agency alternatives in case one company's spacecraft is grounded for some reason.",
      "But in the near term, SpaceX is \"the horse that we're going to ride, and we're expecting that horse to be able to run and run fast,\" Nelson said. \"And if not, we've got another horse and it's called Blue Origin.\"",
      "At Nelson insistence shortly after taking office, NASA held a second competition for a second lunar lander \"based on the principle that you want to have two spacecraft in case something happens to one of them,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"If ever there's been a demonstration of the wisdom of having two competitors, it was for the cargo and crew to the space station.\"",
      "NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing to build commercial crew ferry ships in the wake of the space shuttle's retirement in 2011.",
      "While SpaceX has successfully launched 10 sets of astronauts and cosmonauts to the station aboard Crew Dragon capsules, along with five purely commercial flights to orbit, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has carried just two crew members to the lab.",
      "Commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams took off on Boeing's first piloted Starliner test flight June 5. The mission was expected to last eight to 10 days, but thruster problems and propellant leaks combined to extend the crew's stay aboard the ISS while engineers carried out extensive testing.",
      "In the end, NASA decided to bring the Starliner down without its crew, switching Wilmore and Williams to a Crew Dragon and delaying their return to Earth until mid February. On Tuesday, NASA announced launch of the next Crew Dragon, carrying a replacement ISS crew, is slipping to at least the end of March.",
      "That means Wilmore and Williams will log an additional month and a half in orbit before finally coming home after 10 months in space. Asked if he had any words of encouragement for the Starliner astronauts, Nelson said simply \"they are true professionals, as are all of our astronauts, and they meet whatever is the need of NASA.\"",
      "Future of NASA's Artemis moon program",
      "The Isaacman nomination has prompted speculation in some quarters that NASA's Artemis moon program, relying on the agency's costly Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, could face major changes, including a possible switch from the SLS to SpaceX's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Nelson said a different rocket might be used in the 2030s, but the SLS is the only choice available for moon flights through the end of the current decade.",
      "\"Understand, that there is currently one human-rated rocket that has been to the moon and back, and that is SLS,\" Nelson said.",
      "NASA launched the first SLS on the program's maiden flight in 2021, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back. The second SLS is being prepared for launch in the April 2026 timeframe to send four astronauts on a similar out-and-back-again trip around the moon.",
      "After that, the Artemis 3 mission is tentatively targeted for launch in 2027. In that flight, an SLS will boost astronauts to the moon in an Orion capsule that will dock with SpaceX's lander in lunar orbit.

    "story": [
      "Two astronauts who traveled to the International Space Station aboard Boeing's troubled Starliner more than six months ago will not return to Earth until at least March 2025, NASA announced Tuesday.",
      "Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams traveled to the space station aboard the Starliner back in June. Their trip was initially only to last about eight to 10 days, but multiple issues with the Starliner prompted a concerned NASA, out of caution, to leave them behind at the space station and return the capsule to Earth empty in September.",
      "That same month, a SpaceX Crew-9 Dragon capsule with a reduced two-person crew and two empty seats launched to the space station with the intention of returning Wilmore and Williams aboard it in February 2025.",
      "However, NASA said in a news release Tuesday that Wilmore and Williams' replacements, traveling aboard the SpaceX Crew-10, would be launching to the space station \"no earlier than late March 2025,\" meaning that would be the earliest that Wilmore and Williams will return to Earth.",
      "The most recent delay in the Crew-10's launch is to give \"NASA and SpaceX teams time to complete processing on a new Dragon spacecraft for the mission.\"",
      "The Crew-9 \u2014 carrying Williams, Wilmore, fellow NASA astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov \u2014 can only leave the space station following a \"handover period\" with the Crew-10.",
      "The handover period \"allows Crew-9 to share any lessons learned with the newly arrived crew and support a better transition for ongoing science and maintenance at the complex.\"",
      "NASA did not speculate on how long that handover might take.",
      "The Starliner, Boeing's answer to the Crew Dragon, has faced major headwinds since it went into development, including a series of technical issues and budget shortfalls.",
      "It finally launched, but after arriving at the space station with its crew, multiple helium leaks were discovered in the Starliner's propulsion system, along with a degraded thrust in five of its maneuvering jets.",
      "A return in late March or April would mean that a trip that was expected to last just over a week for Williams and Wilmore   will have been stretched to at least nine months.",
      "\"Fabrication, assembly, testing, and final integration of a new spacecraft is a painstaking endeavor that requires great attention to detail,\" Steve Stich, manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said in a statement Tuesday about the Crew-10. \"We appreciate the hard work by the SpaceX team to expand the Dragon fleet in support of our missions and the flexibility of the station program and expedition crews as we work together to complete the new capsule's readiness for flight.\"",

      "But if being out in the predawn hours seems unlikely for you Sunday, you don't necessarily need to catch it exactly at the peak. The moon will appear full for several days. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the U.S.",
      "Why is the December full moon called the Cold Moon?",
      "December's full moon is called the Cold Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because of how cold it usually is during December's full moon.",
      "The moon also has several other nicknames, including the Long Night Moon, a name with Mohican origins, according to the Farmer's Almanac. The name is because December's full moon happens on one of the longest nights of the year.",

      "How long will December's moon be full?",
      "While the moon reaches peak illumination early on Dec. 15, it will appear full for several days. According to NASA, around 95% of the moon's nearside was expected to be illuminated by the sun on Friday, Dec. 13, and 99% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated on Saturday, Dec. 14. The agency said 100% will be illuminated on Dec. 15. On Dec. 16, 98% of the moon will still be illuminated.",

      "\"Still, the Geminids are known for bright meteors, and it's common to spot their shooting stars up to a week before the peak,\" according to NASA. \"If you're up before dawn that week, it's worth looking up, just in case you spot a speck of dust from space streaking through the morning sky.\"",
      "When and where you can see the Geminids",
      "Light from the nearly full moon will cut the visible rates for the Geminids by 50-75% during the peak this year, said Bill Cooke, lead of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. The brightest meteors will still be visible, according to NASA.",
      "With the bright moon on peak night, an observer in the U.S. may see around 15 Geminids an hour, Cooke said.",
      "\"In short, 2024 is a bad year for Geminid watching \u2014 December 2025 will be much better,\" Cooke said.",
      "The Geminid meteor shower is visible around the world and throughout the night sky. For optimal viewing conditions, head somewhere far away from city and street lights, then lie down flat on your back with your feet pointed south. Give your eyes half an hour to adjust to the dark.",
      "NASA advises bringing a sleeping bag or blanket to help with the cold while waiting for the Geminids.",
      "The shower usually starts around 9 or 10 p.m., with the meteors best viewed at night or in the pre-dawn hours.",
      "What is a meteor shower?",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere and heat up as they fall toward Earth, according to NASA. As they streak through the sky, glowing, hot air around the meteors gives the meteors the appearance of shooting stars. During meteor showers, many meteors travel through Earth's atmosphere over a short period.",
      "Most meteors burn up in space. The few that survive the trip and reach the ground and considered meteorites.",
      "What makes the Geminids different from other meteor showers?",
      "The Geminids are one of the strongest meteor showers of the year, with a rate of 120 meteors an hour under perfect conditions, according to NASA.",
      "While most meteor showers originate from comets, the Geminids actually come from an asteroid called 3200 Phaethon. NASA researchers say the asteroid acts like a \"weird\" comet.",
      "And while NASA says most meteors appear to be colorless or white, the Geminids are usually yellow in color.",

      "Last July, panic erupted on an American Airlines flight from San Francisco to Miami after a laptop battery in a carry-on bag ignited.",
      "\"It was absolute chaos. It truly felt like every man for themselves. And it was terrifying,\" said Shilpa Patel, a passenger on the flight. \"I don't know if we're going to explode. All I know is I need to get out and I need to survive.\"",

    "title": "How TikTok could avoid being banned in the U.S.",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

    "summary": "Scammers are using AI-powered voice-cloning tools to prey on people. But experts say there's a simple way to protect you and your family.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence-enabled voice cloning tools have made it easier for criminals to mimic strangers' voices and dupe victims into handing over large sums of money.",
      "For example, a scammer might target a victim posing as their grandchild and claiming they require cash \u2014 fast. Older people who might not be as familiar with new technologies such as AI can be particularly susceptible to these types of scams, particularly when the caller on the other line sounds identical to a loved one. Phone numbers also can be spoofed to mimic those of callers known to the target of voice cloning scams.",
      "In 2023, senior citizens were conned out of roughly $3.4 billion in a range of financial crimes, according to the FBI data. The agency recently\u00a0warned\u00a0that AI has increased the \"believability\" or criminal scams given that they \"assist with content creation and can correct for human errors that might otherwise serve as warning signs of fraud.\"",
      "Also commonly known as \"grandparent scams,\" a fraudster will impersonate an individual's loved one and claim they are in trouble, or need cash immediately for some sort of emergency.",
      "\"So much of it is based on psychology and hacking the limbic system,\" Chuck Herrin, field chief information security officer for F5, a security and fraud prevention firm, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They say things that trigger a fear-based emotional response because they know when humans get afraid, we get stupid and don't exercise the best judgment.\"",
      "How to create a family safe word",
      "The good news? Cybersecurity experts and law enforcement officials have a simple, but effective, recommendation for avoiding getting victimized by such scams: creating a family \"safe word,\" along with a protocol for verifying a family member or loved one's identity.",
      "That means choosing a word or phrase that can't be easily guessed. Obvious identifiers like a street name, alma mater or other information that may be readily available online are ill-advised, experts say.",
      "\"It needs to be unique and should be something that's difficult to guess,\" James Scobey, chief information security officer at Keeper Security told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It shouldn't be something that can be researched online about you or your family. Avoid street names, towns, phone numbers and individual names as part of a pass phrase.\"",
      "A safe phrase, consisting of at least four words, offers a greater degree of security, he added.",
      "Verify the caller's identity",
      "Following a basic routine that includes using a safe word is a good first line of defense against scammers.",
      "\"This is a mass operation, they don't care about you, they just care about bad security. They are churning though thousands of people they found on the dark web,\" Herrin of F5 told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have a reasonable security posture, you'll probably be fine. But if you leave the window open, you'll lose your TV,\" he said, comparing cybersecurity threats to physical vulnerabilities.",
      "Any time you are asked for financial assistance, require that the caller verify his or her identity. The key: Always ask for the safe word before transferring any money.",
      "\"Family safe words can be a really useful tool if they are used properly,\" Eva Velasquez, said CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit focused on ID security.",
      "Velasquez gave the example of a phony grandchild calling a grandparent and saying something like, \"I am in jail and need help, and I am so distraught I can't remember our password.\" In a tense or emotional moment, the victim could be inclined to offer it up to the person in distress, putting themselves in jeopardy.",
      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

      "An attorney for Mangione told CBS News New York on Wednesday he will waive extradition at his hearing in Pennsylvania on Thursday morning.",
      "Law enforcement sources say New York City Police detectives will be on hand at the 8:30 a.m. court proceeding to make sure Mangione is then transported straight to central booking at the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse, where he will be photographed before an arraignment hearing that will likely happen either late Thursday or early Friday.",
      "\"If he waives extradition, that should be quite quick,\" said Anna Cominsky, a professor at New York Law School. \"The idea is we want to be able to get him over here to answer the charges that are pending here in New York, so in a matter of a day or two at most.\"",
      "Cominsky was asked what the benefit would be of Mangione waiving extradition on Thursday.",
      "\"The benefit is he gets his New York case to start. We already know that Pennsylvania has said they are not going to move forward with their case until the New York case is completed, and so this means that once he's here, he can actually be arraigned and the case can begin with respect to his New York charges,\" she said.",
      "If for some reason Mangione ends up contesting his extradition, a spokesman said New York Gov. Kathy Hochul will quickly sign a special warrant that could get him back to New York City in a matter of days or weeks.",
      "\"I'm ready to bring him back here and make sure that justice is served to someone who had the audacity to gun down any New Yorker. I don't care what their title is. With that brazen move on our streets must result in severe consequences,\" Hochul said.",
      "CBS News New York has learned new details about Mangione's communication in the Pennsylvania prison where he's being held. The 26-year-old suspect has received 40 emails and 53 pieces of mail since\u00a0his arrest last week at an Altoona McDonald's, and has had 158 deposits into his commissary account. He has also had three visitors. Not from family, but rather his three attorneys, including Manhattan prosecutor-turned-defense attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo.",
      "Luigi Mangione indicted on murder, terrorism charges",
      "Mangione was indicted Tuesday on 11 charges, including first-degree murder in furtherance of terrorism, in the brazen assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson earlier this month.",
      "\"This was a killing that, it was intended to evoke terror, and we've seen that reaction,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced Tuesday.",
      "\"This was a frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock, attention and intimidation,\" Bragg continued. \"It occurred in one of the most bustling parts of our city, threatening the safety of local residents and tourists alike, commuters and business people just starting out on their day.\"",
      "The indictment also confirmed the\u00a0words \"deny\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings\u00a0found at the scene, and\u00a0\"delay\" was written on one of the bullets, an apparent nod to the \"three Ds of insurance,\" a phase used by critics of the industry.",
      "\"We really need to see more, with respect to why is it that the prosecutor believes that they have evidence that supports that terrorism charge. Why is it that they believe that it wasn't just an intent to kill an individual but also to terrorize others, to put fear in others, which is required in order to substantiate that,\" Cominsky said.",
      "\"We don't celebrate murders\"",
      "The NYPD flagged what appears to be a wave of online support for Mangione from people expressing anger toward the health care industry, along with serious online threats since Thompson's murder.",
      "\"There is no heroism in what Mangione did. This was a senseless act of violence, it was a cold and calculated crime that stole a life and put New Yorkers at risk,\"\u00a0NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch\u00a0said.",
      "\"We don't celebrate murders and we don't lionize the killing of anyone, and any attempt to rationalize this is vile, reckless and offensive to our deeply held principles of justice,\" Tisch added.",

      "Oklahoma is preparing to execute a man who killed a 10-year-old girl\u00a0in what would be the nation's 25th and final execution of the year.",
      "Kevin Ray Underwood is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Thursday, his 45th birthday, at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. Underwood, a former grocery store worker, was sentenced to die for killing Jamie Rose Bolin in 2006 as part of a cannibalistic fantasy.",
      "Underwood admitted to luring Jamie into his apartment and beating her over the head with a cutting board before suffocating and sexually assaulting her. He told investigators that he nearly beheaded the girl in his bathtub before abandoning his plans to eat her.",
      "Oklahoma uses a three-drug lethal injection process that begins with the sedative midazolam followed by a second drug that paralyzes the inmate to halt their breathing and a third that stops their heart.",
      "During a hearing last week before the state's Pardon and Parole Board, Underwood told the girl's family he was sorry.",
      "\"I would like to apologize to the victim's family, to my own family and to everyone in that room today that had to hear the horrible details of what I did,\" Underwood said to the board via a video feed from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary.",
      "The three board members in attendance at last week's meeting all voted against recommending clemency.",
      "Underwood's attorneys had argued that he deserved to be spared from death because of his long history of abuse and serious mental health issues that included autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar and panic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizotypal personality disorder and various deviant sexual paraphilias.",
      "His mother, Connie Underwood, tearfully asked the board to grant her son mercy.",
      "\"I can't imagine the heartache the family of that precious girl is living with every single day,\" Connie Underwood said. \"I wish we understood his pain before it led to this tragedy.\"",
      "But several members of Bolin's family asked the board to reject Underwood's clemency bid. The\u00a0girl's father,\u00a0Curtis Bolin, was scheduled to testify to the board but became choked up as he held his head in his hand.",
      "\"I'm sorry, I can't,\" he said.",
      "Prosecutors wrote in opposing Underwood's clemency request that, \"Whatever deviance of the mind led Underwood to abduct, beat, suffocate, sexually abuse and nearly decapitate Jamie cannot be laid at the feet of depression, anxiety or (autism).",
      "\"Underwood is dangerous because he is smart, organized and driven by deviant sexual desires rooted in the harm and abuse of others.\"",
      "In a last-minute request seeking a stay of execution from the U.S. Supreme Court, Underwood's attorneys argued that he deserves a hearing before the full five-member parole board and that the panel violated state law and Underwood's rights by rescheduling its hearing at the last minute after two members of the board resigned.",

    "title": "O'Malley in bid for DNC chair says Democrats need to learn from \"very bad loss\"",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 05:00:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Democrats elect a new party chair on Feb. 1, following the loss of the presidency and the Senate and the narrow failure to win the House in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Martin O'Malley has the kind of experience that would typically benefit a Democrat who wants to guide the party's future after devastating losses in the last election.",
      "He's a former governor, former mayor and a 2016 presidential candidate who until recently was serving in President Joe Biden's administration. Yet O'Malley is facing a difficult path in the race to try and become the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee as the party reckons with the reality that key pockets of voters turned against it.",
      "Vital to O'Malley's attempt is a campaign platform, first reported by CBS News, that calls for reconnecting the Democratic Party \"to the kitchen table of every American family.\"",
      "\"We suffered a very bad loss,\" O'Malley said in an interview, urging Democrats \"to learn from it in order to win the next battles ahead.\"",
      "His vision is centered on a 57-state and territory strategy along with plans to give campaigns \"world-class AI tools for voter outreach, research, communications, and financial management, eliminating barriers to effective campaigning.\" O'Malley's pitch is also focused on \"re-investing in direct voter registration,\" as part of his pledge for the party to make \"voter protection and registration the pillars of the change we need to win.\"",
      "Democrats weathered a chaotic election cycle in 2024, punctuated by the push within the party to convince President Biden to end his reelection run after a dismal debate performance in June. While Mr. Biden eventually ended his bid in July and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place at the top of the ticket, the 107-day sprint that followed resulted in Democrats losing the White House and Senate while failing, albeit narrowly, to win control of the House.",
      "Now the party is essentially leaderless and preparing for an emboldened Donald Trump to return to Washington, where he'll be able to benefit from Republicans' unified control of Congress and the White House. Those dynamics will be well in play at the time of the election for DNC chair on Feb. 1 given the unease among Democrats that has been abundantly clear in the weeks following the presidential election.",
      "\"I want to see someone who doesn't come from the Washington circuit, who actually has been out there in the tissue of the country,\" Ohio Rep. Marcy Kaptur, a battleground district Democrat, said of the DNC chair race.",
      "Failure can mean opportunity. The party's struggles means O'Malley, as well as other ambitious Democrats, have a chance to become the next chair and carry wide ranging influence during a critical time for the party as it looks to regain ground in the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election. For all his apparent vulnerabilities, Trump was far more successful in this election than ever before, winning all seven presidential battlegrounds. Whether what happened in 2024 will become a tangible turning point for Democrats is likely to loom over the chair race in the coming weeks.",
      "\"That's the big shift that's happened with this election going the wrong way on us,\" O'Malley said. \"We're now in a mode of needing a changemaker, not a caretaker.\"",
      "Among those running for chair, Ken Martin, the leader of Minnesota's arm of the Democratic Party and a DNC vice chair, as well as Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, are seen as frontrunners. Martin has deep relationships within the DNC and can boast a statewide winning streak for candidates in Minnesota, while Wikler carries the political gravitas of helping lead the party in one of the nation's seven presidential battlegrounds.",
      "Earlier this month, Martin announced a framework which includes his drive for a \"Democratic infrastructure in all 3,244 counties,\" across the country, as well as taking on the branding problem evident from the 2024 election results.",
      "\"The majority of Americans now believe the Republican Party best represents the interests of the working class and the poor, and the Democratic Party is the party of the wealthy and the elites,\" Martin said in his framework. \"It's a damning indictment on our party brand. We must be willing to dig deep and recenter the Democratic agenda to unite families across race, age, background, and class.\"",
      "During a brief pitch to party leaders at a meeting in Washington D.C. last week where Martin and O'Malley also spoke, Wikler told his fellow Democrats \"we need to build the battle plan to change how we communicate, so we show what we mean when we say we fight for working folks.\"",
      "This isn't the first time O'Malley has been linked to leading the party. Days after the 2016 election, he posted on social media that despite encouragement, he would not run for chair. Eight years later, he's navigating a short window to make his case as he emphasizes his lengthy career in politics.",
      "O'Malley served as mayor of Baltimore from 1999 to 2007 and went on to win two terms as governor of Maryland, which included a stint leading the Democratic Governors Association. His political power has faded since then however, illustrated most notably by the struggles he faced during his campaign for president in the 2016 Democratic primary. Before announcing his run for chair, O'Malley spent nearly a year working in the federal government as commissioner of Social Security.",
      "That experience is intertwined in O'Malley's platform, which also calls for creating \"a feedback loop for our local and state elected officials to ensure that they can help inform our messaging and tactics.\"",
      "\"We all know we need to restore our credibility,\" O'Malley said. \"We need to learn from our failings, as well as our candidates who succeeded. But only one of us [in the race for DNC chair] has actually proven an ability to effectuate a rapid turnaround like we need to do right now in order to win the next election.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 22:13:00 -0500",
    "summary": "House Speaker Mike Johnson is facing a revolt from fellow Republicans over a last-minute measure to keep the government funded and avoid a shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson scrapped a last-minute measure to avoid a government shutdown after facing opposition from fellow Republicans \u2014 including President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 who objected to billions of dollars in spending that had been added to the bill.",
      "Lawmakers are facing a Friday deadline to approve new spending. The measure released Tuesday would have extended funding through March 14, but it also included disaster aid, health care policy extenders and a pay raise for members of Congress, among other provisions. The disaster relief portion of the bill alone carried a price tag of $110 billion.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, confirmed that the\u00a0stopgap funding measure\u00a0is dead and that the path forward is unclear.",
      "\"There's no new agreement right now,\" Scalise said.",
      "In a statement on Wednesday, Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance criticized Johnson's approach and said Republicans should pass \"a streamlined spending bill that doesn't give Chuck Schumer and the Democrats everything they want.\" They also called for House Republicans to increase the debt ceiling, which limits how much the government can borrow to pay its bills.",
      "\"Republicans want to support our farmers, pay for disaster relief, and set our country up for success in 2025. The only way to do that is with a temporary funding bill WITHOUT DEMOCRAT GIVEAWAYS combined with an increase in the debt ceiling,\" they said. \"Anything else is a betrayal of our country.\"",
      "The debt ceiling has not been a part of these negotiations, and Republicans typically oppose increasing it. Trump's decision to inject the issue into shutdown talks adds a new dimension to the legislative fight with just two days to go before funding lapses.",
      "\"Increasing the debt ceiling is not great but we'd rather do it on Biden's watch,\" Trump and Vance wrote. \"If Democrats won't cooperate on the debt ceiling now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration? Let's have this debate now.\" Under legislation passed in June 2023, the debt ceiling was suspended until the first quarter of 2025.",
      "At the U.S. Capitol, Vance did not answer when asked if he and Trump supported a shutdown.",
      "The Office of Management and Budget told federal agencies to start communicating with employees about shutdown procedures starting at 10am tomorrow, sources familiar told CBS News late Wednesday.",
      "Last Friday, the agencies were told to have their shutdown preparations in order and ready to go.",
      "The continuing resolution",
      "When it was unveiled on Tuesday, the spending legislation immediately sparked anger from multiple members of the House Republican conference, mostly targeted at Johnson. While the speaker had pledged to avoid the kind of massive, end-of-year spending bills that conservatives loathe, the final product resembled a scaled-down version of what the party's right flank has railed against for years now.",
      "But the Republicans' slim majority in the House means Johnson would have needed Democratic votes to pass the bill, a dynamic that gave the minority more leverage to extract concessions during negotiations. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hinted at Democrats' influence amid reports that Johnson could scale back the bill, writing in a post on X: \"You break the bipartisan agreement, you own the consequences that follow.\"",
      "\"Republicans have now unilaterally decided to break a bipartisan agreement that they made,\" Jeffries, a New York Democrat, told reporters Wednesday night. \"House Republicans will now own any harm that is visited upon the American people that results from a government shutdown or worse. An agreement is an agreement. It was bipartisan. And there is nothing more to say.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also called on Republicans to \"keep their word.\"",
      "\"Republicans need to stop playing politics with this bipartisan agreement or they will hurt hardworking Americans and create instability across the country,\" she said in statement.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, acknowledged that the bill was intended to be \"very skinny\" before a \"couple of intervening things\" occurred, citing the devastation left by hurricanes earlier this year.",
      "Before the text of the bill was released, Johnson dismissed Republican concerns that the continuing resolution was equivalent to an \"omnibus\" bill, a term used when Congress packages the annual appropriations bills that fund many federal government agencies into one large piece of legislation.",
      "\"This is not an omnibus, OK?\" Johnson said at his weekly news conference on Tuesday. \"This is a small [continuing resolution] that we had to add things to that were out of our control. These are not man-made disasters. These are things that the federal government has an appropriate role to do.\"",
      "Johnson had also vowed to give members 72 hours to read the bill before a vote, but lawmakers said they were expecting a vote as soon as Wednesday, which would give them less than 24 hours to get through the nearly 1,550-page text. The path forward was cast into doubt by Trump's statement, with speculation growing that Johnson could scrap the current version of the bill and bring up a narrower funding extension that includes disaster relief.",
      "Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, on Tuesday called the process \"a total dumpster fire.\" He said he was \"disappointed\" in Johnson and called on him to \"communicate better.\" Other members, like Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, have dubbed the bill the \"Cramnibus.\" Rep. Kat Cammack, a Florida Republican, said the measure was \"a band-aid that is laced with fentanyl.\"",
      "\"There's a certain sandwich that's made of feces, and that's what I would compare this to,\" said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, also of Florida. She argued that pairing disaster relief with the measure puts members in a tough spot. \"This is a s**t sandwich. I don't know how else to say that we're being forced into this position.\"",
      "The fight could prompt a challenge to Johnson's speakership when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, said Wednesday that he won't support Johnson in the speaker's election.",
      "\"I'm not voting for him,\" Massie said. \"This solidifies it.\"",
      "Massie said he's spoken with other members who have a similar stance.",
      "Johnson ran into a buzzsaw of opposition outside the House as well. Elon Musk, the co-head of Trump's advisory Department of Government Efficiency, said in a post on X that any lawmaker \"who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years.\" Musk posted dozens of times throughout the day calling for lawmakers to oppose the bill, which he called \"criminal.\"",
      "The speaker told Fox News earlier in the day that he had discussed the situation with Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the other DOGE co-head, on Tuesday evening. Johnson said he emphasized to them that passing a continuing resolution now would be \"clearing the decks\" and allow the incoming GOP majorities to \"put our fingerprints on the spending\" in March.",
      "Both Musk and Ramaswamy came out strongly against the bill anyway.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 19:58:04 -0500",
    "summary": "The stock market is down sharply today after the Federal Reserve forecast fewer interest rate cuts in 2025 than expected.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. stocks plummeted in one of their worst days of the year after the Federal Reserve forecast Wednesday it may deliver fewer shots of adrenaline  for the economy in 2025 than it had earlier projected.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 178 points, or 3%, pulling it further from its all-time high  set a couple weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1,123 points, or 2.6%, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 3.6%.",
      "The Fed said Wednesday it's cutting its benchmark interest rate for a third time this year, continuing the sharp turnaround begun in September when it started lowering rates  from a two-decade high to support the job market. Wall Street loves lower interest rates, but the Dec. 18 cut had been widely expected by Wall Street.",
      "Why is the stock market down today?",
      "Investors were unsettled by the Fed's forecast for fewer cuts in 2025, even though many economists had already been paring their expectations given sticky inflation.",
      "\"Markets have a really bad of habit of overreacting to Fed policy moves,\" Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said in an analyst note. \"The Fed didn't do or say anything that deviated from what the market expected\u2014this seems more like, I'm leaving for Christmas break, so I'll sell and start up next year.\"",
      "The bigger question centers on how much more the Fed could cut next year. A lot is riding on it, particularly after expectations for a series of cuts in 2025 helped the U.S. stock market set an all-time high 57 times so far in 2024.",
      "Fed officials released projections on Wednesday showing the median expectation among them is for two more cuts to the federal funds rate in 2025, or half a percentage point's worth. That's down from the four cuts they had expected just three months ago.",
      "\"We are in a new phase of the process,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. The central bank has already quickly eased its main interest rate by a full percentage point, to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%, since September.",
      "What happened to the stock market today?",
      "Asked why Fed officials are looking to slow their pace of cuts, Powell pointed to how the job market looks to be performing well overall and how recent inflation readings have picked up. He also cited uncertainties that will require policy makers to react to upcoming, to-be-determined changes in the economy.",
      "While lower rates can goose the economy by making it cheaper to borrow and boosting prices for investments, they can also offer more fuel for inflation.",
      "Powell said some Fed officials, but not all, are also already trying to incorporate uncertainties inherent in a new administration coming into the White House. Worries are rising on Wall Street that President-elect Donald Trump's  preference for tariffs and other policies could further juice inflation, along with economic growth.",
      "\"When the path is uncertain, you go a little slower,\" Powell said. It's \"not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down.\"",
      "One official, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, thought the central bank should not have even cut rates this time around. She was the lone vote against Wednesday's rate cut.",
      "Wall Street's worst performers",
      "The reduced expectations for 2025 rate cuts sent Treasury yields rising in the bond market, squeezing the stock market.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.51% from 4.40% late Tuesday, which is a notable move for the bond market. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, climbed to 4.35% from 4.25%.",
      "On Wall Street, stocks of companies that can feel the most pressure from higher interest rates fell to some of the worst losses.",
      "Stocks of smaller companies did particularly poorly, for example. Many need to borrow to fuel their growth, meaning they can feel more pain when having to pay higher interest rates for loans. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks tumbled 4.4%.",
      "Elsewhere on Wall Street, General Mills dropped 3.1% despite reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. The maker of Progresso soups and Cheerios said it will increase its investments in brands to help them grow, which pushed it to cut its forecast for profit this fiscal year.",
      "Nvidia, the superstar stock  responsible for a chunk of Wall Street's rally to records in recent years, fell 1.1% to extend its weekslong funk. It has dropped more than 13% from its record set last month and fallen in nine of the last 10 days as its big momentum slows.",
      "\"As we wrote in our 2025 outlook a couple of weeks ago, stretched positioning and sentiment left stocks vulnerable to a sell-off,\" Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial said in a note about today's market sell-off. \"The big jump in inflation expectations and related bond sell-off was a convenient excuse. Once support from tech evaporated, no other groups were able to step in to fill that gaping hole.\"",

    "summary": "Here's why NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are stuck, but not stranded, at the International Space Station after launching into space in June.",
    "story": [
      "Two NASA astronauts who flew up to the International Space Station in a Boeing Starliner capsule for a round trip that was supposed to last just over a week will be stuck in space for closer to a year before they can come home. Despite the astronauts' longer-than-expected stay at the space station, officials have insisted that Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore aren't stranded in space.",
      "Here's what we know about the stuck astronauts:",
      "Why are the astronauts stuck in space?",
      "Williams and Wilmore blasted off to the space station in June. Their mission was supposed to take between eight and 10 days, but helium leaks in the capsule's propulsion system and degraded thrusters, which are important for re-entry, upended plans for bringing the astronauts back to Earth.",
      "\"Eight days to eight months or nine months or 10 months, whatever it is, we're going to do the very best job we can do every single day,\" Wilmore told CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann in September. At the time, they were expected to leave the space station in late February 2025.",
      "The capsule safely returned to Earth in September with no one onboard.",
      "Who are the astronauts who are stuck in space?",
      "Williams turned 59 on the space station in September. She joined NASA in 1998 after serving in the Navy for over a decade, retiring as a captain. As a naval aviator, she logged over 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft. At NASA, she had set a record for women with four spacewalks lasting a total of 29 hours, 17 minutes, but it was broken by Peggy Whitson with her fifth spacewalk in 2008.",
      "Wilmore also retired from the Navy as a captain, recording over 8,000 flight hours as a naval aviator. During Operation Desert Storm in Iraq in 1991, Wilmore flew 21 combat missions. He joined NASA in 2000 and accumulated 178 days in space before the Starliner mission. Like Williams, he has also performed four spacewalks, totaling 25 hours, 36 minutes.",
      "Why did the Boeing Starliner crew go to the International Space Station in the first place?",
      "The June launch was the Starliner's first piloted test flight. NASA has funded the development of the capsule and SpaceX's Crew Dragon as the space agency looks to stop using Russian Soyuz flights to transport astronauts to and from the space station.",
      "When will the astronauts be able to return to Earth?",
      "On Tuesday, Dec. 17, NASA announced Williams and Wilmore would return to Earth after the agency's new SpaceX crew arrives at the space station. That won't happen until late March at the earliest so NASA and SpaceX can have more time to finish a new Dragon spacecraft for the mission, NASA said.",
      "Have other astronauts been stuck in the International Space Station before?",
      "NASA astronaut Frank Rubio and two cosmonauts' six-month stay on the space station was unexpectedly extended to a year after their Soyuz ship became disabled. A replacement had to be launched up to the trio so they could return to Earth in 2023.",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday moved to lower its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points, but said it plans fewer cuts in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday\u00a0announced\u00a0its third consecutive interest rate cut of 2024, reducing its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points amid cooling inflation. Yet in a blow for borrowers, the central bank also projected that it will loosen rates less next year than previously expected.",
      "The Fed lowered the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, down from its previous target range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The decision comes after policymakers slashed rates by\u00a00.5 percentage points in September, followed by a\u00a00.25 percentage point drop\u00a0in November.",
      "The Fed has now trimmed rates by 1 percentage point since September, offering relief to Americans carrying credit card balances and other debt.",
      "Fewer rate cuts in 2025",
      "At the same time, the Fed is now penciling in only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the four it had forecast in September when it last issued economic projections. The central bank is now projecting that the federal funds rate may sit at median level of 3.9% by the end of 2025, up from its earlier forecast of 3.4%.",
      "The Fed is also projecting inflation could be higher in 2025, at 2.5%, than it had expected in September, when it forecast that price increases would slow to 2.1% next year.",
      "Wall Street tumbled in Wednesday afternoon trading, with the S&P 500 closing down 178 points, or 2.9%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging 1,123 points, 2.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell even more sharply on the day, sliding 716 points, 3.6%.",
      "\"The market is forward-looking and ignored the good news of today's rate cut and instead focused on the paucity of rate cuts for next year,\" noted Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, in an email. \"[T]he market was underwhelmed by the likely future path of interest rates.\"",
      "Speaking in a Wednesday press conference, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that progress in driving inflation down to the central bank's goal of a 2% annual rate has been slower than expected, with consumer prices in November rising\u00a02.7% on a yearly basis, fueled by elevated housing and food costs.",
      "\"I would say today was a closer call, but we decided it was the right call\" to cut rates, Powell said about Wednesday's rate cut. \"The slower pace of cuts for next year reflects the higher inflation readings we've had this year.\"",
      "The Fed might opt to skip a rate cut in January, while resuming easing at its March meeting, said Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email.",
      "\"While the Fed opted to round out the year with a third consecutive cut, its New Year's resolution appears to be for a more gradual pace of easing,\" Watson said.",
      "New monetary policy phase",
      "The rate cut, which was expected, was the \"least important component\" of today's Fed meeting, noted Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, in an email. Instead, Wall Street was focused on the Fed's forecasts for 2025 and beyond, with the central bank's new forecasts signaling the Fed has entered \"a new phase of monetary policy, the pause phase,\" McIntyre added.",
      "Wednesday's move marks the Fed's final interest rate decision prior to President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. While price increases have cooled from their June 2022 peak, opening the door to Fed rate cuts this year, inflation has remained sticky and well above the Fed's 2% annual target.",
      "Given that inflation has been sticky this year, many analysts have predicted that the Fed was likely to make fewer rate cuts in 2025 amid concerns that could cause the economy to overheat.",
      "Still, the Fed has so far defied forecasters' warnings that its rate hikes could trigger a recession.",
      "The Fed's first rate meeting of 2025 is scheduled for Jan. 28-29, or after Trump's inauguration. About eight in 10 economists expect the Fed to hold rates steady at that meeting, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "Powell's bullish economic outlook",
      "While Powell said that the slow progress in grinding down inflation has been \"a bit frustrating,\" he also sounded an optimistic note about the U.S. economy, stressing that the nation's growth has far outpaced that of other developed economies.",
      "\"It's pretty clear we've avoided a recession \u2014 growth this year has been solid,\" Powell said. \"Again, the U.S. economy has just been remarkable,\" while other countries have contended with slow growth and \"struggles with inflation.\"",
      "He added, \"I expect another good year next year.\"",
      "As far as Trump's stated plans to enact broad-based tariffs, which many economists forecast could prove inflationary, if enacted, Powell said the Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach. The Fed is examining the potential impact from tariffs, but it will be \"quite some time\" until there are policies put into place by the second Trump administration for the central bank to examine, Powell added.",
      "\"We just don't know very much at all about the actual policies \u2014 we don't know how much will be tariffed, from which countries,\" he noted. \"We don't know if there will be retaliatory tariffs.\"",

      "Senators voted 73-27 to approve a motion to proceed with consideration of the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, according to an unofficial Senate tally shown in a\u00a0webcast\u00a0on the floor of the chamber.",
      "\"We will vote on taking up the Social Security Fairness Act to repeal flawed policies that eat away at the benefits of those who've worked as teachers, firefighters, postal workers, or public sector workers,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on social media shortly before the vote. \"Retirees deprived of their hard-earned benefits will be watching closely.\"",
      "The New York Democrat has pushed to bring the measure up for a full vote, which would eliminate two federal policies that prevent million of Americans, including police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension from collecting their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Social Security is a bedrock of our middle class. You pay into it for 40 quarters, you earned it, it should be there when you retire,\" Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who lost his seat in the November election, told the chamber ahead of Wednesday's vote. \"All these workers are asking for is for what they earned.\"",
      "Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican relayed having a retired teacher cry in his office, \"not understanding why she was getting less in Social Security spousal benefits than if she had never worked at all.\"",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis spoke against measure, saying that while a small percentage of people are not getting what they should from Social Security, enacting what he framed as an unfunded government mandate that would increase the federal deficit \"is not the way to fix it.\"",
      "\"This bill will take $200 billion during the 10-year period out of the Social Security trust fund without any way to pay for it,\" the North Carolina Republican added.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that broadly reduce payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "\"This stuff takes time, but 21 years is ridiculous,\" said Brown of the process. The Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The measure, which passed the House in November, had 62 cosponsors when it was introduced in the Senate last year. Yet the bill's bipartisan support eroded some in recent days, with some Republican lawmakers voicing doubts due to its cost. According\u00a0to\u00a0the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "At least one GOP senator who signed onto similar legislation last year, Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana, said he was still \"weighing\" whether to vote for the bill. \"Nothing ever gets paid for, so it's further indebtedness, I don't know,\" Braun said last week, the Associated Press reported.",
      "\"In the end it's going to come down to individual members are going to make their own decisions about where they want to come down on that,\" incoming Republican leader John Thune said at a press conference Tuesday. \"Obviously I am concerned about the long-term solvency of Social Security and that is an issue I think we need to address.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 16:10:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Giant hornets, dubbed \"murder hornets,\" have been eradicated in the U.S., five years after the invasive species was first detected in Washington state.",
    "story": [
      "The Northern giant hornet, more commonly known as the \"murder hornet,\" has been eradicated in the U.S., agriculture officials said Wednesday.",
      "The ominously nicknamed invasive species was confirmed to be in the U.S. in 2019 after officials in Washington state received and verified two reports of the hornet. Efforts quickly began to track and get rid of them.",
      "The 2-inch-long hornet, with a stinger longer than that of a typical wasp, can deliver potent venom, but is largely dangerous to bees and other insects, not humans. Eradication efforts started because of the threat the hornet posed to bees and agriculture across the country.",
      "\"By tackling this threat head-on, we protected not only pollinators and crops, but also the industries, communities, and ecosystems that depend on them,\" Dr. Mark Davidson, deputy administrator at USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said in a news statement.",
      "How \"murder hornets\" were eradicated",
      "State, federal and international government agencies worked together to eradicate \"murder hornets\" in the U.S., the officials said.",
      "To do so, first entomologists had to find the hornets' nests.\u00a0Finding the nests can be a challenge, because the hornets typically build their nests in forested areas, often in an underground cavity, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In some cases, entomologists captured a live hornet, attached a radio tag to it, released it, and tracked the hornet back to its nest. Figuring out how to securely attach a radio tag to a hornet without harming it was a hurdle.",
      "After finding a nest in a tree, a team plugged the nest with foam, wrapped the tree in plastic and vacuumed out the hornets. They also injected carbon dioxide into the tree to kill any remaining hornets.",
      "In 2022, scientists said they were setting about 1,000 hornet traps in Washington. Hornets caught in traps help scientists find the location of nests. The previous year, Washington state officials destroyed a nest, finding nearly 1,500 hornets \"in various stages of development.\"",
      "The public also helped officials track down hornet nests. If not for help from the public, there's a good chance that the hornet could have been around for years to come, Sven Spichiger, Washington State Department of Agriculture pest program manager, said during a news conference Wednesday.",
      "\"All of our nest detections resulted directly or indirectly from public reports,\" Spichiger said in a press release. \"And half of our confirmed detections came from the public.",
      "Could the hornet come back to the U.S.?",
      "While officials in Washington celebrated the eradication of the invasive hornet species, Spichiger acknowledged they could come back to the U.S. He said officials would continue to keep an eye out for the hornet and encouraged members of the community to do the same.",
      "\"They got here once and they could do it again,\" Spichiger said.",
      "CBS News previously reported that it was unclear how the hornets first arrived in the U.S., though invasive species can be \"unwitting hitchhikers\" on things like shipping containers.",
      "Even now, five years after the hornets appeared in the U.S., Spichiger said officials will never know exactly how they got to the country.",
      "What makes \"murder hornets\" unique?",
      "The hornet, an invasive species from Asia, can kill an entire hive of honeybees in as little as 90 minutes, according to agriculture officials.",
      "\"The hornets can enter a 'slaughter phase' where they kill entire hives by decapitating the bees. The hornets then defend the hive as their own, taking the brood to feed their own young,\" according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture. \"They also attack other insects but are not known to destroy entire colonies of those insects.\"",
      "The hornets typically only attack people or pets when threatened, but can sting repeatedly.",
      "The hornet species has a large orange or yellow head and black-and-orange stripes across its body.",
      "They were first detected in North America in British Columbia, Canada ,in August 2019, authorities said, and then were confirmed in Washington state by the end of 2019.",
      "When the species first arrived in the U.S., it was known as the Asian giant hornet. But in July of 2022, the Entomological Society of America adopted \"Northern giant hornet\" as the common name for the species. The organization also adopted the names Southern giant hornet as the name for a closely related species.",
      "\"Common names are an important tool for entomologists to communicate with the public about insects and insect science,\" organization President Jessica Ware said at the time. \"Northern giant hornet is both scientifically accurate and easy to understand, and it avoids evoking fear or discrimination.\"",
      "While the U.S. appears to have gotten rid of them, at least for now, scientists in Spain last month reported sightings of the hornet species in Europe. They described two sightings of the hornet in the journal Ecology and Evolution.",

    "summary": "TP-Link routers could be banned in the U.S. over national security concerns, according to a report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. is considering banning the sale of TP-Link internet routers, which are made in China, over concerns the home devices pose a security risk, the Wall Street Journal reported.",
      "Authorities may ban the popular routers, which were linked to Chinese cyberattacks, as early as next year when President-elect Donald Trump takes office, according to the report.",
      "Trump has signaled that he is prepared to take a tough stance on China in his second term in office, including by introducing\u00a0levies of as much as 60%\u00a0on Chinese-made goods.",
      "TP-Link says its routers do not account for a majority of the internet router devices in U.S. homes and small businesses. The routers are available for purchase on Amazon.com, where they are a best-seller. Amazon did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on the potential ban.",
      "The company's connectivity products are used by the U.S. Defense Department and other federal government agencies, too, \u00a0according to the WSJ.",
      "For its part, TP-Link told CBS MoneyWatch that the company's \"security practices are fully in line with industry security standards in the U.S.\"",
      "\"We implement rigorous secure product development and testing processes, and take timely and appropriate action to mitigate known vulnerabilities,\" a TP-Link spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Many consumer brands targeted by Chinese hackers",
      "The company added that many consumer electronics brands are targeted by China-based hacking groups and that it welcomes \"opportunities to engage with the federal government to demonstrate that our security practices are fully in line with industry security standards, and to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to the American market, American consumers and addressing U.S. national security risks.\"",
      "The Justice Department is investigating whether the routers' relatively low price violates a law stipulating that companies can't sell goods for less than the cost of production, the WSJ reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. On Amazon.com, a handful of router models by T-Link are available for sale with a base model costing around $99. The routers are available for sale through a business unit in California as well.",
      "In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, TP-Link said that while it does undercut competitor prices, it does not sell any products below cost.",
      "Compromised routers",
      "In October, Microsoft published an analysis which found that a Chinese hacking entity had access to a trove of compromised TP-Link routers.",
      "\"CovertNetwork-1658 specifically refers to a collection of egress IPs that may be used by one or more Chinese threat actors and is wholly comprised of compromised devices. Microsoft assesses that a threat actor located in China established and maintains this network. The threat actor exploits a vulnerability in the routers to gain remote code execution capability,\" the report explains.",
      "TP-Link said that it takes \"appropriate action to mitigate any vulnerabilities\" the company becomes aware of. It has also signed the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, Secure-by-Design pledge.",

    "title": "As climate change threatens Christmas trees, growers try to evolve",
    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 16:00:45 -0500",
    "summary": "The effects of climate change have put stress on Christmas tree production in the United States. Some farmers are turning to genetics to adapt.",
    "story": [
      "People around the world are adorning homes and businesses with festive holiday decor, which typically means an abundance of Christmas trees are on display. In the U.S., they pop up everywhere from the average living room to the Rockefeller Center plaza in Manhattan and the White House in Washington, D.C.",
      "But climate change threatens to complicate the tradition. Christmas trees, like any other crop, are affected by the general rise in temperature associated with global warming and the extreme weather events that result from it.",
      "\"The Earth's climate is changing to a warmer one. And like most of society and the environment, Christmas trees are not adapting fast enough to these changes,\" according to the National Centers for Environmental Information website.",
      "Higher temperatures have led to warmer winters and longer growing seasons, which contribute to the prevalence of pests and disease that damage the trees usually decorated for Christmas. Heavier rain and oversaturated soil also put the trees at risk of contracting a notorious type of fungus-like organism that attacks them at the root, weakening and killing them quickly.",
      "Extreme heat and prolonged drought make Christmas trees more vulnerable to those problems and a host of others, including browning needles and stunted development. Unusual heat alone can cause trees to die prematurely.",
      "In Oregon, where more than a third of country's Christmas trees are grown, researchers at Oregon State University reported that record heat in the summer of 2021 destroyed roughly 70% of the Christmas tree seedlings planted that year and dried out the needles of more mature crops. Fewer viable trees could mean higher prices for consumers, although experts have largely attributed the steadily rising cost of Christmas trees in recent decades to a supply shortage that dates back to the 2008 recession, in addition to losses from extreme weather.",
      "Extreme cold can be equally destructive for these trees, which are susceptible to frost damage, as can extreme rainfall. In North Carolina, the second-highest producer of Christmas trees in the U.S. after Oregon, farmers contended with the impacts of Hurricane Helene in September.",
      "Justin Whitehill, an assistant professor at North Carolina State University who leads the school's Christmas tree genetics program, told CBS News that Helene's landslides posed a particular threat to Christmas trees grown on the sides of mountains and completely wiped out a handful of\u00a0smaller growing operations, likely costing the industry at least tens of millions.",
      "Estimates from North Carolina State suggest upwards of 40,000 acres of land are dedicated to Christmas tree production statewide, with 5 or 6 million trees harvested annually for a collective retail value of $250 million or more. Whitehill believes the industry remains strong overall because it has been forced to evolve and adapt with climate change.",
      "\"Climate change has been happening and kind of creeping up for decades now. And so the industry has been evolving alongside of it,\" he said.",
      "The genetics program at North Carolina State is an example of that. Researchers are studying the natural defense mechanisms of Christmas trees \u2014 focusing on a popular variation called Fraser firs \u2014 in hopes of using genetics and molecular biology to help the trees acclimate to climate change and increase their chances of survival.",
      "\"With our breeding work in the genetics program, we're trying to identify trees that have a little bit more resilience to some of these changing climates,\" said Whitehill. Along with determining how genetics can potentially help Christmas trees withstand warmer temperatures, he said his team is also working on strategies to protect the trees from pests.",
      "Rising temperatures are a major concern for Christmas tree growers. Even if their crops survive pests and disease, Whitehill told CBS News that cosmetics are an issue, too.",
      "\"The big thing, I think, with climate change and Christmas trees is going to be the needle loss and needle retention,\" he said. Warmer conditions can cause Christmas trees to shed their needles too early, making them less appealing to people looking to purchase one for the holidays.",
      "Conifers, the cone-bearing and mostly evergreen plant species often marketed as Christmas trees for their classic looks, need to adjust to near-freezing temperatures for several weeks to enter their \"dormant\" stage before being harvested. Not only are people generally buying Christmas trees\u00a0earlier in the year, milder fall weather gives the crops less time to reach this stage, where they effectively enter a deep sleep and are alive but no longer growing, or growing very minimally.",
      "The transition into dormancy means different things for different trees as they slow down to prepare for winter. Some shed their leaves completely, but Christmas trees instead use this time to absorb water and nutrients from their needles to conserve energy. A Christmas tree may shed its needles soon after being cut down if it is harvested in the midst of this active transition.",
      "\"We're basically stressing the trees out to the extreme,\" Whitehill said. \"They're being kind of killed in a way.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday granted California its request to enforce vehicle emissions standards stricter than federal rules, including the state's ban on sales of new gasoline-powered cars.",
      "The EPA granted two waivers to the California Air Resources Board to allow full implementation of its regulation requiring all new car sales to be zero-emission by 2035 and a second rule lowering emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks and off-road vehicles.",
      "The stricter rules would also set interim quotas for zero-emission vehicles. Starting with 2026 models, 35% of new cars, SUVs and small pickups sold in California would be required to be zero-emission vehicles, with quotas increasing each year until 2035.",
      "The quotas would allow 20% of zero-emission cars sold to be plug-in hybrids. The rules would not affect used vehicles, allowing gas-powered car and trucks to remain on the roads.",
      "Other states that have followed California's lead on stricter emissions rules are weighing whether or not to also adopt the ban on gas cars.",
      "Trump administration seeks to block California rules",
      "California's strict emission rules will likely see an immediate challenge from the incoming administration. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bar the state from setting its own rules on emissions, which his first administration did in 2019 by revoking the state's EPA waiver. The move prompted California and 22 other states to sue the administration, a lawsuit that became moot when President Joe Biden took office and reversed the Trump administration policy.",
      "\"Clean cars are here to stay. The Biden-Harris Administration reaffirmed what we've known for decades -- California can rise to the challenge of protecting our people by cleaning our air and cutting pollution,\" said California Gov. Gavin Newsom in a prepared statement. \"Naysayers like President-elect Trump would prefer to side with the oil industry over consumers and American automakers, but California will continue fostering new innovations in the market.\"",
      "Last month, Newsom announced the state would renew a rebate program for electric vehicles if the incoming Trump administration follows through on its threat to eliminate the federal tax credit of $7,500.",
      "Efforts by the incoming administration to block California's emissions standards will likely prompt a series of legal challenges that could delay any action.",
      "Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a narrow case on whether the oil and gas industry has the standing to sue California over its tailpipe emission standards.",
      "California's battle to cut pollution levels",
      "In granting California the waiver requests, the EPA said its review found that opponents did not meet the burden to show how either program is inconsistent with the federal Clean Air Act.",
      "\"California has longstanding authority to request waivers from EPA to protect its residents from dangerous air pollution coming from mobile sources like cars and trucks,\" said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan in a statement. \"Today's actions follow through on EPA's commitment to partner with states to reduce emissions and act on the threat of climate change.\"",
      "California established the country's first tailpipe emissions standards in 1966 and is the only state eligible for a waiver to the federal Clean Air Act of 1970, giving the EPA the authority to regulate pollution nationwide. The Clean Air Act also allows other states to adopt California's standards. Since the Clean Air Act was established, the EPA has granted California more than 75 waivers for its vehicle emissions program.",
      "Major automakers such as BMW, Ford, Honda, Stellantis and Volkswagen have adopted California's current emission rules. Newsom said in a press release Wednesday that millions of Californians and other Americans have already switched to clean vehicles and more than two million zero-emission vehicles have been sold in the state.",
      "Industry group Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which has consistently spoken out against California's stricter emission rules, said Wednesday it expects President-elect Trump to revoke the waiver in 2025.",
      "\"We've said the country should have a single, national standard to reduce carbon in transportation, but the question about the general authority of California to establish a vehicle emissions program \u2013 and for other states to\u00a0follow\u00a0that program \u2013 is ultimately something for policymakers and the courts to sort out,\" the group said in a press release.",
      "Environmental groups hail EPA decision on California emissions",
      "The advocacy group Earthjustice said the EPA's decision would mean cars in the state would largely be zero-emission by the 2050s and the rule on heavy-duty truck emissions would \"deliver critical health benefits to people affected by the worst polluters on the roads: large diesel trucks.\"",
      "\"This might read like checking a bureaucratic box, but EPA's approval is a critical step forward in protecting our lungs from pollution and our wallets from the expenses of combustion fuels,\" said Earthjustice director of Right To Zero campaign Part Cort in a press release. \"The gradual shift in car sales to zero-emissions models will cut smog and household costs while growing California's clean energy workforce. Cutting truck pollution will help clear our skies of smog.\"",
      "The National Resources Defense Council said in a press release that Congress has long recognized the state's ability to set stronger emissions standards which has help California spur innovation and save lives.",
      "\"These waivers allow California - and states that chose to align with it - to curb the pollution spewing from tailpipes and address the impacts of the climate crisis,\" said NRDC director of clean vehicles Kathy Harris. \"California decided that transitioning to cleaner and zero-emission vehicles is the best way to address the unique burdens it faces. This is exactly how our system of federalism should work. If other states don't like California's approach, they don't need to follow it.

      "According to the latest data, there are over 850,000 TPS holders, as of March 2024. Around 350,000 Venezuelans, 200,000 Haitians and 180,000 Salvadorans make up the largest group of beneficiaries.",
      "Approximately 300,000 TPS holders reside in Florida, while Texas has nearly 95,000, and New York and California each have around 68,000.",
      "TPS holders are provided renewable relief for up to six, 12 or 18 months, but without an extension, many will begin losing their legal status in 2025. Protections for Salvadorans are set to expire first in March, with Venezuela, Ukraine and Sudan in April, and Nicraragua in July.",
      "\"It is very important that anybody who is under Temporary Protection Status sits down with an attorney to evaluate every possible avenue to obtain a permanent status, or to change status, and figure it out,\" said Haim Vasquez, an immigration lawyer in Dallas, Texas. \"If there's anything that can be done, they must do it sooner than later.\"",
      "Since Trump won the election, Vasquez says he has been taking questions at the Salvadoran consulate in Dallas from TPS holders who will be among the first to see their status expire in March.",
      "Extensions, known as designations, for TPS are announced two months before the expiration date, Vasquez said. In this case, Biden would have to issue a new designation for Salvadorans by Jan. 9.",
      "As for how much time immigrants would have in the country before they face deportation if Trump were to fulfill his promises and revoke TPS, Vasquez says it depends on how Trump terminates the program. He could allow the status to run through expiration dates previously set; any revocation is sure to be met with lawsuits.",
      "\"A hundred percent, we expect that there will be legal challenges,\" Vasquez said.",
      "During his first administration, Trump tried to terminate TPS for beneficiaries from six countries, including Haiti, Honduras, El Salvador, Nepal, Nicaragua and Sudan. Trump's attempts, however, were immediately met with legal challenges, and a judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the TPS terminations.",
      "With critical deadlines looming, on Dec. 9, a group of senators sent a letter to Mr. Biden urging him to protect long-settled immigrants before Trump's inauguration with key action steps.",
      "Sens. Dick Durbin, Cory Booker, Catherine Cortez Masto, Tammy Duckworth, Mazie Hirono, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n and Alex Padilla asked the president to redesignate and extend TPS for all eligible countries. The senators stressed that \"worsening crises across the world,\" including in Ukraine and Nicaragua, underscore the need for continuing the protected status.",
      "Currently, the U.S. has conferred the status on nationals of El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, Nepa, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Venezuela, Burma, Cameroon, Ethiopia and Ukraine.",
      "Soledad Miranda, a Salvadoran TPS holder, also joined the hunger strike in Washington, D.C., urging Mr. Biden to issue an extension before he leaves office. She fears deportation and being separated from her U.S.-born daughter.",
      "\"Biden is leaving the White House, and we want him to do what he didn't do in four years.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 14:26:37 -0500",
    "summary": "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson says he's optimistic the Trump administration will support the space agency's agenda.",
    "story": [
      "Outgoing NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Wednesday he is optimistic SpaceX founder Elon Musk's relationship with President-Elect Donald Trump will help ensure NASA receives the funding needed to support a robust agenda, including returning U.S. astronauts to the moon.",
      "Trump has nominated billionaire Jared Isaacman, veteran of two SpaceX Crew Dragon flights to low-Earth orbit, to serve as NASA's next administrator, prompting speculation Musk's connections to both men might give him even more influence over NASA space policy than he currently wields.",
      "\"On the one hand, I am optimistic because of the relationship that Musk has with Trump that NASA will get the funding that it needs because Musk will be advocating,\" Nelson said in an interview with CBS News. \"On the other hand, if Musk were to want to cut out other companies in the competition for rockets, that would not be a good thing. And I think Musk is smarter than that.\"",
      "SpaceX already delivers cargo to the International Space Station with its unpiloted Dragon capsules and ferries astronauts to and from the outpost aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft.",
      "Critical to the Artemis moon program, SpaceX also is building a variant of its Starship rocket to carry astronauts back to the lunar surface in 2027. It will be NASA's first such landing since the final Apollo mission in 1972.",
      "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' company, Blue Origin, also is building a moon lander for NASA, giving the agency alternatives in case one company's spacecraft is grounded for some reason.",
      "But in the near term, SpaceX is \"the horse that we're going to ride, and we're expecting that horse to be able to run and run fast,\" Nelson said. \"And if not, we've got another horse and it's called Blue Origin.\"",
      "At Nelson insistence shortly after taking office, NASA held a second competition for a second lunar lander \"based on the principle that you want to have two spacecraft in case something happens to one of them,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"If ever there's been a demonstration of the wisdom of having two competitors, it was for the cargo and crew to the space station.\"",
      "NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing to build commercial crew ferry ships in the wake of the space shuttle's retirement in 2011.",
      "While SpaceX has successfully launched 10 sets of astronauts and cosmonauts to the station aboard Crew Dragon capsules, along with five purely commercial flights to orbit, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has carried just two crew members to the lab.",
      "Commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams took off on Boeing's first piloted Starliner test flight June 5. The mission was expected to last eight to 10 days, but thruster problems and propellant leaks combined to extend the crew's stay aboard the ISS while engineers carried out extensive testing.",
      "In the end, NASA decided to bring the Starliner down without its crew, switching Wilmore and Williams to a Crew Dragon and delaying their return to Earth until mid February. On Tuesday, NASA announced launch of the next Crew Dragon, carrying a replacement ISS crew, is slipping to at least the end of March.",
      "That means Wilmore and Williams will log an additional month and a half in orbit before finally coming home after 10 months in space. Asked if he had any words of encouragement for the Starliner astronauts, Nelson said simply \"they are true professionals, as are all of our astronauts, and they meet whatever is the need of NASA.\"",
      "Future of NASA's Artemis moon program",
      "The Isaacman nomination has prompted speculation in some quarters that NASA's Artemis moon program, relying on the agency's costly Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, could face major changes, including a possible switch from the SLS to SpaceX's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Nelson said a different rocket might be used in the 2030s, but the SLS is the only choice available for moon flights through the end of the current decade.",
      "\"Understand, that there is currently one human-rated rocket that has been to the moon and back, and that is SLS,\" Nelson said.",
      "NASA launched the first SLS on the program's maiden flight in 2021, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back. The second SLS is being prepared for launch in the April 2026 timeframe to send four astronauts on a similar out-and-back-again trip around the moon.",
      "After that, the Artemis 3 mission is tentatively targeted for launch in 2027. In that flight, an SLS will boost astronauts to the moon in an Orion capsule that will dock with SpaceX's lander in lunar orbit. From there, two astronauts will descend to touchdown near the moon's south pole where ice deposits may await discovery.",
      "\"Right now, when you add up all of that, you're talking about a number of years down the road, you're talking about Artemis 3 landing in mid '27 and then the others to follow,\" Nelson said. \"This is fiscal year '25, we're talking at least into fiscal year 3031.",
      "\"So by that time, is there going to be another rocket that's going to supersede (SLS)? I do not know the answer to that. But I know that the SLS and the Artemis program are certainly going to be there for the near future.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate approved the mammoth $895 billion National Defense Authorization Act on Wednesday, despite concern from some Democrats over a controversial policy restricting gender-affirming care for children of servicemembers.",
      "In a 85 to 14 vote, the Senate approved the legislation, which the House passed last week. Eleven Democrats and three Republicans voted against it in the upper chamber. The bill now heads to President Biden's desk for his signature.",
      "The 1,800 page national security legislation to authorize funding for the Defense Department for fiscal year 2025. But the bill includes a handful of controversial policies, like the gender-affirming care restriction, and lost support from the majority of Democrats in the House.",
      "The Democratic-controlled Senate pushed forward with the measure nonetheless. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer noted that while the NDAA \"isn't perfect,\" it still \"includes some very good things that Democrats fought for\" \u2014 citing provisions aimed at standing up against the Chinese Communist Party, boosting the use of artificial intelligence for national defense and expanding domestic tech innovation.",
      "\"Congress has passed the NDAA on a bipartisan basis for over six straight decades, and this year will be no different,\" Schumer said ahead of the vote on Wednesday. \"We're passing the NDAA and that's a very good thing.\"",
      "Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, derided the gender-affirming care restriction earlier this week, calling it \"the product of a nationwide campaign against trans rights\" and arguing that the legislation's approval would mark \"the first anti-LGBTQ law passed by Congress in decades.\"",
      "Still, the outcome of the vote was all but guaranteed after the Senate advanced the measure on Monday in a 83-12 procedural vote.",
      "Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, celebrated the NDAA's \"immense accomplishments,\" including a 14.5% pay raise for junior service members and investments in recruitment capabilities. But he said Congress \"missed an opportunity to strengthen the president-elect's hand as he takes office in a precarious world situation.\"",
      "Wicker outlined that the Armed Services Committee proposed $25 billion for modernization programs, including for missile defense, ship building and counter-drone technology, saying \"this should have been part of the bill today.\"",
      "Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who chairs the Armed Services Committee, called the legislation a \"strong, forward looking bill that we can all be proud of.\" But he said he \"strongly\" disagrees with the inclusion of the gender-affirming care provision, calling it a \"misguided provision.\"",
      "\"I share many of my colleagues' frustrations that the bill includes a provision that would prohibit gender-affirming health care for minors under certain circumstances,\" Reed noted, adding that he voted against the provision in committee. \"We will continue to work to ensure the health care rights of all military personnel and their dependents.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to consider the South Carolina health department's effort to cut off funding from Planned Parenthood because it performs abortions, wading into another dispute over access to the procedure in the wake of its reversal of Roe v. Wade.",
      "The case, known as Kerr v. Edwards, stems from the state's decision in 2018 to end Planned Parenthood South Atlantic's participation in its Medicaid program. Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, directed the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services to deem abortion clinics unqualified to provide family planning services and end their Medicaid agreements.",
      "Planned Parenthood operates two facilities in the state, one in Charleston and the other in Columbia, and provides hundreds of Medicaid patients with services like physicals, cancer and other health screenings, pregnancy testing and contraception. Federal law prohibits Medicaid from paying for abortions except in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother.",
      "Planned Parenthood and one of its patients, Julie Edwards, sued the state, arguing that cutting off its funding violated a provision of the Medicaid Act that gives beneficiaries the right to choose their provider.",
      "A federal district court blocked South Carolina from ending Planned Parenthood's participation in its Medicaid program, and a U.S. appeals court upheld that decision, finding that Edwards could sue the state to enforce the Medicaid Act's free-choice-of-provider requirement.",
      "The legal battle has already been before the Supreme Court in the past, with the high court last year ordering additional proceedings after deciding in a separate case that nursing home residents could sue their state-owned health care facility over alleged violations of civil rights.",
      "After reconsidering its earlier decision, the three-judge appeals court panel ruled unanimously in March that Edwards' lawsuit against the state could go forward and said South Carolina couldn't strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funds.",
      "\"This case is, and always has been, about whether Congress conferred an individually enforceable right for Medicaid beneficiaries to freely choose their healthcare provider. Preserving access to Planned Parenthood and other providers means preserving an affordable choice and quality care for an untold number of mothers and infants in South Carolina,\" Judge Harvie Wilkinson wrote for the panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.",
      "South Carolina officials asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, marking the third time the case has been before the justices. The justices agreed to take up the question of whether \"the Medicaid Act's any-qualified provider provision unambiguously confers a private right upon a Medicaid beneficiary to choose a specific provider.\"",
      "South Carolina is among the more than two dozen that have passed laws restricting access to abortion in the wake of the Supreme Court's June 2022 decision reversing Roe v. Wade. In South Carolina, abortion is outlawed after six weeks of pregnancy with some exceptions.",
      "Several states have also enacted laws blocking Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funding, including Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi and Texas.",

    "story": [
      "A judge in France on Thursday found the former husband of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who\u00a0admitted\u00a0to drugging and raping her repeatedly over the course of almost a decade and inviting dozens of other men to assault her as well, guilty of aggravated rape. He was given the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.",
      "Over the course of the trial, Pelicot \u2014 who insisted that her full name be published and the court\u00a0proceedings be made public \u2014 has been praised for her courage and become a symbol of the fight against sexual violence in France and around the world.",
      "\"I want to express my gratitude, very profound, to all the people who supported me during this difficult time. Your witness, your statements, have really moved me and they have given me the strength to come back every day for these long days of the trial,\" Pelicot told journalists outside the court Thursday.",
      "\"I wanted to open the doors of this trial last September so that society could see what was happening. I'll never regret this decision. I have confidence in our capacity, collectively, to find a better future, in which men and women alike can live harmlessly together with mutual respect,\" she said.",
      "Roger Arata, the lead judge at the court in Avignon, southeast France, also read out the verdicts for 49 other men who were accused of raping Pelicot alongside her ex-husband, at his invitation, and one other accused of aggravated sexual assault. All the men were found guilty, but one had his conviction reduced from rape to sexual assault. They were all given sentences of between three and 15 years, and two of the sentences were suspended.",
      "\"The children are disappointed by these low sentences,\" one of Pelicot's family members, who asked not to be named, told the French news agency AFP.",
      "Pelicot was greeted as she arrived at the court Thursday by crowds holding signs with slogans such as: \"Thank you for your courage.\" She and her daughters sat in the courtroom as the verdicts were read out, resting their heads against a wall, CBS News partner network BBC News reported.",
      "The trial began on Sept. 2 and, almost every day, Pelicot came face to face with her former husband, Dominique, or one of the 50 other men charged with assaulting her. She insisted that videos submitted as evidence, made by her ex-husband and showing men assaulting her while she appeared unconscious, be shown in the court.",
      "Dominique Pelicot was also found guilty of the attempted aggravated rape of a woman named Cillia, the wife of another man, Jean Pierre Marechal, who was one of the co-accused, as well as taking indecent images of his daughter, Caroline, and his daughters-in-law, Celine and Aurore, BBC News reported. Sitting in court, he showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out, according to the BBC. After the verdict and sentencing, his lawyer said he would have ten days to make an appeal, which he was considering.",
      "The assaults took place between 2011 and 2020, when Dominique Pelicot was taken into custody. Police found thousands of photos and videos of the abuse on his computer drives, which helped lead them to other suspects. Some of the men said in court that they believed the unconscious woman was okay with it, or that her husband's permission was sufficient.",
      "\"It's not for us to feel shame \u2014 it's for them,\" Pelicot declared during the trial, referring to the attackers. \"Above all, I'm expressing my will and determination to change this society.\"",
      "Pelicot continued attending the hearings throughout the trial, in part, because she \"felt she was somehow representing the victims of these kinds of abuses,\" her lawyer, St\u00e9phane Babonneau, said ahead of the verdicts being delivered on Thursday. \"There are very many victims that are going to trial, facing their aggressors without having anyone outside, lining up for them, offering flowers. So she felt that she needed to continue to keep focus, because she didn't elect to, but she felt that she was somehow representing the victims, and she felt responsible for that.\"",
      "Controversial French laws",
      "Pelicot's case triggered protests across France, and there was hope among some demonstrators that the case could lead to changes in controversial French laws governing sexual consent.",
      "France introduced a legal age of sexual consent in 2021 after a public outcry over the rape of an 11-year-old schoolgirl by a man who was initially convicted on a lesser charge. Since then, sex with anyone under the age of 15 has been viewed as non-consensual, but French law does not refer to consent in cases involving older victims.",
      "Under French law, rape is defined as penetration or oral sex using \"violence, coercion, threat or surprise,\" without taking consent into account, according to the Reuters news agency. Prosecutors must, therefore, prove an intention to rape if they are to be successful in court, legal experts told Reuters.",
      "Just 14% of rape accusations in France lead to formal investigations, according to a study by the Institute of Public Policies.",
      "\"Why don't we manage to obtain convictions? The first reason is the law,\" French legal expert Catherine Le Magueresse told Reuters. \"The law is written in such a way that victims must comply with the stereotype of a 'good victim' and a 'true rape': an unknown attacker, use of violence, and the victim's resistance. But it is only true for a minority of rapes.\"",
      "\"I'm trying to understand\"",
      "Speaking in court during the trial, Pelicot, who is 72, talked about how she had thought she was in a loving marriage with her husband and would never have guessed what was happening.",
      "\"We would have a glass of white wine together. I never found anything strange about my potatoes,\" Pelicot told the court. \"We finished eating. Often when it's a football match on TV, I'd let him watch it alone. He brought my ice cream to my bed, where I was. My favorite flavor - raspberry - and I thought: 'How lucky I am. He's a love.'\"",
      "She said she didn't have any sensation of being drugged.",
      "\"I never felt my heart flutter. I didn't feel anything. I must have gone under very quickly. I would wake up with my pajamas on,\" Pelicot told the court, adding that she would sometimes wake up \"more tired than usual, but I walk a lot and thought it was that",
      "\"I'm trying to understand,\" she said, \"how this husband, who was the perfect man, could have got to this.\"",
      "\"Nothing will give her back the 15 years that she has lost, the 10 years that she was living without knowing what was happening to her,\" Pelicot's attorney, St\u00e9phane Babonneau, said ahead of the verdicts on Thursday. \"All she can expect now is for justice to be served, and then, well, who could find comfort in someone going to prison for 10, 15 years, seeing another family destroyed. No one - and, in fact - definitely not her.\"",

      "For years, neighboring countries accused Assad's Syria of being the world's main supplier of the illegal drug. In March 2023, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned several Syrians for their alleged involvement in the \"dangerous amphetamine\", including two of Assad's cousins.",

      "Moscow\u00a0\u2014 Former Royal Ballet star Sergei Polunin, famous for his tattoos of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday announced that he plans to leave Russia. The Ukrainian-Russian dancer was one of the most prominent stars who backed Russia's unilateral 2014 annexation of Crimea and its military assault on Ukraine. He was rewarded with prestigious state posts.",
      "In a rambling, misspelled message on his Instagram account, Polunin wrote: \"My time in Russia ran out a long time ago, it seems at this moment that I have fulfilled my mission here.\"",
      "The post first appeared Sunday on his little-read Telegram account.",
      "Polunin, 35, did not give a specific reason for leaving, but said: \"Thank you for everything that Russia has done for me. The time comes and the soul feels that it's not where it should be.\"",
      "He said he was leaving with his family \u2014 his wife Yelena and three children \u2014 but \"where we will go is not clear so far.\"",
      "In the summer, the dancer complained of a lack of security and said he was being followed.",
      "Polunin, who was born in Ukraine, backed Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea\u00a0 \u2014 a prelude to the ongoing, full-scale invasion of Ukraine that Putin launched in February 2022.",
      "The dancer was granted Russian citizenship in 2019. He was appointed acting head of a dance academy in occupied Crimea's biggest city, Sevastopol, and director of the city's opera and ballet theatre, for which a large new building is under construction.",
      "Just last year he was decorated by Putin for his role in popularizing dance. But in August he was replaced as head of the dance academy by former Bolshoi prima Maria Alexandrova, and a week ago, Russia's arts minister Olga Lyubimova announced his theater director job would go to singer Ildar Abdrazakov.",
      "This came after, on December 9, Polunin published a social media post saying he was \"very sorry for people\" living in the heavily bombarded village near Ukraine's city of Kherson, \"where a generation of Polunins grew up and my Russian grandfather built a small house with his own hands.\"",
      "He urged Putin to negotiate to end the war in Ukraine, saying even \"the worst deal would be better than war.\"",
      "\"I am hoping for Humanity of the president of Russia and if there is a possibility to have a normal professional conversation with Trump,\" Polunin wrote at the time. \"It is better to show willpower and good nature yourself and start negotiations.\"",
      "Aged 13, Polunin won a scholarship to train at the Royal Ballet School in London and became its youngest ever principal dancer.",
      "With his tattoos \u2014 including a large depiction of Putin's face emblazoned prominently on his chest \u2014 and his rebellious attitude, he became known as the \"bad boy of ballet\" and caused a sensation by resigning from the Royal Ballet at the height of his fame in 2012.",
      "Later he made a 2015 hit video to Irish musician Hozier's song \"Take Me to Church\" and was the star of a 2016 documentary called \"Dancer.\"",
      "He moved to perform at Moscow's Stanislavsky Musical Theatre's ballet before launching a solo career, starring in dance performances in roles including the mystic Grigory Rasputin.",

    "story": [
      "China is continuing its nuclear expansion, is strengthening its ties with Russia, and has increased military pressure against Taiwan over the past year, according to a new Defense Department report that examines actions accelerating key areas of conflict with the U.S.",
      "The report, released Wednesday, also noted that the recent rash of corruption allegations within China's powerful Central Military Commission, which oversees the People's Liberation Army, is hurting Beijing's military growth and could slow its modernization campaign.",
      "A senior defense official said China has made progress in some of its programs but slid back in others.",
      "The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the U.S. assessment, warned that Beijing is working toward developing a more diverse and technologically sophisticated nuclear force. While the expected number of nuclear warheads has maintained consistent growth, China is broadening its targeting abilities.",
      "Beijing is going to be able to go after more and different types of targets, do greater damage and have more options for multiple rounds of counterstrikes, the official said. The U.S. is urging China to be more transparent about its nuclear program, while also warning that America will defend its allies and take appropriate steps in response.",
      "According to the report, which provides the annual U.S. assessment of China's military power and is required by Congress, By mid-2024, China had over 600 operational nuclear warheads, and the Pentagon expects it will have more than 1,000 by 2030. The Pentagon's estimate of China's current stock of nuclear warheads is about 100 higher than disclosed in last year's report, but that is a reflection in the change in the estimate, not the pace of production.",
      "The Biden administration has worked to maintain a balance with China, building up the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region to be ready to counter Beijing while also encouraging increased communications between the two countries at the diplomatic and military levels.",
      "That uptick in talks has coincided with a decrease in coercive and risky intercepts of U.S. aircraft since late 2023, compared with the previous two years. China still, however, does what the U.S. military considers \"unsafe\" flights near American and allied forces in the region.",
      "The Pentagon's national defense strategy is built around the assessment that China poses the greatest security challenge for the U.S., and the threat from Beijing influences how the U.S. military is equipped and organized for the future.",
      "Corruption within the PLA has resulted in the ouster of at least 15 high-ranking officials in a major shakeup of China's defense establishment.",
      "\"This wave of corruption touches every service in the PLA, and it may have shaken Beijing's confidence,\" the report said.",
      "In June, China announced that former Defense Minister Li Shangfu and his predecessor, Wei Fenghe, were expelled from the ruling Communist Party and accused of corruption. Last month, another senior official, Miao Hua, was suspended and put under investigation, according to China's Defense Ministry.",
      "The U.S. report points to a persistent increased military presence by China around Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own. It said China's navy has been in the region more and that there have been increased crossings into the island's air defense identification zone and major military exercises in the area.",
      "Just last week, a large deployment of Chinese navy and coast guard vessels in the waters around Taiwan triggered alarm as Taiwanese officials said it looked like China was simulating a blockade. Officials have said there were as many as 90 ships involved in what Taiwan described as two walls designed to demonstrate that the waters belong to China.",
      "Taiwan split from communist China in 1949 and has rejected Beijing's demands that it accept unification. China says it will do so by force if necessary, and leaders have said they want to be ready to do so by 2027.",
      "The United States is obligated under domestic law to help defend Taiwan and give it weapons and technology to deter invasion.",
      "The island democracy has been the chief source of tension between Washington and Beijing for decades and is widely seen as the most likely trigger for a potentially catastrophic U.S.-China war.",
      "More broadly, the report concluded that the PLA continued its drive to develop greater military capabilities but \"made uneven progress toward its 2027\" milestone for modernization.",
      "One area of expansion, the report said, is with unmanned aerial systems, which officials said are \"quickly approaching U.S. standards.\"",

    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have discovered an inscribed silver amulet that one theologian now says may rewrite the history of Christianity north of the Alps mountain range.",
      "The inscribed amulet was found buried in a grave in Frankfurt, Germany in 2018,\u00a0according to a news release from the city. The amulet is just over an inch in size, the city said, with an inscribed thin silver foil rolled up inside. It took years to determine what the inscription said: It had to be deciphered by a computer scan because the foil was too fragile to unroll. The so-called \"Frankfurt Silver Inscription\" was presented to the public earlier in December.",
      "The inscription was determined to be a statement of faith in Jesus Christ, written in Latin. The statement shows that the wearer \"was clearly a devout Christian, which is absolutely unusual for this time,\" the city said.",
      "Researchers dated the grave where the amulet was found to between 230 and 270 AD. This is the earliest evidence of Christianity north of the Alps, the city said: All other finds are several decades younger, with \"reliable evidence\" of the religion in the region dating back to the 4th century.",
      "The inscription mentions no religion besides Christianity, which researchers said is unusual. Up until the 5th century, these kind of amulets \"always contain a mixture of different faiths,\" such as Judaism or paganism. Instead, it is entirely based on Christianity. At one point the invocation \"Holy, holy, holy!\" is present. Researchers previously had dated that invocation no earlier than the 4th century. The amulet also included quotations from the Bible used by Christians at that time.",
      "\"The 'Frankfurt Inscription' is a scientific sensation,\" city mayor Mike Josef said in a translated statement. \"It will force us to turn back the history of Christianity in Frankfurt and far beyond by around 50 to 100 years. The first Christian find north of the Alps comes from our city: we can be proud of that, especially now, so close to Christmas. Those involved have done a great job.\"",
      "Researchers said that this find will lead to a reevaluation of the burial ground where the amulet was uncovered. It will also lead to a revision of ideas about Christianity north of the Alps.",
      "German church historian Ulrich Volp told the Evangelical Press Service that the amulet can be used to help understand how Christianity spread through the Roman Empire in the 3rd century, even amid persecution.",
      "\"The significance of the discovery can hardly be overestimated,\" Volp said.",

      "Gen. Ricardo Trevilla acknowledged that the army had already suffered six deaths from such improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, between 2018 and 2024. But he didn't specify whether those six had been killed by bombs dropped from drones, or by buried roadside bombs, both of which have been used by gangs in Mexico.",
      "Trevilla said that devices like the one that exploded Monday were \"very rustic,\" and officials in the past have described them as similar to buried pipe bombs. There was no immediate information on the condition of the five wounded in the attack, which included at least one officer.",
      "Trevilla's description of the location where the two soldiers died Monday in the western state of Michoacan\u00a0suggested that it may have been a sort of grisly drug cartel booby trap.",
      "Trevilla said the army sent out a patrol to check on reports that there was an encampment of armed men in a rural area. The armed forces detected an area protected by stockades that appeared to be an encampment, but when soldiers approached in vehicles, they found the trail blocked by logs, so they descended and had to approach on foot.",
      "While approaching, they spotted three dismembered bodies near the encampment, which appeared to be abandoned. But as they drew closer, a buried device exploded and struck the soldiers.",
      "Trevilla blamed the blast on the United Cartels, an umbrella group that includes the local Viagras gang, which has been fighting bloody turf battles against the Jalisco cartel in Michoacan for years.",
      "In August, the Mexican army acknowledged that some of its soldiers have been killed by bomb-dropping drones operated by drug cartels.",
      "Previously, officials have said the army encounters far more roadside bombs than drone-dropped ones.",
      "The Jalisco drug cartel\u00a0has been fighting local gangs for control of Michoacan for years, and the situation has become so militarized that the warring cartels use roadside bombs or IEDs, trenches, pillbox fortifications, homemade armored vehicles and sniper rifles.",

      "The alleged former high-ranking member of the Sinaloa Cartel was arrested on Friday in Virginia on charges of trafficking fentanyl. Lopez Serrano is the son of\u00a0Damaso Lopez Nunez, who launched a struggle for control of the cartel following the arrest of its leader,\u00a0Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman.",
      "Mexico's Attorney General Alejandro Gertz described Lopez Serrano as the \"mastermind\" behind Valdez's murder.",

      "Valdez was shot and killed in his car on May 15, 2017 in the Sinaloa state capital of Culiacan near the offices of his weekly newspaper Riodoce.",
      "Investigators believe Lopez Serrano ordered the hit because he was angry about information published by Valdez about the Sinaloa Cartel's internal power struggles.",
      "Mexico has made several extradition requests for Lopez Serrano, who surrendered to U.S. authorities in July 2017 for drug trafficking and cooperated in exchange for a reduced sentence. At the time, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said Lopez Serrano was \"believed to be the highest-ranking Mexican cartel leader ever to self-surrender in the United States.\"",
      "He was released from prison on parole in 2022.",
      "Gertz said that Mexico had asked \"on countless occasions\" for Lopez Serrano to be handed over, but Washington declined because he had become a \"protected witness\" and \"was giving them a lot of information.\"",
      "He voiced hope that with Lopez Serrano's latest arrest \"there are more than enough reasons\" for the United States to finally grant Mexico's request.",

      "\"The mystery has finally been solved,\" Congo's health ministry declared in a statement on Tuesday. \"It's a case of severe malaria in the form of a respiratory illness.\"",
      "The health agency said malnutrition in the hardest-hit region had weakened the local population's immunity, leaving them more vulnerable to the disease. People who contracted the malaria infection have exhibited symptoms including headache, fever, cough and body ache.",
      "The Congo's health minister had told journalists the country was on \"maximum alert\" over the spread of the previously unidentified disease, and health officials told CBS News in early December that the remoteness of the epicenter of the outbreak and lack of a diagnosis made it difficult to launch a concerted response.",
      "At least 592 cases were reported after the alert was first raised by Congo's health ministry on Oct. 29. The ministry said the disease had a fatality rate of 6.25%. More than half of the deaths recorded were children younger than five who were severely malnourished when they contracted the disease, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "At a press briefing on Dec. 10, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 10 out of 12 samples from patients suffering from the mysterious disease had tested positive for malaria, but he said they were still testing at the time for other diseases.",
      "The Congolese government had sent a rapid intervention team to the Kwango province, 435 miles southeast of capital city Kinshasa, consisting of epidemiologists and other medical experts. Their objective was to identify the disease and mount a suitable response. Government officials had earlier warned locals to avoid touching people infected with the illness or the bodies of those who had died.",

It said that, acting on instructions from Ukraine, the suspect traveled to Moscow, where he picked up a homemade explosive device. He then placed the device on an electric scooter and parked it at the entrance of the residential building where Kirillov lived.",

    "summary": "Researchers determined that dozens of men, women and children were violently killed and cannibalized in Bronze Age-era England.",
    "story": [
      "New research suggests that dozens of Bronze-Age era Britons were killed in an attack unlike any previous known to archaelogists studying that time period and location.",
      "The research on human remains from Charterhouse Warren in southwest England, conducted by a team of researchers from multiple institutions including Oxford University, was published in Antiquity, a journal of world archaeology. It found that at least 37 Bronze Age-era men, women and children were \"killed and butchered\" and then cannibalized, with their bodies then thrown down a nearly 50-foot deep natural shaft. While archaeologists have found the remains of Bronze Age and later Britons who died violently, those incidents were largely isolated. Mass graves from this era have also been found, but the remains were laid to rest respectfully, unlike those studied.",
      "Researchers first became aware of the shaft in the 1970s. Two excavations were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The human remains, as well as some artifacts including a flint dagger, were found at multiple spots in the shaft during these digs. More than 3,000 individual human bones and bone fragments have been recovered overall. Those bones were used to estimate that at least 37 individual sets of remains were in the shaft. Different bone lengths show that the people killed were both male and female, and ranged in age from infants to grown adults. Ongoing research is working to determine how the people were related to each other.",
      "The way the remains were disposed of made the detailed examination possible, the researchers said. The shaft helped preserve the bones and keep them grouped together.",
      "The bones \"display clear evidence of blunt force trauma,\" according to researchers, suggesting that many of the people in the shaft \"suffered a violent death.\" Other injuries, including removal of the scalp and severed muscles in the jaw suggesting removal of the tongue or lower jaw, also likely occurred, evidenced by marks on the bones, the researchers said. Some of the victims may have been beheaded or dismembered.",
      "It's possible that the victims were held captive or ambushed, because of the severity of the injuries, the researchers said. It's not clear who could have carried out the attacks.",
      "There is also evidence that the bodies were cannibalized, the researchers said, including human teethmarks on the bones and indicators that marrow, the soft tissue inside bones, was removed. The researchers said the cannibalism was likely conducted \"within a context of a violent conflict, in which individuals are dehumanized and treated as animals.\"",
      "\"Some 37 men, women and children\u2014and possibly many more\u2014were killed at close quarters with blunt instruments and then systematically dismembered and defleshed, their long bones fractured in a way that can only be described as butchery,\" the researchers said.",
      "Later in the publication, the researchers referred to the scene as a \"massacre,\" and suggested it may have even been a \"political statement\" of violence so brazen it would have \"resonated across the wider region and over time.\" However, it's not clear what could have led to the violence: \"Neither climate change, ethnic conflict nor competition over material resources seem to offer convincing explanations,\" according to the researchers, leaving the only likely option that the violence broke out as part of a pattern of revenge or violence between communities.",
      "\"At this stage, our investigation has raised as many questions as it has answered,\" the researchers said. \"Work is ongoing to shed more light on this decidedly dark episode in British prehistory.\"",

    "story": [
      "Police in Canada's capital city say they have identified the suspect in a fatal stabbing that happened almost three decades ago. The suspect, a man from Vancouver, British Columbia, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder after advanced DNA testing helped authorities link him to the crime.",
      "Lawrence Diehl, now 73, is accused of killing 22-year-old Christopher Smith on April 12, 1996,\u00a0according to\u00a0Ottawa Police. Smith was stabbed to death on the Portage Bridge, which connects Ottawa, the Canadian capital, to Gatineau in the neighboring province of Quebec.",
      "\"Advances in forensics and DNA have allowed police to identify the perpetrator and the matter is now before the court,\" Ottawa Police said in a statement.",
      "Diehl was arrested in Vancouver on December 10, police said. Investigators returned the suspect to Ottawa within the week, and he made his first appearance in court over the weekend.",
      "Multiple law enforcement agencies from across Canada worked since 2020 to solve Smith's cold case, including the national police force. Diel was identified through investigative genetic genealogy, where scientists and investigators use a combination of genetic testing and genealogy research to build a family tree for the individual whose sample is being evaluated.",
      "In Smith's case, scientists used genome sequencing to build a DNA profile for the murder suspect, according to\u00a0Othram Inc., a labratory that specializes in forensic genetic genealogy to assist law enforcement. Otram's findings allowed police working the case to develop new leads and pursue a renewed investigation, which culminated in Diehl's identification.",
      "Diehl's arrest marked the closure of Ottawa Police's oldest cold case, and the first time the department used genetic genealogy to solve a crime.",
      "\"By bringing these charges, the Ottawa Police Service demonstrates once again that we will never stop working for victims of crime and their loved ones,\" said Ottawa Police Chief Eric Stubbs in a statement. \"We will continue to embrace innovative techniques to solve cases, and I commend the members of our Homicide Unit for ensuring that no case is ever forgotten, and no effort is spared.\"",
      "Stubbs said police have connected with Smith's family to inform them of the new developments in his case. Investigators have asked anyone to contact the Ottawa Police Service's homicide unit with information about Diehl and time in Ottawa, as detectives learned he was there for work-related reasons at the time of the murder.",

    "summary": "A deadly earthquake has struck the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, damaging buildings in the capital, including one housing the U.S. embassy.",
    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 A powerful magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck just off the coast of Vanuatu on Tuesday, causing widespread destruction in the South Pacific island nation and reportedly killing at least six people. Casualties were arriving at hospitals and among the buildings seriously damaged in the capital of Port Vila was one that houses the U.S. embassy.",
      "A tsunami warning was called off less than two hours after the quake. With communications still down hours later and official information scarce, witness accounts of casualties began to surface on social media and through patchy phone calls.",
      "Katie Greenwood, the head of the International Federation of the Red Cross' Pacific branch, said in a social media post that at least six people had been confirmed dead and many more injured.",
      "The temblor hit just before 1 p.m. at a depth of 35 miles and was centered 18 miles west of Port Vila, the largest city in Vanuatu \u2014 a group of 80 islands that's home to about 330,000 people. It was followed by a magnitude 5.5 aftershock near the same location, with tremors continuing throughout the afternoon and evening.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear how much damage was caused as phone lines and government websites remained down, but Greenwood of the IFRC said multiple buildings had collapsed and the hospital in the capital was damaged.",
      "Doctors were working \"as fast as they could\" at a triage center outside the emergency ward, journalist Dan McGarry told The Associated Press, adding that the nation wasn't well equipped to deal with a mass casualty event. Video shared by the Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation showed crowds outside the hospital.",
      "In the first official information published by Vanuatu's government, the Geohazards Department said on social media that its monitoring systems remained offline due to power outages. Residents were urged to stay away from coastlines for at least 24 hours, and until tsunami and earthquake monitoring systems were operational once again.",
      "A video posted on social media appeared to show crumpled buildings in Port Vila, including one that had collapsed onto its lower floors and cars parked on the street below. Amanda Laithwaite said her husband was among a group of rescuers attempting to shift the roof of the three-story building because they believed people were trapped inside, but their progress was slow without specialist machinery.",
      "A building housing a number of diplomatic missions in Port Vila, including those of the U.S., Britain, France and New Zealand, was significantly damaged, several of its tenants said, but the U.S. Embassy said in a message posted on its Facebook page that all staff were safe, though the building was closed until further notice.",
      "The U.S. mission only opened in July, as part of a wider push by the U.S. to expand its Pacific presence to counter China's burgeoning influence on governments in the region.",
      "A video posted on social media showed the building with some damage, including buckled windows and debris that had crumbled from walls to the ground.",
      "The French news agency AFP said its photos showed the ground floor of the diplomatic building completely flattened. The bottom floor \"no longer exists,\" Vanuatu resident Michael Thompson told AFP by satellite phone after posting images of the destruction on social media. \"It is just completely flat. The top three floors are still holding but they have dropped.\"",
      "\"There's people in the buildings in town. There were bodies there when we walked past,\" Thompson said. The quake also knocked down at least two bridges and toppled other buildings, he said.",
      "McGarry, the journalist, said a \"massive landslide\" at the international shipping terminal was likely to impede the country's recovery. The airport's runway was also damaged, he said.",
      "Vanuatu's position on a subduction zone \u2014 where the Indo-Australia tectonic plate moves beneath the Pacific Plate \u2014 means earthquakes of magnitudes greater than 6 aren't uncommon, and the country's buildings are intended to withstand quake damage.",
      "\"I think it could have been worse,\" McGarry said. But this was the most serious he had experienced during 21 years in Vanuatu, \"by a long shot,\" he said.",
      "Port Vila's airport couldn't be contacted Tuesday, but flight tracking sites suggested all flights were grounded. Some airlines in Australia and the Pacific said they had cancelled or paused flights scheduled for Wednesday and were awaiting news of the airport's status.",
      "Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong told reporters her country would provide whatever help was needed. New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said 45 New Zealanders were registered as being in Vanuatu and his government was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation there.",
      "Vanuatu has been led by four prime ministers in four years and is due to go to the polls in January for a snap election. In November, Prime Minister Charlot Salwai asked President Nikenike Vurobaravu to dissolve Parliament so he wouldn't have to face a no-confidence vote as his recent predecessors did.",

      "The three later returned to Britain more than a month after they fled and were arrested on suspicion of murder.",
      "The trial in the Central Criminal Court exposed horrific details of abuse that included more than 70 fresh injuries and many older ones, including bruising, burns, fractures and bite marks and has raised questions about failures by social services and authorities to intervene and protect her.",
      "\"Sara's death was the culmination of years of neglect, frequent assaults and what can only be described as torture,\" Justice John Cavanagh said. \"The degree of cruelty is almost inconceivable... None of you have shown a shred of true remorse.\"",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called last week for stronger safeguards for home-schooled children like Sara, and said there were \"questions that need to be answered\" after her murder. Sara died months after her father pulled her out of state school to be taught at home, following a teacher reporting bruising on the little girl to social services.",
      "British child protective services did look into the report, but took no action.",

      "\"It's great to be back, returning U.S. presence to here after eight years,\" the ship's commanding officer, Daniel A. Sledz, said in brief remarks to reporters. He was given a bouquet of flowers by a Cambodian officer and shook hands with a line of her colleagues.",
      "The United States for many years has had rocky relations with Cambodia, criticizing its government for political repression and human rights violations. There is particular concern about its close ties with China, which Washington fears may get exclusive access to a Cambodian naval base on the Gulf of Thailand, not far from where the Savannah docked.",
      "Recently, there seem to have been moves to patch up relations.",

He also met with Cambodian alumni of U.S. military training programs. Hun Manet himself is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.",

      "Controversy over the Chinese activity at Ream initially arose in 2019 when The Wall Street Journal reported that an early draft of an agreement seen by U.S. officials would allow China 30-year use of the base, where it would be able to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships.",
      "Cambodia's government has denied such an agreement or any intention to grant China special privileges at the base, though Beijing has funded its expansion.",

      "IS EATING ONCE A DAY A GOOD IDEA? EXPERTS SHARE VARYING OPINIONS ON THE \u2018OMAD DIET\u2019",
      "\"A well-documented observation is that the body tends to defend increased body weight, making weight loss and maintenance notoriously challenging.\"",
      "Obesity is a common chronic disease in the U.S., with one in five children and two out of five adults meeting the criteria, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
      "The cycle of losing and regaining weight on repeat, commonly known as the yo-yo effect, could be due to a type of \"metabolic memory,\" a new study found. (iStock)",
      "The new research, published in November in the journal Nature, points to epigenetics (genetic activity) that may play a role in regaining weight after weight loss.",
      "What is epigenetics?",
      "\"Epigenetics, which involves chemical markers that influence gene activity without altering the DNA sequence, is crucial in how cells function and respond to environmental factors,\" Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School,\u00a0told Fox News Digital.",
      "\u2018HIDDEN\u2019 FAT COULD PREDICT ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE UP TO 20 YEARS BEFORE SYMPTOMS, RESEARCH FINDS",
      "\"These markers can be altered by lifestyle factors, such as diet, and can remain stable for years, effectively creating a cellular \u2018memory\u2019 of past states, such as obesity,\" added Stanford, who was not part of the study.",
      "It is well-known that cells keep their genetic identity as they divide. The researchers were curious about what happens to fat cells \u2014 which live on average for 10 years before the body replaces them, von Meyenn said.",
      "The researchers investigated what happens to fat cells, which live on average for 10 years before the body replaces them. (iStock)",
      "This differs from other cells in tissues, which divide much faster \u2013 intestinal cells, for example, generally divide every other week, he added.",
      "Fat cells still must adapt to external stimuli and undergo epigenetic adaptations, von Meyenn noted.",
      "The researchers set out to determine whether these changes could be reversed.",
      "Fighting \u2018memory\u2019 in fat cells",
      "In mouse studies, the researchers found that even after significant weight loss, their cells have a \"memory\" of obesity encoded in the epigenome, which controls the activity of genes, said von Meyenn.",
      "\"Our study indicates that one reason maintaining body weight after initial weight loss is difficult is that the fat cells remember their prior obese state and likely aim to return to this state,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The body tends to defend increased body weight, making weight loss and maintenance notoriously challenging.\"",
      "\"This means one would have to \u2018fight\u2019 this obesogenic memory to maintain body weight.\"",
      "Based on this research, a failure to maintain weight loss after dieting is not necessarily due to lack of effort or willpower, but could also be driven by an underlying biological phenomenon, von Meyenn added.",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The research looked only at fatty tissue, and the genetic mechanisms were studied only in mice. Even so, the researchers said they believe that similar mechanisms also apply to humans.",
      "Other experts cautioned, however, that the study shows only association and does not prove that epigenetic changes cause the yo-yo effect.",
      "CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOUR NEXT MEAL? IT'S CALLED FOOD NOISE, HERE'S WHAT TO DO",
      "\"The authors pointed out that they cannot say for certain that the epigenetic modifications directly cause people to regain their lost weight, nor pinpoint which specific epigenetic markers may be driving this effect,\" Petronella Ravenshear, board-certified nutritionist and author of \"The Human Being Diet,\" told Fox News Digital.",
      "Florida-based Ravenshear, who was not part of the study, noted that the results should not lead people to claim, \"It\u2019s not my fault, it\u2019s my genes!\"",
      "Plans for future research",
      "\"We will need to now expand, see how the memory can be erased and whether other cells or tissues are also affected, [such as] the brain or the liver,\" von Meyenn said.",
      "It\u2019s possible that if people maintain a healthy weight for a year or longer after dieting, that may be enough time to erase the memory in fat cells, according to Ravenshear.",
      "The term \"diet,\" in its original connotation, means \"way of living\" \u2014 but it is now synonymous with short-term dietary changes that are unsustainable, one expert said. (iStock)",
      "\"This discovery underscores the importance of preventing obesity, particularly in children and adolescents, to avoid establishing this epigenetic memory that complicates long-term weight management,\" Stanford noted.",
      "\"Understanding these mechanisms further could lead to more effective treatments and prevention strategies, emphasizing the need for a proactive approach to weight management from an early age,\" she added.",

      "People often regain the weight they lose when they return to the eating habits that led to weight gain in the first place, many experts agree.",

      "Hackers are using CAPTCHAs to infect your PC with malware.",
      "When you visit a webpage, you might see a CAPTCHA to make sure you\u2019re a real person and not a bot. These usually involve jumbled words, some recognizable images or just a box that says, \"I am not a robot.\"",
      "CAPTCHAs are harmless, but hackers are now using them to infect your PC with malware.",
      "Security researchers have found a huge fake CAPTCHA campaign spreading the dangerous Lumma info-stealer malware, which can bypass security measures like Safe Browsing.",
      "This campaign shows how malvertising works, with more than a million ad impressions every day and thousands of victims losing their accounts and money through a network of more than 3,000 sites. I\u2019ll break down how this scam works, who\u2019s responsible and how you can protect yourself.",

      "Illustration of a scammer (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does the scam work?",
      "As reported\u00a0by Guardio, the fake CAPTCHA scam is a sophisticated malvertising campaign that lures you into unknowingly installing malware under the guise of routine CAPTCHA verification. The cyberattack starts when you\u2019re browsing websites, often those offering free streaming, downloads or pirated content. These sites are used by hackers to present you with what appears to be a legitimate CAPTCHA verification page.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The page mimics a real CAPTCHA, asking you to confirm you are human. However, the instructions are designed to trick you into initiating harmful actions, like triggering the Windows \"Run\" dialog. Users unknowingly paste and execute a crafted PowerShell command, which silently installs the Lumma info-stealer malware onto their system.",
      "The malware targets sensitive data, including social media accounts, banking credentials, saved passwords and personal files, potentially leading to financial and identity theft.",

      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "Who\u2019s to blame for this?",
      "The fake CAPTCHA scam shows how messy the internet\u2019s ad system has become, with everyone involved passing the buck. Guardio Labs points to ad networks like Monetag as a big part of the problem. They distribute malicious ads that are disguised during moderation using tricks like cloaking. Publishers, especially those offering free or pirated content, add to the issue by running these shady ads on their sites, often without checking what they\u2019re actually showing users.",
      "Then there are services like BeMob, which lets scammers hide their bad links behind harmless-looking URLs. These companies call themselves analytics tools, but they\u2019re helping the scams stay hidden. Hosting providers don\u2019t escape blame either. They\u2019re where these fake CAPTCHA pages live, and they often don\u2019t bother to check what\u2019s being hosted.",
      "Of course, the scammers themselves are the ones pulling the strings. But because they spread their operations across so many platforms, they\u2019re almost impossible to track down. Guardio\u2019s research shows how all these moving parts work together, creating a system where no one takes responsibility, and the scams keep running.",

      "6 ways to stay safe from fake CAPTCHAs",
      "1. Use reliable security software:\u00a0Keeping your antivirus and anti-malware software up to date is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself from fake CAPTCHA scams. A strong antivirus software will detect and block malware like the Lumma info-stealer before it can infect your device.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Enable browser protection features:\u00a0Modern browsers offer built-in security features, such as Safe Browsing and phishing protection, which warn you about potentially dangerous sites. Make sure these features are enabled in your browser settings. These tools can alert you to malicious links or fake CAPTCHAs trying to trick you into downloading malware.",
      "3. Be cautious with \"free\" content:\u00a0There\u2019s a saying that goes, \"If something is free, you\u2019re what they are selling.\" Websites that offer free downloads, streaming services or pirated content are often associated with malvertising campaigns. Fake CAPTCHA scams are commonly spread through these types of sites, where users are tricked into clicking on malicious ads or links. Even if a site seems tempting, it\u2019s important to be cautious. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or using \"free\" services, as they could be traps designed to infect your device with malware.",
      "4. Avoid clicking on suspicious ads:\u00a0Always be wary of ads that appear out of nowhere or seem too good to be true. Fake CAPTCHA scams often disguise themselves as legitimate ads, asking you to click to verify you're human. Never interact with pop-up ads or unfamiliar banners, especially those that claim to give you something for free, as they may lead to malicious pages or trigger malware downloads.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Check for HTTPS and look for signs of a legitimate site:\u00a0Before entering any personal information or interacting with a CAPTCHA, ensure that the website is secure. Look for \"https://\" in the website\u2019s URL, which indicates the connection is encrypted. Legitimate websites also tend to have a professional appearance, so if something feels off or the design looks poor, trust your instincts and leave the site.",
      "6. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for attackers to access your accounts.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "There\u2019s no question that fake CAPTCHA scams are a growing threat, putting millions of us at risk of malware infections and financial loss. What\u2019s even more concerning is that ad networks, publishers and hosting services continue to allow malicious campaigns to spread through their platforms despite the widespread awareness of the problem. The companies involved must take immediate action to improve content moderation, tighten security measures and prevent these scams from thriving. We are seeing a dangerous loophole in the digital advertising ecosystem that could have serious consequences for internet users.",

      "These breaches can be very damaging and haunt people for life. Recently, hackers leaked the personal data of around 500,000 Americans.",

      "CVR, a clinic headquartered in Maryland, experienced a massive data breach where hackers stole highly sensitive personal information, including lab results and health insurance details, as reported by\u00a0Cybernews. The breach occurred in early October, with the clinic detecting \"unusual activity\" in its systems on Oct. 6.",
      "CVR has more than 110 branches across the country, from Alabama to Alaska. This breach has affected hundreds of thousands of individuals. According to a\u00a0notice filed by CVR with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, more than 445,000 people had their personal information compromised.",
      "As the name suggests, CVR specializes in vein restoration, a very specialized procedure aimed at improving the health and function of veins. This means the clinic keeps a very elaborate record of its patients\u2019 health, and now all that is in the hands of hackers, along with copious amounts of personal information.",
      "The full list of exposed data includes addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, medical record numbers, diagnoses, lab results, medications, treatment information, health insurance information, provider names, dates of treatment and financial information.",

      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "The risks associated with the CVR data breach",
      "The risks of data breaches depend on the type of company affected. For instance, breaches involving companies like Ticketmaster are generally more manageable because they often expose information like contact details, addresses and, in some cases, identification documents. Even if financial data is leaked, it can typically be mitigated by replacing or blocking compromised accounts.",
      "Health care data breaches, however, are far more severe. When companies like CVR are targeted, hackers gain access to sensitive medical records that cannot be altered. Your medical history is permanent and highly sought after on the dark web. Cybercriminals can use this information to commit identity fraud, such as obtaining prescription drugs through false insurance claims. Plus, detailed knowledge of medical treatments, lab results and medications allows attackers to create highly targeted phishing scams, exploiting victims\u2019 vulnerabilities with alarming precision.",

Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3. Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code or authentication app, in addition to your password.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Don\u2019t fall for phishing scams; use strong antivirus software: Be mindful of the information you share online and with whom you share it. Avoid providing sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers or medical details, unless absolutely necessary. Verify the legitimacy of any requests for personal information. Scammers often pose as health care providers or insurance companies to trick you into revealing sensitive data by asking you to click on links in emails or messages.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Use identity theft protection services: Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services that monitor your personal information and alert you to potential threats. These services can help you detect and respond to identity theft more quickly. Some identity theft protection services also offer insurance and assistance with recovering from identity theft, providing additional peace of mind.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "6. Freeze your credit:\u00a0A credit freeze prevents anyone from opening new credit accounts in your name without your authorization, reducing the risk of identity theft. Contact the major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to request a credit freeze. This is often free and can be temporarily lifted when you need to apply for credit.",
      "7. Remove your personal data from the internet: After being part of a data breach, it's crucial to minimize your online presence to reduce the risk of future scams. Consider using a personal data removal service that can help you delete your information from various websites and data brokers. This can greatly diminish the chances of your data being used maliciously.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "DON\u2019T LET SNOOPS NEARBY LISTEN TO YOUR VOICEMAIL WITH THIS QUICK TIP",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The CVR data breach is deeply troubling, affecting nearly half a million individuals and exposing highly sensitive medical and personal information. What makes this breach particularly concerning is the lasting impact health care data leaks can have on victims, from identity theft to targeted phishing scams. Whether or not you\u2019ve been directly affected, it\u2019s a stark reminder to take proactive steps, such as monitoring your accounts, enabling multifactor authentication and staying alert to phishing attempts.",

This is when you find the best deals on your favorite products, whether it\u2019s a new electronic gadget or a household essential.",

      "According to\u00a0Appdome's latest U.S. Consumer Survey, 60.6% of Americans say fraud is their biggest concern. More than 40% of global consumers reported that they or someone close to them had been directly affected by mobile fraud, malware or a cyberattack. With mobile apps now being the main way people interact with brands, skepticism among users is growing. In fact, 24% of consumers believe developers don\u2019t care about app security, a massive jump of 258% since 2021.",
      "Social engineering has become a major worry, as people are becoming more aware of the many ways mobile fraud can happen. This includes things like location spoofing, scams that manipulate users and account takeovers. Almost half of the survey respondents this year said they or someone they know personally had dealt with fraud, scams or similar issues.",
      "Such scams also affect your online shopping experience. I spoke with Tom Tovar, CEO of Appdome, regarding what consumers need to know when they are shopping on their mobile devices this holiday season.",
      "\"Consumers should be aware of phishing, smishing and vishing scams, which exploit fake emails, deceptive SMS messages and fraudulent phone calls to steal sensitive information. More sophisticated threats include FaceID bypass attacks, such as those carried out by the GoldPickaxe malware, which uses AI-enhanced techniques to bypass biometric authentication,\"\u00a0Tovar said.",
      "\"Other significant risks include banking trojans, which infiltrate apps to steal login credentials or financial data, and accessibility malware, which exploits device accessibility features to take control of mobile interactions.

      "\"With the growing sophistication of mobile threats, it\u2019s becoming increasingly challenging for consumers to identify risks independently. Threats like phishing, accessibility malware and banking trojans are designed to mimic legitimate functions, making them nearly impossible to detect at a glance. Instead of relying solely on spotting issues, consumers should look for apps that clearly communicate their commitment to security through visible privacy policies, transparent security practices and updates addressing new threats. Choosing apps from trusted sources and reading user reviews can also provide reassurance,\"\u00a0Tovar said.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "When shopping on your phone, be cautious of\u00a0phishing, smishing and\u00a0vishing scams, as they are common tactics used to steal your personal and financial information. Phishing involves fake emails that look like they are from trusted retailers, tricking you into sharing sensitive details like passwords or payment information. Smishing is a similar tactic but delivered through text messages, often containing links to fake websites or malicious downloads.",
      "Vishing, on the other hand, involves scammers making phone calls pretending to be customer service representatives from well-known brands, attempting to gain access to your private information. Always verify the authenticity of emails, texts or calls before clicking links or sharing details to ensure a safe shopping experience.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "When shopping online on your phone, it's important to be careful about the permissions you give to apps. A lot of apps may ask for access to things like your camera, contacts or location, even if it's not necessary for the shopping experience. Always think twice before granting these permissions.",
      "\"These permissions are often abused by malware to collect sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions. Before granting permissions, consider whether they align with the app\u2019s purpose. Developers can mitigate these risks by incorporating protections from Appdome\u2019s anti-fraud offering, which protects against the many abuse methods used by malicious actors to abuse mobile app permissions,\" Tovar said.",

      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Protecting financial information is crucial, especially when shopping online. It's important to use secure websites, indicated by \"https\" in the URL, and avoid saving payment details in apps or on websites unless they are trustworthy.",
      "While consumers should stay vigilant \u2013 by using trusted apps, downloading only from official app stores and monitoring for suspicious activity \u2013 there\u2019s only so much they can do, Tovar said.",
      "\"The sophistication of modern threats often makes it impossible for users to identify or prevent all risks on their own,\" he said. \"Consumers have a better chance of keeping their personal information secure by choosing brands that prioritize security and back it up with tangible actions, such as automating robust protections and delivering proactive, built-in security measures.\"",

So, if you receive a text that mentions a package delivery, you may be likely to easily fall for a scam. I was expecting a package recently and received this text out of the blue (see image).",

But once I looked a little closer, there were a few red flags in this text message that tipped me off to it being a scam.",

This is a common scam going around called typosquatting wherein a scammer uses a domain that looks close to a real website. Next, the text says \"pls,\" which is lingo for \"please\" that you likely wouldn't see in correspondence from the USPS. Scammers often make typos or use poor grammar when communicating, so always double-check.Scammers are sending emails, texts and even occasionally there could be a phone call that is regarding an issue with package delivery.

      "2) Charity scams",
      "Sadly, charity scams aren't new, but they are way more prevalent during the holiday season since scammers are hoping you're feeling more generous during this time of year. Sometimes, scammers may create fake names of organizations to get you to donate money, or they may reach out to you via phone/email/text posing as someone working for a legitimate charity. Social media has also become a popular place for charities to market themselves and reach more eyes in hopes of donations, so scammers may try to pose as fake charities. These schemes will try to appeal to your emotions during this season, so be sure to check where you donate your money so you don't fall for a scam.",
      "Never give your money to anyone immediately who approaches you or reaches out on behalf of any organization without doing your own independent research. Either do a little googling or check with a family member to see if it's real, and if it is, you should be able to donate to an official website or an official address. You can always mention this to anyone who asks you to donate somewhere. Don't fall into the pressure of donating right then and there. Also, always double-check the name of an organization. Sometimes (especially online), scammers will alter the name of a known organization slightly to trick you into donating.",

      "The\u00a0Better Business Bureau is warning about a gift exchange scam with a new twist, which has been occurring during recent holiday seasons. It's an online version of the popular \"Secret Santa\" gift exchange. However, the BBB says these social media-driven gift exchanges are actually pyramid schemes, and you will most likely be disappointed if you participate.",
      "In the past few years, variations of the gift exchange have popped up, with someone asking you to select a random person and send them a gift to pay it forward. Another asks you to exchange bottles of wine with someone else, and while it seems fun and light-hearted, you don't know who is on the receiving end.",
      "It may sound nice to send a holiday gift to a stranger in turn for receiving multiple gifts yourself, but you're never going to receive many (if any) gifts at all.\u00a0Don't participate in gift exchanges with anyone you don't know, or you won't be able to guarantee you'll actually be gifting someone who isn't a scammer.",

      "4) Gift card scams",
      "Gift card scams are another popular method that has been rising in popularity recently, but it's especially important to watch out for the possibilities, since you may be purchasing gift cards for friends or family for the holidays. Scammers often steal gift cards and use the information before they make it look like they didn't. They have a number of methods for tricking you using gift cards, so if you can send an online one (so that you can ensure you've purchased it on a legitimate, official website), that would be a much safer alternative.",
      "If you're getting anyone a gift card and buying it in person, be sure to check that the package hasn't been tampered with. Double-check that nothing on the packaging looks suspicious since scammers will try to make it seem like the package was sealed, but they will already have used the gift card, so you're essentially buying a useless piece of plastic.",

      "5) Home Depot email confirmation scam",
      "Scammers are capitalizing on the festive spirit with a deceptive email campaign targeting people at this time of year.\u00a0This scam involves a deceptive email that appears to be from Home Depot with such wording as \"Confirmation needed: please confirm receipt.\" The email body typically contains enticing text like \"Congratulations! The Home Depot - You are our winner!\" along with a customer number and a blue circle that says, \"Check if you won.\" Who couldn't use a little extra cheer or perhaps a holiday prize from Home Depot this season?",
      "The problem is this is a scam, and the goal of this scam is to lure you into clicking on an embedded link, which can lead to various malicious outcomes. These include phishing for personal and financial information, installing malware on your device, redirecting to a fake website that resembles Home Depot's or prompting you to pay a \"delivery fee\" for a non-existent prize.",
      "To protect yourself from this and similar scams, scrutinize the sender's email address for any discrepancies. Hover over links without clicking to reveal their true destination. Be wary of unexpected \"winnings\" or requests for confirmation. If you receive an email that raises suspicion, contact Home Depot directly through their official website or customer service number to verify its legitimacy. Finally, remember that legitimate companies will not ask you to confirm sensitive information via email or require you to click on links to claim prizes.",
      "Fake Home Depot winning email (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6) Fake online shopping sites scam",
      "One of the most common scams during the holiday season is the fake online shopping site scam. Scammers create websites that look like legitimate online stores but are actually designed to steal your personal and financial information. They may offer products at very low prices or claim to have limited-time deals or exclusive items. They may also send you\u00a0phishing emails or text messages with links to these fake sites.",

      "1) Shop only from trusted and reputable online stores that you know and have used before.",
      "2) Check the website address carefully and look for any red flags.",
      "3) Do some research on the online store before making a purchase. Read customer reviews, look for ratings or search for complaints online.",
      "4) Use a credit card or a secure payment service like PayPal when shopping online. Do not use debit cards, wire transfers or gift cards.",
      "5) Keep track of your online purchases and monitor your bank statements for any unauthorized charges.",
      "6) Use strong antivirus protection software. An effective antivirus software is a must-have. The best way to protect yourself from clicking on any malicious links on fake websites or in phishing emails and text messages is to have\u00a0antivirus protection installed and actively running on all your devices.\u00a0It\u2019s the best to help stop and alert you of any malware in your system and ultimately protect you from being hacked.\u00a0See my expert review of the best antivirus protection for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7) Use a personal data removal service. Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",

      "We\u2019re sorry to hear about the theft in your neighborhood. This highlights a problem that goes beyond mere property loss. It's a theft of holiday cheer and personal effort. Let\u2019s see how we can use technology to help secure your decorations.",

      "Karen also inquired about the effectiveness of\u00a0Samsung SmartTags, asking if these tags would work on her decorations and how far they could reach. The good news is that Samsung SmartTags can indeed be used on your holiday decorations. You can attach the SmartTag to any item you want to track. These devices are compatible with most recent Samsung Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S9, making them accessible to many Android users.",
      "As for the distance, the range of the\u00a0Samsung SmartTag uses Bluetooth to connect to your phone. If the item is within Bluetooth range, you can ring it to find it or use the \"Search Nearby\" feature to get directions to it. If the item is out of range, other Samsung devices near the tag will anonymously locate it for you and then let you know where it is. This is done in the background and is encrypted to ensure privacy. The SmartTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range.",
      "The\u00a0Samsung SmartTag is compatible with almost all Samsung Galaxy phones released recently. They must have 2GB of RAM and run Android 8.0 (Oreo) or higher. So, your Samsung Galaxy S9 phones should be compatible with the Samsung SmartTag.",

While primarily designed for iOS devices,\u00a0you can use it with your Android phone as mentioned in our article here, with some limitations. It uses the Find My network, and if another Apple device passes by the AirTag, the Find My network will be notified of the lost item\u2019s location.",
      "The AirTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range. However, the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature, which provides highly accurate tracking, is only compatible with iPhone 11 series and onwards. If you\u2019re considering purchasing an iPhone, the iPhone 11 would be a relatively inexpensive option that is compatible with the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature.",

Similarly,\u00a0AirTags leverage the Find My network, utilizing nearby Apple devices to relay location information.",

      "2. Secure decorations: Consider physically securing your decorations with zip ties, chains or locks. While this won't deter all thieves, it can make stealing more difficult and time-consuming.",
      "3. Light it up: Well-lit areas are less appealing to thieves. Ensure your yard and decorations are adequately lit with\u00a0outdoor lights, especially in dark corners or near entry points.",
      "4. Engage your neighbors: Create a sense of community by alerting neighbors to thefts and keeping an eye out for suspicious activity. A connected neighborhood can act as a strong deterrent.",
      "5. Mark your property: Use invisible ink or engrave your decorations with a unique identifier. If stolen items are recovered, this will help law enforcement return them to you.",
      "6. Report thefts to local law enforcement: Always report thefts, no matter how small. Law enforcement can track patterns and increase patrols in areas with frequent incidents. Providing details may also help them recover stolen items.",

Knowing what steps to take \u2014 and in what order \u2014 can make a huge difference in regaining control and stopping the damage.

      "Step 1: Remove malicious software",
      "Even if hackers had only brief access to your device, assume they\u2019ve seen sensitive data. Your first task is to remove any malware or spyware.",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software: The easiest and most effective way to start is by installing and running strong antivirus or antivirus software. Avoid unfamiliar apps, as some pose as antivirus tools but are actually malware in disguise.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "After installation, run a full device scan. This will search for hidden threats like spyware, ransomware, or keyloggers that could compromise your information further. Once the scan identifies malicious files, follow the app\u2019s instructions to quarantine or remove them. Be sure to double-check the app\u2019s log to confirm all suspicious activity has been addressed. Most antivirus tools offer real-time protection to monitor for threats as they occur. Turn this feature on to reduce the risk of reinfection. Antivirus programs are only as effective as their latest updates. Cybercriminals continuously develop new malware, so keeping your antivirus database current ensures it can detect the newest threats.",
      "2. Factory reset if needed: If the antivirus software fails to fully restore your phone\u2019s functionality \u2014 such as fixing issues like freezing, slowdowns or unexpected shutdowns \u2014 you may need to perform a factory reset on your\u00a0iPhone or\u00a0Android. A factory reset wipes all data from your phone, returning it to its original state when it left the manufacturer. Before resetting, create a backup of your important files. However, ensure the backup itself is free of malware. Use antivirus software to scan backups before restoring them. Most phones offer a simple reset option in their settings menu under \"System\" or \"General Management.\" Consult your device manual or manufacturer\u2019s website for detailed instructions.",
      "3. Seek professional help:\u00a0If you\u2019re not confident in your ability to remove malware or reset your phone, reach out to a trusted professional. Visit the Apple Store, Microsoft Store or an authorized service provider for your phone brand. Explain your situation and ask for a thorough inspection and cleaning of your device. Many retailers offer comprehensive diagnostic and repair services.",
      "4. Abandon hardware only as a last resort: In rare cases, malware can deeply embed itself into a device, making complete removal nearly impossible. If your phone continues to exhibit signs of infection despite using antivirus tools, factory resets and professional help, you may need to replace it. Ensure you completely\u00a0wipe the device before disposing of it to prevent any residual data from falling into the wrong hands. When setting up a new device, take extra precautions to secure it, such as enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication and keeping all\u00a0software up to date.",

      "Innovative design for superior handling",
      "Harbinger's EV delivery truck features a unique chassis design that places the heavy batteries within the frame, resulting in a much lower center of gravity compared to traditional medium-duty trucks. This innovative layout allows for powerful torque and superior handling, even for vehicles exceeding 13 feet in length. The result is a truck that handles more like a passenger car, even in challenging winter conditions.",

      "TESLA SEMI'S IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE ON ICE MARKS ANOTHER MAJOR TRIUMPH",
      "Key elements of winter testing",
      "According to John Harris, co-founder and CEO of Harbinger, winter testing is critical for vehicle development, especially for EVs. It ensures that vehicles perform reliably on low-traction surfaces such as ice and snow. The focus is not only on typical cold weather driving conditions but also on less common yet important higher-risk scenarios. This is particularly crucial for EVs due to their significant torque output, which can lead to loss of control if not managed correctly on slippery surfaces. Systems like regenerative braking also need optimization for extreme conditions.",

At low temperatures, the chemical reactions within the battery slow down, leading to decreased efficiency and power output. Additionally, electric vehicles require energy to heat the cabin, which further reduces driving range. Harbinger addresses these concerns by utilizing a multi-zone heat pump that efficiently provides heating for both the battery and cabin, thereby minimizing the negative effects of cold weather on performance.",

      "\"Since October 7th, there has been an increased push\u00a0from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, with significant Iranian involvement,\" said Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Forum for Palestinian Studies at Tel Aviv University who further emphasized the shift in the situation since Oct. 7, noting the influence of Iranian-backed forces. \"They're trying to push operations in the West Bank, and there have been attempts to manufacture rockets and fire them at Israeli cities\u00a0from Jenin. While it\u2019s still in the early stages and these efforts are unsuccessful, it\u2019s a troubling development that signals how Jenin is evolving into a central hub for terrorists.\"",
      "Last weekend, PA security forces killed Yazid Jaysa, an Islamic Jihad commander, in an operation that has intensified tensions in the region. This was the third death in Jenin within a week, following the killing of 19-year-old Rahbi Shalabi during gunfights between PA forces and local militants. The deaths have further fueled the discontent in the city, particularly among residents of the Jenin refugee camp. \"The entire refugee camp is now against the PA,\" said Daraghmeh.",
      "On Sunday, reports surfaced that the PA had positioned its forces outside the refugee camp, but attempts to enter were met with resistance. The terrorists inside the camp, many of whom have vowed to fight the PA\u2019s forces, pose a significant challenge to the PA\u2019s plans for reasserting control.",

(ZAIN JAAFAR/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"There\u2019s no active fighting right now, but the PA forces are stuck. They\u2019ve tried to enter, but failed, and now they\u2019re stuck outside,\" said Daraghmeh. \"They can\u2019t leave, but they can\u2019t continue the operation either, because there are dozens of militants ready to confront them.\"",
      "Milshtein, the former head of Palestinian affairs in Israeli Defense Forces military intelligence, told Fox News Digital, \"The PA does not have the ability to enforce control in northern Samaria and the surrounding areas. The PA has lost control of these regions, and for years, Israel has treated Jenin and the surrounding areas like Gaza- without PA control mechanisms, and essentially, there\u2019s a real vacuum.\"",
      "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, right, and President Biden shake hands in the West Bank town of Bethlehem on Friday, July 15, 2022. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)",
      "The timing of the PA\u2019s operation is significant, with many observers noting that it coincides with the broader regional context, including the ongoing war in Gaza and the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Milshtein believes that the events in Syria played a role in the PA\u2019s decision to act. \"People in the West Bank say that when one dictator (PA President Mahmoud Abbas) saw what happened to the other (Bashar al-Assad), he decided he would not follow the same fate,\" Milshtein explained. \"Mahmoud Abbas likely felt that he needed to act before the PA\u2019s authority in the West Bank completely erodes.\"",
      "The operation, which is part of a larger crackdown in the northern West Bank, also reflects the PA\u2019s desire to assert itself as a capable authority ahead of potential political developments in Gaza. The PA has long struggled with its ability to govern Gaza, which it lost to Hamas in 2007. Now, with the region in turmoil, it is hoping to prove that it can restore order in the West Bank, which it argues will bolster its legitimacy in any postwar political scenario for Gaza.",

      "\"I don\u2019t see a possibility that the PA will control Gaza,\" Milshtein said, \"There are two million people there. For 17 years, they have been ruled by Hamas, and 60% were born after Hamas took control. They were educated to view the PA as collaborators with Israel and enemies. Giving the PA two hours in Gaza is a known failure from the outset.\"",
      "Despite the violence in Jenin, Daraghmeh does not foresee the conflict spreading beyond. \"People in Ramallah, Hebron and other cities don\u2019t want the West Bank to turn into another Gaza,\" Daraghmeh said. \"The situation in Jenin is contained, but it remains a test for the PA\u2019s ability to control its own territory.\"",

It claims that it also fails to exclude deaths unassociated with Israeli military action from its count. This includes individuals believed to have been killed by Hamas, like 13-year-old Ahmed Shaddad Halmy Brikeh, who appears on a casualty list from August despite reports indicating he had \"been shot dead by Hamas\" while trying to get food from an aid shipment in December 2023.

HTS has already said it would cooperate with the U.S. in the search for Austin Tice, the American journalist missing in Syria since 2012 and who was believed to be held captive by the Assad regime. The initial contact with the rebel group and their promise to work with the U.S. to bring Tice home could further legitimize the group as it looks to consolidate its control over post-Assad Syria.",

    "story": [
      "This article is part of \u201cDealing the Dead,\u201d a series investigating the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research.",
      "Every day for two seemingly endless months, Arelis Coromoto Villegas repeated the same prayer: From her small, cinder-block home in Venezuela, she asked God to protect her 21-year-old daughter as she trekked thousands of miles through treacherous jungle and desert terrain to reach America\u2019s southern border.",
      "Her prayers were answered in September 2022 when Aurimar Iturriago Villegas crossed safely into the U.S. and continued north with her own prayer \u2014 to land a job and eventually earn enough money to help her mother build a new house.",
      "But within two months of her arrival in Texas, Aurimar was dead, shot in a road rage incident near Dallas as she sat in the back seat of a car.",
      "And then, for her mother, the unthinkable somehow became the unimaginable.",
      "Without her family\u2019s knowledge, county authorities donated Aurimar\u2019s body to a local medical school, where officials cut it up and assigned dollar figures to parts that hadn\u2019t been damaged by the bullet that struck her head \u2014\u00a0$900 for her torso, $703 for her legs.",
      "Remnants of Aurimar\u2019s body were cremated and buried in a field among strangers in a Dallas cemetery, all while her mother desperately sought to have her murdered daughter returned to Venezuela, unaware her body had become a commodity in the name of science.",
      "Arelis only learned her daughter had been used for research two years after her death, when NBC News and Noticias Telemundo \u2014 as part of a broader investigation of the U.S. body industry \u2014\u00a0published the names of hundreds of people whose unclaimed bodies were sent to the Fort Worth-based University of North Texas Health Science Center.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very painful thing,\u201d Arelis said in Spanish, in an interview from her home in a small town in western Venezuela. \u201cShe\u2019s not a little animal to be butchered, to be cut up.\u201d",
      "What happened to Aurimar was a matter of money, part of a pattern NBC News uncovered over the past two years: Across the United States, vulnerable people\u2019s bodies often are mistreated and their families\u2019 wishes disregarded as overwhelmed local officials grapple with rising numbers of unclaimed dead amid widespread opioid addiction, surging homelessness and increasingly fractured families. Reporters found that county coroners, medical institutions and others repeatedly failed to contact reachable family members before declaring bodies unclaimed.",
      "In some cases, people were buried in paupers\u2019 fields as their loved ones reported them missing and searched for them. In others, corpses were sent to medical schools, biotech companies and for-profit body brokers without consent.",
      "Aurimar was one of about 2,350 people whose bodies were sent to the University of North Texas Health Science Center since 2019 under agreements with two local counties, which helped the center bring in about $2.5 million a year and saved the counties hundreds of thousands of dollars in cremation and burial costs, according to financial records.",
      "Hundreds of the bodies were used for student training or research. Others were leased out to medical technology companies that require human remains to develop products and train doctors on them. Some, including Aurimar\u2019s, were used for both.",
      "Donated bodies play a key role in medical education and the biotechnology industry, helping surgeons build their skills and researchers develop potentially lifesaving treatments. While using unclaimed bodies for this purpose remains legal in much of the country, including Texas, it\u2019s widely viewed as unethical because of the absence of consent and the pain it can inflict on survivors.",
      "Reporters have identified two dozen other cases in which families learned weeks, months or years later that a relative\u2019s body had been provided to the Health Science Center. Eleven of those families only learned what happened from NBC News and Noticias Telemundo \u2014 including five, in addition to Aurimar\u2019s loved ones, who were horrified to find their relative\u2019s names on the list of unclaimed bodies published by the news outlets this fall.",
      "In response to NBC News\u2019 findings, the Health Science Center suspended its body donation program, fired the officials who ran it and pledged to stop using unclaimed bodies. Spokesperson Andy North did not answer questions about Aurimar\u2019s case, but said in a statement to reporters that the center extends apologies to all the \u201cindividuals and families impacted\u201d and has \u201ctaken multiple corrective actions.\u201d",
      "In many of the cases NBC News uncovered, the people whose bodies went unclaimed were homeless, struggling with drug addiction or estranged from their families.",
      "Aurimar was none of these. She was in constant touch with her mother \u2014 speaking to her just hours before she died. Her family immediately scrambled to scrape together the thousands of dollars it would have cost to have her body repatriated to Venezuela, believing falsely month after month that her remains were preserved in a Dallas morgue.",
      "Instead, what followed were a cascade of bureaucratic breakdowns and communication failures. The Dallas County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office had Arelis\u2019 cellphone number on file, but there\u2019s no record in documents obtained by NBC News that the agency attempted to call her before declaring Aurimar\u2019s body abandoned. The agency declined to comment.",
      "Throughout this ordeal, Arelis has struggled \u2014 from a home with no internet, in a country with no diplomatic ties to the U.S. \u2014 to reclaim her daughter\u2019s body.",
      "Until then, she said, she can\u2019t truly begin to mourn.",
      "\u201cEvery night I say, \u2018My God, why did you take my daughter?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t accept my daughter\u2019s death. Not yet.\u201d"

The show reportedly began casting and filming this summer, with contestants performing physical tasks akin to challenges staged on Donaldson\u2019s YouTube channel.",
      "But Amazon\u2019s investment in Donaldson \u2014 as well as the initial hype around the show\u2019s announcement \u2014 has been overshadowed in recent months as Donaldson faced the most intense scrutiny of his career.",
      "Donaldson, 26, is one of the internet\u2019s most recognizable creators, having grown a multimillion-dollar company that employs hundreds of people in North Carolina and pumps out videos featuring competitions and stunts that regularly attract tens of millions of views. His most-viewed video on YouTube is his re-enactment of the Netflix show \u201cSquid Game,\u201d in which contestants faced elimination challenges similar to those on the show (without the death element) to win the $456,000 prize.",
      "While some of his challenges have raised eyebrows, he had largely averted public fallout \u2014 until August, when The New York Times reported that some contestants said they sustained injuries and had inadequate access to food and medical care while they were filming the show in Las Vegas.",
      "A spokesperson for Donaldson said at the time that the shoot \u201cwas unfortunately complicated\u201d by a variety of factors, including \u201cextreme weather, and other unexpected logistical and communications issues.\u201d The spokesperson added that \u201cvirtually all\u201d participants who were invited to proceed to the upcoming Toronto shoot \u201centhusiastically accepted.\u201d",
      "Around the same time, online commentators accused former longtime MrBeast channel collaborator Ava Kris Tyson of \u201cgrooming.\u201d Tyson denied the allegations and announced her departure from the channel in July. A third-party legal probe, commissioned by Donaldson, found that allegations of sexual misconduct directed at his company were baseless.",
      "Concerns over safety on set followed \u201cBeast Games\u201d after it continued production in Toronto. And in September, a handful of contestants filed a lawsuit in California alleging they were \u201cshamelessly exploited\u201d and subjected to \u201cunreasonable, unsafe\u201d working conditions.",
      "The class-action lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, names Donaldson\u2019s production company and Amazon Prime as defendants. Representatives for Donaldson and Amazon did not comment on the lawsuit at the time. A lawyer for the plaintiffs said in an email Wednesday that \u201cas this is an ongoing legal matter, the attorneys and related parties are not conducting interviews.\u201d Representatives for Amazon and Donaldson declined to comment.",
      "In a recent appearance on \u201cThis Past Weekend with Theo Von,\u201d Von asked Donaldson about whether issues around his production were \u201coverblown.\u201d In response, Donaldson said it was \u201cimpossible for there never to be anything negative\u201d with such a large production.",
      "He also responded to an X user who asked whether the \u201cBeast Games\u201d show was \u201cthe same one where a lot of contestants complained of terrible conditions.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have tons of behind the scenes dropping when the show does to show how blown out of proportion these claims were,\u201d Donaldson wrote on Nov. 25. \u201cJust can\u2019t release it now because it would spoil the games.\u201d",
      "Promotion around the show has been relatively muted. Donaldson posted a teaser trailer this month on social media and announced the release date.",
      "\u201cI spent over a year creating this 10 episode competition series, breaking 40 world records, building the craziest sets in entertainment history, featuring 1,000 players, and a $5,000,000 grand prize!\u201d he wrote. \u201cI poured everything I have into this show, I\u2019ll see you December 19th on @PrimeVideo.\u201d",
      "The trailer kicks off with Donaldson saying \u201cstart the timer\u201d while a group of contestants, wearing blue jumpsuits with numbers on them, stand in individual, neon-illuminated platforms facing a 10-minute countdown.",
      "It also teases what appears to be some of the challenges, including one that involves monster trucks and another that looks like it\u2019s on a boat. Some contestants hold their hands on their faces, appearing stressed, or applaud in excitement. One person dives out of a helicopter. Donaldson high-fives some contestants in the trailer. People in all-black, face-covering suits also hold bags labeled with dollar signs and drop money into piles.",
      "Donaldson said on Von\u2019s podcast, \u201cIt\u2019s fun to create environments that have never been created before and almost just see what people do.\u201d",
      "Amazon did not provide any screeners to NBC News before the show\u2019s launch, saying in an email that the studio wants to preserve \u201cthe MrBeast fashion of a \u2018surprise and delight\u2019 moment for fans, and to protect the integrity of the competition series and spoilers.\u201d",
      "The first two episodes will drop at noon ET/9 a.m. PT Thursday, with additional episodes rolling out weekly. There are a total of 10 episodes.",
      "\u201cBeast Games is for everyone,\u201d Donaldson told Von."

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The movie, premiering this month, is based on real events in the early 1990s, when a group of young people in Cuba were looking for freedom from government repression.",
    "story": [
      "A coming-of-age movie with a dramatic punk rock twist has a storyline that may sound unreal, but it's based on true events.",
      "In \"Los Frikis,\" set in early 1990s Cuba, hundreds of young, disenfranchised Cubans inject themselves with HIV during the early years of the AIDS epidemic, hoping to escape political repression by going inside government-run clinics, or sanitariums.",
      "Based on true events, the film takes its title from the Spanish translation of the word \u201cfreaky,\u201d referring to the punk rock movement that came together in Cuba during the 1980s and 1990s.",
      "\u201cI grew up in Miami, I have Cuban family, Cuban friends, but I didn\u2019t know this story specifically, so it was very important for me to tell it,\u201d said one of the movie's leads, Puerto Rican Guatemalan actor Adria Arjona.",
      "Arjona, who starred earlier this year in the romantic comedy crime movie \"Hit Man\" and is known for her roles in the series \"Andor\" and \"True Detective,\" spoke to NBC News alongside two of the movie's co-stars, H\u00e9ctor Medina and Eros de la Puente.",
      "\"Los Frikis\" was written and directed by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz, creators of \"The Peanut Butter Falcon,\" the 2019 comedy drama about a young man with Down syndrome who escapes from a care facility.",
      "During the AIDS crisis, Cuba's sanitariums drew both praise and criticism. While they were credited with containing the spread of HIV on the communist island, the clinics were described as \u201ca pretty prison\u201d by Dr. Jonathan Mann, the first AIDS director at the World Health Organization.",
      "According to an article in\u00a0The Lancet, Cuba had 927 cases of HIV seropositivity and 187 cases of AIDS as of May 1993. By comparison, neighboring Puerto Rico, with roughly one-third the population of Cuba, had over 8,000 cases of AIDS at the time, and New York City, with a population closer in size to Cuba, had 43,000 patients with AIDS then.",
      "But Cuba\u2019s health policy led to \"unintended consequences,\" The New York Times wrote in 2012 about this period.",
      "\u201cTo stay out, some Cubans tried to avoid testing. But a few others, usually teenagers estranged from their families, deliberately got themselves infected to get in,\u201d\u00a0The New York Times reported.",
      "Patients were initially confined to the medical center by the military. But life inside, which ultimately inspired \u201cLos Frikis,\u201d could also be less austere than what these punk rockers faced on the streets.",
      "\u201cInmates got food, medical care and their old salaries; theater troupes and art classes formed. Gay men could live together, which was not true in the macho culture outside,\u201d\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0reported.",
      "\u201cLos Frikis\u201d tells the story of this second young group, who lived in a Cuba that was increasingly isolated after the fall of the Berlin Wall\u00a0in 1989 and the ensuing demise of the Soviet Union and the communist bloc. Fidel Castro\u2019s revolutionary government cracked down in response to dissidents and others who didn't fit in.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll throw you in jail for anything here. It\u2019s impossible to survive without breaking the law,\u201d Paco (played by Medina), one of the punk rockers in the film, says.",
      "Paco, like other young people, believed he could escape from government repression by entering a sanitarium after injecting himself with HIV.\u00a0Punk bands started forming at these medical centers, and recorded cassettes inspired hundreds to self-inject.",
      "But many would soon face a rude awakening as they died of AIDS; it would be years before the current treatments that have made it possible to live with HIV as a manageable condition.",
      "Medina \u2014 who will play Ra\u00fal Castro, the brother of Fidel Castro and the former president of Cuba, in an upcoming movie with Al Pacino \u2014\u00a0said that he\u00a0prepared for his role in \u201cLos Frikis\u201d by speaking to a sanitarium doctor who now lives in the U.S.",
      "The doctor had worked at Los Cocos, a sanitarium about 30 minutes\u00a0southwest from Havana by car. He told Medina that it was painful to remember, since he had become friends with his patients who later died of AIDS.",
      "Medina said much of the punk music that Los Frikis made at the time was not preserved. But viewers could still connect with the very positive message of their culture in the film, which shows how they found freedom in friendship, love and the communities they created at the sanitariums.",
      "This message, Arjona said, transforms the \u201cFrikis\u201d from scary outcasts to relatable people who are vulnerable and want to heal from different traumas.",
      "In the movie, Arjona\u2019s character, Mar\u00eda, tells Gustavo (played by de la Puente) that \u201cyou can\u2019t expect to hold onto anything.\u201d",
      "Faced with the deaths of her peers, Mar\u00eda poetically says that loved ones, sunsets and even cherished animals like horses eventually disappear.",
      "This makes de la Puente think about one of the most enduring messages from the Frikis movement.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need many things to have everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI am referring in the context of the film, and how that group of people becomes a family and creates such a beautiful experience in a moment from the history of Cuba that was very empty.\u201d",
      "\u201cLos Frikis\u201d releases in New York and Los Angeles on Friday and\u00a0select movie theaters nationwide Dec. 25."

      "The northern giant hornet has not been detected in three years, prompting\u00a0officials to announce its eradication from the United States,\u00a0the Washington and U.S. Agriculture departments said in a\u00a0joint statement Wednesday.",
      "Officials said the multiyear effort to eradicate the species, which began in 2019, involved \"extensive collaboration between state, federal, and international government agencies as well as significant support from community members and groups.\"",
      "\"I'm incredibly proud of our team, which has dedicated years of hard work to safeguarding our state and the nation from this invasive threat to our native pollinators and agriculture,\" Washington Agriculture Director Derek Sandison said in the statement.",
      "Sven Spichiger, the department\u2019s pest program manager, pointed to the public's help, noting that \"all of our nest detections resulted directly or indirectly from public reports.\" He added that half of all confirmed hornet detections also came from the public.",
      "\"We are proud of this landmark victory in the fight against invasive species,\" Mark Davidson, deputy administrator at the U.S. Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said in the statement. \"The success of this effort demonstrates what\u2019s possible when agencies and communities unite toward a common goal.\"",
      "Officials first detected the northern giant hornet in British Columbia in August 2019. It was detected in the United States, in Washington state, in December 2019.",
      "The Washington Agriculture Department \"found and eradicated\" a hornet nest in October 2020 and three more in August and September 2021. It said it continued trapping efforts through this year.",
      "The murder hornets could have posed a \u201csignificant threat\u201d to honeybees, as well as other pollinators and other native insects, officials said, noting the species has the ability to kill an entire honeybee hive in 90 minutes.",
      "The insects are also a threat to humans, as their sting is more dangerous than a honeybee\u2019s, officials said.",
      "In October, a person reported a suspicious hornet sighting in Kitsap County, Washington, officials said, but the state Agriculture Department was never able to obtain the hornet, so it could not be tested to confirm whether the species of murder hornets popped up in a new area.",
      "The Washington Agriculture Department said that it placed traps in the area and that it is encouraging others to report if they see any hornets. So far, efforts by the agency have not yielded any more evidence that murder hornets have infiltrated the area, but it will keep trapping there in 2025.",
      "\"Luckily, we were already on the lookout for hornets when they showed up in Washington in 2019,\" Spichiger said. \"Although they are now eradicated from the state, we'll always be keeping an eye out for them and encourage community members to do the same. They got here once, and they could do it again.\""

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Lawyers and pro-democracy advocates are in the early stages of building a nationwide network of specialists aimed at defending and protecting people who may be targeted for retribution once President-elect Donald Trump takes office, according to multiple people involved in the effort.",
      "The sprawling initiative is intended to go far beyond legal assistance for those potentially subjected to criminal or civil investigations in a new Trump administration.",
      "Those working to create the infrastructure said that in addition to lawyers, they are recruiting accountants to help people who may find their taxes under audit, employment experts to advise those who could be fired or reassigned without cause, public relations professionals to assist anyone whose reputations might be tarnished by accusations and even psychologists to help potential targets manage the stress that comes with being in the federal government\u2019s crosshairs.",
      "The services would be free, underwritten by contributions to nonprofit groups steering the effort or through web-based donation sites, those involved said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s necessary because we\u2019re seeing threats of the improper use of government and investigative power like we haven\u2019t seen in modern times in our country,\u201d said Norm Eisen, a co-founder of the State Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonprofit group that offers pro bono legal services, who is assisting the effort. \u201cThe pro bono bar and nonprofit legal organizations need to be ready to provide strong support to those who are targeted unfairly.\u201d",
      "The structure is still taking shape, most likely as a loose-knit blend of new and existing nonprofit groups. A person familiar with the planning described a push to start a group that would offer security and public relations assistance to current or former officials facing what they believe to be retaliatory action.",
      "An incoming president doesn\u2019t normally spark that level of foreboding. But Trump has made no secret that he feels he has been wronged, and he has suggested his perceived political enemies should pay a price. Over the years he has singled out judges, prosecutors, lawmakers, journalists, governors and state election officials who he says have failed in their jobs.",
      "When he takes office again, Trump will preside over a vast law enforcement apparatus capable of leaving those who\u2019ve crossed him bankrupt, imprisoned or both, people involved in the effort to try to protect them said. Fending off such investigations can be financially ruinous, even if defendants escape punishment. A legal defense can quickly cross the six-figure mark.",
      "In a recent interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Trump name-checked the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, saying members should be jailed.",
      "Moderator Kristen Welker asked Trump whether his choice for FBI director, Kash Patel, would pursue investigations into Trump\u2019s political enemies.",
      "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.",
      "When Welker pressed whether he wanted to see that happen, Trump said: \u201cIf they were crooked, if they did something wrong, if they have broken the law, probably. They went after me. You know, they went after me, and I did nothing wrong.\u201d",
      "Mark Zaid, a private national security attorney who has been recruiting people for the initiative, said in an interview: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to expect other than we listen to his promises. And there\u2019s not a great track record with keeping promises, but when it comes to retribution and retaliation, he seems to keep them more often than he breaks them.\u201d",
      "One way to short-circuit a potential investigation is for the sitting president, Joe Biden, to pre-emptively pardon those who might face scrutiny. Biden gave a sweeping pardon to his son Hunter, covering any offense he may have committed over the past 10 years, effectively shielding him from the incoming administration.",
      "NBC News reached out to two dozen people who have been mentioned by Trump or his allies as potential targets for investigation. About half said they don\u2019t want pre-emptive pardons because they\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Others are uncertain or said they would accept pardons.",
      "People close to Rod Rosenstein, a deputy attorney general in the first Trump administration, and Robert Hur, the former special counsel who declined to prosecute Biden for his handling of classified documents, said neither wants a pardon.",
      "Two sources familiar with the matter said Jack Smith, the federal prosecutor who brought a pair of indictments against Trump after he left office in 2021, has privately made it clear he doesn\u2019t want a pardon.",
      "Smith is confident that he has done nothing wrong and that any effort to prosecute him would result in vindication, they said. Others have said publicly that they don\u2019t want pre-emptive pardons, including former CIA Director John Brennan and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who as a House member led the first impeachment trial against Trump.",
      "Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the chair of the Jan. 6 committee, has said he would accept a pardon from Biden. A spokesman for the vice chair, former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cIf he offers it to me \u2014 or other members of the committee \u2014 I think I would accept it,\u201d Thompson said in a CNN interview last week.",
      "So would Stephanie Grisham, a former Trump White House press secretary who wrote a book criticizing her former boss and spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August.",
      "Asked about a potential pardon from Biden, Grisham wrote in an email message: \u201cI have not heard that he is considering one for me, but I would not turn it down.\u201d",
      "A former national security official said he was sufficiently worried about Trump\u2019s return to power that he had been \u201cseriously thinking about leaving the country.\u201d",
      "After he visited a foreign country and checked homes to rent, he \u201cdecided on reflection I didn\u2019t want to do that because that gives the appearance of guilt.\u201d",
      "If Trump appointees were to launch groundless investigations merely to avenge him, they\u2019d face serious obstacles, legal experts said.",
      "Career FBI agents know they would be violating their own policies if they focused their fearsome investigatory powers on targets without good reasons. If they did so knowingly and for corrupt reasons, they could be committing a crime.",
      "Justice Department lawyers who participated in baseless criminal probes could face discipline by the department\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility and by their state bar associations.",
      "A network of legal allies will most likely not deter the Trump administration from targeting critics, but it could make it harder for the future White House, said Rosa Brooks, a former Defense Department official who is now at Georgetown Law.",
      "\u201cTo whatever extent Trump and his inner circle may think these are going to be easy targets, I don\u2019t think they will be easy targets, because there will be resources in place to ensure that they have really robust legal defenses against politically motivated investigations and prosecutions,\u201d Brooks said."

    "summary": "The House Ethics Committee has voted to publicly release a report detailing the findings of an investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The House Ethics Committee has voted to publicly release a report detailing the findings of an investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News \u2014 a reversal from last month when the panel deadlocked on whether to publish the report.",
      "The report is expected to be made public as soon as this week, after the House finishes its final business of the year: voting to keep the government open.",
      "The committee's yearslong investigation included looking into allegations that Gaetz had engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, gave special favors to people with whom he had personal relationships and obstructed the House probe.",
      "Gaetz resigned from the House last month after President-elect Donald Trump said he intended to nominate him for attorney general.",
      "Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration for the position just eight days after Trump's announcement, after he faced scrutiny from senators and details emerged publicly about the testimony of women who spoke to the Ethics Committee. He has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "CNN was first to report the news of the committee's vote.",
      "An attorney for one woman interviewed by the panel alleged that Gaetz paid for sex in Florida, a state where prostitution is illegal. The same woman told the panel that Gaetz had sex with her friend, who was 17 years old at the time.",
      "Just before the Thanksgiving holiday, the Ethics Committee met for hours behind closed doors about Gaetz but could not reach an agreement about releasing the report. A majority of the House this month voted against a resolution that would have forced the committee to release the report; instead, the House sent the matter back to the committee.",
      "The matter appeared to be dead until Wednesday's development. The release of the report is significant given that Gaetz remains a close ally of and is in regular contact with Trump and has flirted with a bid for governor of Florida in 2026.",
      "The release of the Gaetz report goes against the wishes of House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who had argued repeatedly that releasing a report into someone who is no longer a member of Congress would be \u201cterrible precedent.\u201d",
      "The Ethics Committee only has jurisdiction over current \u2014 not former \u2014 members of Congress.

    "title": "How Dave McCormick won 2024's closest Senate race \u2014 and how he'll shape the GOP in Washington",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Sen.-elect Dave McCormick was one of the first Republicans to test-drive the party's main strategy against Kamala Harris.",
    "story": [
      "For months, Dave McCormick knew a victory in Pennsylvania\u2019s critical Senate race was far from certain.",
      "Public polling over the summer had him trailing Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, a three-term incumbent and state political scion, by as many as 14 percentage points. McCormick\u2019s own polling, he told NBC News, had him down nearly 10 points, too.",
      "But, said McCormick, Pennsylvania\u2019s senator-elect, he could feel the momentum shifting on the ground, particularly when he campaigned before traditionally Democratic constituencies, including the state\u2019s large Jewish community and Hispanic enclaves in the Lehigh Valley, and with tradesmen in the state.",
      "It was an Italian festival he attended late this summer in Casey\u2019s hometown, Scranton, that stood out most, though. He and his wife started the day by attending a church service.",
      "\u201cWent to the service in the morning, and the entire service is in Italian,\u201d McCormick said, adding: \u201cAnd then you walk outside into the main square of Scranton, and there\u2019s all these Italian food stands, and it\u2019s full. And a lot of people would come up to me and say: \u2018Hey, we got you. We\u2019re with you.\u2019",
      "\u201cAnd this is Lackawanna County, which is Bob Casey\u2019s literal backyard,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018Man, I can feel it. I got some energy here.\u2019\u201d",
      "The last time Casey shared a ballot with a presidential candidate was in 2012, when he outran President Barack Obama across Pennsylvania and carried Lackawanna County by 35 points. This year, his margin of victory there shrunk to just 8.4 points. In neighboring Luzerne County, which Casey won by 11 points in 2012, McCormick won by 15 points this year. Those performances in the state\u2019s northeastern corner played a huge role in Casey\u2019s going from a 13-point victory in 2018 to defeat by just more than 15,000 votes last month.",
      "Democrats argue that McCormick\u2019s win is more a product of Donald Trump\u2019s strong performance in the state, which boosted Republicans down-ballot. (Notably, the GOP nominees for state attorney general, treasurer and auditor general won more votes than McCormick.) They also point to outsized spending on behalf of McCormick\u2019s bid from three well-funded super PACs, as well as general voter anger with high prices.",
      "\u201cI think if you had to boil it down to one or two words, it\u2019d be \u2018costs\u2019 or \u2018cost of living,\u2019\u201d Casey, a former hedge fund executive who made fighting \u201cgreedflation\u201d a core theme of his campaign, said in an interview. He also described Trump as \u201cabout as strong a Republican candidate as they\u2019ve had for president in my lifetime.\u201d",
      "But Republicans say all that is a convenient oversimplification. McCormick seemingly corrected every misstep from Mehmet Oz\u2019s failed GOP Senate campaign in Pennsylvania in 2022 \u2014 including effectively neutralizing the carpetbagger narrative Democrats deployed against both Republicans \u2014\u00a0and vigorously campaigned across the state, as well as gave Republicans an early blueprint of how to handle Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 taking over the Democratic ticket from President Joe Biden.",
      "McCormick and allies saw other factors that contributed to his win, too, including extensive courting of the state\u2019s Jewish community and investments in reaching the same unreliable voters Trump sought, which were highlighted by advertising during football games. And after internal data showed a substantial number of voters did not have strong opinions about Casey, a three-term incumbent, they hammered away at defining him as ineffective and unable to deliver change.",
      "Now, McCormick, the only GOP candidate for the Senate or governor in the seven presidential battleground states to defeat his Democratic opponent this year, will be one of the most-watched senators entering Washington. NBC News spoke with more than a dozen Republicans and Democrats, many of whom worked on the Senate race, to discuss the makings of his victory and how he is readying to enter the next Congress.",
      "'The reality was much more favorable for me than it was in the case of Dr. Oz'",
      "No message stuck more in Sen. John Fetterman\u2019s successful 2022 Senate bid than the idea that Oz was not a real Pennsylvanian. Democrats thought they would have good fortune running that playbook back against McCormick, who spent years living in Connecticut and bought his current Pennsylvania home in the run-up to his 2022 Senate bid. (McCormick\u2019s campaign said that that was so his daughter could complete high school there and that his lease ended as of June.)",
      "Yet whereas Fetterman succeeded, Casey fell flat \u2014 in no small part because McCormick, a Bloomsburg native, went to great lengths to highlight his long-standing ties to the state. Ironically, ads filmed at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, were a core part of his message about being a tried-and-true Pennsylvanian, helping him relate to the state\u2019s significant veteran and service member population.",
      "McCormick said, \u201cFirst of all, the reality was much more favorable for me than it was in the case of Dr. Oz,\u201d whose main tie to Pennsylvania was a brief stint at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cI grew up in Pennsylvania, which he did not. I played football; I wrestled. I grew up in a small town. I\u2019m a seventh-generation Pennsylvanian.\u201d",
      "McCormick made brandishing his Pennsylvania credentials core to his ad campaign.",
      "\u201cIt was much less responding and debating whether I had ever lived in Connecticut, which, of course, I had lived in Connecticut,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cAnd it was much more going to the pictures and the true narrative.\u201d",
      "He pointed to two ads that he said \u201crepresented strategically how we thought about addressing that question,\u201d one highlighting the lessons he learned as a wrestler growing up in Pennsylvania and the other about his time at West Point.",
      "The ads \u201creinforced the Pennsylvania cred,\u201d McCormick said, adding of the latter ad: \u201cIt reinforced that, wait a second, this guy\u2019s a public servant. ... He\u2019s been willing to risk his life for his country that ran antithetical to the nasty commercials around, me being somebody who was trying to make money at the expense of others.\u201d",
      "A handful of Pennsylvania Democrats took issue with how the campaign to paint McCormick as a carpetbagger was executed.",
      "\u201cLook, the McCormick team, Dave, they were good,\u201d one said. \u201cMan, they ran a good campaign. And the Connecticut stuff, I think they tried way too hard to make that stick. In this electorate, it just didn\u2019t work.\u201d",
      "Casey\u2019s allies said the Connecticut attacks were an important piece of a broader campaign to diminish McCormick\u2019s standing. A Casey campaign strategist said McCormick\u2019s Connecticut residency \u201creally mattered in all of the polling\u201d the campaign had.",
      "\u201cWas it enough to crumble the roof? No,\u201d this person said. \u201cBut I think it was an important part of the campaign. It highlighted his character and trustworthiness. And the idea that it was irrelevant or didn\u2019t matter is ridiculous.\u201d",
      "But McCormick\u2019s Republican allies and advisers described the Connecticut focus as a grave miscalculation, an example of Democrats\u2019 trying to make a playbook that previously worked stick with someone when the facts differed.",
      "\u201cDr. Oz gave the Democrats a lot to work with in terms of showing that he wasn\u2019t from Pennsylvania,\u201d said a Republican who worked on the race. \u201cAnd Dave McCormick did not.\u201d",
      "Authoring the Harris playbook",
      "No major Republican campaign was quicker to embrace the change at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket from Biden to Harris than the McCormick team. When Republicans, including Trump, were still working through how to run against Harris, McCormick\u2019s campaign launched a digital ad just two days after the switch that ended up foreshadowing the playbook Republicans ran against her across the map: highlighting her policy statements in 2019.",
      "The ad soon went viral. One reason the McCormick team was so quick on the draw was that in Pennsylvania, they saw Biden, a native son with decades of experience in the state, as a more formidable opponent than Harris, even after his disastrous debate against Trump.",
      "\u201cPennsylvania was maybe one place Biden would have fared better than Kamala Harris,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cScranton Joe. 50 years. Campaigning for president six or seven times in Pennsylvania. Knew every county commissioner. A lot of the union guys were in his camp. So I thought he had a formidable Pennsylvania presence.\u201d",
      "Matt Gruda, McCormick\u2019s campaign manager, said the campaign\u2019s initial anti-Harris ad, which connected her past comments with positive things Casey had to say about her, was the most viral moment he has ever been a part of.",
      "\u201cIt set the tone. It allowed us to clearly define how we were going to win this race,\u201d he said, adding that the race would have been \u201cdefinitely different\u201d had Biden remained in the campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s better or worse for Casey. We were probably the only campaign in the country that was actually excited about the idea of Kamala Harris being the top of the ticket.\u201d",
      "Casey remained close to Biden after the debate, standing by him and campaigning with him even as other vulnerable Democratic senators stayed at a distance. When Harris took over, Casey was quick to talk up her talents. Seeking to bolster his independent bona fides as Election Day neared, Casey released an ad highlighting areas of agreement with Trump on trade and China. Much earlier in the cycle, he criticized the Biden administration on a handful of fronts, including a pause in natural gas exports and a fight over funding for school archery and hunting programs.",
      "\u201cNo, not from Biden,\u201d the Casey campaign strategist said when asked about efforts to distance Casey from the top of the ticket. \u201cLook, we talked about being bipartisan.\u201d",
      "Now, an open question for McCormick\u2019s term is whether he carves out his own path in Trump\u2019s Washington. The previous GOP senator to represent Pennsylvania, Pat Toomey, voted to convict Trump after his second impeachment trial following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. In his first run for the Senate, McCormick lost out on Trump\u2019s endorsement after he refused to say the 2020 election was stolen.",
      "McCormick told NBC News in July that Pennsylvanians \u201ccan count on\u201d him to be his \u201cown person\u201d in Congress.",
      "\u201cWhen I agree with President Trump, which I do on many things, like the border and the economy and China, then I\u2019ll speak loud and clear,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I disagree, I will also be clear about those positions.\u201d",
      "Asked about Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard, McCormick said he has \u201cgenerally\u201d thought Trump\u2019s choices \u201chave been great,\u201d adding that he believes Trump \u201chas a mandate.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was very specific even about a number of the people that he\u2019s nominated, that they were going to play really important, key roles in his administration,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cSo he\u2019s, by and large, doing everything he said he would do.",
      "\u201cWe in the Senate need to do everything we can to make sure the president has his team as quickly as possible to drive a very extreme agenda, extreme in the best sense of the word, radically good in terms of bringing about the change that\u2019s required,\u201d McCormick continued, adding: \u201cNow, in the Senate, I have a responsibility to advise and consent, and so I\u2019m trying to exercise that. I\u2019m going to meet with every single candidate. I\u2019m going to ask the questions that I think a responsible senator would do.\u201d",
      "Democrats did not express optimism that McCormick will deviate from Trump in any significant way early on. Casey said that question \u201cwill be answered\u201d by how McCormick votes on Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks. (A senior aide to a GOP senator said, \u201cI doubt he\u2019s going to try to sink anyone, just because that\u2019d be an audacious move as a freshman.\u201d)",
      "Interestingly, it was Casey\u2019s closeness to the top of his ticket that McCormick\u2019s allies saw as the biggest factor allowing them to drive home their message of change.",
      "\u201cI think this is something that Democratic candidates around the country missed,\u201d a senior McCormick campaign adviser said. \u201cBiden and Harris thought that \u2018oh, the border bill is bipartisan. And the infrastructure bill is bipartisan. Oh, and the CHIPS bill is bipartisan.\u2019 In this era, the independent voter is looking for how you disagree with people in your base, not how you agree with the other side.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "ATLANTA \u2014 Georgia prosecutors called on a state appeals court to reject President-elect Donald Trump's bid to dismiss the election interference case against him, saying his arguments are \"underbaked\" and \"should be ignored.\"",
      "Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis\u2019 office is pushing forward with its case against Trump and more than a dozen of his allies, which began in August 2023. Attorneys for Trump argue that the case should be dropped in light of Trump's recent election and the immunity from prosecution that is often afforded to sitting presidents.",
      "Prosecutors disagreed.",
      "Trump \"does not make a specific request based on reasoned argument but expresses his preference that this Court independently perform extensive and novel legal analysis without guidance from the parties in order to arrive at a general result: the dismissal of all charges against him,\" Willis' office said in a filing Wednesday with the Georgia Court of Appeals, which described Trump's request as \"procedurally and legally inadequate.\"",
      "Trump's attorneys disputed those characterizations in a subsequent filing Wednesday, saying his request \"was intended to alert this Court to a jurisdictional issue and his legal position on how and when the issue should be addressed.\"",
      "\"Contrary to the State\u2019s response, it did not 'demand' this Court do anything,\" Trump's lawyers wrote.",
      "A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the court filings.",

    "summary": "Experts say Kennedy\u2019s long history of anti-vaccine activism could translate into significant changes to childhood immunization policies in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr. meets with Senate Republicans on the Hill this week in an effort to secure his confirmation as secretary of health and human services, his biggest hurdle may be convincing them that he doesn\u2019t hold extreme views on vaccines.",
      "That could prove difficult, however, as Kennedy has spent decades publicly opposing vaccines, including making repeated false claims about vaccines being linked to autism and his involvement with Children\u2019s Health Defense, a leading anti-vaccine group.",
      "In recent days, concerns over how Kennedy might wield his influence as health secretary have grown. Last week, The New York Times reported that a lawyer for Kennedy who is reviewing candidates for jobs at HHS filed a petition to the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 to revoke approval of the polio vaccine. The petition, the Times said, was on behalf of the Informed Consent Action Network, an anti-vaccine group with ties to Kennedy.",
      "On Monday, President-elect Donald Trump added to the controversy, saying during a news conference that he believes there are \u201cproblems\u201d with vaccines and suggesting they may be linked to rising autism rates. Trump said, however, that he\u2019s a \u201cbig believer\u201d in the polio vaccine.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a polio survivor and a potential key figure in Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, fired a warning shot at Kennedy in a statement Friday.",
      "\u201cEfforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d McConnell said. The polio vaccine was approved in the U.S. in 1955, and it has prevented an estimated 20 million cases of paralysis in children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Experts say Kennedy\u2019s long history of anti-vaccine activism could translate into significant changes to childhood immunization policies in the U.S. and could undermine decades of progress in preventing diseases like measles, polio and whooping cough.",
      "A Kennedy spokesperson did not respond to a new request for comment. In an earlier statement to NBC News, Kennedy spokeswoman Katie Miller said, \u201cThe Polio Vaccine should be available to the public and thoroughly and properly studied.\u201d",
      "Kennedy\u2019s previous comments conflict with that statement, however. On the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d last year, Kennedy said there\u2019s \u201cno vaccine that\u2019s safe and effective\u201d and linked the polio vaccine to cancer.",
      "Advisory committees",
      "Childhood vaccination policies in the U.S. are complex, with states holding much of the authority.",
      "Still, experts say that Kennedy could wield enormous influence over childhood vaccinations.",
      "If confirmed as health secretary, Kennedy would oversee a suite of health agencies that includes the CDC, the FDA, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, among others.",
      "His greatest influence on vaccines, experts say, could come through the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, an independent group of health experts that helps the agency make recommendations for states and insurers on what vaccines to cover, including childhood vaccinations.",
      "The committee reports to the CDC director. The CDC director then informs the HHS secretary of the immunization recommendations. Last month, Trump tapped Dr. Dave Weldon, a former congressman from Florida and a physician who has made false claims about vaccines, to lead the CDC.",
      "According to KFF, a nonprofit group that researches health policy issues, the HHS secretary has the authority to appoint new members to the committee, and advisory committee members can be replaced at the discretion of the secretary.",
      "There are currently 15 voting members of ACIP, but the committee can have up to 19. Committee members generally serve four-year terms, and several members\u2019 terms are set to end in 2025, according to a committee roster. However, many will remain in place until 2028, unless Kennedy directs them to resign.",
      "Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy researcher at the University of California Law San Francisco, said she sees two potential scenarios: Kennedy could replace members of ACIP with anti-vaccine advocates who make recommendations that the CDC approves, or he could influence Weldon, as the CDC director, to reject ACIP recommendations. The CDC director is not required to sign off on the committee\u2019s recommendations, but usually does.",
      "Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases and a nonvoting member of ACIP, said that even if there\u2019s a shake-up at ACIP \u2014 and the CDC makes new recommendations against certain vaccines \u2014 parents may still choose to vaccinate their children. States are not required to follow the recommendations, but most do.",
      "\u201cAlthough this stuff can and will have an impact, most parents, I think, are still going to listen to the recommendation of their child\u2019s pediatrician,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about childhood vaccines, parents want to do what\u2019s best for their kids, and politics aside, that matters a lot more.\u201d",
      "Reiss noted, however, that ACIP\u2019s recommendations have direct implications for insurance and which vaccines are covered.",
      "Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies are required to cover vaccines that ACIP recommends.",
      "\u201cFor example, if the committee requests against giving children DTaP, or recommends against giving them at the ages they are now, those won\u2019t be covered by insurance,\u201d she said, referring to the vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough). Insurers could decide to cover them anyway, she added, but that\u2019ll be up to them.",

      "Federal prosecutors are looking into whether to charge Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of United Healthcare\u2019s CEO, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "If federal charges are filed, the New York state murder case against Mangione would have priority, the sources said.",
      "Mangione, 26, was indicted Tuesday on first-degree murder and other charges in the targeted killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who authorities said was shot from behind as he walked on a Manhattan sidewalk on Dec. 4.",
      "New York police said Mangione targeted Thompson, possibly because of the size of the private health insurance company he led. United Healthcare is the largest private health insurer in the United States.",
      "Mangione was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder in furtherance of terrorism, in addition to counts of second-degree murder and other counts.",
      "In New York, a first-degree murder charge needs a special circumstance beyond intent, like the killing of a witness, being a murder for hire, the killing of a police officer or the killing of someone in furtherance of terrorism.",
      "Karen Friedman Agnifilo, one of the attorneys representing  Mangione on the New York charges, said Wednesday night that they  \u201care ready to fight these charges in whatever court they are brought.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe federal government\u2019s reported decision to pile on top of an already overcharged first-degree murder and state terror case is highly unusual and raises serious constitutional and statutory double jeopardy concerns,\u201d she said.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said Tuesday that the ambush killing of Thompson was \"intended to cause shock and attention and intimidation.\"",
      "Mangione, wearing a hooded a jacket and a mask, waited for nearly an hour near a hotel for Thompson to arrive and then shot him from behind with a 9 mm handgun equipped with a suppressor at around 6:45 a.m., Bragg said.",
      "Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Dec. 9 after he was recognized from security photos New York police and the FBI distributed.",
      "He is being held in Pennsylvania and has contested extradition to New York. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutor's office in Manhattan, declined to comment.",
      "Representatives of the FBI and the New York Police Department also declined to comment.",
      "If he is convicted of either first-degree murder or second-degree murder as an act of terrorism, Mangione could face up to life in prison without parole, Bragg said. If he is convicted of a normal charge of second-degree murder, the maximum sentence is 25 years to life, Bragg said."

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 21:49:02 GMT",
    "summary": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed the first severe case of bird flu in a human. The patient is hospitalized in Louisiana.",
    "story": [
      "A person in Louisiana has been hospitalized with bird flu \u2014\u00a0the country\u2019s first severe human H5N1 infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\u201cThe patient is experiencing severe respiratory illness related to H5N1 infection and is currently hospitalized in critical condition,\u201d said Emma Herrock, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana Health Department.",
      "The CDC said the patient was likely exposed to the virus from a backyard flock, which would mark the first time such a flock has been associated with a bird flu infection in a U.S. resident.",
      "\u201cWhile an investigation into the source of this infection in Louisiana is ongoing, it is believed that the patient that was reported by Louisiana had exposure to sick or dead birds on their property,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, during a briefing Wednesday.",
      "The case was reported as a presumptive positive by Louisiana on Friday and later confirmed by CDC laboratory testing.",
      "Daskalakis said the Health Department was conducting an investigation, monitoring the patient's contacts for exposure and offering testing and antiviral medication as needed.",
      "The patient is over age 65 and had underlying medical conditions, Herrock said. She did not address questions about the patient's symptoms or the backyard flock.",
      "In the United States this year, 61 human cases of avian influenza have been reported. Wisconsin officials announced Wednesday that they had detected an additional probable case, in someone who was exposed to infected birds at a commercial poultry operation. That case is pending confirmation by the CDC.",
      "No person-to-person transmission of bird flu has been documented so far. Most cases in people have been mild, and they have been found among farmworkers exposed to the virus through interactions with infected poultry or cattle. Common symptoms in earlier cases have included pinkeye, coughs and sneezing.",
      "Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco who studies infectious diseases, said the Louisiana case highlights the risks of exposure outside of farms.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been focusing on dairy workers and poultry workers, but an emerging risk is handling dead birds in your backyard,\u201d he said.",
      "Daskalakis said the CDC is still working to better characterize the virus\u2019 genome, which will help researchers understand whether it has developed any concerning mutations that might allow it to spread from person to person.",
      "Early indicators in the Louisiana case suggest that the version of virus causing the infection is similar to what has been circulating in wild birds and poultry in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington state.",
      "A teenager in British Columbia was hospitalized in November after having contracted the same genotype of the bird flu virus. Canadian health officials were not able to determine the source of the teen's infection.",
      "\"What this illustrates is people can get really sick from bird flu, and to me it\u2019s related to the case in British Columbia,\" Chin-Hong said. \"These patients are both united by the same variant.\"",
      "The CDC said the development does not change its assessment of H5N1's immediate risk to public health, however, which it says remains \"low.\"",
      "H5N1 began circulating widely among wild birds in the U.S. in 2022 then spread to poultry farms and backyard flocks. At least 123 million birds have been killed or euthanized because of the virus since 2022, according to the CDC.",
      "This spring, bird flu began to spread among dairy cows, and at least 16 states have since detected the virus in cows.",
      "Research on dairy farms has shown the\u00a0virus can spread efficiently between mammals. Scientists have found that it likely spreads between farm animals through raw milk because infected cows shed large amounts of the virus through their mammary glands.",
      "Although there is no evidence of the virus spreading between humans, scientists are concerned that it could mutate and develop that ability, which could touch off the next pandemic.",
      "In the U.S., there have been two cases so far in which health officials could not determine the source of a person's exposure to bird flu. One was an infection in a California child reported in November. The other was in a hospitalized patient in Missouri, who tested positive for H5N1 in August and recovered.",
      "Daskalakis said the CDC considers the Louisiana case the first severe H5N1 infection because other conditions likely caused the hospitalization of the Missouri patient.",
      "Additionally, Delaware health officials reported a case of H5N1 this week in a person without known exposure to poultry or cattle. But CDC testing results could not confirm the virus was H5N1, Daskalakis said, and the case is listed as a \"probable.\""

      "The twins were born in September. Media reports said the mother, the infant twins and two more children had been deported. But\u00a0Immigration and Customs Enforcement told NBC News that it deported only the mother, whom it identified as Cristina Geraldyn Salazar-Hinojosa, 23, and that ICE does not deport U.S. citizens.",
      "\"ICE does not deport U.S. citizens. Any decision for minors with U.S. citizenship to depart the U.S. with their parents is up to the parents,\u201d an ICE spokesperson said.",
      "The children\u2019s father, Federico Arellano, is a U.S. citizen.",
      "The mother was scheduled for an immigration hearing but had to postpone it because of the emergency C-section, WOAI in San Antonio reported.",
      "ICE alleged Salazar-Hinojosa entered the U.S. illegally on June 28 through the Rio Grande Valley area. The spokesperson said she was released June 29 under the Alternatives to Detention program, pending her immigration proceedings.",
      "The spokesperson said Salazar-Hinojosa failed to show up to an Oct. 9 hearing and was ordered removed by a judge with the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review. DOJ did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Isaias Torres, an attorney for Salazar-Hinojosa's husband, told WOAI that \"this case shouldn\u2019t have gone to this extreme. There were options, legal options that were available and he was not given that opportunity.\u201d",
      "Torres did not immediately respond to a request from NBC News for comment.",
      "The attorney told KHOU in Houston that Salazar-Hinojosa missed the hearing because she was told by doctors to recover at home. He also said the family called the court to inform them and was told the hearing would be rescheduled. They were told in a later phone call to report to a Houston-area location to discuss their case but were arrested when they showed up, Torres told KHOU.",
      "Arellano tried to explain but ICE agents prevented him, attorneys told KHOU.",
      "\u201cThey were shocked and surprised that they were separated,\u201d Torres said.",
      "President Joe Biden has been criticized by Republicans who have said his policies have left the border open to illegal immigration. But in June, the Migration Policy Institute reported that Biden\u2019s deportations were on track to surpass those of Donald Trump's first administration.",
      "Trump was elected in November after vowing to conduct the largest mass deportation operation in American history. His pick to head ICE, Tim Homan, has said that the only way to not break up families under Trump\u2019s plan is to \u201csend them all back.\u201d",
      "People born in the United States \u2014 with the exception of children of certain foreign diplomats \u2014 are constitutionally guaranteed U.S. citizenship regardless of whether their parents are illegally here. Trump recently said in a \"Meet the Press\" exclusive interview that he wants to end that guarantee.",
      "In a 2021 report, the Government Accountability Office found that over about five years, ICE arrested 674, detained 121 and removed 70 people that the GAO said were potentially U.S. citizens. The GAO found ICE did not keep sufficient data on U.S. citizen deportations at the time."

The Dow's 10th-consecutive day of decline is now closer to becoming the worst losing streak in 50 years.

The study found that\u00a0the moon is likely 4.51 billion years old\u00a0\u2014 not 4.35 billion years old, as many scientists previously thought.

      "The Dane County Medical Examiner\u2019s office confirmed their identities in a press release Wednesday night, while in a separate statement, the school said, \u201cour hearts are heavy with these losses.\u201d",
      "The suspected shooter, 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow, a freshman at the school who was also known as Samantha, died on the way to hospital on Monday from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.",
      "\u201cALCS is a better school for the work of Erin West.\u00a0She brought her love of Jesus and love of people to our staff and school family all wrapped in a hug and topped with a smile,\u201d the school\u2019s statement said.",
      "The school said West worked as a substitute teacher for three years before taking a full-time staff role as an in-house substitute teacher and coordinator, \u201ca role tailor made for her abundant skills and breadth of knowledge.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe served our teachers and students with grace, humor, wisdom, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 with the love of Jesus.\u00a0Her loss is a painful and deep one and she will be greatly missed not just among our staff, but our entire ALCS family,\u201d the statement added.",
      "Rubi Vergara, a 9th grade student, had been at the school since kindergarten and was described as popular and a keen volunteer.",
      "\u201cHer gentle, loving, and kind heart was reflected in her smile.\u00a0Rubi was a blessing to her class and our school.\u00a0She was not only a good friend, but a great big sister,\u201d the school said.",
      "\u201cOften seen with a book in hand, she had a gift for art and music.\u00a0Yet, it was Rubi\u2019s love for Jesus that shined brightest and she shared His love with others by volunteering faithfully.\u00a0She will be missed deeply by her teachers and fellow students,\u201d the statement added.",
      "An online obituary uploaded to a local funeral home website said Vergara loved art, singing and playing keyboard in her family's worship band. \u201cShe shared a special bond with her beloved pets, Ginger (cat) and Coco (dog),\u201d the obituary said.",
      "The funeral home said a service for Vergara would be held on Saturday at 11 a.m. CST (12 a.m. ET) and would be livestreamed online.",
      "The police investigation into the shooting continues. Authorities said Wednesday night that the two unidentified students who received life-threatening injuries remain in a local hospital, while the four people who were treated in hospital for minor injuries sustained in the shooting have been discharged.",
      "Police said that the shooter opened fire in a second-floor classroom \u201cduring a study hall for mixed graders.\u201d",
      "Two guns were found at the school, but only one was used in the shooting, police said.",
      "Police said they were working to establish a motive and said they were aware of the suspect\u2019s alleged social media activity and \u201cdocuments and photos circulating the internet,\u201d that have yet to be verified.",
      "Detectives want to speak to any who may have interacted with Rupnow in the days or weeks before the shooting \u2014 they can contact police anonymously through Madison Area Crime Stoppers at\u00a0p3tips.com\u00a0or by calling 608-266-6014."

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The movie, premiering this month, is based on real events in the early 1990s, when a group of young people in Cuba were looking for freedom from government repression.",
    "story": [
      "A coming-of-age movie with a dramatic punk rock twist has a storyline that may sound unreal, but it's based on true events.",
      "In \"Los Frikis,\" set in early 1990s Cuba, hundreds of young, disenfranchised Cubans inject themselves with HIV during the early years of the AIDS epidemic, hoping to escape political repression by going inside government-run clinics, or sanitariums.",
      "Based on true events, the film takes its title from the Spanish translation of the word \u201cfreaky,\u201d referring to the punk rock movement that came together in Cuba during the 1980s and 1990s.",
      "\u201cI grew up in Miami, I have Cuban family, Cuban friends, but I didn\u2019t know this story specifically, so it was very important for me to tell it,\u201d said one of the movie's leads, Puerto Rican Guatemalan actor Adria Arjona.",
      "Arjona, who starred earlier this year in the romantic comedy crime movie \"Hit Man\" and is known for her roles in the series \"Andor\" and \"True Detective,\" spoke to NBC News alongside two of the movie's co-stars, H\u00e9ctor Medina and Eros de la Puente.",
      "\"Los Frikis\" was written and directed by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz, creators of \"The Peanut Butter Falcon,\" the 2019 comedy drama about a young man with Down syndrome who escapes from a care facility.",
      "During the AIDS crisis, Cuba's sanitariums drew both praise and criticism. While they were credited with containing the spread of HIV on the communist island, the clinics were described as \u201ca pretty prison\u201d by Dr. Jonathan Mann, the first AIDS director at the World Health Organization.",
      "According to an article in\u00a0The Lancet, Cuba had 927 cases of HIV seropositivity and 187 cases of AIDS as of May 1993. By comparison, neighboring Puerto Rico, with roughly one-third the population of Cuba, had over 8,000 cases of AIDS at the time, and New York City, with a population closer in size to Cuba, had 43,000 patients with AIDS then.",
      "But Cuba\u2019s health policy led to \"unintended consequences,\" The New York Times wrote in 2012 about this period.",
      "\u201cTo stay out, some Cubans tried to avoid testing. But a few others, usually teenagers estranged from their families, deliberately got themselves infected to get in,\u201d\u00a0The New York Times reported.",
      "Patients were initially confined to the medical center by the military. But life inside, which ultimately inspired \u201cLos Frikis,\u201d could also be less austere than what these punk rockers faced on the streets.",
      "\u201cInmates got food, medical care and their old salaries; theater troupes and art classes formed. Gay men could live together, which was not true in the macho culture outside,\u201d\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0reported.",
      "\u201cLos Frikis\u201d tells the story of this second young group, who lived in a Cuba that was increasingly isolated after the fall of the Berlin Wall\u00a0in 1989 and the ensuing demise of the Soviet Union and the communist bloc. Fidel Castro\u2019s revolutionary government cracked down in response to dissidents and others who didn't fit in.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll throw you in jail for anything here. It\u2019s impossible to survive without breaking the law,\u201d Paco (played by Medina), one of the punk rockers in the film, says.",
      "Paco, like other young people, believed he could escape from government repression by entering a sanitarium after injecting himself with HIV.\u00a0Punk bands started forming at these medical centers, and recorded cassettes inspired hundreds to self-inject.",
      "But many would soon face a rude awakening as they died of AIDS; it would be years before the current treatments that have made it possible to live with HIV as a manageable condition.",
      "Medina \u2014 who will play Ra\u00fal Castro, the brother of Fidel Castro and the former president of Cuba, in an upcoming movie with Al Pacino \u2014\u00a0said that he\u00a0prepared for his role in \u201cLos Frikis\u201d by speaking to a sanitarium doctor who now lives in the U.S.",
      "The doctor had worked at Los Cocos, a sanitarium about 30 minutes\u00a0southwest from Havana by car. He told Medina that it was painful to remember, since he had become friends with his patients who later died of AIDS.",
      "Medina said much of the punk music that Los Frikis made at the time was not preserved. But viewers could still connect with the very positive message of their culture in the film, which shows how they found freedom in friendship, love and the communities they created at the sanitariums.",
      "This message, Arjona said, transforms the \u201cFrikis\u201d from scary outcasts to relatable people who are vulnerable and want to heal from different traumas.",
      "In the movie, Arjona\u2019s character, Mar\u00eda, tells Gustavo (played by de la Puente) that \u201cyou can\u2019t expect to hold onto anything.\u201d",
      "Faced with the deaths of her peers, Mar\u00eda poetically says that loved ones, sunsets and even cherished animals like horses eventually disappear.",
      "This makes de la Puente think about one of the most enduring messages from the Frikis movement.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need many things to have everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI am referring in the context of the film, and how that group of people becomes a family and creates such a beautiful experience in a moment from the history of Cuba that was very empty.\u201d",
      "\u201cLos Frikis\u201d releases in New York and Los Angeles on Friday and\u00a0select movie theaters nationwide Dec. 25."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Lawyers and pro-democracy advocates are in the early stages of building a nationwide network of specialists aimed at defending and protecting people who may be targeted for retribution once President-elect Donald Trump takes office, according to multiple people involved in the effort.",
      "The sprawling initiative is intended to go far beyond legal assistance for those potentially subjected to criminal or civil investigations in a new Trump administration.",
      "Those working to create the infrastructure said that in addition to lawyers, they are recruiting accountants to help people who may find their taxes under audit, employment experts to advise those who could be fired or reassigned without cause, public relations professionals to assist anyone whose reputations might be tarnished by accusations and even psychologists to help potential targets manage the stress that comes with being in the federal government\u2019s crosshairs.",
      "The services would be free, underwritten by contributions to nonprofit groups steering the effort or through web-based donation sites, those involved said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s necessary because we\u2019re seeing threats of the improper use of government and investigative power like we haven\u2019t seen in modern times in our country,\u201d said Norm Eisen, a co-founder of the State Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonprofit group that offers pro bono legal services, who is assisting the effort. \u201cThe pro bono bar and nonprofit legal organizations need to be ready to provide strong support to those who are targeted unfairly.\u201d",
      "The structure is still taking shape, most likely as a loose-knit blend of new and existing nonprofit groups. A person familiar with the planning described a push to start a group that would offer security and public relations assistance to current or former officials facing what they believe to be retaliatory action.",
      "An incoming president doesn\u2019t normally spark that level of foreboding. But Trump has made no secret that he feels he has been wronged, and he has suggested his perceived political enemies should pay a price. Over the years he has singled out judges, prosecutors, lawmakers, journalists, governors and state election officials who he says have failed in their jobs.",
      "When he takes office again, Trump will preside over a vast law enforcement apparatus capable of leaving those who\u2019ve crossed him bankrupt, imprisoned or both, people involved in the effort to try to protect them said. Fending off such investigations can be financially ruinous, even if defendants escape punishment. A legal defense can quickly cross the six-figure mark.",
      "In a recent interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Trump name-checked the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, saying members should be jailed.",
      "Moderator Kristen Welker asked Trump whether his choice for FBI director, Kash Patel, would pursue investigations into Trump\u2019s political enemies.",
      "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.",
      "When Welker pressed whether he wanted to see that happen, Trump said: \u201cIf they were crooked, if they did something wrong, if they have broken the law, probably. They went after me. You know, they went after me, and I did nothing wrong.\u201d",
      "Mark Zaid, a private national security attorney who has been recruiting people for the initiative, said in an interview: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to expect other than we listen to his promises. And there\u2019s not a great track record with keeping promises, but when it comes to retribution and retaliation, he seems to keep them more often than he breaks them.\u201d",
      "One way to short-circuit a potential investigation is for the sitting president, Joe Biden, to pre-emptively pardon those who might face scrutiny. Biden gave a sweeping pardon to his son Hunter, covering any offense he may have committed over the past 10 years, effectively shielding him from the incoming administration.",
      "NBC News reached out to two dozen people who have been mentioned by Trump or his allies as potential targets for investigation. About half said they don\u2019t want pre-emptive pardons because they\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Others are uncertain or said they would accept pardons.",
      "People close to Rod Rosenstein, a deputy attorney general in the first Trump administration, and Robert Hur, the former special counsel who declined to prosecute Biden for his handling of classified documents, said neither wants a pardon.",
      "Two sources familiar with the matter said Jack Smith, the federal prosecutor who brought a pair of indictments against Trump after he left office in 2021, has privately made it clear he doesn\u2019t want a pardon.",
      "Smith is confident that he has done nothing wrong and that any effort to prosecute him would result in vindication, they said. Others have said publicly that they don\u2019t want pre-emptive pardons, including former CIA Director John Brennan and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who as a House member led the first impeachment trial against Trump.",
      "Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the chair of the Jan. 6 committee, has said he would accept a pardon from Biden. A spokesman for the vice chair, former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cIf he offers it to me \u2014 or other members of the committee \u2014 I think I would accept it,\u201d Thompson said in a CNN interview last week.",
      "So would Stephanie Grisham, a former Trump White House press secretary who wrote a book criticizing her former boss and spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August.",
      "Asked about a potential pardon from Biden, Grisham wrote in an email message: \u201cI have not heard that he is considering one for me, but I would not turn it down.\u201d",
      "A former national security official said he was sufficiently worried about Trump\u2019s return to power that he had been \u201cseriously thinking about leaving the country.\u201d",
      "After he visited a foreign country and checked homes to rent, he \u201cdecided on reflection I didn\u2019t want to do that because that gives the appearance of guilt.\u201d",
      "If Trump appointees were to launch groundless investigations merely to avenge him, they\u2019d face serious obstacles, legal experts said.",
      "Career FBI agents know they would be violating their own policies if they focused their fearsome investigatory powers on targets without good reasons. If they did so knowingly and for corrupt reasons, they could be committing a crime.",
      "Justice Department lawyers who participated in baseless criminal probes could face discipline by the department\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility and by their state bar associations.",
      "A network of legal allies will most likely not deter the Trump administration from targeting critics, but it could make it harder for the future White House, said Rosa Brooks, a former Defense Department official who is now at Georgetown Law.",
      "\u201cTo whatever extent Trump and his inner circle may think these are going to be easy targets, I don\u2019t think they will be easy targets, because there will be resources in place to ensure that they have really robust legal defenses against politically motivated investigations and prosecutions,\u201d Brooks said."

    "story": [
      "This article is part of \u201cDealing the Dead,\u201d a series investigating the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research.",
      "Every day for two seemingly endless months, Arelis Coromoto Villegas repeated the same prayer: From her small, cinder-block home in Venezuela, she asked God to protect her 21-year-old daughter as she trekked thousands of miles through treacherous jungle and desert terrain to reach America\u2019s southern border.",
      "Her prayers were answered in September 2022 when Aurimar Iturriago Villegas crossed safely into the U.S. and continued north with her own prayer \u2014 to land a job and eventually earn enough money to help her mother build a new house.",
      "But within two months of her arrival in Texas, Aurimar was dead, shot in a road rage incident near Dallas as she sat in the back seat of a car.",
      "And then, for her mother, the unthinkable somehow became the unimaginable.",
      "Without her family\u2019s knowledge, county authorities donated Aurimar\u2019s body to a local medical school, where officials cut it up and assigned dollar figures to parts that hadn\u2019t been damaged by the bullet that struck her head \u2014\u00a0$900 for her torso, $703 for her legs.",
      "Remnants of Aurimar\u2019s body were cremated and buried in a field among strangers in a Dallas cemetery, all while her mother desperately sought to have her murdered daughter returned to Venezuela, unaware her body had become a commodity in the name of science.",
      "Arelis only learned her daughter had been used for research two years after her death, when NBC News and Noticias Telemundo \u2014 as part of a broader investigation of the U.S. body industry \u2014\u00a0published the names of hundreds of people whose unclaimed bodies were sent to the Fort Worth-based University of North Texas Health Science Center.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very painful thing,\u201d Arelis said in Spanish, in an interview from her home in a small town in western Venezuela. \u201cShe\u2019s not a little animal to be butchered, to be cut up.\u201d",
      "What happened to Aurimar was a matter of money, part of a pattern NBC News uncovered over the past two years: Across the United States, vulnerable people\u2019s bodies often are mistreated and their families\u2019 wishes disregarded as overwhelmed local officials grapple with rising numbers of unclaimed dead amid widespread opioid addiction, surging homelessness and increasingly fractured families. Reporters found that county coroners, medical institutions and others repeatedly failed to contact reachable family members before declaring bodies unclaimed.",
      "In some cases, people were buried in paupers\u2019 fields as their loved ones reported them missing and searched for them. In others, corpses were sent to medical schools, biotech companies and for-profit body brokers without consent.",
      "Aurimar was one of about 2,350 people whose bodies were sent to the University of North Texas Health Science Center since 2019 under agreements with two local counties, which helped the center bring in about $2.5 million a year and saved the counties hundreds of thousands of dollars in cremation and burial costs, according to financial records.",
      "Hundreds of the bodies were used for student training or research. Others were leased out to medical technology companies that require human remains to develop products and train doctors on them. Some, including Aurimar\u2019s, were used for both.",
      "Donated bodies play a key role in medical education and the biotechnology industry, helping surgeons build their skills and researchers develop potentially lifesaving treatments. While using unclaimed bodies for this purpose remains legal in much of the country, including Texas, it\u2019s widely viewed as unethical because of the absence of consent and the pain it can inflict on survivors.",
      "Reporters have identified two dozen other cases in which families learned weeks, months or years later that a relative\u2019s body had been provided to the Health Science Center. Eleven of those families only learned what happened from NBC News and Noticias Telemundo \u2014 including five, in addition to Aurimar\u2019s loved ones, who were horrified to find their relative\u2019s names on the list of unclaimed bodies published by the news outlets this fall.",
      "In response to NBC News\u2019 findings, the Health Science Center suspended its body donation program, fired the officials who ran it and pledged to stop using unclaimed bodies. Spokesperson Andy North did not answer questions about Aurimar\u2019s case, but said in a statement to reporters that the center extends apologies to all the \u201cindividuals and families impacted\u201d and has \u201ctaken multiple corrective actions.\u201d",
      "In many of the cases NBC News uncovered, the people whose bodies went unclaimed were homeless, struggling with drug addiction or estranged from their families.",
      "Aurimar was none of these. She was in constant touch with her mother \u2014 speaking to her just hours before she died. Her family immediately scrambled to scrape together the thousands of dollars it would have cost to have her body repatriated to Venezuela, believing falsely month after month that her remains were preserved in a Dallas morgue.",
      "Instead, what followed were a cascade of bureaucratic breakdowns and communication failures. The Dallas County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office had Arelis\u2019 cellphone number on file, but there\u2019s no record in documents obtained by NBC News that the agency attempted to call her before declaring Aurimar\u2019s body abandoned. The agency declined to comment.",
      "Throughout this ordeal, Arelis has struggled \u2014 from a home with no internet, in a country with no diplomatic ties to the U.S. \u2014 to reclaim her daughter\u2019s body.",
      "Until then, she said, she can\u2019t truly begin to mourn.",
      "\u201cEvery night I say, \u2018My God, why did you take my daughter?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t accept my daughter\u2019s death. Not yet.\u201d"

His most-viewed video on YouTube is his re-enactment of the Netflix show \u201cSquid Game,\u201d in which contestants faced elimination challenges similar to those on the show (without the death element) to win the $456,000 prize.",
      "While some of his challenges have raised eyebrows, he had largely averted public fallout \u2014 until August, when The New York Times reported that some contestants said they sustained injuries and had inadequate access to food and medical care while they were filming the show in Las Vegas.",
      "A spokesperson for Donaldson said at the time that the shoot \u201cwas unfortunately complicated\u201d by a variety of factors, including \u201cextreme weather, and other unexpected logistical and communications issues.\u201d The spokesperson added that \u201cvirtually all\u201d participants who were invited to proceed to the upcoming Toronto shoot \u201centhusiastically accepted.\u201d",
      "Around the same time, online commentators accused former longtime MrBeast channel collaborator Ava Kris Tyson of \u201cgrooming.\u201d Tyson denied the allegations and announced her departure from the channel in July. A third-party legal probe, commissioned by Donaldson, found that allegations of sexual misconduct directed at his company were baseless.",
      "Concerns over safety on set followed \u201cBeast Games\u201d after it continued production in Toronto. And in September, a handful of contestants filed a lawsuit in California alleging they were \u201cshamelessly exploited\u201d and subjected to \u201cunreasonable, unsafe\u201d working conditions.",
      "The class-action lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, names Donaldson\u2019s production company and Amazon Prime as defendants. Representatives for Donaldson and Amazon did not comment on the lawsuit at the time. A lawyer for the plaintiffs said in an email Wednesday that \u201cas this is an ongoing legal matter, the attorneys and related parties are not conducting interviews.\u201d Representatives for Amazon and Donaldson declined to comment.",
      "In a recent appearance on \u201cThis Past Weekend with Theo Von,\u201d Von asked Donaldson about whether issues around his production were \u201coverblown.\u201d In response, Donaldson said it was \u201cimpossible for there never to be anything negative\u201d with such a large production.",
      "He also responded to an X user who asked whether the \u201cBeast Games\u201d show was \u201cthe same one where a lot of contestants complained of terrible conditions.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have tons of behind the scenes dropping when the show does to show how blown out of proportion these claims were,\u201d Donaldson wrote on Nov. 25. \u201cJust can\u2019t release it now because it would spoil the games.\u201d",
      "Promotion around the show has been relatively muted. Donaldson posted a teaser trailer this month on social media and announced the release date.",
      "\u201cI spent over a year creating this 10 episode competition series, breaking 40 world records, building the craziest sets in entertainment history, featuring 1,000 players, and a $5,000,000 grand prize!\u201d he wrote. \u201cI poured everything I have into this show, I\u2019ll see you December 19th on @PrimeVideo.\u201d",
      "The trailer kicks off with Donaldson saying \u201cstart the timer\u201d while a group of contestants, wearing blue jumpsuits with numbers on them, stand in individual, neon-illuminated platforms facing a 10-minute countdown.",
      "It also teases what appears to be some of the challenges, including one that involves monster trucks and another that looks like it\u2019s on a boat. Some contestants hold their hands on their faces, appearing stressed, or applaud in excitement. One person dives out of a helicopter. Donaldson high-fives some contestants in the trailer. People in all-black, face-covering suits also hold bags labeled with dollar signs and drop money into piles.",
      "Donaldson said on Von\u2019s podcast, \u201cIt\u2019s fun to create environments that have never been created before and almost just see what people do.\u201d",
      "Amazon did not provide any screeners to NBC News before the show\u2019s launch, saying in an email that the studio wants to preserve \u201cthe MrBeast fashion of a \u2018surprise and delight\u2019 moment for fans, and to protect the integrity of the competition series and spoilers.\u201d",
      "The first two episodes will drop at noon ET/9 a.m. PT Thursday, with additional episodes rolling out weekly. There are a total of 10 episodes.",
      "\u201cBeast Games is for everyone,\u201d Donaldson told Von."

      "During the experiment, Nick, who had issued the ultimatum to Sandy, spiraled while she developed a close bond with fellow contestant Jon Richard \u201cJ.R.\u201d Warren. Nick processed his emotions alone as his trial marriage partner, Vanessa Hattaway, was one of four cast members who quit the experiment in Episode 4.",
      "Sandy tells TODAY.com that Nick tackling the process solo was \u201cdetrimental\u201d to their relationship, which never recovered when the two reunited for their trial marriage.",
      "\u201cIt damaged the whole experience and relationship with Nick and I,\u201d she shares.",
      "Looking back at her time on the Netflix series, she says, \u201cMaybe Nick and I should have left. We should have walked away because it was really challenging and things unfolded in a way that they never had before.\u201d",
      "Despite the two repeatedly expressing their love for each other, she told him on \u201cUltimatum Day\u201d that they still had unresolved issues. She opted to leave alone after he appeared to reach for a ring, ready for a proposal.",
      "But Sandy reveals to TODAY.com that that isn\u2019t what really happened. Below, Sandy shares how their breakup unfolded, in her eyes. She also discusses fans\u2019 reactions to her \u201csurface-level\u201d relationship with J.R., if she has spoken to him or Nick since the show ended, unaired conversations and her biggest regrets.",
      "Somebody actually reached out to me about it, and I had originally said, \u201cNo.\u201d I was like, \u201cNope, that sounds too intense. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re at the place in our relationship where we\u2019re ready to get engaged by any means.\u201d Nick, he perked up. He was like, \u201cNo, I would actually really like to do that with you.\u201d We went through the process, very nonchalant, and we got it. I\u2019m a very firm believer in that everything happens for a reason.",
      "Yes. I think everybody wanted to leave at some point. It\u2019s a really difficult process, specifically when you move in with your trial partner. I know it looks all like rainbows and butterflies with me and J.R, but it was really challenging. First, moving in with somebody new, and being away from your partner, and then having their emotions and reactions mixed with it. It\u2019s really difficult. There were multiple points throughout that I considered leaving, too. But I think when we agreed to it, we committed. That\u2019s kind of the mentality that I had going into it and I think maybe a little too much, honestly. Because there were a lot of things where maybe Nick and I should have left. We should have walked away because it was really challenging and things unfolded in a way that they never had before. We didn\u2019t know what to do with it. Production didn\u2019t know what to do with it. Nobody knew what to do. That\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing unfold. It was very messy.",
      "That was really upsetting and difficult. Because we\u2019re like, \u201cHow is this going to work if Nick is by himself and I\u2019m in this trial marriage with J.R.?\u201d That\u2019s literally a recipe for disaster on so many different levels. Nick and Mariah had the option to also match up, which, to be honest, they probably should have. Because it was very detrimental that Nick was fully by himself during it. We\u2019re not supposed to be communicating, we\u2019re not supposed to be talking and it just completely spiraled. I was not happy. I wanted Nick to have that experience. I actually wanted to see how it would make me feel to have him in a trial marriage with somebody. (He) and Vanessa really had a legit connection. I don\u2019t know what would have happened if she had stayed. The experiment didn\u2019t go the way it was supposed to go.",
      "I was communicating with Nick. I did see him a couple times and talked to him for hours and hours and hours about everything. Made sure that I was reassuring him. We\u2019ve had a lot of conversations around the whole process. Unfortunately when you get there, immediately you get broken up and you\u2019re in a trial marriage. You have to go through that whole thing before you can then go back with your original partner. So I was trying to let him know, \"We\u2019re really here for the second half of this.\" But I think what unfolded during the trial marriage \u2014 it damaged the whole experience and relationship with Nick and I. We were communicating, but then the communication got very much out of hand on his end. I had to lay boundaries for myself and he was not respecting those boundaries.",
      "I\u2019ve seen him act that way several times in our relationship. It\u2019s a pattern that he has. I know the state that he was in \u2014 emotional, mental, physical \u2014 and I\u2019ve learned to disengage when he\u2019s in that state. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing when I don\u2019t go out and talk to him. Why would I talk to him? He\u2019s intoxicated. He\u2019s very emotional. This is also after \u2014 which we don\u2019t see because this was not caught on camera \u2014 he had called me over 100 times that night and then showed up at the apartment. So it\u2019s like, he\u2019s not respecting my boundaries in the slightest. He\u2019s actually making it almost impossible for me to disengage from that behavior. I knew what was going on because I\u2019ve seen it before many, many times.",
      "Nick is at the door. J.R. immediately goes to the door. He\u2019s like, \u2018Don\u2019t answer it. I\u2019m answering the door.\u2019 They\u2019re getting in a fight over me and I\u2019ve never been in that position before. So that was different, but I\u2019ve seen Nick in that state of mind many times.",
      "It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve had to learn the hard way \u2014 setting boundaries and sticking to my boundaries. I had these boundaries around (his) level of communication and how it\u2019s unhealthy and inappropriate in a lot of moments. Again, we don\u2019t see that. I do not blame viewers for not understanding because we don\u2019t see it. It\u2019s on my phone. It\u2019s also really difficult for me to deny somebody that I genuinely love and care for so much support when they need it. I would be there for him in a lot of ways and I think that\u2019s maybe what he\u2019s talking about to J.R. at the guys\u2019 night. I (was) expressing to him (that) I love him and I miss him and I want him to be OK. I\u2019m trying to get him through this so we can get to the other side and do our portion together. I don\u2019t really know how to handle the emotions and the behavior sometimes. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s best. I\u2019ve had to learn that through this. Through my relationship with Nick \u2014 before, during and after the show \u2014 genuinely, I\u2019ve learned a lot about setting boundaries and really sticking to it.",
      "Viewers are missing just about everything in terms of me and J.R.\u2019s emotional (and) mental connection. We don\u2019t see it at all. I don\u2019t blame anybody for thinking that me and J.R. (had) a purely surface-level physical connection. Our flirtiness completely outpowers the other stuff that we talked about because it\u2019s just not shown. I get it. It\u2019s OK. It is a TV show and there\u2019s only so much (they) could show. But me and J.R., we had a lot in common. The first conversation that we had, I was like, \u201cWhat the hell?\u2019\u201dWe both have roots in Philadelphia. We both went to the same college, which was a pretty random college. We had the same major in college, which was a very random major. We had a lot of the same beliefs in terms of spirituality, goals and ambitions. I\u2019ve probably talked to J.R. more than I\u2019ve talked to most people about every topic you can think about.",
      "I wouldn\u2019t say it was just a friendship and I didn\u2019t say that it was a friendship. I was trying to explain to her that, \"This is not a real life relationship because this is not a real-life situation. This is an experiment that we\u2019re in.\" Yes, we had a real attraction and connection. I\u2019m not dismissing that. I was just trying to give her reassurance that she quite literally did not ask for, and it was honestly out of line for me to even say anything. I should have just kept my mouth shut. But I was trying to let her know, like, \"We\u2019re not walking out of here together.\" I was trying to give her reassurance in a way that I just didn\u2019t need to. I shouldn\u2019t have.",
      "Me and Zaina actually had a full conversation about that on camera, which we don\u2019t get to see. We do talk through all of it and we clear the air. She knows where I was coming from, but that wasn\u2019t my place to even say that to her. Same thing with the \u201chooking up\u201d comment because we all have different definitions of hooking up, including me and Zaina. Me and J.R. had only kissed a couple times and what I consider hooking up is more than kissing. I was out of line for even saying anything in that space. As a girl, that crushes me because I was not trying to play her. I was trying to be brutally honest, and it came off the wrong way.",
      "Leading up to that, I think we both came to an agreement that it would not be responsible or smart for us to get engaged at that point. There\u2019s a lot more things that we (needed) to work on and things that came up through this process that we\u2019re probably not the right life partners for each other. He had told me that he wasn\u2019t going to propose. So when I saw him reaching in his pocket, I was surprised. That\u2019s why I was like, \"What are you doing?\" Because I didn\u2019t think that he was. He wasn\u2019t reaching for a ring. He was reaching for something else.",
      "It was really hard. It\u2019s really sad, honestly I\u2019ve had such a special relationship with Nick. I\u2019ve had such a special connection and bond with him, and we are so deeply connected. I know it doesn\u2019t look like it, but I love him so much, like, I really, really do. Anybody that knows me, knows our relationship, knows that love was never a problem with us. The love and connection was so deep and strong. It\u2019s the life that that kind of got in the way. I think the \"Ultimatum Day\" was the end, and we both knew it. It\u2019s really difficult to separate from somebody that you still really love and care about. You have that connection with them but you know that they\u2019re not the right life partner for you.\u00a0 I think this whole process expedites the answer. It did bring a lot of things to light, but I think those things would have come to light down the line anyways. What we can uncover in two months is better than taking two years for it to uncover outside of the experience. We got the answers. It just wasn\u2019t the answer that we were hoping for and it was a really weird, hard way to get there.",
      "It was a real breakup. Just like any other marriage or relationship, there\u2019s a separation process. It\u2019s difficult to really emotionally separate from somebody that you are so emotionally tied to. So it was a little bit of a process, but I was feeling this overwhelming gut feeling we (needed) to separate and this (wasn\u2019t) the right relationship for me. It wasn\u2019t healthy anymore. We still supported each other and were there for each other in a lot of ways. I\u2019ll always love him and care for him as a person. That\u2019s way far bigger and beyond this show and this experience. But it doesn\u2019t mean that we have to date and get married.",
      "No, actually, J.R. and I did not communicate at all after filming the show. I think it was kind of a mutual understanding, and we actually had talked about it during our trial marriage. That\u2019s why I was so confidently telling Zaina, \"This is not a real relationship. You don\u2019t have to worry about that.\" I wanted to leave it in the experience. I gave it my all. It\u2019s this unnatural experience that would literally never happen in the normal world. So for me, in my mind and my heart, that was never an option. I was not going to take that with me, Also, out of respect for Nick and Zaina, we never went there.",
      "I have a lot of regrets and lessons (learned) throughout the whole process. I felt this way the last year and now I can actually see it. There\u2019s a lot of things that I would have done differently. I think I made a lot of mistakes along the way. I\u2019m so aware of that. I\u2019m not denying that at all. I think, for one, just my overall kind of the lack of respect that I\u2019m sensing from myself towards Nick, and the resentment that I was carrying from our relationship into the show. That\u2019s pretty apparent to me. Regardless of whatever happened in my relationship, I just don\u2019t want to be showing up for my partner, myself in that way. It\u2019s not who I am to my core. I do think that leaning into the process with J.R. as quick as we did was honestly inappropriate. I don\u2019t think that that was \u2018wrong.\u2019 But for me, my heart and my standards, I don\u2019t think that was respectful towards Nick or Zaina. Looking back now, that\u2019s something that I would have done differently.",

      "\"I was completely blindsided by everything,\" Zaina tells TODAY.com in an interview. \"I had no idea who the person that I saw watching it was. I did not recognize J.R. My friends and family are like, 'Who is that man? We don\u2019t know him.' And I just feel like I was completely deceived the entire time, to the point where now the world feels like we were in a fake relationship based off of how he was acting.\"",

      "Do Zaina and J.R. get engaged in the 'Ultimatum' finale?",
      "Zaina and J.R. had trial marriages with Scotty Lewis and Sandy Gallagher, respectively. At first, in the finale, it seemed like the experience caused J.R. to change his mind about marriage.",
      "\"You showed me so much love and care. I want to thank you for that,\" J.R. told Zaina in the finale. \"I wasn't ready to receive it before this.\"",
      "Taking her hands, he told her he thought she'd make a \"fantastic wife and mother,\" and that he envisioned himself giving \"100%\" to make her happy.",

      "But \u2014 with a revelation timed to the music stopping \u2014 J.R. decided he wasn't at that point to give her what she deserved. He wasn\u2019t the \"rock\" or the \"provider\" he wanted to be. So, he decided to leave the show single.",
      "Zaina seemed at peace with his choice and told J.R. he would be an amazing husband one day. \"Deep down, I just knew you weren't ready,\" she said.",
      "The two both became emotional as Zaina told J.R. she loved him and they shared a kiss. He reciprocated the sentiment. \"You're still my favorite person,\" Zaina said.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com about that day, Zaina says she wasn't sure whether J.R. would propose.",
      "\"It was just so hard to tell because the entire trial marriage he kept  saying all the right things to keep me holding on to hope,\" she says. \"I felt like there was a possibility we would have left there together, or at least not gotten engaged and then continued our relationship off in real life.\"",
      "But on \"Ultimatum Day\" she noticed that his body language gave away his decision.",

      "What is Zaina and J.R.'s relationship like now?",
      "As far as her current relationship with J.R. goes, Zaina tells TODAY.com that it is \"non-existent.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s unfortunate, because I am a very understanding person. I like to have conversations, and I feel like if he would have taken accountability in any way, shape or form, we could have been cordial. But he avoided any real conversation,\" she says.",
      "The reality television star continues, \"So it\u2019s like almost passing a stranger on the street. We run into each other at events and I don\u2019t even look his way, because everything that happened was so disrespectful to the 10th degree.\"",
      "Zaina says she's happy that \"everything came to light\" and she is at peace with the end of her relationship.",
      "\"It sucks that I had to go through that experience, but I feel like sometimes God has a way of revealing things. And it was clear: J.R. and I were not meant to be together and he needed to be removed,\" she says.",
      "The real shock, Zaina adds, has come in watching J.R.'s relationship with Sandy, his trial marriage partner. On camera, J.R. and Sandy were open about developing feelings for each other and shared two kisses. This, however, was news to Zaina.",
      "\"When we switched back over, J.R. was very much so, like, \u2018Nothing happened. Sandy was the one that initiated everything.\u2019 He was saying all these things to downplay everything to the point where I believed him, and I was just like, 'There\u2019s nothing for me to worry about,'\" she says.",
      "While Sandy had spoken to Zaina about the trial marriage, she says she didn\u2019t know the extent of their relationship until recently.",
      "\"After the show he never gave me closure, or he refused to have real conversations. I didn\u2019t know anything that happened between him and Sandy until last month, before we shot the reunion,\" she says.",
      "Since the show, Zaina has been supported by family, who are \"very upset\" on her behalf.",
      "\"They\u2019re thanking God I\u2019m out of that toxic situation. They\u2019re just pouring a lot of love into me, but also like, \u2018Please, just stay away from him,'\" she says.",
      "At the reunion, which aired Dec. 18, J.R. told his side of the story, saying that Zaina was upset about the time they spent broken up after the show and did not want J.R. to date other people.",
      "\u201cI told her I needed time to process things, and she wanted to go back to what we were doing, and ignore the whole experience, and get back together,\u201d J.R. said. \u201cWe\u2019re not together. I feel like if we really want to realize what we want out of our relationship, we do need to take this time apart. I think you were upset about that.\u201d",
      "Zaina clarified that after their breakup, they lived across the street from each other while continuing to talk and spend time together.",
      "\u201cNaturally, I was really confused and he refused to give me any type of closure,\u201d Zaina said. \u201cI would ask, \u2018OK, during this break, are we seeing other people?\u2019 That\u2019s a valid question to ask. That was asking for clarity. That is not being controlling.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have a lot of love for Zaina. I don\u2019t know where all this hostility is coming from. I\u2019ve helped her whenever she called on me.

      "\"I just started prioritizing myself. I started really leaning into my passions. I left my corporate job to pursue becoming an entrepreneur on my own.  I\u2019m working on building my own wellness brand. Fitness, wellness (and) self care are the three things that I want to prioritize (as well as) mental health,\" she says.",
      "Zaina added that she is also looking forward to sharing her story with others \"to help them identify when it\u2019s time to walk away.\""

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 18:39:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Is The Sticky based on a true story? Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist true story and how it inspired the TV show.",
    "story": [
      "In July 2012, Michel Gavreau was conducting a routine inspection of a maple syrup warehouse near Laurierville, Quebec.",
      "He climbed up a stack of 600-pound barrels, expecting them to support his weight, but when he reached the top, he almost fell.",
      "One of the barrels seemed unbalanced and when Gavreau peered inside, he realized it was empty. As it turned out, many of the surrounding drums were empty, too, and others had been filled with water, according to Vanity Fair's 2016 reporting, which quoted spokeswoman for the Quebec Maple Syrup Producers\u00a0Federation Caroline Cyr's retelling of the story.",
      "This marked the discovery of what came to be known as the Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist, a multi-year operation in which a ring of thieves siphoned syrup from thousands of barrels worth millions of dollars.",
      "The heist inspired a new Prime Video series, \u201cThe Sticky\u201d (Dec. 6), starring Margo Martindale as a syrup farmer about to have her land seized by the government.",
      "The comedy-drama is only loosely based on the actual heist and in fact, none of the show\u2019s protagonists are based on the real syrup thieves.",
      "While \u201cThe Sticky\u201d is \u201cabsolutely not the true story\u201d of the heist, as the show\u2019s trailer notes, the series does call fresh attention to one of the most unusual crimes in Canadian history.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about the true story of the Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist.",
      "Why would people steal maple syrup?",
      "Maple syrup may seem like an odd target for a multimillion dollar heist, but the sweet commodity is big business in Canada.",
      "Canada produces nearly three-quarters of the world\u2019s pure maple syrup, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.",
      "Syrup harvests vary every year due to climate, tree disease and other factors. To meet the world\u2019s demand for maple syrup, producers created a strategic reserve, where they can stockpile extra syrup in good years and draw from the surplus in bad years.",
      "\u201cIn the States you have the strategic oil reserve,\u201d Simon Tr\u00e9panier, then general manager of the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers, now executive director, told The New York Times in 2012. \u201cMother Nature is not generous every year, so we have our own global strategic reserve.\u201d",
      "The strategic reserve allows producers to keep prices stable \u2014 and the prices are not insignificant.",
      "Around the time of the heist, maple syrup was trading for $32 per gallon, or $1,800 per barrel, according to Bloomberg News. (By comparison, a gallon of crude oil in 2012 cost $2.66, according to Statista.)",
      "Throughout the months-long heist, thieves stole syrup from more than 9,500 barrels, with a market value of more than $18 million CAD, or about $12 million USD in 2024.",
      "At his trial, heist ringleader Richard Valli\u00e8res said he sold the stolen syrup for $10 million CAD, making a personal profit of around $1 million CAD, or just over $700,000 USD today, according to BBC News.",
      "\u201cTo steal that amount of maple syrup means you have to know the market,\u201d Tr\u00e9panier told Bloomberg.",
      "How did the thieves pull it off?",
      "In 2011, there was an especially large surplus of maple syrup, meaning that producers had to rent an additional warehouse to stockpile the additional supply.",
      "Here, thieves saw an opportunity. They rented out another section of that extra warehouse under the guise of using it for a different business, which gave them access to the building, according to The New York Times.",
      "Sometimes, the thieves would truck out drums of syrup from the warehouse by night and siphon them into their own barrels, then return the original barrels filled with water, according to Vanity Fair.",
      "Later, the criminals found a way to drain syrup directly from the barrels in the warehouse, without having to cart them away and secretly return them. The syrup would then be trafficked to buyers outside Quebec who allegedly did not realize it had been stolen.",
      "Incredibly, after the theft was discovered, more than 600 barrels of the stolen syrup were recovered in New Brunswick in October 2012, and was transported back to Quebec under police protection, NBC News reported.",
      "At the time, \u00c9tienne St-Pierre, the owner of the New Brunswick export company where the syrup was found, said he had no idea that syrup had been stolen, telling police it had been sold to him by his usual suppliers in Quebec, according to NBC News.",
      "However, it later emerged that St-Pierre was in on the scheme. He was found guilty in 2016 of fraud and trafficking stolen goods, per the CBC.",
      "What happened to the criminals?",
      "Twenty-six people were arrested in 2016 in connection with the maple syrup theft, according to the CBC.",
      "A year later, in 2017, the heist\u2019s ringleader, Richard Valli\u00e8res, was sentenced to nearly eight years in prison and fined more than $9 million CAD, Reuters reported.",
      "He appealed this ruling and had his fine reduced to about $1 million CAD. However, in 2022, Canada\u2019s Supreme Court reversed this appeal, ruling that he should pay the full amount of the value of the syrup he stole, according to BBC News.",
      "Valli\u00e8res\u2019 father, Raymond Valli\u00e8res, was also in on the scheme, according to Canada\u2019s Global News. He was sentenced to two years minus one day in jail and was required to pay about $10,000 CAD within one year.",
      "Others sentenced for their involvement include syrup reseller \u00c9tienne St-Pierre, Avik Caron, whose wife partly owned the warehouse at the center of the heist, and S\u00e9bastien Jutras, a trucker who transported stolen syrup.",
      "Jutras testified at trial that he occasionally collected money from buyers for Richard Valli\u00e8res, saying he once picked up a shoebox full of money that \u201chad to be $200,000,\u201d Canada\u2019s National Post reported in 2017.",
      "He also shared how Valli\u00e8res allegedly justified stealing large quantities of syrup from the FPAQ.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018Stealing from thieves is not stealing,\u2019\u201d Jutras testified."

    "summary": "Annie Gonzalez talks to TODAY.com about embodying the late Jenni Rivera in the biopic \"Jenni,\" her career and manifesting being the next rom-com leading lady.",
    "story": [
      "WHEN SHE GREETS me at her door, Annie Gonzalez is barefoot, her dark chocolate curls loose and bouncing. In full glam and wearing a cream-colored lace dress, she's holding a bundle of clear plastic wrapping in her arms. With an excited wiggle, the actor explains she had a lush white couch assembled in her Los Angeles home just minutes before her TODAY.com photo shoot.",
      "Gonzalez may still be in the middle of making her house a home, but she says she's never felt more at home within herself.",
      "\u201cThis moment in my life feels like the beginning of being awake,\u201d the 31-year-old says. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a lot that happened in my life that I was always trying to numb myself to, and for the first time ... I can face whatever it is that comes my way.\u201d",
      "That includes starring in the late Jenni Rivera biopic \u201cJenni,\u201d in theaters and available on the Spanish-language streaming service Vix now. \u201cJenni\u201d tells the tragic and intense real-life story of the late Mexican American regional singer from Long Beach, California, who became one of the leading ladies in a predominantly male-fronted genre.",
      "From her teen pregnancy, musical family upbringing and abusive marriages \u2014 all before her untimely death at 43 in a plane crash \u2014 Rivera was a take-no-BS woman. And she was one who was admired, scrutinized and beloved by many.",
      "Which is why, when offered to audition for the role, Gonzalez says she was \u201cscared s---less.\u201d The team behind the film reached out three times in the span of two months, and Gonzalez kept passing on the opportunity.",
      "\u201cI turned it down because I was like, \u2018Jesus Christ, I don\u2019t know much about her. How am I going to do this?\u2019 Speaking Spanish, the type of music that she does ... that\u2019s not something that I\u2019m familiar with. Culturally, yes, it\u2019s in my ethos, but it\u2019s not something that I grew up around or listening to.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez's team and close friends kept insisting she give the role a shot, including her \u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot\u201d co-star Jesse Garcia, who \u201creally convinced me to audition.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnce I read (for the role), I was like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m going to book it,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s just certain things that click. I think what we do as creatives, as artists, is such a spiritual thing. A lot of times things come to us to break us free, open us up to pieces of ourselves that we never knew, that we didn\u2019t know we could access, or that we needed to.\u201d",
      "The result is a heart-wrenching look at the reality of a young woman who had to physically and emotionally fight back to reclaim her joy, protect her children and make a name for herself. Rivera, who was a mother of five, died Dec. 9, 2012 in a fatal plane crash in Monterrey, Mexico. The accident also claimed the lives of six others.",
      "GONZALEZ ALWAYS knew she wanted to be an actor. Raised by single mother Anna Castillo in Los Angeles and a slew of t\u00edas, Gonzalez \u2014\u00a0who is sixth generation Mexican American \u2014 was surrounded by creatives. Her mom, who also had acting aspirations, had her when she was 23.",
      "\u201cShe was like my big sister,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cWe were little creative babies, and would walk around the house and listen to music and do accents. My babysitters a lot of the time were Gene Kelly and Ginger Rogers from watching old movies. It was a lot of daydreaming.\u201d",
      "Her father, Gabriel Gonzalez, is also an actor and musician.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been singing since I was a little girl,\u201d says Gonzalez, who sings in \u201cJenni\u201d and serves as an executive producer on the film. \u201cI thought I was going to be a singer before I was an actress.\u201d",
      "One of Gonzalez\u2019s first auditions was at the age of nine, alongside J.R. Villarreal, who coincidentally co-stars as Rivera's second husband, Juan \u201cCinco\u201d Lopez, in \u201cJenni.\u201d The two hadn\u2019t seen each other in years before reconnecting for the biopic.",
      "Gonzalez\u2019s other accolades include roles in \u201cShameless,\u201d \u201cVida,\u201d and most recently, \u201cLopez vs. Lopez.\u201d Her big break came in 2020 with the Netflix series \u201cGentefied,\u201d where she starred as the book-and-street smart Lidia, who dates Erik (J.J. Soria), one of three Mexican American cousins the show follows in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles. The show ran for two seasons, and it was there that she connected and became close friends with co-creator Linda Yvette Ch\u00e1vez. The two later worked together on Eva Longoria\u2019s directorial debut \u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot,\u201d written by Ch\u00e1vez and co-starring Gonzalez.",
      "\u201cEva taught me very early on to not get attached to any high or to not get attached to any low. She taught me that whatever you want, you\u2019re going to have to be the one that decides and goes after it,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cIf you want it to happen overnight, you won\u2019t have longevity. If you love the art, focus on that. That should be the most important thing, the art and the joy of it.\u201d",
      "\u201cEva really taught me relevance comes and goes,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s about believing that you\u2019re relevant in here: inside of your heart, finding that peace in here.\u201d",
      "DANCING ALONG to artists like Victoria Mon\u00e9t and Kelly Rowland, Gonzalez is carefree and open in her own safe space.",
      "\u201cOh, so you\u2019re just going to make me feel beautiful!\u201d she exclaims after seeing the first photographs of herself taken by Juan Veloz.",
      "Whatever you want, you\u2019re going to have to be the one that decides and goes after it.\"",
      "Annie Gonzalez",
      "As a journalist in Los Angeles, my path has crossed with Gonzalez's many times over the last years. From a set visit during the first season of \u201cGentefied\u201d to interviewing her for \u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot\u201d and running into each other at events in Hollywood, Gonzalez's genuine spirit has has always shined through.",
      "She once told me she didn\u2019t know how \u201cto do this\u201d \u2014 meaning, navigate Hollywood with interviews and photo shoots. However, watching her being photographed, I have to disagree.",
      "It\u2019s taken Gonzalez a bad breakup and therapy, she says now, to self-reflect and see her talent and worth. She has realized the importance of facing her fears and living by the belief that \u201cno weapon formed against me shall prosper.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez has also given herself grace to rise and fall \u2014 much like Rivera did over the course of her complicated life.",
      "\u201cThis was one of the hardest projects I\u2019ve ever done in my life,\u201d she says. \u201cThis helped me open up to myself. Now, even watching \u2018Jenni,\u2019 I see certain things. Because I\u2019ve grown so much as a person in the last two years since shooting the film, that I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh s---, I wonder how I would approach this now.\u2019 There\u2019s always room to grow, and I\u2019m proud of myself.\u201d",
      "RIVERA\u2019S FAMILY had final casting approval for who was going to portray their mother. After getting the role, Gonzalez had lunch at the home of Rivera\u2019s eldest daughter, Latin Grammy-winning artist Chiquis Rivera.",
      "\u201cI asked a lot of questions,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was only one lunch, so you can only get so much, and ultimately, for me, it was about getting her essence. I\u2019d be doing a disservice to her if I was trying to imitate everything that she was. But her essence is something that I understood once I saw the family dynamic. It reminded me very much of my family.\u201d",
      "Thousands of interviews exist online of Rivera. While doing her research, Gonzalez couldn\u2019t believe the sexist questions and \u201ccomplete disregard to her humanity\u201d that Rivera experienced. Yet she persisted.",
      "\u201cShe was honest, she was authentic, as much as she could be, because either way people had an opinion about her,\u201d she says. When embodying \"La Diva de la Banda,\" Gonzalez says \u201cit was hard to separate\u201d what her character Rivera was going through and her own real life, including being assaulted.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m such a visceral person that I do pull a lot from my own life. And then just knowing her life and what she had experienced ... Sometimes I still sit and I ponder her. I listen to her music, and I sob for her.\u201d",
      "\u201cJenni\u201d the film concludes with a poignant quote from the late \u201cLa Chacalosa\u201d singer.",
      "\u201cGracias por aceptarme tal como soy, con mis virtudes y defectos,\u201d which translates to, \u201cThank you for accepting me as I am, with my virtues and defects.\u201d",
      "The screen then fades to black. And as the credits roll, \u201cPedacito de M\u00ed\u201d by Jenni Rivera and her daughters Chiquis and Jacqie Rivera starts to play.",
      "\u201cThis movie is a Chicana, feminist story of someone finding her fight and finding it in her own way, and finding fight enough to not just protect herself, but to protect those who didn\u2019t know they needed protection,\u201d Gonzalez reflects. \u201cIt\u2019s a love story to anyone who\u2019s never felt worthy, who\u2019s never felt good enough, more beautiful enough, talented enough, and still stood up in the face of adversity and went for it.\u201d",
      "Legs stretched across her new couch, a golden glow embracing the downtown skyline, Gonzalez shares what comes next for her.",
      "An artist through and through, she\u2019s been writing songs for an EP and has been performing live at historic venues \u2014 something she didn\u2019t feel she had the confidence to do before \u201cJenni.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis film has broken me open to exploring, to leaving no leaf unturned in my life,\u201d she says.",
      "She\u2019s also manifesting becoming the next rom-com queen. \u201cBut not just any. I want to be what Sandra Bullock was to the \u201890s to today. I think our last rom-com queen was maybe Anne Hathaway or Emma Stone. I want to do that, but me.\u201d",
      "Smirking, she pauses before talking about herself as the leading lady in \u201cJenni.\u201d",
      "\u201cI even saw moments in \u2018Jenni\u2019 where I was like, \u2018Oh yeah, I could do it. Yeah, she\u2019s a little charming f------!\u2019\u201d"

      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Sandy says she originally turned down the show because it seemed too \"intense,\" but Nick was more keen on trying. Today, Sandy is at peace with their decision to agree to be on \"The Ultimatum.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m a very firm believer in that everything happens for a reason,\" Sandy tells TODAY.com.",
      "Here's what unfolded between her and Nick and where they are now.",
      "Do Nick and Sandy get engaged in 'The Ultimatum' finale?",
      "During \"The Ultimatum\" Season 3 finale, Nick and Sandy greeted each other with a kiss.",
      "This meeting came after their two trial marriages \u2014 one charged and the other short-lived. Sandy developed a connection with Jon Richard \"J.R.\" Warren. Meanwhile, Nick's trial partner, Vanessa Hattaway, left early along with her boyfriend Dave Adams and another couple. Nick struggled being alone during the show and also reacted emotionally to learning J.R. and Sandy had kissed twice.",
      "When Nick met Sandy on \"Ultimatum Day,\" he said he gained \"answers\" from the experience and seemed ready to propose.",
      "\"I feel like I've never been more in love with you and more committed to the change and the growth that would make me a better partner,\" Nick said.",
      "Nick said he had a ring in his pocket and gave Sandy a choice. She expressed hesitation. \"There are still some things we have to work through,\" she said.",
      "Although she said she loved him with \"everything\" in her, Sandy wasn't ready to commit. \"I want nothing more than to walk out of here engaged to you and to ride off into the sunset,\" she told him.",
      "\"That's not true,\" he responded.",
      "After a back and forth, the two finally chose to break up. \"I do have some concerns, hesitations and fears with you, babe,\" Sandy said.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Sandy says she and Nick were actually more on the same page about the proposal than they seemed in the episode. She says Nick had told her he wasn't going to propose.",
      "\"That\u2019s why I was like, 'What are you doing?' Because I didn\u2019t think that he was (proposing),\" she explains.",
      "Nick shared his perspective in the episode. He said that his \"heart dropped into (his) stomach\" when he saw her reaction to possibly pulling out a ring. \"I could tell she was fearful,\" he said. \"I don't want to be with someone that's so afraid to be with me.\"",
      "What is Nick and Sandy's relationship like now?",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Sandy says her breakup with Nick was \"real.\"",
      "\"Just like any other marriage or relationship, there\u2019s a separation process. It\u2019s difficult to really emotionally separate from somebody that you are so emotionally tied to. So it was a little bit of a process, but I was feeling this overwhelming gut feeling we (needed) to separate and this (wasn\u2019t) the right relationship for me. It wasn\u2019t healthy anymore,\" she says.",
      "\"I\u2019ll always love him and care for him as a person,\" she continues. \"That\u2019s way far bigger and beyond this show and this experience. But it doesn\u2019t mean that we have to date and get married.\"",
      "What is Sandy and J.R.'s relationship like now?",
      "J.R. and his partner, Zaina Sesay, also broke up in the finale and he chose to leave single.",
      "So, did he reconnect with Sandy after the show?",
      "\"J.R. and I did not communicate at all after filming the show,\" Sandy says. \"I think it was kind of a mutual understanding, and we actually had talked about it during our trial marriage. I wanted to leave it in the experience. I gave it my all. It\u2019s this unnatural experience that would literally never happen in the normal world. So for me, in my mind and my heart, that was never an option.\"",
      "She also says they never resumed their relationship \"out of respect for Nick and Zaina.\""

      "Part 1 of the film adaptation clocks in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, making it about the same length as the entire \"Wicked\" musical. But the first film is just half of the story, following the events of Act 1 while giving moments \"a chance to breathe,\" the musical's composer Stephen Schwartz says.",

      "Between acts, there's a time jump, although how much time exactly is unclear. (The 1995 book by Gregory Maguire, which has a markedly different tone and adult audience, would suggest it's a period of about five years.)",
      "In the musical, Act 2 opens with the song \"Thank Goodness,\" sung primarily by Glinda and Madame Morrible, played by Ariana Grande and Michelle Yeoh in the film.",
      "The song establishes that Glinda has left Shiz University and has officially assumed the mantle of Glinda the Good, meant to uplift spirits, while the rest of Oz is overwhelmed by fear of the Wicked Witch of the West, the enemy of the Wizard. She also announces that she and Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey in the 2024 film), now a captain in the Wizard's army, are officially engaged.",

      "When Elphaba tries to free the flying monkeys she accidentally created at the end of Act 1, she runs into the Wizard, who, after a failed attempt to again sway her to his side, turns her in to his guards.",
      "She and Fiyero reunite, and instead of bringing her to the Wizard, he helps her escape and leaves with her, abandoning Glinda.",
      "Glinda then finds herself the third prong of the love triangle and sings a reprise of \"I'm Not That Girl.\" Meanwhile, Fiyero and Elphaba profess their love to the steamy song \"As Long As You're Mine.\"",

      "While Elphaba leads a campaign against the Wizard, her sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode in the film), has taken over as governor of Munchkinland in the wake of their father's death and rules harshly. Her relationship with Boq (Ethan Slater) has soured, and he stays by Nessarose's side under duress rather than love.",

      "Desperate to make him love her, Nessarose tries to use Elphaba's spell book, the Grimmerie, but her enchantment goes wrong and she shrinks his heart. To save him, Elphaba turns him into a man made of tin so he can survive without a heart. Nessarose then proclaims herself the Wicked Witch of the East.",
      "Bode is the first actor to play Nessarose who uses a wheelchair in real life. She told TODAY's Donna Farizan in an interview that while she can't say too much about Part 2, \"it is definitely less of a case of my character wanting to be fixed, and more of her just taking in the magic itself.\"",
      "Bode also confirms to TODAY.com that in \"Wicked: For Good\" her character plays a bigger role in the story. Her character undergoes almost a 180-degree change from the end of Part 1, which sees her happy and in love with Boq, to the start of Part 2.",
      "\"What was helpful to me was journaling as my character to fill in a lot of the blanks and to really get in the mindset (of) why my character changed, what her feelings were in the in between and how did she get to where she was today,\" Bode says.",

So, using her powers to control the weather, Madame Morrible summons the tornado that lands a house on Nessarose, bringing Dorothy Gale to Oz.

    "story": [
      "Many women are surprised by how much pain they experience during a medication abortion, a study published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health found.",
      "More than 60% of abortions in the U.S. are medication abortions, meaning a person takes two drugs, often at home, to end a pregnancy. The study, which surveyed women in the U.K., found that many don\u2019t feel prepared for the amount of pain they may feel during the procedure.",
      "Pain does not mean the procedure is unsafe, but some women may feel caught off guard based on the information health providers gave them.",
      "\u201cThere is a bit of a reckoning in the world of gynecology right now and the pain patients are experiencing during procedures,\u201d said Dr. Alyssa Colwill, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Oregon Health and Science University School of Medicine who wasn\u2019t involved with the new research.",
      "In the study, researchers looked at survey responses from about 1,600 women in the U.K. who had undergone a medication abortion and then answered questions about the experience. Most were between the ages of 20 and 39 and half had never given birth.",
      "More than 90% of respondents ranked their pain at least a 4 out of a maximum of 10, and about half said the pain was more than they had expected. About 40% said their pain was severe, between an 8 and a 10 on the pain scale.",
      "Women are often told to expect cramping akin to strong menstrual cramps during a medication abortion, both in the U.K. and in the U.S. While some respondents felt that was an accurate description, others said they felt unprepared and that the pain aspect of medication abortion was \u201csugar-coated\u201d or downplayed.",
      "One woman who responded to the survey said: \u201cPain was so much stronger than period pain, it was like having contractions in labour. I\u2019ve given birth three times and the pain really wasn\u2019t too much different from that pain, the cramping contraction pain.\u201d",
      "Another said: \u201cI think it\u2019s worth reassuring people that just because it [pain] is stated severe it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it will be. I spent more time worrying about the possibilities of the side effects than needed!\u201d",
      "The researchers concluded that women wanted detailed, realistic pain counseling and general preparatory advice, including details from firsthand experiences that illustrate the range of pain women may experience during medication abortion.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s important here is the acknowledgement that everyone\u2019s experience of pain during a medical abortion will be different,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Hannah McCulloch, an evaluation researcher at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be realistic about what women experience during medical abortion in order to provide meaningful patient-centred care.\u201d",
      "Medication abortions involve taking two pills. The first, mifepristone, blocks the hormone progesterone, which is critical for a pregnancy to continue. One or two days after taking mifepristone, the person takes a second drug \u2014 usually misoprostol \u2014 which causes the uterus to cramp and soften and the cervix to dilate so the pregnancy can pass, usually within 24 hours of taking misoprostol, according to Colwill.",
      "\u201cThat process, the uterus having to cramp and expel the pregnancy, inherently is going to cause pain,\u201d she said, adding that many factors play into how much pain each person feels.",
      "Women who may report less pain with a medication abortion include those who have experienced labor or given birth vaginally and women who have painful menstrual cramps every month, such as those who have endometriosis, Colwill said.",
      "\u201cUnderstanding these past experiences, and things like how they experience Pap smears and vaginal exams, can help us better support patients to be prepared for how pain may be for them,\u201d she added, noting that she was not surprised to see many women did not feel they were adequately prepared to manage pain during a medication abortion.",
      "Medication abortion is an extremely safe procedure. Serious side effects occur in less than 0.5% of people who take Mifeprex, the brand-name version of mifepristone, according to the drug\u2019s label, and the number of women managing their own abortions has increased since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "\u201cPatients need to be adequately informed about what to expect and be told what we know about how to manage the pain. Pain is downplayed in medicine in general and particularly in women\u2019s health and obstetrics and gynecology,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and director of advancing new standards in reproductive health at the University of California San Francisco.",
      "Even if a person accesses abortion medication through telehealth, Grossman said people should still be counseled on what to expect and how to treat the intense pain and nausea that can happen during the procedure. His best advice, he said, for managing pain during a medication abortion is to take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, such as ibuprofen, at the same time as misoprostol. If possible, he recommends also taking an anti-nausea medication such as metoclopramide, which requires a prescription.",
      "Colwill said that acetaminophen, or Tylenol, is also an option, but NSAIDs do a better job of blocking this specific pain.",
      "Putting a heating pad, a hot water bottle or over-the-counter trans-electrical nerve stimulation pads on the lower belly can also help \u201cconfuse\u201d nerves in the area and help relieve pain,\u00a0Grossman said.",
      "He said it\u2019s also important to understand what pain is \u201cnormal\u201d and when it may be time to seek medical help, especially in situations where people are at home.",
      "Pain in the middle of the lower abdomen is normal, for example, but pain higher up or pain just on one side could be a sign that something is wrong, such as an ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition in which a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus.",
      "If someone experiences severe pain on one side of the abdomen or pelvis, they should go to the emergency room, Grossman said. \u201cIf they have mild to moderate pain on one side, they might try to talk to a clinician first by phone. But if there\u2019s any question, they should go to an emergency department,\u201d he added.",
      "Ectopic pregnancies are detected on ultrasounds, however, \u201cmany people have a medication abortion without having an ultrasound and it can even be missed on an ultrasound,\u201d Grossman said.",
      "Medication abortion will not work for an ectopic pregnancy, according to the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Pain beyond 24 hours after a pregnancy is passed, especially if the person also has a fever or is vomiting, could be a sign of infection, he said.",
      "Women should also not discount the importance of moral support, he added: \u201cFeeling supported and having someone there makes a big difference, too.\u201d"

      "Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew has been caught up in an alleged spying case after cultivating an \u201cunusual degree of trust\u201d with a Chinese man who was barred from the country on national security grounds.",
      "The scandal-hit younger brother of King Charles III was \u201cprepared to enter into business activities\u201d with the alleged spy, Britain\u2019s High Court said in a written ruling Thursday, which referred to the Chinese national as H6. The court lifted an anonymity order protecting his identity Monday, allowing him to be named as Yang Tengbo.",
      "Yang had been subjected to the highest levels of national security investigation in the U.K., Thursday's ruling by judges Charles Bourne, Stephen Smith and Stewart Eldon said, adding that British intelligence agencies feared he was attempting to gain influence over a member of the royal family.",
      "In a statement released through his lawyers, Yang said the \u201cwidespread description of me as a \u2018spy\u2019 is entirely untrue.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, Andrew forged a relationship of \u201csignificant degree\u201d with Yang, marked by an \u201cunusual degree of trust,\u201d the court ruling said, adding that he was \u201cprepared to enter into business activities\u201d with the Chinese national, whom he invited to his 60th birthday party in 2020.",
      "Yang could reportedly \u201cact on behalf\u201d of the prince in engagements with potential partners and investors in China, the ruling said.",
      "Andrew\u2019s office said in a statement that he\u00a0\u201cceased all contact with the individual after concerns were raised.\u201d It added that he \u201cmet the individual through official channels with nothing of a sensitive nature ever discussed.\u201d",
      "Yang also sought connections with \u201cprominent U.K. figures,\u201d including politicians, which could be \u201cleveraged\u201d for political interference by China, the court said.",
      "Yang was considered a \u201crisk to national security,\u201d prompting former Secretary of State Suella Braverman to conclude in March 2023 that the ban on his entry to Britain was \u201cjustified and proportionate,\u201d the ruling added.",
      "Pictures of Yang alongside former British Prime Ministers Theresa May and David Cameron have been published in U.K. news outlets, although it is unclear when and where the meetings took place.",
      "In his statement, Yang said that he had \u201cdone nothing wrong or unlawful\u201d and that the concerns raised by Britain\u2019s Home Office \u201care ill-founded.\u201d",
      "For the royal family, it is another embarrassing revelation about Andrew, a onetime war hero who served in Britain\u2019s Royal Navy and flew a number of missions during the 1982 conflict with Argentina over the remote\u00a0Falkland Islands.",
      "Andrew returned his military affiliations and royal patronages in January 2022 after his lawyers failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a\u00a0civil lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse. He later paid a substantial sum to Virginia Giuffre, who alleges Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17.",
      "Giuffre has long alleged she was forced in the 1990s to have sex with Andrew after notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his\u00a0confidant, the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, trafficked her to him. Maxwell, 62, was jailed for 20-years after a jury concluded that she played a pivotal part\u00a0in recruiting and grooming teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.",
      "Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegation.",
      "There have also been several high-profile spy cases involving China in the U.S.",
      "Federal prosecutors this year charged Linda Sun, a former top aide to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering.",
      "Sun, 41, used her position to aid Chinese officials and covertly sharing internal documents with Beijing, prosecutors alleged in court papers. She was also accused of blocking Taiwanese diplomats from contacting the state government.",
      "In return, Sun received millions of dollars in transactions for the China-based business activities of her husband, Chris Hu, a job for her cousin in China and tickets to various sporting and cultural events, the indictment said.",
      "Hu was charged with money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and misuse of means of identification.",
      "Both have pleaded not guilty."

    "story": [
      "Israel's defense minister has vowed that it would maintain \u201cfull freedom of action\u201d in the Gaza Strip after fighting ends in the Palestinian enclave, a day after raising hopes that a ceasefire and hostage deal was imminent.",
      "Israel was \u201ccloser to a ceasefire deal than we have ever been,\u201d Defense Minister Israel Katz said during a closed-door parliamentary committee hearing Monday. The comment was confirmed to NBC News by an Israeli lawmaker who was present.",
      "While ceasefire talks have broken down multiple times in the past, two U.S. officials and an Israeli official\u00a0last week told\u00a0NBC News that Hamas relented on key points to securing an agreement.",
      "According to the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Hamas agreed that Israeli forces would remain in Gaza temporarily after the end of hostilities, and Hamas would provide a comprehensive list of hostages, including American citizens, to be released.\u00a0Hamas would also see a large number of Palestinian prisoners released by Israel as part of the deal, the sources said.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported these concessions.\u00a0Hamas has not confirmed to NBC News or others\u2019 reporting that it has agreed to Israeli troops in Gaza.",
      "Hamas said Tuesday that \u201cserious and positive discussions\u201d had taken place in Doha, Qatar, with Egyptian and Qatari mediators, and that reaching a ceasefire agreement and prisoner exchange was possible if Israel \u201cstops setting new conditions.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday morning, Katz said Israel would maintain control over Gaza after the fighting ends.",
      "\"After the military and governmental power of Hamas in Gaza is defeated, Israel will securely control Gaza with full freedom of action\" he posted on X, likening this outcome to Israel\u2019s current control over the occupied West Bank.",
      "Katz did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for details on what \u201cfull freedom of action\u201d would mean. But the comparison to the West Bank underscores a key concern for Palestinians and their supporters: the fear of prolonged Israeli military presence in Gaza, akin to the West Bank, where Israel maintains ultimate control over territory and settlements, and carries out regular raids in the area.",
      "Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow with Chatham House\u2019s Middle East and North Africa program, said Katz' comparisons with the West Bank suggest that Israel is \u201cgoing to have full control entering by any means at any given time.\u201d",
      "\"That\u2019s a completely fair enough interpretation, considering that we know what happens in the West Bank,\" he said. \"Is that what a ceasefire agreement is going to say? I have my doubts.\"",
      "Gershon Baskin, an Israeli hostage negotiator and frequent critic of Netanyahu's government, said he did not believe Katz' remark that Israel had never been closer to a ceasefire.",
      "\"I have difficult accepting that Hamas has dropped its fundamental demand of an obligation to end the war including full Israeli withdrawal,\" he told NBC News via WhatsApp.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has injected urgency into negotiations, repeating Monday his threat that there would be \u201chell to pay\u201d if no deal was in place by the time he was inaugurated Jan. 20.",
      "A senior administration official told NBC News on Friday that Trump\u2019s pressure was a major factor in Hamas relenting on two key issues during ceasefire and hostage-release talks with Israel.",
      "\u201cThere is a confidence we have not seen since May when\" President Joe Biden \"presented his proposal,\u201d the official told NBC News, acknowledging that Trump\u2019s warning that he wants to see a deal before he takes office was \u201ca big factor\u201d in recent concessions.",
      "The U.S. hopes to secure a ceasefire agreement before the end of the month, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said last week in a press conference in Tel Aviv.",
      "Recent developments in the region, including the weakening of Iran, the longtime backer of the terrorist group, the degradation of Hezbollah and the fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, also contributed to the compromise by Hamas, the senior Biden administration official said.",
      "Negotiations to secure the release of the remaining hostages captured by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack have languished for months. According to Israeli officials, around 1,200 people were killed in the country during the attack and around 250 people were taken hostage \u2014\u00a0dozens of whom\u00a0are still being held by Hamas and other militant groups.",
      "More than 45,000 people, more than half of them women and children, have been killed in the Gaza Strip in Israel's military campaign following the attack, according to the enclave's health officials and aid organizations. Much of the Palestinian enclave has been destroyed and a majority of the population driven from their homes."

      "The aftermath of an \u201cexceptionally violent\u201d attack in early Bronze Age England suggests that at least 37 people may have been \u201csystematically dismembered\u201d and eaten, new research has revealed.",
      "The attack, which took place around 4,000 years ago, reveals a case of cannibalism and \u201cthe darker side of human prehistory,\u201d according to the study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "Over 3,000 bones were excavated from a 50-foot pit in Charterhouse Warren, around 20 miles south of the city of Bristol in southwest England.",
      "The bones, which were chosen for analysis because of the \u201csheer number of cutmarks,\u201d were first discovered by cavers in the 1970s,\u00a0 researchers said.",
      "They had more violence inflicted on them then what would normally be seen \"in a butchered animal bone assemblage,\u201d Rick Schulting, the study's lead author, told NBC News in an email Monday.",
      "Schulting, a professor of scientific and prehistoric archaeology at Britain's University of Oxford, said that the archeology at the site is \u201cexceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe most\u00a0surprising thing is the\u00a0sheer extent of the violence carried\u00a0out on the bodies,\" he said. \"They were killed with blows to the head, and then systematically dismembered, defleshed, bones smashed\u00a0apart.\"",
      "The violence took place \u201cprobably in a single event between\u201d 2210 B.C. and 2010 B.C., researchers suggest, adding that it's a unique example of extreme violence in Early Bronze Age Britain and that \"nothing else on this scale\u201d has been recorded in Britain.",
      "However, Schulting said the extreme violence was unlikely to have been an isolated incident in the U.K. at the time. \u201cThere would have been repercussions, as the relatives and friends of the victims sought revenge, and this could have led to cycles of violence in the region,\u201d he added.",
      "Schulting said that determining the motive behind such as an attack is \u201cone of the hardest things to do in archaeology.\u201d But together with his fellow authors, he concluded in the study that the massacre was likely driven by a furious \u201cspiraling cycle of revenge\u201d within or between Early Bronze Age communities.",
      "\u201cTensions may have built up from relatively innocuous beginnings such as theft or accusations\u00a0of\u00a0witchcraft and then escalated out of control,\u201d Schulting said in his email.",
      "The victims might have been eaten to \u201cdehumanize\u201d them and \u201ctreat them like animals,\u201d Schulting said, emphasizing that this was not the action of just a few individuals. \u201cThe number of victims and the time it would have taken to dismember the victims tells us that there must have been a large number of aggressors involved.\u201d",
      "The bones were found with faunal assemblage, or animal fossils, that also showed initial \u201cevidence of butchery,\u201d although they have not been fully examined yet, the paper said.",
      "The authors do not believe that the attackers were driven to eat the human remains because of hunger, as the bone fragments were found alongside these animal bones, indicating there was sufficient food."
