      "Samara Joy\u2019s voice transports listeners to the early jazz clubs, evoking legends like Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Samara Joy\u2019s voice has the ability to transform listeners to the early jazz clubs, filling them with warm nostalgia for legends like Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan.",
      "At 25, Joy is a five-time Grammy winning recording artist, whose album, \u201cLinger Awhile\u201d won her best new artist and best jazz vocal album in 2023. She\u2019s been praised by artists like Chaka Khan, Regina King and Quincy Jones and has amassed a large following of her Gen-Z peers on TikTok, introducing a new generation to jazz.",
      "Last year, Joy released \u201cPortrait,\u201d her third and most personal studio album allowing listeners into the tension between excitement and feeling overwhelmed that often follows a whirlwind of accolades and success. Her first original song \u201cPeace of Mind\u201d fully captures this moment.",
      "\u201cI wrote it in a time where I was really questioning whether I could continue or not because I was so exhausted,\u201d said Joy. \u201cI reminded myself through that Sun Ra composition that I have experienced something wonderful, and it doesn\u2019t have to be the end all be all. This is just the beginning \u2026 this is just a springboard for all of the other creative ideas that I have and what I feel like I have to offer.\u201d",
      "For Joy, releasing \u201cPortrait\u201d was a creative challenge and a turning point toward trusting her creative instincts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s taught me a lot about what I can do and to stand firm in the creative vision and the direction that I see for myself,\u201d she said.",
      "Joy sat down with The Associated Press to talk about life post-Grammy wins, how diving into \u201cPortrait\u201d helped her grow as an artist and what it means to make her mark on the classic genre.",
      "This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.",
      "JOY: This album was a turning point. Because I feel like it was the first time I really had to make a decision about what my path was going to be. With the first two albums, it was just songs that I loved and felt like I could interpret as my own. And this album, \u201cPortrait,\u201d was the first time I felt like I took the reins of creative direction and band mates and songs. And honestly kind of opened up even more to my band mates and said, arrange. I want you guys to orchestrate this next era.",

      "So, it was definitely a big leap, I think, from maybe what people thought I should do after the second album after the best new artist. And I think this album taught me the importance of patience and not rushing to stay relevant or spark up a moment or just stay in that moment. It taught me to just take my time and really wait until you have something you feel like you have to say.",
      "JOY: I never expected to be nominated. I never thought that that was a possibility, at least so early on in my career.",
      "Even thinking about it now, I can see everybody still and still feel the way that I felt that night. It\u2019s a night that I will never ever forget. And I\u2019m thankful. I\u2019m really thankful to everybody who believed in me enough to allow me to have that moment, who voted, who listened to my music, who support me then and still support me now. Which is why I never want to lose sight of what I do this for.",
      "JOY: A couple years ago I did the Hollywood Bowl and it was a birthday celebration for Quincy Jones \u2014 Patty Austin, I got the chance to sing alongside of her. And backstage, you know, she was funny and sharp and quick, but she was just very supportive and very honest. And that meant a lot to me from somebody who has been in the industry for as long as she has and collaborated with Quincy Jones and George Benson and James Ingram and all these people to be so encouraging on this new journey as I kind of embark on it.\u201d",
      "JOY: I guess I never thought about it that way. There are so many wonderful artists that I draw inspiration from \u2014 Billy Strayhorn, Duke Ellington through the course of their lives contributed to the changing to the evolution of the music that we call jazz. I know that there\u2019s always gonna be a certain sense of nostalgia and a certain artist or song that people can connect to or relate to easily because jazz is not mainstream, at least to me, I don\u2019t think unless it is really, really, really, really watered down, I don\u2019t think it will be.",
      "But it\u2019s an opportunity for me to once again be authentic and show people like, \u201cHave you ever heard of this Abby Lincoln song?\u201d Or maybe this Thelonious Monk song doesn\u2019t have lyrics, but I can put lyrics to them and share a different, you know, a different compositional style. And a different voice in jazz. And so I guess that\u2019s my way of reclaiming it and educating in a way and just introducing people to the sound that they may not recognize at first, but good music is good music.",
      "JOY: I feel very honored and sometimes undeserving because of how new my relationship to their music was initially. I hadn\u2019t really listened to their music or their voices at all growing up and getting introduced to them in college, it just felt like another world had opened up and I felt like I wanna sing, I wanna be able to move people the way that they move me with their voices.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the first author who has now had censorship occur in two different types of media,\u201d Picoult says. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not out here to be salacious. I am writing the world as it is, and I am honestly just trying to write about difficult issues that people have a hard time talking about because that is what fiction and the arts do.\u201d",
      "The superintendent of Mississinewa High School in Gas City, Indiana, canceled a production last week of \u201cBetween the Lines,\u201d saying concerns were raised over \u201csexual innuendo\u201d and alcohol references in the musical. Jeremy Fewell, the superintendent, did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s devastating for us to know that these kids who put in hundreds of hours of hard work had that torn away from them because of the objections of a single parent,\u201d says Picoult.",
      "\u201cWhat I know, perhaps better than most people, as someone whose books have been banned, is when one parent starts deciding what is appropriate and what is inappropriate for the children of other parents, we have a big problem.\u201d",
      "Picoult noted that the same Indiana high school has previously produced \u201cGrease,\u201d where the sexual innuendo and alcohol abuse is much greater, including a pregnancy scare, sex-mad teens and the line \u201cDid she put up a fight?\u201d",
      "\u201cBetween the Lines\u201d centers on Delilah, an outsider in a new high school, who finds solace in a book and realizes she has the power to write her own story and narrate her own life. \u201cIt is a very benign message. And it\u2019s actually a really important one for adolescents today,\u201d says Picoult.",
      "The original work, which features a nonbinary character, had already been edited with licensed changes to make it more palatable for a conservative audience, including removing any reference to the nonbinary character's gender orientation.",
      "The production was scheduled for Halloween weekend at the Gas City Performing Arts Center. The show has music and lyrics by Elyssa Samsel and Kate Anderson, and a story by Timothy Allen McDonald, based on the 2012 novel by Picoult and her daughter, Samantha van Leer. It played off-Broadway in 2022.",

As fans may recall, Boone\u2019s \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d sent millions of overactive tear ducts and sniffly noses into overdrive. It would have been good to have a whole box of tissues at hand.",
      "Of course, that story was about not only about teen love but teen cancer. It was hard not to cry just thinking about it, let alone seeing it. \u201cRegretting You,\u201d a tragicomic intergenerational romance adapted by Susan McMartin, has its share of grief. But the strange way the tears give way to smiles, quips and then full-on rom-com corniness feels a little awkward \u2014 and then just weird and annoying. It\u2019s a two-Kleenex ride, at most \u2014 definitely not the whole box.",
      "Allison Williams and Dave Franco play Morgan and Jonah, and when we first meet them in high school, they have definite chemistry (they also look like they\u2019re around 30, despite some de-aging). But Jonah\u2019s dating Morgan\u2019s sister Jenny, and Morgan is with Jonah\u2019s buddy Chris. This prelude, at a teen gathering on the beach, introduces us to the quartet but also informs us of Morgan\u2019s unexpected pregnancy, which she's just discovered in a convenience store restroom.",
      "\u201cHow did we end up with our exact opposites?\u201d Jonah asks on the beach, as hunky Chris parties and gets drunk, along with Morgan\u2019s fun-loving sister.",
      "And then 17 years later, we meet the foursome again. We\u2019re more than a little disappointed to know that the couples remained intact \u2014 sort of. Did Morgan REALLY marry the boyfriend who told her on the beach that she was more fun when drunk? Yes, Morgan married Chris. And sister Jenny is with Jonah (bespectacled and dark and twisty, as Meredith Grey might say) \u2014 but only because a one-night stand has led to a baby, which they're co-parenting.",
      "Then there\u2019s the other baby \u2014 Morgan\u2019s daughter Clara (Mckenna Grace), about to turn 17, lovely, smart and aiming for drama school. There\u2019s some conflict with her mother about this ambition, though like so much here, it really doesn't ring true that Morgan, as portrayed by the always-appealing Williams, would oppose such a thing. But whatever. Who are we to question the stuff between teen daughters and their moms, right?",
      "Then Miller turns up. Known as the coolest guy in school (believable) but also a slightly sketchy sort (not believable), Miller, played sweetly by Mason Thames, enters Clara\u2019s life when he hitches a ride with her. She knows he has a girlfriend, but is smitten. Theirs is a rocky road to love. Kidding! Only a few pesky pebbles stand in the way, seemingly meant to take up pages in a meandering script. (He breaks up with the girlfriend. He reunites with the girlfriend! He breaks up with the girlfriend again. He\u2019s a little angry! He\u2019s fine again.)",

      "Yorgos Lanthimos' movies are farces, fables and experiments that reside in surreal worlds of their own",
      "The twisted filmography of Yorgos Lanthimos has by now trained us to expect darkly comic visions of contemporary life, both savage and mundane. His movies have perhaps inspired the most \u201cWhat?!\u201d reactions of the last decade, partly because they\u2019ve tried so hard to do so.",
      "His movies \u2014 farces, fables, experiments \u2014 reside in surreal worlds of their own. But his latest, \u201cBugonia,\u201d is thrillingly, if tragically, tied to our reality. It might even be his best film. Though I\u2019ve been apprehensive about the flamboyant severity of Lanthimos\u2019 movies, I found \u201cBugonia,\u201d a chamber-piece gut punch, hard to shake. For starters, it\u2019s difficult to resist any movie with a line in it like: \u201cThere\u2019s Andromedan code all over your Instagram.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s one of the things that Teddy (Jesse Plemons), an incel eco-terrorist, says to Michelle (Emma Stone) after kidnapping her with his neurodivergent cousin Donny (newcomer Aidan Delbis) and tying her up in their basement. Teddy and Donny live together in fairly remote, rundown old house. There, Teddy tends to both his bees and to unhinged conspiracy theories.",
      "But as Plemons so deftly plays him, Teddy doesn\u2019t seem like a lunatic. He might reach wildly insane conclusions, such as that Michelle, a pharmaceutical company chief executive, is an alien. But he\u2019s thoughtful in nature and sweetly cares for his cousin. It\u2019s a feat of Plemons\u2019 innate good nature that we kind of like Teddy, even as he shaves Michelle\u2019s head, to prevent \u201cit,\u201d as he calls her, from contacting the mothership.",
      "The opening moments of the script by Will Tracy (\u201cThe Menu,\u201d episodes of \u201cSuccession\u201d) cast these demented shenanigans in an apocalyptic light. The fate of bees is much on Teddy\u2019s mind; colony collapse disorder, often caused by pesticides, is one of his talking points. It\u2019s a phenomenon that, in \u201cBugonia\u201d \u2014 a movie reckoning with, or maybe just lamenting, humanity\u2019s fate \u2014 isn\u2019t just for the bees.",
      "While Stone\u2019s abilities alone might legitimize extraterrestrial suspicions, there\u2019s more to why Teddy has pinpointed Michelle. She\u2019s a lauded corporate leader; her office includes a framed Time magazine with her on the cover and a photograph with Michelle Obama. Her company, Auxolith, operates out of a sleek office building where Michelle presides over her workforce like a queen bee. She has the corporate lingo of \u201ctransparency\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d down pat, but whether she actually adheres to any of those ideals is dubious, at best. Before Teddy and Donny jump her, she announces a \u201cnew era\u201d at Auxolith where employees leave at 5:30 p.m. But not if they haven\u2019t met their quota, she adds. And not if they\u2019re, you know, busy.",
      "In that way, Michelle is a camera-ready cover for whatever Auxolith is up to, which, as the movie goes along, teases out a poisonous history, including opioid manufacturing that affected Teddy\u2019s mother (Alicia Silverstone).",

It\u2019s a conversation, laced with contemporary divides, that is comical for its impossibility. One is addled by paranoia and extremism, the other knows only heartless corporate speak. Understanding each other is futile. Watching Stone, as Michelle, attempt to reason with Teddy is part of the movie\u2019s dark fun, just as is seeing Plemons\u2019 Teddy resolutely stick to his certainty that Michelle is part of an alien infiltration of Earth that he wants gone by the next lunar eclipse.",
      "The source of such a wild narrative can only come, of course, from South Korea. \u201cBugonia\u201d is loosely based on the 2003 Korean film \u201cSave the Green Planet!\u201d All of Lanthimos\u2019 most notable films before have been written with either Efthimis Filippou (\u201cDogtooth,\u201d \u201cThe Lobster\u201d) or Tony McNamara (\u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cThe Favourite\u201d). But, otherwise, \u201cBugonia\u201d has the feel of a quick follow-up to last year\u2019s \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d a black-comedy triptych also led by Stone and Plemons.",
      "Yet what could easily be mistaken for a tossed-off, in-between movie \u2014 there are only a handful of characters and a few scene locations \u2014 ends up feeling like a culmination-slash-nadir for Lanthimos. Having made a dozen films darkly satirizing the sad, primal folly of humankind, it\u2019s comeuppance time in \u201cBugonia.\u201d",
      "The movie drags in the middle, when it\u2019s locked in a prisoner drama that grows a little tiresome and predictable. But the payoff is immense. Teddy calls his torture chamber \u201cthe headquarters of the human resistance.\u201d By the time \u201cBugonia\u201d reaches its unforgettable finale, it's made chillingly clear just how feeble any such movement might be, and the movie's apocalyptic air of resignation, of fait accompli, sounds a chastening death knell.",
      "\u201cBugonia,\u201d a Focus Features release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for bloody violent content including a suicide, grisly images and language. Running time: 118 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "Echoing what senior VP of football operations Troy Vincent said Tuesday, Goodell said there has not been much discussion about the tush push quarterback sneak since an effort to ban it narrowly failed to pass in the spring.",

      "Vincent said the primary concern is how tough it is to officiate the maneuver that the Philadelphia Eagles have successfully executed so often. It was not on the formal agenda at this meeting, though owners did get an update on penalties and other football matters.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we will continue to monitor on all phases, just like we do every other aspect of the game,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any proposals to bring it back up. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if something does evolve. But it\u2019s not something we\u2019re really focused on during the season.\u201d",
      "Asked about replay reviews and the length of time they are taking, Goodell said game times are actually down through the first seven weeks compared to last season, despite a surge in kick returns after an adjustment was made to the so-called dynamic kickoff.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s quite remarkable when you add the number of kickoffs,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get more fouls. You\u2019re going to get different sets of fouls. You\u2019re going to have a little bit (more) length of the game.\u201d",
      "Goodell said he had breakfast with interim Players Association executive director David White before one of the league's international games this season but expects any talk about a move to an 18-game regular season and other collective bargaining discussions to wait until the union chooses its long-term leader.",
      "The current CBA runs through the 2031 league year. White told The Associated Press last month that an 18-game season was not inevitable.",
      "\u201cThe negotiations will be a lot more than just simply the 18 and two (exhibition games),\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThere are a lot of issues that we are going to raise and I\u2019m certain that the players will raise, and that\u2019s what it should be. That\u2019s what collective bargaining is all about. They\u2019re going to need time to make sure that they\u2019re prepared, that they\u2019re ready for the negotiations (and) they have their priorities straight, and then we can begin negotiations.\u201d",
      "Goodell said work is being done to choose sites for the Super Bowl to cap the 2028 and \u201829 seasons and expects an announcement on those next year.",

      "Ballerina Misty Copeland has taken one last passionate spin on the ballet stage before saying goodbye",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Misty Copeland took one last spin on her pointe shoes Wednesday, showered with golden glitter and bouquets as she retired from American Ballet Theatre after a trailblazing career in which she became an ambassador for diversity in an overwhelmingly white art form.",
      "Copeland, who a decade ago became the first Black female principal dancer in the company\u2019s 75-year history, was feted at its star-studded fall gala at Manhattan's Lincoln Center. Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who gave speeches of praise.",
      "Winfrey spoke of the power of young people of color seeing Copeland lead iconic ballets like \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d",
      "\u201cMisty didn\u2019t just perform ballet,\" Winfrey said of the ballerina who has achieved a unique crossover fame. \"She changed it. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\u201d",
      "In a way, the gala was both a return and a departure for Copeland, 43. She was dancing with the company for the first time in five years. During that time, Copeland has been raising a son, Jackson, with her husband. The 3-year-old came onstage to hug his mother during curtain calls, wearing a tuxedo.",
      "Copeland has also been continuing her career as an author \u2014 the second volume of her \u201cBunheads\u201d series appeared in September \u2014 and working to increase diversity in the dance world with her namesake foundation, including \u201cBe Bold,\u201d an afterschool program designed for young children of color.",
      "But she decided to dust off the pointe shoes so she could have one last spin on the ABT stage \u2014 including as Juliet, one of the most passionate roles in ballet and her personal favorite. Copeland's Romeo in the balcony pas de deux was Calvin Royal III, who in 2020 became ABT's first Black male principal dancer in two decades.",
      "The duo later reappeared for another duet, this time a modern one, in \u201cWrecka Stow,\u201d by Kyle Abraham. For Copeland's final performance of the night, she performed Twyla Tharp's \u201cSinatra Suite\u201d with another of her favorite partners, Herman Cornejo.",
      "The night, which also celebrated ABT's 85th anniversary and was curated in large part by Copeland herself, included speeches and film clips about her career. And her fellow dancers performed excerpts of ballets in her honor. At the end, a beaming Copeland was given a quintessential ballet farewell, as colleagues, teachers, friends and family came out to greet her, one by one, with hugs and bouquets while glittery confetti poured from the rafters.",
      "Though Copeland has not closed the door on dancing altogether, it\u2019s clear an era is ending.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d she told The Associated Press in an interview in June, when she announced her retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.\u201d",

      "For a future professional dancer, she came to ballet relatively late \u2014 at 13 \u2014 but soon excelled and went on to study at the San Francisco Ballet School and ABT on scholarship opportunities. After a stint in the junior company, Copeland joined ABT as a member of the corps de ballet in April 2001, becoming a soloist six years later.",
      "In June 2015, Copeland was promoted to principal dancer. Unlike other promotions, which are announced quietly, Copeland's was announced at a news conference \u2014 a testament to her celebrity.

      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely concerning,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve just gotten to a place in my career where there\u2019s only so much I can do on a stage. There\u2019s only so much that visual representation \u2026 can do. I feel like it\u2019s the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.\u201d",
      "She also noted this is an especially trying moment for anyone working in the area of diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think all we can really do is keep our heads down and keep doing the work. There\u2019s no way to stop the people that feel passionate about this work. We will continue doing it.\u201d",

      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 A major German private art collection accumulated over four generations is going on large-scale show for the first time in Berlin, with a who's who of French art of the 19th and 20th centuries at its core.",
      "The Scharf Collection has its roots in a collection started more than a century ago by Otto Gerstenberg, who led a Berlin life insurance company. It's now in the hands of Gerstenberg's great-grandson, Ren\u00e9 Scharf, and his wife, Christiane, who have expanded it further into contemporary art.",
      "The roughly 150 works going on show this week at Berlin's Alte Nationalgalerie range in time from the early 19th century, with plates from Spanish master Francisco de Goya's series \u201cThe Disasters of War\u201d and \u201cLa Tauromaquia,\u201d to modern abstract works by German artists Katharina Grosse and Anselm Reyle. Compositions by Sam Francis and Jasper Johns bring an American element to the collection.",
      "\u201cWe go from Goya to Grosse,\u201d Ren\u00e9 Scharf said as the exhibition was presented Wednesday. He said that he has a particular passion for impressionism, cubism and contemporary art, and hopes visitors who see Grosse's shimmering pink and blue \u201cNo title\u201d at the end of the show will see a connection to Claude Monet's impressionist \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d from nearly a century earlier.",
      "At the heart of the collection are works by many of the biggest names in French art of the past two centuries. Visitors progress from the romantic paintings of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix to the realist work of Gustave Courbet and the caricatures of Honor\u00e9 Daumier, including a series of busts of French lawmakers by the latter.",
      "One of Claude Monet's earlier, realist works, \u201cFarmyard in Chailly,\" is displayed alongside later impressionist paintings such as \u201cSteep Cliffs near Dieppe\u201d and one of his \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d series. There are works on paper and canvas by Auguste Renoir and Paul C\u00e9zanne, complemented by nudes and dancers by Edgar Degas.",
      "Two of Pierre Bonnard's major works are prominently displayed \u2014 the lively and playful \u201cPlace Clichy,\u201d depicting a Paris square close to his studio, and \u201cThe Large Bathtub,\u201d portraying the artist's wife. They're shown close to pieces by his close friend Henri Matisse as the exhibition heads toward the cubism and the modern day with work from Pablo Picasso, Fernand L\u00e9ger and others.",

      "Scharf said that, after the Alte Nationalgalerie approached him about showing the collection, \u201cwe asked ourselves what happens if we do nothing? Then maybe 30, 40 or 50 people per year will see the collection and only a very small part of it, because we can't hang everything at home.\u201d",

      "He wrote both the music and lyrics for most of his songs, which had deeply political, romantic and humorous content. His debut album, \u201cFortigo,\u201d meaning Truck, was released in 1966 and became a major success, propelled him to fame with its combination of political commentary, rock influences and Greek folk idioms.",
      "He solidified his success with is second album, \u201cThe Fool\u2019s Garden,\u201d released three years later in 1969, during the military dictatorship. Savvopoulos quickly became one of Greece\u2019s leading voices of artistic dissent, and by the time the junta fell in 1974, he was considered one of the most important and original Greek songwriters of his generation.",

      "Universal Pictures says Sunday that \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d has topped the North American box office with an estimated $26.5 million in ticket sales",
      "The horror sequel \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d topped the North American box office charts this weekend with $26.5 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Not only did it surpass the original's $23.6 million debut, it's a much-needed win for Blumhouse after a string of disappointments this year like \u201cM3GAN 2.0.\u201d",
      "Though \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d opened in line with expectations, moviegoing in October continues to be slow \u2014 down about 11% from last year, according to Comscore. The overall box office is still up about 4% compared with last year, but a big blockbuster hit that could spark more momentum might not arrive until late November or December.",
      "Universal Pictures released \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d in 3,411 theaters in North America on a wave of good reviews. Coming four years after the original, the sequel sees the return of filmmaker Scott Derrickson, as well as stars Ethan Hawke and Mason Thames. Opening weekend audiences were 63% between the ages of 18 and 34, according to exit polls, and the biggest demographic was Hispanics, making up 39% of ticket buyers while Caucasians accounted for 35%.",
      "With an additional $15.5 million from 71 international territories, \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d had a $42 million worldwide launch against a reported $30 million production budget.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opening,\u201d said Jim Orr, who heads Universal\u2019s domestic distribution. \u201cOur great partners in Scott Derrickson and Blumhouse once again took this property and crafted an unbelievably haunting, chilling story that audiences just simply couldn\u2019t get enough of.\u201d",
      "The first \u201cBlack Phone\u201d was a bit of a sleeper hit for Universal and Blumhouse in 2021 as cinemas were beginning to come back to life after COVID shutdowns. By the end of its run, it had earned more than $161 million worldwide against an $18 million budget.",
      "Blumhouse has had a rocky 2025, with a handful of duds including \u201cWolf Man\u201d and \u201cThe Woman in the Yard.\u201d But the once impenetrable horror hitmaker could be on the upswing again with a \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d sequel coming in December. The first movie earned nearly $300 million worldwide.",
      "The horror genre in general has soared to record-breaking heights this year, with hits like \u201cWeapons\u201d and the multi-genre \u201cSinners,\" generating over $1.2 billion for the industry, noted Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s head of marketplace trends.",
      "\u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d was also the only film to really break through this weekend, despite a slew of options playing in wide release including the R-rated Seth Rogen, Aziz Ansari and Keanu Reeves comedy \u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in 2,990 locations to $6.2 million, and the expansion of the Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which made $1.6 million from 1,238 theaters. Also new in theaters is Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d although Netflix does not report box office grosses.",
      "\u201cTron: Ares\u201d fell about 67% to $11.1 million in its second weekend in theaters, which was enough to snag second place on the charts. Globally it has now earned $103 million.",
      "\u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in third place, had mostly positive reviews on its side, but Ansari's comedy with a side of social commentary did not drum up a lot of enthusiasm in its first weekend. With a B+ CinemaScore, though, it likely has a better chance in the coming weeks than the campus drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which got a very poor C- score.",
      "\u201cThis is a quintessential October for movies, meaning this is not a hotbed of box office blockbusters,\u201d said Dergarabedian. \u201cBut the marketplace is flush with titles. This is awards season; this is where you have a lot of auteur driven films, edgier films. Collectively these don\u2019t generate a ton of box office, but there\u2019s the currency of goodwill created with movie fans.\u201d",
      "Next weekend audiences will get another batch of awards-hopefuls, including Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s latest Emma Stone collaboration \u201cBugonia\u201d and the Bruce Springsteen biopic \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,\u201d starring \u201cThe Bear\u2019s\u201d Jeremy Allen White.",

      "Being pregnant changes many of the processes that allow the body to stay cool during extreme heat",
      "Doctors have long known that heat puts a strain on the heart, kidneys and other organs. Those risks are exacerbated for pregnant people, as the body's processes for staying cool are altered.",
      "It\u2019s a problem that climate change, caused by the burning of fuels like gasoline and coal, is worsening. Intensifying extreme heat events, high temperatures well into the night and shattering weather records means more exposure for pregnant people, particularly in developing countries.",
      "Here's what to know about the science of pregnancy and extreme heat:",
      "Pregnancy changes the body in myriad ways, which can make it more difficult and uncomfortable to dissipate heat.",
      "\u201cAn obvious thing is, pregnant people have a belly bump, depending how far along they are, and that\u2019s a change in their surface to volume ratio,\u201d said Anna Bershteyn, an associate professor at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine and director of Project HEATWAVE, an initiative aimed at improving research on preventing extreme heat deaths. Heat leaves your body through your skin, so when the belly gets larger, the heat has farther to travel to escape.",
      "As pregnancy progresses, the body burns more calories, creating internal heat. The heart has to work harder, which can already be strained by extreme heat. And people who are pregnant also need more liquid to stay hydrated, so they might get dehydrated more easily, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "One way the body cools itself is by shunting blood toward the skin and away from the central organs, which is why a person's skin may flush and turn red when they get hot. Emerging research indicates that reduced blood flow to the placenta can affect the development of the fetus.",
      "For pregnant people handling potent substances like pesticides, increased blood flow can also increase chemical absorption, said Dr. Chris Holstege, chief of the division of medical toxicology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine.",
      "Research is beginning to show exposure to extreme heat even in the months before getting pregnant may affect a future pregnancy, said Cara Schulte, a researcher with the University of California Berkeley and the nonprofit Climate Rights International studying maternal health and heat.",
      "During pregnancy, even short-term exposure to heat can increase the risk of severe maternal health complications, such as high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy, according to the EPA. That includes preeclampsia, a condition that can be fatal for both mother and child.",
      "Heat can also worsen anxiety, depression and feelings of isolation and once the baby is born, \u201call of those things are compounded by this difficulty that postpartum women have in caring for their children in the heat,\u201d Schulte said.",

      "New Zealand is being battered by dangerous winds for the second time in a week, causing chaos across the country",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 Swathes of New Zealand were pummeled by dangerous winds for the second time in a week on Thursday, with howling gales canceling hundreds of flights, causing electricity blackouts and forcing school closures.",
      "The gales were worst in the lower North Island, where the capital Wellington is located, and in parts of the South Island, including the city of Christchurch. The national forecaster MetService issued rare \"red\" wind warnings, the highest level of alert, for several regions.",
      "No deaths or serious injuries were reported. When a different weather system battered the country on Monday, a Wellington man was struck and killed by a falling tree branch.",
      "The havoc on Thursday also disrupted planned rallies for health and education workers in what was likely the country's biggest industrial walkout in decades. More than 100,000 workers represented by four unions walked off the job for four hours, after months of talks with the government about pay and conditions broke down.",
      "More than 200 flights across New Zealand were canceled on Thursday as some urban parts of New Zealand experienced wind speeds of 140 to 160 km (87 to 100 miles) per hour, with gusts in one remote, rural part of the South Island registering 230 km (143 miles) per hour.",
      "Tens of thousands of properties were without power in different parts of the country. The winds downed trees, ripped off roofs, and in the city of Dunedin, toppled shipping containers at the port.",
      "Dangerous winds also forced the closure of some highways. The remote West Coast of the South Island was cut off by road after flooding closed the only routes to the area.",
      "Some rallies by teachers, doctors and nurses around the country whose unions had planned a coordinated strike Thursday were canceled due to the weather. Union leaders said workers were still on strike, even where demonstrations were canceled.",
      "Thousands still marched in the cities of Auckland and Hamilton, and hundreds of people turned out for demonstrations in small towns unaffected by the bad weather.",

      "Hospitals and emergency rooms remained open to the public, but the government health agency urged people not to seek medical attention unless the matter was urgent. Medical staff at one hospital in the city of Nelson returned to work during the strike when the facility lost electricity in high winds.",
      "In the days before the strike, ministers in New Zealand's center-right government \u2014 often at odds with workers' unions \u2014 lambasted the action as politically motivated. Union leaders rejected the charge, saying they had also enacted strikes during the previous center-left government.",
      "About half of those who walked off the job were teachers and the rest included doctors, dentists, nurses, social workers and other medical practitioners. Their demands varied between industries, but pay, staffing levels and working conditions were the central complaints prompting the strike.",
      "The action came amid steep government cuts to public spending and record numbers of New Zealanders leaving the country \u2014 particularly for neighboring Australia, where medical practitioners are lured by higher salaries and lower living costs.",
      "Several major highways remained closed on Thursday night and residents of some South Island regions remained on alert as rivers rose and threatened to breach their banks. Winds were due to ease by Friday, although the authorities urged caution for travelers.",
      "Bans on fireworks and fires were enacted for much of the country and would remain in place for the rest of the week, the national fire service said. The strong winds whipped up wildfires during both Monday's and Thursday's storms and fire fighters hadn't been able to quell the worst of the blazes by Thursday night.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s location in the southern latitudes and the mountain ranges that run the length of the country can produce wild weather throughout the year.",

      "Goldman and her colleagues analyzed nasal swabs and symptom reports from more than 800 students and staff in a large school district in Kansas City from November 2022 to May 2023.",
      "They found that overall, more than 85% of all participants had at least one respiratory virus detected during that time and more than 80% had an episode of acute respiratory illness \u2014 though not necessarily at the same time.",
      "More telling, 92% of pre-K and elementary school kids had a virus detected, compared with about 86% of middle school students, about 77% of high school students and 76% of staff.",

      "Most of the viruses were the kinds that cause the common cold, including rhinovirus, which was found in 65% of participants, and types of seasonal coronavirus detected in about 30%. The virus that causes COVID-19 was found in about 15% of those studied.",
      "The new study provides a baseline look at the burden of viruses in school settings, Goldman said.",

      "As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House \u2014 not for urgent talks on how to end it, but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House on Tuesday \u2014 not for urgent talks on how to end it, but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands.",
      "Senate Democrats, too, are confident in their strategy to keep voting against a House-passed bill that would reopen the government until Republicans, including Trump, engage them on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.",
      "With both sides showing no signs of movement, it\u2019s unclear how long the stalemate will last \u2014 even as hundreds of thousands of federal workers will miss another paycheck in the coming days and states are sounding warnings that key federal programs will soon lapse completely. And the meeting at the White House appears unlikely, for now, to lead to a bipartisan resolution as Senate Republicans are dug in and Trump has followed their lead.",
      "\u201cI think the president\u2019s ready to get involved on having the discussion\u201d about extending the subsidies, said Senate Republican leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Monday. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they are prepared to do that until (Democrats) open up the government.\u201d",
      "While Capitol Hill remains at a standstill, the effects of the shutdown are worsening. Federal workers are set to miss additional paychecks amid total uncertainty about when they might eventually get paid. Government services like the  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, and Head Start preschool programs that serve needy families are facing potential cutoffs in funding. On Monday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the National Nuclear Security Administration is furloughing 1,400 federal workers. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air controller shortages and flight delays in cities across the United States.",
      "Still, there has been little urgency in Washington as each side believes the other will eventually cave.",
      "\u201cOur position remains the same, we want to end the shutdown as soon as we can and fix the ACA premium crisis that looms over 20 million hardworking Americans,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Monday, referring to the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire in December.",
      "Schumer called the White House meeting a \u201cpep rally\u201d and said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of town during the shutdown.",
      "Members of both parties acknowledge that as the shutdown drags on, it is becoming less likely every day that Congress will be able to either extend the subsidies or fund the government through the regular appropriations process. The House GOP bill that Senate Democrats have now rejected 11 times would only keep the government open through Nov. 21.",
      "Thune on Monday hinted that Republicans may propose a longer extension of current funding instead of passing individual spending bills if the shutdown doesn\u2019t end soon. Congress would need to pass an extension beyond Nov. 21, he said, \u201cif not something on a much longer-term basis.\u201d",
      "Democrats are focused on Nov. 1, when next year\u2019s enrollment period for the ACA coverage begins and millions of people will sign up for their coverage without the expanded subsidy help that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. Once those sign-ups begin, they say, it would be much harder to restore the subsidies even if they did have a bipartisan compromise.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cBeing bald is sexy. It\u2019s an attitude. It\u2019s a luxury. It\u2019s a lifestyle.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s how Brennan Nevada Johnson, who shaved her head voluntarily 14 years ago, opens the video podcast she launched last November to celebrate the advantages of choosing a bald look.",
      "Sensuous, self-assured and glamorous are not the adjectives typically assigned to women with shorn hair. For centuries, many cultures have viewed long hair as a symbol of femininity, health and fertility. But more women are defying that traditional beauty standard and finding empowerment by baring their heads.",
      "\u201cOnce you do it, it brings all this confidence into your life,\u201d Johnson, 34, said. \u201cWhenever you see someone who\u2019s bald and not wearing a wig, just know that they have fully embraced themselves, and I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s really challenging to do.\"",
      "Her initial decision to go baldheaded was practical. Johnson played competitive volleyball in college and found the sweating she did on the court affected the expensive hair relaxing treatments she often had done. Once she started shaving off her hair, though, she was hooked. She was relieved to save money on salon trips.",
      "Johnson now owns a New York public relations firm. \u201cBald and Buzzed with Brennan,\u201d the video podcast she posts on YouTube, was an attempt to fill a void in social media content that affirmed bald people, especially women. She says she always thought baldness was sexy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a fashion statement, and it\u2019s a really powerful look,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Other women without hair, whether voluntarily or due to medical conditions, also have sought ways to support each other, attending conferences, joining \u201cbaldie\u201d groups and swapping grooming and scalp care tips.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole community of us out there,\u201d said Dash Lopez, a content creator who posts a weekly video series of her shaving routine called \u201cFresh Cut Friday.\u201d \u201cWe need to talk about it because we do find comfort and empowerment and beauty in what some people think is weird.\u201d",
      "Lopez said members of her family praised the long curly hair she had growing up. Some of her friends played with different hair colors and styles, but Lopez said she didn't have the same freedom. And she didn't enjoy detangling her hair or spending long afternoons at the salon.",
      "As soon as she turned 18 and could get a haircut without permission, she chopped her locks into a pixie cut. Then she shaved it all off during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt makes me feel powerful in the sense that I\u2019m able to detach from the things that people place so much emphasis on,\u201d Lopez, 29, said. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here planning, \u2018Oh my gosh, when am I going to get my next color appointment done? That\u2019s gonna cost me $300. Oh my gosh. I\u2019ve got to get my hair done before I go to this event.\u2019\u201d",
      "Lopez signed a contract with a modeling agency in 2020, a time when brands wanted to showcase diversity, she said. Back then, being bald worked for her professionally.",
      "\u201cThere was an appreciation for quirks and if you had a gap in your tooth, if you had a bald head, if you had a face full of freckles, that\u2019s what casting directors were looking for,\u201d Lopez said.",
      "She noticed the tide shifting last year, when her bookings for modeling jobs decreased. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, the odds were stacked against me in the modeling world,\" Lopez said. \"I was 5\u2032 4\u2033, 5\u2032 5\u2033 on paper, no hair.\u201d",
      "A client suggested she wear wigs to land more work. Lopez did not want to do that or grow out her hair. Her modeling contract ended. Since then, she has shared glimpses of her life as a bald woman on Instagram and TikTok, where some of her videos have been watched millions of times.",

      "\u201cBeing bald, it\u2019s like a boost of confidence out of nowhere,\u201d said Soumaoro, who cuts her hair every Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s like a new skin, a new layer, a new personality. I just feel fresh. Like I was born again.\u201d",
      "She also hikes on Sundays, savoring the feeling of cold breezes on her scalp. \u201cHaving that connection with Earth, it feels amazing,\u201d Soumaoro said. \u201cI feel like I can hear everything more clearly. It\u2019s like I have a clear mindset when my head is bald.\u201d",

      "If you\u2019re thinking about shaving your head, don\u2019t hesitate, Thomas advises. Women tell her they\u2019re concerned that their head isn\u2019t the right shape, or they have a lump or a scar. \u201cDo it without thought,\u201d she said. \u201cDo it scared. Everything in life, just do it scared. The best way to get through that fear is to actually do it.\u201d",

      "A British judge has sentenced five men for their roles in an arson attack in London that authorities say was masterminded by Russian intelligence as part of a wider campaign of sabotage and disruption",
      "LONDON -- A British judge on Friday sentenced five men for their roles in an arson attack in London that authorities say was masterminded by Russian intelligence as part of a wider campaign of sabotage and disruption.",
      "The sentences ranged from seven to 17 years in prison.",
      "The men were involved in a plot to set fire to a warehouse in east London in March 2024 that contained satellite communication devices destined for Ukraine. British prosecutors said that the arson \u2014 organized on behalf of the Wagner paramilitary group \u2014 was intimately connected to the Russian state and likely linked to another arson attack against a warehouse in Spain.",
      "The fire is one of at least 25 arson or explosives plots across Europe linked to Russia by Western officials that The Associated Press has documented since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "European intelligence officials have told the AP that the risk of death or serious injury is rising as saboteurs directed by Russia set fires near homes and businesses, plant explosives or build bombs. The pattern of attacks is similar across Europe and the goal, the officials say, is to undermine support for Ukraine, sow fear and create conflict.",
      "\u201cThis offence was part of a series of European-wide sabotage operations,\u201d prosecutor Duncan Penny said.",
      "The actions of Dylan Earl \u2014 the British man who arranged the arson \u2014 constituted a \u201csustained campaign of terrorism and sabotage on U.K. soil, carried out in support of a foreign power \u2014 the Russian Federation \u2014 and its war of aggression against Ukraine,\u201d Penny said.",
      "The sentences were the first a British court imposed for violating the National Security Act, which was introduced in 2023 to address threats from foreign states including espionage and sabotage. U.K. counterterrorism police said that three men were arrested under the act on Thursday on suspicion of spying for Russia.",
      "Sentencing Earl, 21, to 17 years in prison, Judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said that he was a member of numerous pro-Russia propaganda channels on Telegram and part of a \u201cpernicious\u201d plot organized by Moscow. Earl played \u201ca leading role in terrorist activities,\u201d she said.",
      "The arson in East London caused 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) in damage to a warehouse owned by a Ukrainian couple who shipped StarLink satellite communication devices to Ukraine. The devices are often used by the Ukrainian military.",
      "The couple also own a business on the outskirts of Madrid that was set on fire 10 days after the attack in London, a counterterrorism officer from the Metropolitan Police told the court in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe method used, the time of night, the time of year, and the business targeted strongly suggest the two incidents ... may be linked,\u201d Penny said, reading the officer\u2019s statement.",
      "During the trial, the jury was shown messages where Earl and his co-conspirators also talked about burning down London businesses owned by Evgeny Chichvarkin \u2014 a Russian tycoon who delivered supplies to Ukraine \u2014 and kidnapping him.",
      "At sentencing, the court heard how Earl also tried to pay someone identified as a serving British soldier for intelligence for the Wagner Group \u2014 a mercenary organization whose operations were taken over by Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry in 2023.",
      "Earl also discussed burning down a warehouse in the Czech Republic for 35,000 pounds ($47,000), a day after the London arson, kidnapping another billionaire for the purposes of extortion and the need to collect bank card details on European residents.",
      "Earl\u2019s defense attorney Paul Hynes painted him as a \u201csad\u201d fantasist who boasted to his Russian recruiter that he could be \u201cthe best spy you have ever seen\u201d as well as of having ties to international criminal gangs.",

      "He communicated on Telegram with Privet Bot \u2014 an account which posted multiple times in a Telegram channel linked to the Wagner Group, asking for people to join the battle against the West. The Metropolitan Police on Friday released an image of Earl holding up his passport to confirm his identity to Privet Bot \u2014 who likely was linked to Russian military intelligence, the court heard.",
      "The recruiter and Earl communicated predominantly in Russian with Earl using Google to translate.",
      "Privet Bot asked Earl to \u201cget access to bank accounts containing money destined for Ukraine,\u201d including Russian assets frozen after President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of the country.",
      "\u201cWe need those who are our kindred spirit,\u201d the Russian recruiter said.",
      "Earl was \u201ceasy meat\u201d for the \u201csophisticated operatives\u201d from the Wagner Group, Hynes said. But Judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb disagreed with that assessment and said that he was motivated by \u201csimple and ugly greed.\u201d",
      "Police and intelligence services are grappling with similar attacks throughout Europe, including where people have been recruited online.",
      "Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Polish authorities have investigated multiple arson attacks on shopping centers, industrial areas and apartment buildings which show how Russian operatives often \u201cfollow the same pattern\u201d in attacks across Europe, said Jacek Dobrzy\u0144ski spokesperson for Poland\u2019s security minister. Authorities Tuesday said that they detained people over another plot to send explosives to Ukraine.",
      "In 2024, a Colombian man was directed on the Telegram messaging app to set fire to two warehouses in Poland and then to travel to the Czech capital, Prague, to set fire to public buses.",
      "Like Earl, he was given the location for the fires, instructions on how and when to set them and told to provide video evidence to Russia\u2019s intelligence services to get paid, Dobrzy\u0144ski told the AP.",
      "The goal of the arson attacks is to \u201cintimidate people,\u201d create conflict and to undermine European societies and support for Ukraine, Dobrzy\u0144ski said. It\u2019s also about testing the response of law enforcement and \u2014 because the plots often involve multiple people and lines of investigation \u2014 draining police resources, he said.",
      "Five men were sentenced Friday alongside Earl for their roles in the arson.",
      "Both Earl and his co-conspirator Jake Reeves, 23, \u201cwillingly acted as hostile agents on behalf of the Russian state,\u201d said Commander Dominic Murphy, head of Counter Terrorism Policing at the Metropolitan Police. Reeves was sentenced to 12 years in prison.",
      "But Nii Mensah, 23, Jakeem Rose, 23; Ugnius Asmena, 20 didn\u2019t know they were working for Russia. They were found guilty of aggravated arson and sentenced to nine years; eight years, 10 months, and seven years in prison, respectively. Ashton Evans, 20, was sentenced to nine years in prison for failing to disclose information about terrorist acts.",
      "When armed police swooped on Earl to arrest him in the parking lot of a home improvement store in April 2024, they told him he was being arrested under the new powers of the National Security Act.",
      "\u201cI hope you guys have some good proof,\u201d Earl told the officers. \u201cI hope I get a good story for this.\"",

      "Yostin Andres Mosquera killed Albert Alfonso, 62, and Paul Longworth, 71, in July last year with a hammer and a knife, in a double murder that London police described as one of the \u201cmost harrowing\u201d they have witnessed.",
      "In his sentencing remarks at Woolwich Crown Court in east London, Judge Joel Bennathan said Mosquera may never be released if he doesn\u2019t meet the parole requirements when his minimum tariff expires. Accounting for the time already spent in prison, Mosquera won't be eligible for release for more than 40 years.",
      "While describing the murders as \u201cpremeditated and thoroughly wicked,\" the judge did not impose a whole-life order on Mosquera, which would mean he would never be eligible for parole. He said that was partly because of his lack of previous convictions in Colombia or the U.K., and the fact that he \u201cmay have been brutalized\u201d as a child when witnessing the murder of other children.",
      "Mosquera was convicted by a jury at Woolwich Crown Court in July. On Friday, he also pleaded guilty to three counts of possessing child pornography.",
      "Mosquera, who was staying with the couple, decapitated and dismembered them, then froze parts of their remains and took the rest to the city of Bristol.",
      "Mosquera was arrested at a train station in Bristol, three days after the grisly discovery of body parts in suitcases on the city\u2019s Clifton Suspension Bridge. Police found more remains at the victims\u2019 home in London.",

      "BERLIN -- Forget France: The Louvre Museum jewelry heist was a classic case of German efficiency.",
      "Photos of a German-made freight lift that the thieves used in a lightning-fast daylight heist at the Louvre have gone viral. And its manufacturer is now riding high from the unexpected endorsement.",
      "Alexander B\u00f6cker, the managing director and third-generation owner of B\u00f6cker Maschinenwerke GmbH, told The Associated Press that when he and his wife saw the images online, they were \u201cshocked that our lift had been misused for this robbery.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnce the initial shock had subsided, black humour took over,\u201d he wrote in an email to the AP.",
      "Authorities say the thieves spent less than four minutes inside the Louvre on Sunday morning. They wheeled the freight lift up to the museum, rode the basket up the fa\u00e7ade, forced open a window, smashed display cases and grabbed priceless Napoleonic jewels before spiriting away on motorbikes through central Paris.",
      "It didn't take long for the Germans to seize on the marketing opportunity. By Monday morning, B\u00f6cker\u2019s company had come up with a social media post featuring a photo of the freight lift \u2014 which is typically used for furniture and construction \u2014 and a slogan in German that translates to \u201cwhen something needs to be done quickly.\u201d",
      "The post also touts the ability of the \u201cB\u00f6cker Agilo\u201d to transport up to 400 kilograms (882 pounds) of \u201cyour treasures\u201d at a speed of 42 meters (46 yards) per minute. And it moves \u201cwhisper quiet\u201d thanks to its 230 Volt E-Motor, the post says.",

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Less than six months after Samia Suluhu Hassan was inaugurated as Tanzania\u2019s first woman president in 2021, the country\u2019s most famous cartoonist depicted her in a military general\u2019s uniform under the title \u201cDictatoress.\u201d",
      "In the cartoon by Tanzanian-born Gado, drawn from his base in Kenya where there is more press freedom, Hassan looks at her image in a mirror and sees herself as holding a torch \u2014 perhaps of liberty \u2014 when actually she wields a spiked club.",
      "A former vice president who rose to the presidency after the death of predecessor John Pombe Magufuli, Hassan initially gave indications that she would relax the government\u2019s repressive tactics against opposition leaders, civic groups, journalists and others.",

      "Hassan\u2019s political group, known as Chama cha Mapinduzi, or CCM, is one of Africa\u2019s longest-ruling parties. A version of CCM, which maintains ties with the Chinese Communist Party, has held power since independence in 1961.",
      "Although Tanzania is yet to witness an orderly transfer of power from one party to another, regular elections featuring successive leaders of CCM have long guaranteed a measure of stability that is rare among neighbors in the region.",
      "That leadership model is gradually being challenged, with the opposition party Chadema consistently the strongest of the groups trying to break CCM\u2019s grip on Tanzania. Chadema\u2019s popular leader, Tundu Lissu, who survived an assassination attempt in 2017, is currently jailed on treason charges.",
      "Chadema has said it will not participate in elections without the reforms it says are necessary to have free and fair polling, a stance that led to its disqualification by electoral authorities.",
      "Another popular candidate, Luhaga Mpina of the Alliance for Change and Transformation-Wazalendo party, is also disqualified from running for allegedly violating his own party\u2019s constitution.",
      "Running against opponents from smaller parties, Hassan is effectively unopposed and will almost certainly be elected, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, or ACLED, a U.S.-based nonprofit that collects data on political violence around the world.",
      "Tanzania\u2019s election \u201cwill follow over four-and-a-half years of sustained repression by a CCM-controlled state that is keen to avoid the electoral pressures\u201d faced by opposition parties elsewhere in Africa, ACLED said in a recent analysis.",
      "CCM, after receiving its lowest-ever share of the vote in the 2015 election, has \u201csince neutered Tanzania\u2019s opposition through administrative, legal, and extra-legal means,\" the group said.",
      "In June, a United Nations panel of human rights experts cited more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance since 2019. The experts said they were \u201calarmed by reports of a pattern of repression\u201d ahead of elections, after two pro-democracy activists from Uganda and Kenya went missing in Tanzania, where they had gone to attend Lissu\u2019s treason trial.",
      "The activists, Boniface Mwangi of Kenya and Agather Atuhaire of Uganda, later reported that they had been sexually abused before they were deported.",
      "A recent high-profile disappearance is of Humphrey Polepole, Tanzania\u2019s former ambassador to Cuba, who resigned his post earlier this year. His resignation letter, leaked on social media, cited his loss of \u201cpeace of heart and faith\u201d in a government that he said violates the rule of law.",

      "When Hassan took over as president, she asserted her authority by recruiting associates who had fallen out of favor with Magufuli, the previous president.",

She will revise the security strategy early and have it ready by the end of 2026, she said. Japan used to revise its strategy about once a decade, the last time in December 2022.",

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Anyone who watched U.S. President Donald Trump vow to condition financial aid to cash-strapped Argentina on the outcome of a \u201cvery big\u201d and \u201cvery important\u201d vote in the South American country would be forgiven for thinking that his close ideological ally, Argentine President Javier Milei, was up for reelection.",
      "But no. The vote that Trump was talking about earlier this month is, in fact, a midterm election for less than half of the Argentine Congress.",
      "Now the explosive comments, combined with a dizzying series of scandals and setbacks for Milei, have cranked up the pressure on Argentina\u2019s libertarian president and transformed Sunday's limited vote into a major political test that could help determine the fate of Milei\u2019s free-market experiment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve made it to the elections on our feet, and on Sunday Argentina will really change,\u201d Milei said in a fiery final campaign speech late Thursday from the port city of Rosario.",
      "At the start of the year, pollsters and pundits were predicting a smashing success for Milei in the midterms.",
      "His huge cuts to state spending delivered Argentina's first fiscal surplus in nearly 15 years and pulled down monthly inflation from 25.5% to 2%. Argentines celebrated relief from ever-rising prices and took comfort in a strong peso that made it cheaper for them to snap up imported goods and vacation abroad.",
      "With his approval ratings high, Milei took victory laps through Europe, Latin America and, most frequently, Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, railing against the evils of socialism and the corruption of the political elite. He pushed key deregulation laws through an opposition-dominated Congress, allying with the right-wing PRO party of former President Mauricio Macri and striking deals with moderate governors.",
      "How quickly the mood turned.",
      "Milei's aura of infallibility first began to crack in February, when he promoted a dodgy memecoin on his social media account that quickly collapsed, leading to $250 million in losses for investors. Then in August, Milei's powerful sister was accused of taking bribes from a government medicine supplier. She denies wrongdoing.",
      "The latest blow came earlier this month, when Milei\u2019s leading candidate in Buenos Aires province, Jos\u00e9 Luis Espert, dropped out of the midterm race after admitting he received $200,000 from a businessman indicted in the U.S. for drug trafficking. He says it was for consulting services.",
      "The controversies have hurt Milei's reputation as a straight-talking outsider determined to tear down the corrupt establishment, experts say, particularly at this time of harsh austerity.",
      "\u201cIt was the first wake-up call when people started to ask, maybe (Milei and Karina) are asking us to make sacrifices that they're not making themselves,\" said Eugenia Mitchelstein, the chair of the social sciences department at Buenos Aires\u2019 San Andr\u00e9s University.",
      "Tactical errors compounded matters. Milei ran an aggressive campaign strategy in some two dozen provincial elections in recent months that pitted a slew of unknowns from his scrappy libertarian party against more established rivals.",
      "His decision to forgo any attempt at coalition-building alienated potential political allies, who punished Milei by passing spending measures in Congress and overturning his vetoes.",
      "The run-up to the midterms \u2014 in which half the seats in the lower house of Congress and a third of the Senate are up for grabs \u2014 has also been rough. Although veteran politician Diego Santilli is now at the top of the party's Buenos Aires list after Espert stood down over the scandal, voters will still see Espert on the ballot Sunday after electoral authorities ruled it was too late to print new ones.",
      "The other Buenos Aires candidate, Karen Reichardt, is a former model and actress who has recently come under fire for old social media posts attacking national soccer hero Lionel Messi and insulting her political enemies with racially insensitive language. She did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "The loss tipped already jittery markets over the edge. Investors dumped Argentine bonds and sold off the peso, prompting the central bank to burn through its foreign currency reserves to prop up the currency.",
      "That's when Trump and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stepped in to save their closest political ally in the region.",
      "The Treasury bought up pesos \u2014 the currency that even Argentines distrust \u2014 and confirmed a $20 billion swap line to Argentina's central bank on what Bessent called a \u201cbridge\u201d to the midterms. Bessent said he was working on another $20 billion loan from private banks, and Trump said the U.S. would even boost beef imports from Argentina to bring down U.S. meat prices.",
      "But it seems that not even such dramatic moves from the world's biggest economy could restore faith in the famously volatile peso. Argentine investors \u2014 who can more easily take money out of Argentina since Milei's government scrapped capital controls this year \u2014 continued ditching pesos. The currency slid to a new record low of 1,476 per dollar Monday.",

      "Washington\u2019s multibillion-dollar rescue of Argentina has unleashed backlash across the political spectrum \u2014 and the Western Hemisphere.",
      "In the U.S., Democratic and Republican lawmakers, farmers, ranchers and Trump supporters have increasingly questioned the merits of showering money on a serial defaulter and rival agricultural exporter.",
      "In Argentina, Trump's warning that U.S. assistance was contingent on Milei\u2019s victory in the vote breathed new life into the opposition Peronist party, which urged Argentines long wary of U.S. interventionism to punish Milei on Sunday.",
      "\u201cCompatriots, Argentina is a country too great and dignified to depend on the whims of a foreign leader,\u201d said former Peronist President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in a video message Thursday from her Buenos Aires apartment, where she\u2019s serving out a six-year sentence for corruption.",
      "Markets reeled as investors fretted that the U.S. aid might not come at all. Consultants tried to parse Trump's cryptic demand that Milei clinch a congressional victory. Does it mean Milei increasing his party\u2019s tiny congressional minority? Does it mean securing enough seats to defend his vetoes?",
      "With only some congressional seats up for renewal, a landslide win for Milei\u2019s party wouldn\u2019t give it a majority in Congress.",
      "Even Milei\u2019s supporters took to social media to express unease, with many attacking then-Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein for mishandling the situation. Werthein tendered his resignation without explanation late Tuesday.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The last time U.S. President Donald Trump visited South Korea in 2019, he made a surprise trip to the border with North Korea for an impromptu meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to revive faltering nuclear talks.",
      "Now, as Trump is set to make his first trip to Asia since his return to office, speculation is rife that he may seek to meet Kim again during his stop in South Korea. If realized, it would mark the two\u2019s first summit since their last meeting at the Korean border village of Panmunjom in June 2019, and fourth overall.",
      "Many experts say prospects for another impromptu meeting aren\u2019t bright this time but predict Trump and Kim could eventually sit down for talks again in coming months. Others dispute that, saying a quick resumption of diplomacy isn\u2019t still likely given how much has changed since 2019 \u2014 both the size of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program and its foreign policy leverage.",
      "Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to restore diplomacy with Kim as he boasted of his relationship with the North Korean leader and called him \u201ca smart guy.\" Ending his silence on Trump's outreach, Kim last month said he held \u201cgood personal memories\u201d of Trump and suggested he could return to talks if the U.S. drops \u201cits delusional obsession with denuclearization\u201d of North Korea.",
      "Both Washington and Pyongyang haven't hinted at any high-profile meeting ahead of the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in South Korea. But South Korea's Unification Minister Chung Dong-young told lawmakers in mid-October that it was possible for Trump and Kim to meet at Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone again when the U.S. president comes to South Korea after visiting Malaysia and Japan.",
      "\u201cWe should see prospects for their meeting have increased,\u201d said Ban Kil Joo, assistant professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy in Seoul. He cited the recent suspension of civilian tours to the southern side of Panmunjom and Kim's comments about a possible return to talks.",
      "If the meeting doesn't occur, Ban said Kim will likely determine whether to resume diplomacy with Trump when he holds a major ruling party conference expected in January.",
      "No notable logistical preparations that imply an impending Kim-Trump meeting have been reported, but observers note that the 2019 get-together was arranged only a day after Trump issued an unorthodox meeting invitation by tweet.",
      "Since his earlier diplomacy with Trump fell apart due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on North Korea, Kim has accelerated the expansion of an arsenal of nuclear-capable missiles designed to strike the U.S. and its allies. He has also strengthened his diplomatic footprint by aligning with Russia over its war in Ukraine and tightening relations with China.",
      "Subsequently, Kim's sense of urgency for talks with the United States could be much weaker now than it was six years ago, though some experts argue Kim would need to brace for the end of the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "\u201cConsidering the current situation, it seems difficult to imagine Kim Jong Un coming over for talks,\u201d said Kim Tae-hyung, a professor at Seoul\u2019s Soongsil University.",

To get Kim back to talks, Koh said Trump would have to bring something enticing him to the table this time around.",
      "Even if they don't meet this month, there are still chances for Trump and Kim to resume diplomacy later. Kim may see Trump as a rare U.S. leader willing to grant concessions like the nuclear state status, while Trump would think a meeting with Kim would give him a diplomatic achievement in the face of various domestic woes.",

The country has no nuclear weapons of its own and is under the so-called U.S. \u201cnuclear umbrella\u201d protection.",
      "Chung, the former university dean, said there are virtually no chances for North Korea to give up its nuclear program.

      "U.S. President Donald Trump has done a turnaround on sanctions against Russia, taking aim at Russia's two biggest oil companies and the billions of dollars they reap for Moscow's war against Ukraine",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) \u2014 The U.S. and the European Union are hitting Russia with another round of sanctions, aiming to cut into oil and gas export earnings that fund Moscow's war against Ukraine.",
      "More than 3 1/2 years into the war, the effort remains a cat-and-mouse game, with Russia finding new ways to get around sanctions, and Washington and Brussels adding new ones and looking for ways to plug enforcement gaps.",
      "The chief target of the latest round: Russia's biggest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. New U.S. Treasury sanctions threaten their customers in India and China with retaliation that could include being sanctioned themselves.",
      "Meanwhile, the EU is phasing out by the end of next year those shipments of Russian liquefied natural gas that come by ship, and is going after cryptocurrency issuers, platforms and exchanges that Russia has used to skirt restrictions on its financial dealings with the outside world.",

      "\u201cGiven President Putin\u2019s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia\u2019s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin\u2019s war machine,\" he said, adding that \u201cTreasury is prepared to take further action if necessary.\u201d",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "Rosneft and Lukoil account for roughly half of Russia's oil exports, which along with natural gas and oil products have supplied 30% to 50% of state revenues in the past decade. The biggest customers for Russian oil are China, at about 2.1 million barrels per day, and India, at 1.5 million.",
      "Refineries in India and China that buy Russian oil to turn it into gasoline and diesel could potentially face U.S. sanctions themselves if they deal with those companies, and so could their banks.",
      "\"Being touched by U.S. sanctions, even secondary sanctions, is like the death penalty for the private sector,\u201d said sanctions expert Maria Perrotta Berlin at the Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics.",
      "As a result, India\u2019s major refinery, Reliance Industries' Jamnagar facility, may reconsider its 600,000 barrels a day of Russian crude imports and is \u201clikely to halt or pause\u201d shipments, said Johannes Rauball, senior crude oil analyst at data analytics firm Kpler. Russia\u2019s unbought barrels could wind up in storage or looking for another customer at a price discount, he said. \u201cIt puts Russia in a tough spot.\u201d",
      "U.S. oil prices rose by 5% to $61.44 per barrel Thursday and international benchmark Brent rose 4.7% to $65.52. A Treasury spokesperson, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the sanctions, said the latest action is not expected to significantly affect energy costs for U.S. consumers, and Treasury expects prices to remain stable.",
      "Chris Weafer, CEO of the Macro-Advisory Ltd. consultancy, said the biggest takeaway was Trump's willingness to add sanctions to those imposed under the Biden administration.",

      "The EU also added sanctions on Rosneft and sanctioned 117 more tankers it says are part of Russia's shadow fleet used to evade a Western-imposed price cap on Russian oil, bringing the total to 557.",
      "The sanctions don\u2019t take effect until Nov. 21, a grace period that gives traders a chance to wind down business with Rosneft and Lukoil \u2014 but also provides a chance for Russia to make more money in the short term.",

The cap was an attempt to cut into Russia' oil earnings without knocking Russian oil off the global market and causing a price spike, enforced by barring Western insurers and shippers from handling oil priced above the cap.",
      "Perrotta Berlin said Russia has lost about $100 billion in oil and gas sales since the start of the war, and sanctions have raised the costs of imported goods and deprived Russian companies of so-called dual-use goods like computer chips that can be used for both civilian and military productions.

Putin, who on Thursday called the sanctions an \u201cunfriendly act,\u201d has the money for now to continue the war and has shown no inclination to accept a ceasefire.",
      "One reason: Putin took steps to sanction-proof Russia's economy and reduce dependence on imports after a first round of sanctions when Russia illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.

      "An outline of the ruling Communist Party's blueprint for the next five years was laid out in a 5,000-word communique released Thursday after a four-day top level meeting in Beijing, just days ahead of planned talks between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump.",

      "To try to spur demand, the government has encouraged investment in more modern factories and equipment and paid subsidies to people who replace old appliances and vehicles with newer ones. But manufacturing capacity exceeds demand in many industries. That has caused damaging price wars and led companies to boost exports, in turn adding to trade friction.",
      "Even with strong government support, the economy grew 4.8%, the slowest pace in a year in the last quarter. And factory activity shrank for the sixth consecutive month in September, official data showed, as domestic demand remained sluggish.",

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Anyone who watched U.S. President Donald Trump vow to condition financial aid to cash-strapped Argentina on the outcome of a \u201cvery big\u201d and \u201cvery important\u201d vote in the South American country would be forgiven for thinking that his close ideological ally, Argentine President Javier Milei, was up for reelection.",
      "But no. The vote that Trump was talking about earlier this month is, in fact, a midterm election for less than half of the Argentine Congress.",
      "Now the explosive comments, combined with a dizzying series of scandals and setbacks for Milei, have cranked up the pressure on Argentina\u2019s libertarian president and transformed Sunday's limited vote into a major political test that could help determine the fate of Milei\u2019s free-market experiment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve made it to the elections on our feet, and on Sunday Argentina will really change,\u201d Milei said in a fiery final campaign speech late Thursday from the port city of Rosario.",
      "At the start of the year, pollsters and pundits were predicting a smashing success for Milei in the midterms.",
      "His huge cuts to state spending delivered Argentina's first fiscal surplus in nearly 15 years and pulled down monthly inflation from 25.5% to 2%. Argentines celebrated relief from ever-rising prices and took comfort in a strong peso that made it cheaper for them to snap up imported goods and vacation abroad.",
      "With his approval ratings high, Milei took victory laps through Europe, Latin America and, most frequently, Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, railing against the evils of socialism and the corruption of the political elite. He pushed key deregulation laws through an opposition-dominated Congress, allying with the right-wing PRO party of former President Mauricio Macri and striking deals with moderate governors.",
      "How quickly the mood turned.",
      "Milei's aura of infallibility first began to crack in February, when he promoted a dodgy memecoin on his social media account that quickly collapsed, leading to $250 million in losses for investors. Then in August, Milei's powerful sister was accused of taking bribes from a government medicine supplier. She denies wrongdoing.",
      "The latest blow came earlier this month, when Milei\u2019s leading candidate in Buenos Aires province, Jos\u00e9 Luis Espert, dropped out of the midterm race after admitting he received $200,000 from a businessman indicted in the U.S. for drug trafficking. He says it was for consulting services.",
      "The controversies have hurt Milei's reputation as a straight-talking outsider determined to tear down the corrupt establishment, experts say, particularly at this time of harsh austerity.",
      "\u201cIt was the first wake-up call when people started to ask, maybe (Milei and Karina) are asking us to make sacrifices that they're not making themselves,\" said Eugenia Mitchelstein, the chair of the social sciences department at Buenos Aires\u2019 San Andr\u00e9s University.",
      "Tactical errors compounded matters. Milei ran an aggressive campaign strategy in some two dozen provincial elections in recent months that pitted a slew of unknowns from his scrappy libertarian party against more established rivals.",
      "His decision to forgo any attempt at coalition-building alienated potential political allies, who punished Milei by passing spending measures in Congress and overturning his vetoes.",
      "The run-up to the midterms \u2014 in which half the seats in the lower house of Congress and a third of the Senate are up for grabs \u2014 has also been rough. Although veteran politician Diego Santilli is now at the top of the party's Buenos Aires list after Espert stood down over the scandal, voters will still see Espert on the ballot Sunday after electoral authorities ruled it was too late to print new ones.",
      "The other Buenos Aires candidate, Karen Reichardt, is a former model and actress who has recently come under fire for old social media posts attacking national soccer hero Lionel Messi and insulting her political enemies with racially insensitive language. She did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "The loss tipped already jittery markets over the edge. Investors dumped Argentine bonds and sold off the peso, prompting the central bank to burn through its foreign currency reserves to prop up the currency.",
      "That's when Trump and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stepped in to save their closest political ally in the region.",

Bessent said he was working on another $20 billion loan from private banks, and Trump said the U.S. would even boost beef imports from Argentina to bring down U.S. meat prices.",

Argentine investors \u2014 who can more easily take money out of Argentina since Milei's government scrapped capital controls this year \u2014 continued ditching pesos. The currency slid to a new record low of 1,476 per dollar Monday.",

      "In Argentina, Trump's warning that U.S. assistance was contingent on Milei\u2019s victory in the vote breathed new life into the opposition Peronist party, which urged Argentines long wary of U.S. interventionism to punish Milei on Sunday.",
      "\u201cCompatriots, Argentina is a country too great and dignified to depend on the whims of a foreign leader,\u201d said former Peronist President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in a video message Thursday from her Buenos Aires apartment, where she\u2019s serving out a six-year sentence for corruption.",
      "Markets reeled as investors fretted that the U.S. aid might not come at all. Consultants tried to parse Trump's cryptic demand that Milei clinch a congressional victory. Does it mean Milei increasing his party\u2019s tiny congressional minority? Does it mean securing enough seats to defend his vetoes?",
      "With only some congressional seats up for renewal, a landslide win for Milei\u2019s party wouldn\u2019t give it a majority in Congress.",

      "Doris Brown\u2019s home in Northeast Houston becomes a refuge for neighbors during power outages thanks to her solar panel and battery system",
      "HOUSTON -- Doris Brown was nearly asleep when a neighbor knocked on her door, telling her to look outside. \u201cThere were no lights, nowhere,\u201d said Brown, recalling the power outage that summer night in 2023. \u201cI didn't even know it.\u201d",
      "Brown's solar panel and battery system was keeping her power on. She'd prepared for a night like this. \u201cCall everybody,\u201d she told the neighbor.",
      "Soon around 15 \u201cneighbors and neighbors' neighbors\u201d were inside Brown's three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath home in Northeast Houston. They charged phones, cooked, and showered before work and school. Some slept over.",
      "\u201cThere were people sleeping everywhere,\u201d said Brown, 75. She was happy to be \u201ca port in a storm,\u201d despite one downside: \u201cThey ate all my snacks.\u201d",
      "Brown's house is a \u201chub home,\u201d one of seven in a Northeast Houston pilot program meant to create emergency safe havens \u2014 not at shelters or community centers, but inside neighbors' houses.",
      "The idea was a grassroots response to decades of community disinvestment and neglect that got neighbors talking about what they could do to be ready for extreme weather and power outages.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s us helping us,\u201d said Brown.",
      "The project was set to reach 30 more homes, until the Environmental Protection Agency in August canceled the $7 billion Solar for All program which would have funded its expansion. Harris County, which includes Houston, is now a plaintiff in one of multiple lawsuits over the cancellation.",
      "People involved with the program acknowledge hub homes are unconventional \u2014 requiring trust and community cooperation and impacting fewer people than a larger resilience center.",
      "But they also say they're effective in creating pockets of preparedness in communities confronting more extreme weather but lacking resources to do more.",
      "\u201cIt was a way to increase resilience in those neighborhoods that are often forgotten,\u201d said Sam Silerio, Texas program director at Solar United Neighbors, one of the nonprofits involved with the pilot program which is also suing over the cuts.",
      "The hub homes idea started after Winter Storm Uri in 2021, when freezing temperatures crippled Texas' power grid for five days and led to 246 storm-related deaths, according to the Texas Department of Health Services.",
      "Power loss contributed to many of the deaths, as people with health conditions couldn't refrigerate medicines or run life-sustaining medical devices. Nineteen people died from carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly using generators and grills to stay warm.",
      "\u201cWe were like, \u2018Shoot, power grid failure is a serious thing that we are not prepared for\u2019,\u201d said Becky Selle, co-director of disaster preparedness, organizing, and operations at West Street Recovery, a Northeast Houston nonprofit founded after Hurricane Harvey in 2017.",
      "WSR bought some generators for residents willing to share the resource. Brown, who almost froze to death herself in Uri, stepped up.",
      "WSR added more supplies to the hubs, like life jackets and kayaks for flood evacuations, and held preparedness trainings for members.",
      "When the D.C.-based nonprofit Solar United Neighbors approached them with a private grant from the Hive Fund to add free solar panels and batteries to several houses, WSR knew exactly where to install them.",
      "The pilot had its challenges \u2014 some roofs had to be repaired before they could hold solar panels, and hub captains had to learn how to manage their batteries to not deplete them.",
      "Success also required neighborly connection that modern communities often lack.",
      "\u201cYou have to build that trust,\u201d said David Espinoza, a hub home captain and West Street Recovery\u2019s co-director of community organizing and language access. The 34-year-old went door-to-door on his block, introducing himself to sometimes wary neighbors. \u201cI got to know my neighborhood a lot better,\u201d he said.",

      "NEW YORK -- The stunning indictment that led to the arrest of more than 30 people, including Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and other NBA figures, on charges of illegal sports betting has drawn new scrutiny of the booming business of professional sports gambling across the U.S.",
      "Since widespread legalization, the multibillion-dollar industry has made it easy to place wagers on everything from the outcome of games to that of a single play with just a few taps of a cellphone. It\u2019s just about impossible to go to a basketball, football, baseball or other pro game today \u2014 or watch a matchup on TV \u2014 without seeing ads for sports betting.",
      "Fans can place wagers from their stadium seats, while \u201cBet\u201d tickers scroll on TV sports broadcasts. Star athletes are frequently at the center of ads promoting it all.",
      "In Thursday\u2019s indictment, federal investigators accused Rozier and other defendants of breaking the law by exploiting private information about players to win bets on NBA games. Rozier\u2019s lawyer, Jim Trusty, said in a statement that his client is \u201cnot a gambler\u201d and \u201clooks forward to winning this fight.\u201d",
      "A separate indictment alleges Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and others participated in a conspiracy to fix high-stakes card games. Billups' attorney declined to comment Thursday.",
      "Regulating sports wagering has proven to be a challenge \u2014 and experts warn about the ramifications for gamblers who typically lose money. Professional leagues' own role in promoting gambling has raised eyebrows.",
      "Here's what we know.",
      "Sports betting is probably as old as sports itself. But in the U.S., legal gambling really took off in 2018.",
      "That's when the Supreme Court struck down the Professional Amateur Sports Protection Act, which barred sports betting in most states. Once allowed only in Nevada, sports betting is now permitted online or in retail locations in 38 states and Washington, D.C. Missouri will become the 39th state on Dec. 1.",
      "Experts say the biggest jump has been online, through smartphone apps and platforms like DraftKings and FanDuel. Through the third quarter of this year, legal sports betting generated $10 billion in revenue, up about 19% from the same period a year ago, according to the American Gaming Association.",
      "The industry argues that legal wagering generates money for states and can deter illegal betting. Major operators point to technology they use to monitor suspicious activity. FanDuel said Thursday's news illustrates \u201cthe stark contrast between legal and illegal betting markets.\u201d",
      "There is plenty of money on the table both for those who place winning bets and the platforms that make it possible. The NBA and other pro sports leagues have also created revenue streams by partnering with sportsbooks and reaping advertising dollars.",
      "Live game stats provided by leagues are key to the sports world\u2019s relationship with the gambling industry. When you're able to bet what the next pitch in a baseball game is going to be, that's because Major League Baseball is selling data to platforms \u201cfor a pretty high price,\" according to Isaac Rose-Berman, whose research focuses on sports betting as a fellow at the American Institute for Boys and Men.",
      "The NBA has a partnership with Sportradar for its data rights. Sportradar, in turn, provides FanDuel Sportsbook official NBA statistics. When the deal was announced in 2022, Sportradar touted it as a way \u201cto monetize our long-term partnership with the NBA.\"",
      "Each state has its own regulations and tax rates for sports betting. A handful restrict where you can place bets \u2014 allowing users to use mobile apps, but only while they're physically inside a casino or within a certain radius of a stadium, for example. Others limit which betting platforms you can use or what you can bet on.",
      "\u201cStates sort of opened up a can of worms, and now some of them are starting to realize just how crazy this sports betting world sort is,\u201d said Wayne Taylor, a professor of marketing at Southern Methodist University.",

      "Still, experts like Taylor note that companies\u2019 own financial interests may bring some of that into question. And across the sports market, he says the large number of players and scope of micro bet possibilities makes potential manipulation \u201ceasier to hide.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump will be in Japan and South Korea next week and he's expected to promote an epic windfall in investments for U.S. factories and projects",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is going to Japan and South Korea next week to promote an epic financial windfall \u2014 at least $900 billion in investments for U.S. factories, a natural gas pipeline and other projects.",
      "Japan and South Korea made those financial commitments in August to try to get Trump to ratchet down his planned tariff rates from 25% to 15%. But as the U.S. president is set to depart Friday night for Asia, the pledges are more of a loose end than money in the bank for American industry.",
      "Japan pledged $550 billion in investments, but it wants the money to benefit its own companies, making that a condition in a memorandum released in September. As of Monday, Japan has a new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, who has expressed respect for Trump but is operating in an untested coalition government.",
      "South Korea offered $350 billion \u2014 but wants a swap line for U.S. dollars to facilitate its investments and seeks to fund the transactions through loan guarantees. Otherwise, the commitment could sink its own economy.",
      "The investment arrangements are unusual for trade frameworks, and Trump maintains that he will personally direct how the money is spent, enabling him to pick winners and losers. Weeks of talks have yet to produce any breakthroughs on how the investments would go forward even though both nations want to preserve their relationship with America.",
      "Still, ahead of the trip, Trump was radiating optimism that his tariffs had forced investments to fuel what he believes will be an economic boom starting next year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done well, as you know, with Japan, with South Korea,\u201d Trump told Republican senators Tuesday. \u201cWithout the tariffs, you could have never made the deal. I\u2019ll tell you what. Tariffs equal national security.\u201d",
      "For Trump, the investments are also about demonstrating America\u2019s strength before a planned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping while he is in South Korea. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Monday described Trump's strategy in part as \u201cencouraging allied investment in America\u2019s industrial future\u201d to counter Chinese manufacturers.",
      "But Japan and South Korea are also competing against China \u2014 which is pivoting aggressively into electric vehicles, computer chips and other technologies. There is a risk that mandating investment in the U.S. could weaken allies that are closer geographically to China, said Christopher Smart, managing partner at the Arbroath Group, a geopolitical strategy firm.",
      "\u201cThey need to invest in their own countries,\u201d said Smart, who was a senior economic aide in the Obama White House. He said Trump was \u201cgoing to extract investment money\u201d from the countries while also erecting \"tariff walls\u201d that could make it harder for them to sell goods in America, a rather lopsided view of how alliances work.",
      "Few experts believe Japan and South Korea would agree with the Trump administration's framing that their U.S. investments are a way to compete against China.",
      "\u201cIt is really about lowering tariffs and avoiding Trump\u2019s wrath,\u201d said Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for Asia Policy Studies.",
      "There is an expectation that Japan and South Korea both want to resolve any hurdles on the investments and will take steps to achieve \u201cprogress\u201d in talks with Trump, said William Chou, a senior fellow focused on Japan at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank.",
      "Chou pointed to Nippon Steel's agreement to purchase U.S. Steel this year as an example of how Japan can work with the Trump administration. The president had initially opposed the merger, but later backed it with an agreement that gave the U.S. government some control over the acquired company.",
      "Similarly, the memorandum of understanding on Japan\u2019s $550 million investment would also give the U.S. government input on how the money would be spent. It provides for a committee led by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to propose investments, giving Japan 45 days to respond, with the understanding that the deals would give preference to Japanese contractors and suppliers.",
      "\"Japan came through with the paperwork,\" Lutnick said in a September CNBC interview. \u201cThey gave us $550 billion to invest for the benefit of America, build the Alaska pipeline, build nuclear power plants, make your grid better, do generic antibiotics in America.\"",

The proposal would have to receive more than 870,000 signatures by next spring to qualify for the ballot in November 2026. If it qualifies, it's not guaranteed to pass. Democratic Gov.

      "The report on the consumer price index is being issued more than a week late because of the government shutdown, now in its fourth week. The Trump administration recalled some Labor Department employees to produce the figures because they are used to set the annual cost-of-living adjustment for roughly 70 million Social Security recipients.",
      "Friday's inflation report will be the first comprehensive economic data to be released in more than three weeks and will attract intense interest from Wall Street and officials at the Federal Reserve. Fed officials are cutting their short-term interest rate to buoy the economy and hiring, but they are taking some risk doing so because inflation is still above their 2% target.",
      "The issues of affordability and the cost of necessities are gaining in political importance. Concerns over the costs of rent and groceries have played a key role in the mayoral race in New York City. And Trump, who has acknowledged that the spike in grocery prices under President Joe Biden helped him win the 2024 election, has been considering importing Argentine beef to reduce record-high U.S. beef prices, angering U.S. cattle ranchers.",
      "The cost of ground beef has jumped to $6.32 a pound, a record, in part because of tariffs on imports from countries such as Brazil, which faces a 50% duty. Years of drought that have reduced cattle herds have also raised prices.",
      "Friday's report is forecast to show that inflation rose 3.1% in September from a year earlier, according to a survey of economists by data provider FactSet. That would be up from 2.9% in August and the highest in 18 months. On a monthly basis, inflation is projected to be 0.4% in September, the same as in August.",
      "Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core inflation in September was likely 3.1% for the third straight month. On a monthly basis, core prices likely rose 0.3%, economists project, also for the third straight month.",
      "Such figures are unlikely to deter the Fed from cutting its key rate by another quarter-point when it meets next week, to about 3.9%. It would be the second cut this year and is driven by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's concerns that hiring is weakening and poses a threat to the economy.",
      "Even as inflation has fallen sharply from its peak of 9.1% more than three years ago, it remains a major concern for consumers. About half of all Americans say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, according to an August poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "And the Conference Board, a business research group, finds that consumers are still referencing prices and inflation in responses to its monthly survey on consumer confidence.",
      "Still, inflation has not risen as much as many economists feared when Trump first announced a sweeping set of tariffs. Many importers built up inventories of goods before the duties took effect, while Trump reduced many import taxes, including as part of trade deals with China, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.",

      "\u201cWe've been shouldering some significant additional costs,\u201d Rattigan said.

The imports from Nicaragua were duty-free because the country had a trade agreement with the United States, but now faces an 18% import tax.",
      "Cocoa prices have more than doubled over the past two years because of poor weather and blights in West Africa, which produces more than 70% of the world's cocoa. The tariffs are an additional hit on top of that. Rattigan is also paying more for almonds, hazelnuts, and chocolate-making equipment from Italy, which has also been hit with tariffs.",

The rally, dubbed a \u201cpeace march\u201d by organizers, came on Hungary\u2019s Oct. 23 national holiday, a remembrance of a failed anti-Soviet uprising in 1956 that was crushed by the Red Army.",
      "Participants shouted slogans backing Orb\u00e1n, and his message that foreign powers threaten to push Hungary into direct involvement in Russia's war in Ukraine. At the front of the march, one large banner read: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to die for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Addressing the crowd in a speech riddled with hostility for both Ukraine and the European Union \u2014 regular subjects of his ire \u2014 Orb\u00e1n accused Kyiv's European backers of having brought the EU into the war, and of being willing \u201cto send others to die.\u201d",
      "Orb\u00e1n, considered Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s closest partner in the EU, has consistently argued against Western support for neighboring Ukraine since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, and has maintained warm relations with the Kremlin while taking a combative posture toward Kyiv.",
      "The Hungarian leader also has vehemently opposed Ukraine's ambitions to join the 27-nation EU and has argued for an immediate ceasefire in the conflict, though he hasn't addressed what that might imply for Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity or European security amid continuing Russian aggression.",
      "During his roughly 40-minute speech, Orb\u00e1n said that Ukraine \u201chas long ceased to be sovereign, independent and is absolutely not self-sufficient.\u201d",
      "He said he would support a strategic partnership between the EU and Kyiv, but that Ukraine \"cannot be members either of our military or economic alliance. They would bring war, take our money and ruin our economy.\u201d",
      "Later in the day, throngs of supporters of opposition leader Magyar filled one of Budapest's central squares and adjacent avenues for their own demonstration \u2014 both an anti-government protest and a show of support for Magyar and his center-right Tisza party.",
      "Marchers shouted anti-government slogans, as well as \u201cRussians go home!\u201d \u2014 a refrain from Hungary's 1956 anti-Soviet rebellion and a modern reference to many people's view that Orb\u00e1n has drawn the country too close to Moscow.",

      "Magyar, a 44-year-old lawyer and former insider within Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party, burst into political prominence last year, and has focused his message on bread-and-butter issues affecting the majority of Hungarians: persistent inflation, poor health care and increasingly salient allegations of government corruption \u2014 all sources of dissatisfaction that have plagued Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government.",
      "Magyar has focused his campaign on the rural countryside, traditionally a reliable voting bloc for Fidesz. He recently ended an 80-day tour of the country where he held scores of town hall-style forums, giving speeches and taking questions from attendees.",
      "Speaking to the crowd of his supporters that filled Budapest's sprawling Heroes' Square, Magyar accused Orb\u00e1n of impoverishing the country by misusing public funds, and of turning Hungarians against one another.",
      "However, he also struck an inclusionary tone, encouraging his supporters to embrace their political opponents following next April's election.",
      "\u201cI call on everyone to stick together and endure these six bitter months, and then to reach out to those who gathered at another event today,\u201d Magyar said. He encouraged the crowd to imagine a future in which, \"on October 23 of next year, there are not two contemptuous crowds facing each other, but a nation united, celebrating and smiling at each other.\u201d",
      "The dueling marches on Thursday were seen as a barometer of which politician had more energy behind his campaign as the election nears. Orb\u00e1n is lagging in the polls behind Magyar\u2019s Tisza, and with six months before the ballot, the prime minister has struggled to reinvigorate his base.",

One marcher, S\u00e1ndor Kerekes, said that he had come to the event from the ethnic Hungarian-majority town of Fantanele, in Romania\u2019s Transylvania region.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to feel like we can meet with like-minded people, that we think the same things and think with unity,\u201d he said.",

      "The NBA has strict rules against betting on its games, and the consequences are clear",
      "MIAMI -- As a new NBA season opened this week, coach Rick Carlisle and the Indiana Pacers received their annual briefing on the do's and don'ts of gambling.",
      "Betting in casinos is generally allowed. Betting on other sports, provided it is legal, is also allowed.",
      "Betting on NBA basketball is not.",
      "For veterans of the sport, it's the type of training that can seem routine \u2014 almost boring, perhaps. But the potential repercussions for breaking the rules are now abundantly clear after Portland coach Chauncey Billups and Miami guard Terry Rozier were among nearly three dozen people arrested Thursday for what federal law enforcement officials described as their involvement in various illicit gambling activities.",
      "The developments pose an unexpected challenge for a league that hoped to begin its season on a strong note, fueled by an opening night game watched by millions as it went into a thrilling double overtime. There have been amazing performances already: Victor Wembanyama scoring 40 points in his season debut with San Antonio, reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scoring 55 for Oklahoma City, Golden State's Stephen Curry and Denver's Aaron Gordon putting on an I-can-top-this show.",
      "Those should be the talk of the league right now. That's not the case. All that has been overshadowed. The NBA now faces questions about the pervasiveness of gambling in basketball, and uncertainty about what might happen next.",
      "\u201cA shocking day,\u201d said Carlisle, who said he unsuccessfully tried to connect with Billups to offer support. \u201cThis is a very serious situation.\u201d",
      "Rozier, who was arrested in Orlando, Florida, where the Heat opened the season against the Magic, stands accused of telling an associate that he was going to play sparingly in a game on March 23, 2023, when he was with the Charlotte Hornets. Rozier played just under 10 minutes and fell well short of many of the lines set for prop bets regarding his performance.",
      "More than $200,000 worth of wagers were won, federal officials said, based on the information Rozier shared.",
      "Billups \u2014 a Hall of Fame player \u2014 was arrested in Lake Oswego, Oregon, and charged with being involved in a poker scheme that federal officials said cheated victims out of at least $7 million. Billups was one of 31 people arrested on the poker-related charges, and some of those arrested were, according to officials, members of three Mafia families.",
      "The indictments for the insider betting and poker cases were separate, but it appears Billups was mentioned \u2014 albeit not by name \u2014 in the betting one as well. Someone who matches Billups\u2019 resume, an Oregon resident who played in the NBA from 1997 through 2014 and has been a coach since 2021, was alleged to have given insider information to someone who used it to craft wagers involving Trail Blazers\u2019 games in 2023.",
      "That person is described in that document only as Co-Conspirator 8.",
      "Billups and Rozier appeared in court on Thursday and are out of the league indefinitely, being placed on leave by the NBA just hours after their arrests. An attorney for Billups called his client a \u201cman of integrity\u201d while a lawyer for Rozier said the player is \u201cnot a gambler\u201d and \u201clooks forward to winning this fight.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the NBA said it takes \u201cthese allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority.\u201d",
      "Yet betting has become big business for the NBA, as it has with virtually all pro sports leagues in this era where sports wagering is legal in much of the country. The practice is allowed in some form in 38 states now. Missouri will join that list later this year, and it\u2019s also permitted in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a world that\u2019s a different world than it was a few years ago with the advent of legalized gambling,\u201d Carlisle noted.",

Today, the NBA has two official gaming partners, FanDuel and DraftKings Sportsbook, and has relationships with at least 12 authorized gaming operators. There is even a portion of the NBA\u2019s website devoted to gambling \u2014 NBABet.",

      "\u201cObviously, I\u2019m very concerned if there\u2019s any illegal activity going on in our league,\u201d he said in July. \u201cBut I\u2019d say similar to the way a public financial market works, the fact that there might be insider trading doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re necessarily going to shut down those public markets. Often the way they are catching insider traders is because they have a system, a complex system, that detects aberrational behavior.\"",
      "\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \"anybody in this league, any player who engages in that activity, there\u2019s no question they are putting their livelihood at risk.\u201d",

      "In Saturday\u2019s race, Shiffrin can lay the foundation for what might become another record-setting season for the American. If she wins the slalom standings, Shiffrin would become the first skier, female or male, to hold nine titles in a single discipline.",
      "And by winning the big crystal globe, Shiffrin would match the women\u2019s best mark of six overall World Cup titles set by Austrian great Annemarie Moser-Pr\u00f6ll in the 1970s. Swiss two-time champion and last season's runner-up Lara Gut-Behrami, who has announced her retirement after the 2025-26 season, might be Shiffrin's closest challenger.",
      "Lindsey Vonn, who returned to the circuit last year after nearly six years away from racing, recently added Norwegian great Aksel Lund Svindal to her coaching staff.",
      "The American great hopes to add to her total of 82 career wins.",

      "Steen Olsen led a Norwegian sweep of the podium in the first men\u2019s GS last year, in which pre-race favorite Marco Odermatt skied out in the first run. Steen Olsen opted not to start in Sunday\u2019s race to get more treatment on a persistent knee injury.",
      "Odermatt also didn\u2019t finish the second GS of last season, but the Swiss star still convincingly won the season title in the discipline, the super-G and downhill globes, and his fourth straight overall championship.",
      "\u201cI worked hard to improve in downhill last season, especially the gliding part. And while my feeling there got better, it went at the expense of the GS a little bit,\u201d said Odermatt, the leader of the Swiss team that earned 17 race wins last season.",
      "\u201cWhen I want to become better in one discipline, I have to accept compromises elsewhere. It\u2019s a balancing act you have do as an allrounder.\u201d",
      "A strong favorite for the overall title again, Odermatt could become the third skier with at least five overall World Cup titles, after Austria\u2019s Marcel Hirscher and Luxembourg\u2019s Marc Girardelli, and only the second after Hirscher to win five in a row.",
      "Hirscher, who won the sport\u2019s biggest prize eight consecutive times between 2012 and 2019, returned after a five-year absence last season, competing for the Netherlands. He ended his comeback season in December after just three events when he injured his knee in a training run. He planned to race again this season but decided to skip Sunday\u2019s opener after suffering from illness.",
      "Hirscher adds to a long list of big-name absentees, which includes Brignone\u2019s teammate Marta Bassino and Olympic slalom champion Petra Vlhov\u00e1 on the women\u2019s side, while long-term injured racers like Aleksander Aamodt Kilde and Cyprien Sarrazin sit out the men\u2019s race.",
      "On the other side, 2021 overall champion Alexis Pinturault is back in the start gate after knee injuries cut the Frenchman\u2019s last two seasons short, though he will reduce his schedule to only giant slaloms.",

      "\u201cIt sucks,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cThey were asking if I wanted the game ball. No. I don\u2019t want to take the L with me. It sucks. But it\u2019s one game. It\u2019s our first game.\u201d",
      "The Warriors were down seven late when Curry got to the line and made two free throws with 2:42 to play. He then was fouled on a 3-pointer the next trip down and made all three after encouraging the crowd to get loud before he went to the line.",

      "\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Curry said of Gordon's 10-for-11 shooting night from long range. \u201cWhatever he did this summer worked.\u201d",
      "Curry took little time to respond, using a pick and roll to get a crack of space and using that to make the game-tying 3 with 21.4 seconds to play.",
      "\u201cOn that one I was able to kind of do a little snake and I saw just a little bit of daylight,\u201d Curry said. \u201cDecisive. No second guessing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d",

      "In some of the most agriculturally rich regions in the U.S., researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand how climate change is impacting heat in rural areas and the farmworkers who toil in them",
      "In the summers, the sky is jet black when Raul Cruz arrives at this Imperial Valley sugarcane field to start his day. He chops, cleans and bundles the crop, taking heed as the sun rises. It's hard work, but so is starting at 4 a.m., even though he knows it's the safest thing when temperatures in this California desert frequently soar into the triple digits.",
      "\u201cWe just have to because we need to beat the heat,\" said Cruz, who\u2019s worked here for 15 years. They finish work by 9 or 10 a.m. to avoid the risk of heat stroke, he added, but when heat starts creeping up around 8 a.m., \"mentally, it's stressful.\"",
      "The hot climate that makes this Southern California region a farming powerhouse is also what makes it dangerous for farmworkers, who are increasingly vulnerable to rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal, oil and natural gas. Researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand the health consequences of heat stress on farmworkers and where heat is most extreme in this rural landscape. They hope their findings can lead to a better understanding of rural heat islands, identify gaps in research and help develop interventions that better protect them in the face of climate change.",
      "\u201cWorkers could potentially be dying or having some serious issues,\" said project leader Nicolas Lopez-Galvez, assistant professor in the School of Public Health at SDSU. \u201cIt\u2019s better to start acting sooner.\"",
      "Since the start of the 20th century, California temperatures have increased almost 3 F (about 1.7 C), according to state and federal data. Warming has accelerated, and seven of the state\u2019s last eight years through 2024 were the warmest on record. While all areas of the state have warmed, Southern California is heating up about twice as fast as Northern California.",
      "Ana Solorio, an organizer with the farmworker advocacy group L\u00edderes Campesinas that is working with researchers, remembered feeling \u201csuffocated\u201d in the Coachella Valley summer heat when she was a farmworker. \"With the humidity, it felt awful,\" said Solorio, who's lived in the Imperial Valley for more than 30 years. The heat was so intense she didn\u2019t return for another season, preferring instead the cooler winter harvesting months of lettuce in the Imperial Valley.",
      "\u201cThis (heat) can cause a lot of harm to their health,\" she said.",
      "Researchers are trying to understand how farmworkers' heat stress might vary depending on the crops, the season and the number of breaks they take.",
      "Over the past two years, they've collected year-round data from some 300 farmworkers. Body sensors measure things like core body temperature and heart rate while they work. Elsewhere in the fields, environmental monitors measure the day's temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover, also known as the wet-bulb globe temperature, considered the best metric to understanding heat stress. Using satellite imagery along with historical and current wet-bulb globe temperature data, researchers are mapping areas of extreme heat, particularly in the Imperial and Coachella valleys.",
      "Researchers are learning that ground level crops can expose workers to higher heat levels compared to tree crops, for example, but it also depends on their harvesting months. In the summers, farmworkers who prepare fields for planting or help maintain irrigation systems are also more exposed.",
      "Rural heat can vary based on things like tree cover, proximity to a body of water and empty fields, which may be hotter. \u201cIt creates this island where people might be living or working that are higher in terms of heat stress compared to other places,\u201d said Lopez-Galvez.",

      "Bordered by the Colorado River to the east, the Salton Sea to the northwest and Mexico to the south, the Imperial Valley is home to hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland and produces billions of dollars in agricultural production. It grows two-thirds of winter vegetables consumed nationally and provides thousands of jobs. From 2023 to 2024 alone, about 17,579 migrant and seasonal farmworkers were employed in Imperial County, according to the state.",
      "It's also extremely hot. In a given year, there are about 123 days with temperatures over 95 F (35 C), often exceeding 110 F (43 C) in August and early September, according to calculations by Sagar Parajuli, research scientist and adjunct faculty with SDSU's geography department. The county has one of the largest Latino populations and the highest number of heat-related illnesses among workers than anywhere else in the state.",
      "Some of their data analysis has already been published.",
      "One study found that irrigating crop fields in the Imperial Valley reduced the wet-bulb globe temperature on summer days, thanks to the cooling effect of evaporating water. But on summer nights, the opposite occurred: irrigation increased the wet-bulb globe temperature as humidity spiked. Irrigation also heightened heat in nearby urban and fallow areas adjacent to crop fields due to moisture transport.",
      "\u201cIt is a concern because an elevated nighttime temperature restricts the ability of farmworkers to cool down,\u201d said Parajuli, the study's lead author. \u201cSo they can\u2019t recover from the heat stress they could be accumulating from the daytime.\"",
      "Through this research, the authors were able to recommend how frequently farmworkers should take rest breaks to protect themselves from heat stress, based on how often wet-bulb globe temperatures exceed safety thresholds across seasons and work shifts. While California has heat rules, they're not strictly enforced, he added.",
      "\u201cWe realized that farmworkers are not getting enough rest breaks, and also there are no clear policy guidelines in terms of heat-related rest breaks,\" he said.",

      "The inquiry found both companies had violated the Digital Services Act, the EU\u2019s trailblazing digital rule book that imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online, including making it easier to report counterfeit or unsafe goods or flag harmful or illegal content like hate speech, as well as a ban on ads targeted at children.",

That means platforms must empower users, respect their rights, and open their systems to scrutiny. The DSA makes this a duty, not a choice.\u201d",
      "The 27-nation bloc launched investigations in 2024 into both Meta and TikTok. They found that the companies did not allow easy access to data for researchers. They also found that Meta's Instagram and Facebook did not make it easy for users to flag illegal content and effectively challenge moderation decisions. \u201cAllowing researchers access to platforms\u2019 data is an essential transparency obligation under the DSA, as it provides public scrutiny into the potential impact of platforms on our physical and mental health,\u201d according to a statement by the European Commission, the EU's executive body. The inquiry found both Facebook and Instagram deployed \u201cdark patterns\u201d or deceptive interface designs for its protocol for flagging malicious content like child sex abuse or terrorist content. That led to a kind of obfuscation, with the Commission saying it was \u201cconfusing and dissuading\u201d and \u201cmay therefore be ineffective.\u201d",

TikTok said Friday that it would review the findings but said that the transparency obligations of the DSA conflict with the EU's strict privacy rules, the General Data Protection Regulation. \"If it is not possible to fully comply with both, we urge regulators to provide clarity on how these obligations should be reconciled,\u201d said Paolo Ganino, a spokesperson for TikTok.",

      "Intel posted profits in the latest quarter as the one-time America technology icon struggles to regain market share",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Intel has posted a profit in its first quarterly report since the U.S. government became a major shareholder in the struggling chipmaker.",
      "The one-time American tech icon reported a net income of $4.1 billion, or 90 cents per share, in the three months ending in September, up from a loss of $17 billion, or $3.88 per share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 3% from last year to $13.7 billion.",
      "Stock in the company rose nearly 8% in after-hours trading to $41.10, adding to strong gains since the United States invested in the summer.",
      "Recently installed CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been slashing thousands of jobs and mothballing projects to shore up the company's finances and better compete with domestic and foreign rivals that have since overtaken it.",
      "President Donald Trump announced in August that the U.S. government would take a 10% stake in the Intel as part of his effort to bolster companies deemed vital to national security. It was a startling move for a Republican leader, bucking the party's long-held belief that governments shouldn\u2019t try to pick corporate winners and losers with taxpayer money.",

      "Founded in 1968 at the start of the personal computer revolution, Intel missed the shift to mobile computing triggered by Apple\u2019s 2007 release of the iPhone. The company's troubles have been magnified since then by the advent of artificial intelligence \u2014 a booming field where Nvidia's chips have become tech\u2019s hottest commodity.",

      "Some public figures carry threats to their livelihood in the palms of their hands",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Some politicians carry threats to their livelihood in the palms of their hands.",
      "News stories in recent weeks about offensive or ill-advised text messages have blown up the careers of several young Republicans in a chat group, led a nominee for a White House job to drop out, threatened the campaign of a Democrat running for Virginia attorney general and embarrassed a federal prosecutor.",
      "Memories are still fresh of this spring's inadvertent inclusion of a journalist on a Signal chain where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other leaders discussed military strikes, possibly the second Trump administration's most embarrassing moment.",
      "For journalists, it's something else entirely. Bad smartphone behavior is fertile ground for reporters seeking insight into people who look to lead us \u2014 and presents a challenge to nail down stories when \u201cthat's fake\u201d looms as a default defense.",
      "Paul Ingrassia, who was President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Office of Special Counsel, withdrew his name from consideration Tuesday. His Senate support had crumbled following Politico's Oct. 20 report that Ingrassia said in a text chain that he had a \u201cNazi streak\u201d and believed the federal holiday honoring the birth of Martin Luther King Jr. should be tossed into hell.",
      "Less than a week earlier, Politico exposed a Telegram chat group with leaders of youthful Republican groups across the country involved in casually racist and violent talk. So far, the outlet says seven people have lost jobs due to the story.",
      "\u201cPart of the reason this is such an important line of coverage for Politico right now is it gives readers as close to an unfiltered look at the way powerful people think and express themselves in private as they're going to get,\u201d said Alex Burns, its senior executive editor.",
      "He described texts as one of the few remaining frontiers of inadvertent authenticity. They recall past moments of infamy, like when President Richard Nixon made the ill-advised decision to tape his White House conversations, transcripts of which brought the phrase \u201cexpletive deleted\u201d into the American lexicon.",
      "There are countless cringeworthy moments caught on \u201chot\u201d microphones, such as during the Cold War with the Soviet Union, when President Ronald Reagan joked before a 1984 radio address that \u201cwe begin bombing in five minutes.\" Most public figures now know that virtually everyone around them carries a video camera-equipped smartphone.",
      "Some of the recently-unearthed text messages \u2014 Black people called monkeys or \u201cwatermelon people,\u201d images of gas chambers or urinating on the graves of opponents \u2014 are stunning and dark. You can't help but wonder: what were they thinking? Were they thinking?",
      "Probably not, in part because texting is such a ubiquitous, low-friction form of communication in today's world, said Cal Newton, professor of computer science at Georgetown University. Guards that people have up when talking with other people \u2014 be reasonable, civil, careful \u2014 are often missing.",
      "Some parts of our brain \u201cdon't recognize text on a glowing piece of glass as \u2018I\u2019m in a conversation with other people,'\u201d Newton said. Bad impulses, and the tendency to amplify or exaggerate, slip out because they can't see reactions.",
      "Still, it's not like people don't understand, on some level, that they're communicating on a medium where conversations can be saved on screen shots. There were nervous warning signs in some of the chats: \u201cIf we ever had a leak of this chat we would be cooked,\u201d one young Republican said.",
      "It reminds Sarah Kreps, a Cornell University professor who teaches about the intersection of politics and technology, of politicians whose careers are ruined by affairs. Everyone sees the cautionary tales, but it doesn't stop the behavior.",
      "\u201cThere's this overconfidence \u2014 \u2018it can\u2019t happen to me. It happens to other people and it won't bring me down,'\u201d Kreps said.",
      "Beyond texts, Burns said Politico is in the market for other insightful open source reporting, such as audio, video or behind-the-scenes memos. He would not say whether the Ingrassia texts came as direct result of how Politico handled its previous story, but he believes his outlet has proven it has handled these stories responsibly.",

      "While the Politico stories immediately impacted careers, voters will ultimately decide the impact of the National Review's Oct. 3 story on Jay Jones, the Virginia attorney general candidate.

      "The ability now to concoct something that sounds real, coupled with public mistrust in the media, compels news organizations to tell readers as much as possible about how the material was verified without breaking agreements to confidential sources.",
      "In its story about the January 2024 chat that Ingrassia was involved in, Politico said it interviewed two other participants. It explained why the sources were granted anonymity and had the person who showed reporters the entire chain say why they came forward. The second person verified Ingrassia's phone number.",

Bower had assumed it was a hoax; it's rare for a U.S. attorney in a high-profile case to contact a journalist.",
      "She had met Halligan one time years before, and asked the texter to say when that meeting was and who she was with. After the person answered correctly, Bower checked through another source to see if the phone number the messages came from was indeed Halligan's.",
      "Halligan later complained that their text conversation was off the record. Bower explained the rules of journalism to readers: A source must assume that a conversation with a reporter is on the record unless there's an explicit agreement otherwise ahead of time \u2014 and this wasn't done.",
      "The Atlantic editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, wrote at length about how he handled being added to the Signal text chain about military operations. He, too, initially thought it was a hoax. He removed himself from the chat group when he became convinced it was real, then received confirmation from the National Security Council.",

      "Elon Musk literally left a government job with a black eye, has seen profits at his car company sink and must worry about federal regulators disrupting his plans to unleash a fleet of driverless taxis on America's roads in the next few years",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 If someone left a government job with a black eye, literally, ran a company with shrinking profits, and suddenly had federal investigators crawling over their business, you might say they\u2019re having a bad year.",
      "But most people are not Elon Musk.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man has only gotten richer this year and shareholders at Tesla, his electric car company, may make him wealthier yet by approving a trillion-dollar pay package in a bet he will succeed with new plans for a \u201crobot army\u201d and other technological breakthroughs even as some past promises remain unfulfilled.",
      "\u201cThe genius of Elon Musk is keeping investors focused on what the company might look in like 5 or 10 years \u2014 while ignoring very near-term challenges,\u201d marvels Garrett Nelson of CFRA Research. Or put more bluntly by Zacks Investment's Brian Mulberry, \"Your average CEO would likely not survive this.\"",
      "Musk started out the year with a side hustle \u2014 promising to cut $2 trillion in government spending as head of President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, before cutting that pledge in half. In the end, DOGE posted only $240 billion in savings, according to its own notoriously unreliable estimates, and it's not even clear those savings will hold as the Trump administration scrambles to refill many essential jobs DOGE cut that it shouldn't have.",
      "\u201cThere is a pattern of them announcing great big firings, and then turning about and saying, \u2019No, that\u2019s a mistake,\u2019\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a Brookings Institute senior fellow who has compiled a list of 17,000 positions being refilled. \u201cThey cut without a plan, without regard to function.\u201d",
      "Musk used the same slash-and-burn tactics after he took over Twitter and evidence of that backfiring has emerged this year, too.",
      "In the past two months, he\u2019s settled a pair of lawsuits filed by 2,000 former Twitter employees and executives alleging that they were pushed out under false pretenses or never given severance as promised. The amount the ex-workers got was undisclosed, but if they received even a fraction of the combined $628 million they were demanding, the cost will cut deeply for a company whose advertising has plunged since his takeover.",
      "More bad news for Musk came Wednesday when Tesla announced earnings had plunged 37% in the third quarter. Vehicle sales rose 6% as customers rushed to take advantage of a federal tax credit before it expired last month, but the figure for the full year is expected to drop significantly as car buyers turned off by Musk's right-wing political stances have boycotted the business.",
      "This time a year ago Musk was telling investors sales could grow 20% to 30%.",
      "The stock fell earlier this year as the bad news piled up. But after Musk appeared in the Oval Office in May for his farewell to DOGE sporting a shiner, it has doubled and is now posting a year-to-date gain of nearly 9% after the close of regular trading Wednesday. His net worth has also jumped \u2014 up $62 billion this year to $483 billion, according to Forbes magazine.",

To make his task worth while, Tesla\u2019s directors are asking shareholders to sign off on his enormous new pay package at an annual meeting next month.",
      "But there are big questions surrounding these endeavors, particularly the driverless cabs.",
      "Musk's robotaxis, which began picking up passengers in Austin, Texas, and San Francisco this summer, can\u2019t yet be called driverless because they still require \u201csafety monitors\u201d who are ready to seize control in case something goes wrong, which occasionally happens. One of them drove down the opposing lane, for example.",
      "The robotaxi plans need approval from regulators in various states even as the ones in Washington have swarmed the company.",

Another launched earlier this month is looking into dozens of reported accidents in which Teslas using self-driving software ran red lights and broke other traffic rules, occasionally crashing into other vehicles and causing injuries.",
      "Musk has disappointed before, talking big and missing deadlines repeatedly, only to deliver for shareholders eventually. Tesla investors who held on through a tough 2018 as the company struggled to produce its Model 3 vehicle at a profit, eventually saw their stock soar as sales jumped.",
      "One money manager who rode that earlier surge then bought again earlier this year, says she\u2019s confident Musk's magic is still there and he can pull off the seemingly impossible again.",

      "These dinosaur remains are different from the wrapped mummies of Egypt or natural human mummies that get accidentally preserved in bogs or deserts. Mummified dinosaurs are so old that their skin and soft tissues fossilize. Scientists use these rare remnants, along with dinosaur bones, to recreate what these prehistoric creatures may have looked like.",
      "Scientists have been uncovering dinosaur mummies for over a century. Some were buried quickly after dying, while others sank into bodies of water or dried out.",
      "Many of them \u2014 including a duck-billed dinosaur mummy discovered in 1908 \u2014 hail from an area in eastern Wyoming. In the new study, scientists returned to this so-called mummy zone and found new remains, including the mummy of a duck-billed dinosaur that was only a few years old when it died.",
      "\u201cThis is the first juvenile of a dinosaur that really is mummified,\u201d said Paul Sereno, a University of Chicago paleontologist who was involved in the discovery.",
      "Surprisingly, the new mummies seem to have been preserved without any evidence of fossilized skin. Instead, they left impressions of their skin and scales on a thin layer of clay that hardened with help from microbes.",
      "This style of mummification has preserved other organisms before, but scientists didn't think it could happen on land. It\u2019s possible that other mummies found at the Wyoming site could have formed in a similar way, Sereno said.",

It's also easy to shut off, which is a big difference from Microsoft's Clippit, better known as Clippy and infamous for its persistence in offering advice on word processing tools when it first appeared on desktop screens in 1997.",
      "\u201cIt was not well-attuned to user needs at the time,\u201d said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cMicrosoft pushed it, we resisted it and they got rid of it. I think we\u2019re much more ready for things like that today.\u201d",
      "Reimer, co-author of a new book called \u201cHow to Make AI Useful,\u201d said AI developers are balancing how much personality to give AI assistants based on who their expected users are.",
      "Tech-savvy adopters of advanced AI coding tools may want it to \u201cact much more like a machine because at the back end they know it\u2019s a machine,\u201d Reimer said. \u201cBut individuals who are not as trustful in a machine are going to be best supported \u2014 not replaced \u2014 by technology that feels a little more like a human.\u201d",
      "Microsoft, a provider of work productivity tools that is far less reliant on digital advertising revenue than its Big Tech competitors, also has less incentive to make its AI companion overly engaging in a way that's been tied to social isolation, harmful misinformation and, in some cases, suicides.",
      "Andreou said Microsoft has watched as some AI developers veered away from \u201cgiving AI any sort of embodiment,\u201d while others are moving in the opposite direction in enabling AI girlfriends.",
      "\u201cThose two paths don\u2019t really resonate with us that much,\u201d he said.",

But it's also one of the busiest for parents as they try to keep track of their trick-or-treaters, give out candy and watch over their homes.",
      "Fortunately, there are some tech tricks out there that can help families stay safe this Halloween, and have a little more fun too.",
      "If your children are outfitted with Apple or Google-branded smart phones or watches or tracking tags, you can use the Find My or Family Link apps to keep tabs on them as they embark on their candy journeys. But don't think of these apps as basic. Because branded peripherals \u2014 like Apple Air Tags or Pixel smartwatches \u2014 are built to be used with Apple and Google platforms, their tracking platforms can be more reliable than some third-party services.",
      "One trick I discovered last Halloween is that I can set up a geofence with Find My. This gave my kids a little more freedom to navigate a set trick-or-treating area while I struggled to keep up with them. If anyone broke from the pack and left the designated area, I would get a notification. Here's how to set it up:",
      "Go to the Find My app on your iPhone. Scroll and tap on the name of the person or device you want to be notified about. Below notifications, tap \u201cAdd,\u201d then \u201cNotify me.\u201d Continue through the menu options until you get to a location option. Choose \u201cNew Location\u201d and you will be given the option to set a location radius. Then you will be asked how often you wish to be notified if the tracked individual leaves the area.",
      "Next is a critical step if you wish to set a recurring notification. Unless it's an air tag, your child must give a one-time authorization to the request. They will receive an alert asking for approval when they arrive at or leave the location you chose for the first time.",
      "Google users have a similar geofencing option. First, you need to set up a new Family Location in the Family Link app. Then select your child in the main menu of the app and tap Family Locations, add the place you just created and select how often you'd like to be notified when they enter or exit the area.",

If your device isn't hardwired, the extra motion from trick-or-treaters could drain your doorbell's batteries quickly (as I discovered). You can also avoid a flood of notifications if you do so.",
      "Smart phones have flashlights, sure, but they're not the brightest nor are they the best option if you're carrying jackets, candy baskets, water bottles or costume parts. Instead, give yourself or your children more portable lumens so they can see (and be seen) easily in the dark.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The most widely used COVID-19 vaccines may offer a surprise benefit for some cancer patients \u2013 revving up their immune systems to help fight tumors.",
      "People with advanced lung or skin cancer who were taking certain immunotherapy drugs lived substantially longer if they also got a Pfizer or Moderna shot within 100 days of starting treatment, according to preliminary research being reported Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "And it had nothing to do with virus infections.",
      "Instead, the molecule that powers those specific vaccines, mRNA, appears to help the immune system respond better to the cutting-edge cancer treatment, concluded researchers from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Florida.",
      "The vaccine \u201cacts like a siren to activate immune cells throughout the body,\u201d said lead researcher Dr. Adam Grippin of MD Anderson. \u201cWe\u2019re sensitizing immune-resistant tumors to immune therapy.\u201d",

      "But this research team found its results so promising that it is preparing a more rigorous study to see if mRNA coronavirus vaccines should be paired with cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors \u2014 an interim step while it designs new mRNA vaccines for use in cancer.",
      "A healthy immune system often kills cancer cells before they become a threat. But some tumors evolve to hide from immune attack. Checkpoint inhibitors remove that cloak. It's a powerful treatment \u2013 when it works. Some people\u2019s immune cells still don\u2019t recognize the tumor.",
      "Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is naturally found in every cell and it contains genetic instructions for our bodies to make proteins. While best known as the Nobel Prize-winning technology behind COVID-19 vaccines, scientists have long been trying to create personalized mRNA \u201ctreatment vaccines\u201d that train immune cells to spot unique features of a patient's tumor.",
      "The new research offers \u201ca very good clue\u201d that maybe an off-the-shelf approach could work, said Dr. Jeff Coller, an mRNA specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn\u2019t involved with the work. \u201cWhat it shows is that mRNA medicines are continuing to surprise us in how beneficial they can be to human health.\u201d",
      "Grippin and his Florida colleagues had been developing personalized mRNA cancer vaccines when they realized that even one created without a specific target appeared to spur similar immune activity against cancer.",

      "Data centers needed to fuel AI accounted for about 1.5% of the world\u2019s electricity consumption last year, and those facilities' energy consumption is predicted to more than double by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. That increase could lead to burning more fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which release greenhouse gases that contribute to warming temperatures, sea level rise and extreme weather.",
      "But when AI's computing power is used to analyze energy usage and pollution, it can also make buildings more efficient, charge devices at optimal times, make oil and gas production less polluting and schedule traffic lights to reduce vehicle emissions.",

      "AI can be used to make buildings more energy-efficient by automatically adjusting lighting, ventilation, heating and cooling based on weather data, electricity usage and other factors, said Bob French, chief evangelist at the building automation company 75F. Around one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution comes from homes and buildings.",
      "Letting AI schedule air conditioning and heating around workers' arrivals and departures can be more efficient than manually adjusting the thermostat. Otherwise, a worker's instinct might be to blast the air to quickly adjust the temperature. Automated thermostats can be particularly useful for smaller buildings where it's not cost-effective to overhaul the entire heating and cooling system.",
      "For building ventilation, automation can balance the intake of outside air against how much heating or cooling is needed to maintain indoor temperatures.",
      "AI can also monitor the maintenance needs of HVAC systems and other equipment to predict and detect failures before they lead to costlier repairs.",
      "Combined, these automations can reduce a building's energy consumption by between 10% and 30%, experts said.",

      "AI can schedule the most efficient charging of electric vehicles and other devices such as smartphones.",
      "This means setting a schedule for when it is best to draw power from the grid, such as overnight, when demand and rates are lower so it\u2019s less likely to make the grid burn more fossil fuels.",

      "Prince Harry and Meghan have joined a diverse group, including Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck, to call for a ban on AI \"superintelligence\" that threatens humanity",
      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \u201csuperintelligence\u201d that threatens humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says:",
      "\u201cWe call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\u201d",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\u201d",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\u201d",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\u201cThis is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It\u2019s simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\u201d",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",

      "\u201cYeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \u201cBut does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don\u2019t want that.\u201d",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\u201cIn the past, it\u2019s mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\u201d said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cI feel what we\u2019re really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\u201d",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of stuff that\u2019s overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\u201d Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to pause the development of more powerful AI models temporarily. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\u201cI really empathize for them, frankly, because they\u2019re so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\u201d Tegmark said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\u201d",

      "The American grandmaster won several championships and amassed hundreds of thousands of subscribers on YouTube, Twitch and other platforms, where he would livestream matches and explain strategy in real time. But he also struggled with the cyberspace he helped build.",
      "High-speed games became wildly popular online during the pandemic, creating a chess community that was soon rife with cheating allegations as players gained access to sophisticated computer programs that could give them an unfair advantage.",
      "Naroditsky's untimely death has shined a spotlight on the dark underbelly of the game that fellow pros say brought undue hostility upon the chess star in his final months.",
      "Naroditsky had been accused of cheating, and the allegations, never proven, had taken a toll. Ukrainian grandmaster Oleksandr Bortnyk, a competitor and friend of Naroditsky, was concerned and went to check on him Sunday. He and a friend found Naroditsky, known to many as Danya, unresponsive on a couch in his North Carolina home, Bortnyk recounted during an emotional livestream Monday.",
      "The cause of death has not been made public.",
      "\u201cDanya was not only a brilliant grandmaster, but also a tireless ambassador for chess, and above all \u2014 a kind, compassionate and truly good person,\u201d said Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation.",
      "The unsubstantiated claims of cheating came from from Russian grandmaster and former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik, whom Naroditsky had called one of the \u201cheroes\u201d he looked up to as a kid.",
      "Naroditsky had denied the claims as he excelled at blitz and bullet chess, where players have mere minutes to finish intense matches.",
      "\u201cEver since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,\u201d Naroditsky said Saturday in the last livestream he filmed before his death. \u201cThe issue is just the lingering effect of it.\u201d",
      "He ruminated about his legacy and hoped other top players would trust that he played with integrity.",
      "Chess pros from around the world have since praised Naroditsky as an honorable player who used his online platform to make chess more accessible. His family said in a statement that they hope he will be remembered for the joy and inspiration he brought people.",
      "Meanwhile, grandmasters have slammed Kramnik on social media for how he treated Naroditsky. American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura went on an expletive-laden rant on his latest livestream, and Indian grandmaster Nihal Sarin accused the Russian pro of trying to destroy Naroditsky's life in a post on X.",
      "Kramnik continued to post about Naroditsky on the day his death was announced, calling it a tragedy and speculating about the cause.",

He was consistently ranked in the top 200 worldwide for traditional chess and was a top 25 blitz player, winning the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August. He spent much of his time training young players.",

      "Kenneth Regan, a chess international master and computer science professor at the University at Buffalo, said the opportunity to cheat has exploded as the cerebral sport has shifted online. There are ways to police the game online, but Regan said they are intrusive.",
      "\u201cThe rate of cheating online is 100 to 200 times higher than the rate over the board,\u201d Regan said. \u201cFrom my point of view, there are five to 10 cases per year over the board.\u201d",
      "The popular internet chess server Chess.com shut down Kramnik\u2019s blog on the site in 2023, saying he had used it to spread baseless cheating allegations about \u201cmany dozens of players.\u201d At the time, the platform warned of \u201cKramnik\u2019s escalating attacks\u201d against some of the most respected members of the chess community and some promising young talents.",
      "The speedy style of play popularized in chess' digital arena is somewhat reliant on the honor system.",
      "Top talents analyze the board so quickly and move with such precision that cheating allegations have become common. Bullet chess is so fast, Regan said, that it's essentially \u201cplaying chess entirely with your gut.\u201d",
      "Last week, Naroditsky posted a video in his popular Speedrun series on YouTube, telling viewers he was \u201cback, better than ever\u201d after a short \u201ccreative break.\u201d His videos, in which he gave tips and discussed strategy, were great tools for chess players of various abilities, said Benjamin Balas, a psychology professor at North Dakota State.",

      "The results announced Tuesday broke Netflix's six-quarter streak of posting a profit that eclipsed analysts' projections.",
      "The Los Gatos, California, cited an unexpected $619 million expense tied to the Brazilian tax dispute for the earnings shortfall while hailing its lineup of distinctive TV series and films for keeping its audience engaged and delivering a mix of subscriber fees and increased ad sales that helped it deliver revenue that matched analyst forecasts.",
      "Investors, though, weren't placated by the explanation as Netflix's shares still fell by about 6% in extended trading after the numbers came out.",
      "Analysts varied in their interpretation of the third-quarter report.",
      "Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro worries Netflix is using the Brazilian tax hit as a way to mask signs of a slowdown in subscriber growth and advertising amid economy uncertainty. \u201cThe truth is that the company failed to deliver the kind of growth we\u2019ve grown used to over the past couple of years,\u201d he said.",
      "But Zacks analyst Jeremy Mullin said he sees little reason for concern, asserting Netflix's \u201cunderlying story remains solid.\u201d",
      "Netflix earned $2.5 billion, or $5.87 per share, in its July-September quarter, an 8% increase from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 17% from last year to $11.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted the Los Gatos, California, company to earn $6.96 per share on revenue of $11.5 billion.",
      "Delivering solid financial growth has become more important than ever for Netflix as management has steered investors from fixating on how many subscribers its service gains from one quarter to the next. As part of that process, Netflix stopped disclosing its subscribers at the end of last year.",
      "The shift has paid off so far, with Netflix\u2019s stock price rising about 40% so far this year, although the downturn in extended trading signaled some of those gains are about to evaporate.",
      "Although Netflix no longer reveals the specific, this year\u2019s revenue growth signals that its worldwide subscriber count has increased from the roughly 302 million it had at the end of last year \u2013 by far the most among video streamers, even as rivals with deeper pockets such as Amazon and Apple expand their programming selections.",

      "Chrome\u2019s immense success could provide a blueprint for OpenAI as it enters the browser market. When Google released Chrome in 2008, Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer was so dominant that few observers believed a new browser could mount a formidable threat.",
      "But Chrome quickly won over legions of admirers by loading webpages more quickly than Internet Explorer while offering other advantages that enabled it to upend the market.

      "Employer feedback suggested to Citi that early career applicants lacked the technical skills necessary for roles many had long prepared to fill, highlighting the need for continued vocational training and the importance of soft skills.",
      "Skyler pointed to the World Economic Forum\u2019s recent survey of more than 1,000 companies that together employ millions of people. Skills gaps were considered the biggest barrier to business transformation over the next five years. Two-thirds of respondents reported planning to hire people with specific AI skills and 40% of them anticipated eliminating jobs AI could complete.",
      "Some of Citi's grantees are responding by teaching people how to prompt AI chatbots to do work that can be automated. But Skyler emphasized it was equally important that Citi fund efforts to impart qualities AI lacks such as teamwork, empathy, judgment and communication.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all effort where we think every young person needs to be able to code or interface with AI,\" Skyler said. \u201cWhat is consistent throughout the programs is we want to develop the soft skills.\u201d",
      "Among the recipients is NPower, a national nonprofit that seeks to improve economic opportunity in underinvested communities by making digital careers more accessible. Most of their students are young adults between the ages of 18 and 26.",
      "NPower Chief Innovation Officer Robert Vaughn said Citi's grant will at least double the spaces available in a program for \u201cgreen students\u201d with no tech background and oftentimes no college degree.",
      "Considering the tech industry's ever-changing requirements for skills and certifications, he said, applicants need to demonstrate wide-ranging capabilities both in cloud computing and artificial intelligence as well as project management and emotional intelligence.",
      "As some entry-level roles get automated and outsourced, Vaughn said companies aren\u2019t necessarily looking for college degrees and specialized skillsets, but AI comfortability and general competency.",

      "James pleaded not guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution.",
      "\"Not guilty, judge, to both counts,\" James said, entering the plea herself.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jamar Walker set an initial trial date for Jan. 26, to which both the government and the defense agreed.",
      "The trial is expected to take \"no more\" than two weeks, said government attorneys, who estimated they will call between 8 to 10 witnesses.",
      "James was released on personal recognizance following the conclusion of the hearing.",
      "Interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan -- who\u00a0Trump appointed just days after calling on the his attorney general to\u00a0act \"NOW!!!\"\u00a0to prosecute James and other political enemies -- secured the indictment against James on Oct. 9. James successfully brought a\u00a0civil fraud case\u00a0against Trump last year and currently leads multiple lawsuits challenging his administration's policies.",
      "Halligan was named U.S. attorney by Trump after\u00a0Trump ousted\u00a0her predecessor, Erik Siebert, who sources say had expressed doubts internally about bringing cases against James and former FBI Director James Comey.",
      "After attorneys representing James filed a motion challenging Halligan's appointment as unlawful, Judge Walker ordered that the motion be consolidated with the already ongoing effort to disqualify her in the case against Comey, who was indicted last month on charges of making false statements to Congress, to which he has pleaded not guilty.",

      "James, speaking outside the courthouse following her arraignment, said the justice system under President Trump has been \"used as a tool of revenge\" and is nothing but a \"vehicle of retribution.\"",

      "The charges James faces accuse her of committing mortgage fraud related to a home she purchased in 2020.",
      "According to the indictment, James falsely described the property as a second home to get an advantageous mortgage rate, but used it as an \"investment property,\" rented to a family of three. The indictment alleged James collected thousands of dollars in rent and would have saved $17,837 over the life of the mortgage versus a loan at a higher rate.",
      "\"No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust,\" Halligan said in a statement announcing the charges. \"The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.\"",
      "But in an internal memo to Siebert in September, prosecutors said James purchased the home in Norfolk, Virginia, for her great-niece and immediately allowed her and her children to begin living in the house rent-free,\u00a0sources told ABC News. Prosecutors met with James' niece, who stated that she had never signed a lease, had never paid rent for the home, and that James had often sent her money to cover some of the expenses, the memo concluded, according to sources familiar with its contents.",

      "Doris Brown\u2019s home in Northeast Houston becomes a refuge for neighbors during power outages thanks to her solar panel and battery system",
      "HOUSTON -- Doris Brown was nearly asleep when a neighbor knocked on her door, telling her to look outside. \u201cThere were no lights, nowhere,\u201d said Brown, recalling the power outage that summer night in 2023. \u201cI didn't even know it.\u201d",
      "Brown's solar panel and battery system was keeping her power on. She'd prepared for a night like this. \u201cCall everybody,\u201d she told the neighbor.",
      "Soon around 15 \u201cneighbors and neighbors' neighbors\u201d were inside Brown's three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath home in Northeast Houston. They charged phones, cooked, and showered before work and school. Some slept over.",
      "\u201cThere were people sleeping everywhere,\u201d said Brown, 75. She was happy to be \u201ca port in a storm,\u201d despite one downside: \u201cThey ate all my snacks.\u201d",
      "Brown's house is a \u201chub home,\u201d one of seven in a Northeast Houston pilot program meant to create emergency safe havens \u2014 not at shelters or community centers, but inside neighbors' houses.",
      "The idea was a grassroots response to decades of community disinvestment and neglect that got neighbors talking about what they could do to be ready for extreme weather and power outages.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s us helping us,\u201d said Brown.",
      "The project was set to reach 30 more homes, until the Environmental Protection Agency in August canceled the $7 billion Solar for All program which would have funded its expansion. Harris County, which includes Houston, is now a plaintiff in one of multiple lawsuits over the cancellation.",
      "People involved with the program acknowledge hub homes are unconventional \u2014 requiring trust and community cooperation and impacting fewer people than a larger resilience center.",
      "But they also say they're effective in creating pockets of preparedness in communities confronting more extreme weather but lacking resources to do more.",
      "\u201cIt was a way to increase resilience in those neighborhoods that are often forgotten,\u201d said Sam Silerio, Texas program director at Solar United Neighbors, one of the nonprofits involved with the pilot program which is also suing over the cuts.",
      "The hub homes idea started after Winter Storm Uri in 2021, when freezing temperatures crippled Texas' power grid for five days and led to 246 storm-related deaths, according to the Texas Department of Health Services.",
      "Power loss contributed to many of the deaths, as people with health conditions couldn't refrigerate medicines or run life-sustaining medical devices. Nineteen people died from carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly using generators and grills to stay warm.",
      "\u201cWe were like, \u2018Shoot, power grid failure is a serious thing that we are not prepared for\u2019,\u201d said Becky Selle, co-director of disaster preparedness, organizing, and operations at West Street Recovery, a Northeast Houston nonprofit founded after Hurricane Harvey in 2017.",
      "WSR bought some generators for residents willing to share the resource. Brown, who almost froze to death herself in Uri, stepped up.",
      "WSR added more supplies to the hubs, like life jackets and kayaks for flood evacuations, and held preparedness trainings for members.",
      "When the D.C.-based nonprofit Solar United Neighbors approached them with a private grant from the Hive Fund to add free solar panels and batteries to several houses, WSR knew exactly where to install them.",
      "The pilot had its challenges \u2014 some roofs had to be repaired before they could hold solar panels, and hub captains had to learn how to manage their batteries to not deplete them.",
      "Success also required neighborly connection that modern communities often lack.",
      "\u201cYou have to build that trust,\u201d said David Espinoza, a hub home captain and West Street Recovery\u2019s co-director of community organizing and language access. The 34-year-old went door-to-door on his block, introducing himself to sometimes wary neighbors. \u201cI got to know my neighborhood a lot better,\u201d he said.",
      "About a dozen people are signed up on Espinoza's \u201croster,\u201d but he said the hub is there for anyone in need, prioritizing older neighbors and those with children or medical conditions.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump will be in Japan and South Korea next week and he's expected to promote an epic windfall in investments for U.S. factories and projects",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is going to Japan and South Korea next week to promote an epic financial windfall \u2014 at least $900 billion in investments for U.S. factories, a natural gas pipeline and other projects.",
      "Japan and South Korea made those financial commitments in August to try to get Trump to ratchet down his planned tariff rates from 25% to 15%. But as the U.S. president is set to depart Friday night for Asia, the pledges are more of a loose end than money in the bank for American industry.",
      "Japan pledged $550 billion in investments, but it wants the money to benefit its own companies, making that a condition in a memorandum released in September. As of Monday, Japan has a new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, who has expressed respect for Trump but is operating in an untested coalition government.",
      "South Korea offered $350 billion \u2014 but wants a swap line for U.S. dollars to facilitate its investments and seeks to fund the transactions through loan guarantees. Otherwise, the commitment could sink its own economy.",
      "The investment arrangements are unusual for trade frameworks, and Trump maintains that he will personally direct how the money is spent, enabling him to pick winners and losers. Weeks of talks have yet to produce any breakthroughs on how the investments would go forward even though both nations want to preserve their relationship with America.",
      "Still, ahead of the trip, Trump was radiating optimism that his tariffs had forced investments to fuel what he believes will be an economic boom starting next year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done well, as you know, with Japan, with South Korea,\u201d Trump told Republican senators Tuesday. \u201cWithout the tariffs, you could have never made the deal. I\u2019ll tell you what. Tariffs equal national security.\u201d",
      "For Trump, the investments are also about demonstrating America\u2019s strength before a planned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping while he is in South Korea. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Monday described Trump's strategy in part as \u201cencouraging allied investment in America\u2019s industrial future\u201d to counter Chinese manufacturers.",
      "But Japan and South Korea are also competing against China \u2014 which is pivoting aggressively into electric vehicles, computer chips and other technologies. There is a risk that mandating investment in the U.S. could weaken allies that are closer geographically to China, said Christopher Smart, managing partner at the Arbroath Group, a geopolitical strategy firm.",
      "\u201cThey need to invest in their own countries,\u201d said Smart, who was a senior economic aide in the Obama White House. He said Trump was \u201cgoing to extract investment money\u201d from the countries while also erecting \"tariff walls\u201d that could make it harder for them to sell goods in America, a rather lopsided view of how alliances work.",
      "Few experts believe Japan and South Korea would agree with the Trump administration's framing that their U.S. investments are a way to compete against China.",
      "\u201cIt is really about lowering tariffs and avoiding Trump\u2019s wrath,\u201d said Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for Asia Policy Studies.",
      "There is an expectation that Japan and South Korea both want to resolve any hurdles on the investments and will take steps to achieve \u201cprogress\u201d in talks with Trump, said William Chou, a senior fellow focused on Japan at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank.",
      "Chou pointed to Nippon Steel's agreement to purchase U.S. Steel this year as an example of how Japan can work with the Trump administration. The president had initially opposed the merger, but later backed it with an agreement that gave the U.S. government some control over the acquired company.",
      "Similarly, the memorandum of understanding on Japan\u2019s $550 million investment would also give the U.S. government input on how the money would be spent. It provides for a committee led by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to propose investments, giving Japan 45 days to respond, with the understanding that the deals would give preference to Japanese contractors and suppliers.",
      "\"Japan came through with the paperwork,\" Lutnick said in a September CNBC interview. \u201cThey gave us $550 billion to invest for the benefit of America, build the Alaska pipeline, build nuclear power plants, make your grid better, do generic antibiotics in America.\"",

      "The fire, which left 12 dead in the hillside neighborhoods across Pacific Palisades and Malibu, was one of two blazes that broke out on Jan. 7, killing more than 30 people in all and destroying over 17,000 homes and buildings while burning for days in Los Angeles County.",

Members of the Chicago City Council and their staff, state legislators and congressional candidates report being threatened, handcuffed and detained in recent days.",
      "The tense political atmosphere comes as President Donald Trump has vowed to expand military deployments and jail Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson over immigration policies the Republican claims protect criminals. But Illinois Democrats deem the actions as scare tactics and a calculated acceleration. The clashes, amid constant arrests of immigrants and protesters, have emerged as a top campaign issue in Illinois\u2019 March primary where an unusually high number of congressional seats are open.",

      "While the operation\u2019s focus has been concentrated in Latino neighborhoods and suburbs, federal agents have been spotted all over the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs. Word of pedestrian and traffic stops outside schools, stores, courts and an O\u2019Hare International Airport parking lot used by rideshare drivers have triggered waves of frustration amid the city\u2019s active immigrant rights network and residents who follow vehicles, blow warning whistles and take videos.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has defended its operations, including the detention of U.S. citizens, saying they are temporarily held for safety. The agency, which didn't answer questions about Rodriguez\u2019 staff, accused Huynh of \u201cstalking\u201d agents.",

And now federal lawmakers are divided on the demolition of the East Wing of the White House to make room for the 90,000-square-foot ballroom that President Donald Trump wants to build.",
      "The stunning images of the teardown this week have left Democratic lawmakers incensed. Republicans, meanwhile, are likening it to a long line of White House renovations over the years. There was Franklin Delano Roosevelt's swimming pool addition, now covered over, they said. There was Barack Obama's basketball court, a tennis court adapted so that it could be used for tennis and basketball. And William Taft added the Oval Office, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., noted.",

      "Maine Democrat Graham Platner remains committed to his U.S. Senate campaign despite a growing list of controversies",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- PORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 After days of posting multiple apology videos, showing off his chest to reveal a covered up tattoo that had been connected with a Nazi symbol and distancing himself from old online comments, Maine Democrat Graham Platner says he's only further committed to his U.S. Senate campaign.",
      "Platner, an oyster farmer and first-time political candidate, is vying to flip a Senate seat that has been held by Republican Susan Collins for nearly 30 years. However, he must first clear a competitive primary, which includes facing Democratic Gov. Janet Mills.",
      "Platner, 41, made a splashy jump into the senate race in August as a progressive candidate. But it wasn't until after Mills, 77, jumped in the race that news outlets began reporting on old Reddit posts, forcing him to issue a lengthy apology. He made a separate apology video when questions began swirling around a chest tattoo he drunkenly got nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Yet so far, Platner is attempting to forge ahead through the controversies \u2014 not too dissimilar of the playbook set by President Donald Trump, who has found success amid discoveries that would have ended campaigns only a decade ago.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the Maine Senate primary.",
      "Platner has not disputed that he authored a wide range of Reddit comments between 2013 and 2021 that appeared to endorse political violence and dismiss rape in the military, use homophobic slurs and criticize both police officers and rural America.",
      "Instead, he has maintained that the posts were made after leaving the Army in 2012 when he \"still had the crude humor, the dark, dark feelings, the offensive language that really was a hallmark of the infantry when I was in it.\u201d He also said that he was struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. He has credited moving back to his home town in Maine, going to therapy and spending more time in his community as helping him evolve and change his world views.",
      "Then, a tattoo on Platner's chest quickly became the new target of scrutiny as critics pointed out the image resembled a specific symbol of Hitler\u2019s paramilitary Schutzstaffel, or SS, which was responsible for the systematic murders of millions of Jews and others in Europe during World War II.",
      "Platner covered up the chest tattoo earlier this week with a new design \u2014 nearly 20 years after getting it with some fellow Marines in Croatia \u2014 and has said no one pointed out the tattoo's connotations until a few weeks ago.",

      "Later, at a town hall on Wednesday in southern Maine, Platner told a packed crowd that the establishment was \u201ctrying to destroy my life\u201d and added it is \u201cnot trying to get out there and talk about issues\u201d but rather \u201ctrying to figure out if I said something stupid on the internet 13 years ago.\u201d",

If they thought that ripping my life to pieces, trying to destroy it, was going to make me think that I shouldn\u2019t undertake this project, they clearly have not spent a lot of time around Marines,\" Platner said to cheers.",
      "Platner's supporters, ranging from U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Martin Heinrich, U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna and the United Auto Workers, have continued to throw their support behind the embattled candidate.",
      "\"I\u2019m not overly impressed by a squad of media running around saying, \u2019What do you think about the tattoo on Graham Platner\u2019s chest,' \u201d Sanders told Axios in an interview explaining his endorsement.",
      "Mills, meanwhile, has remained mum on Platner's revelations but separate primary rival, Jordan Wood, a onetime chief of staff to former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, a Democrat from California, has said Platner should drop out because \u201cDemocrats need to be able to condemn Trump\u2019s actions with moral clarity\u201d and Platner \u201cno longer can.\u201d",
      "Maine's primary election wont' be held until June 2026, meaning Platner, Mills and other candidates have another seven months to make their case to the state's voters.",

      "The troops have become a fixture of the city, patrolling metro stations and neighborhoods and supporting other federal law enforcement agencies in operations that have led to hundreds of arrests and sparked fear in many communities, especially among immigrants. Trump, a Republican, has praised the campaign as having reduced crime rates, which were already falling.",
      "D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat whose city budget and laws are determined by Congress, has walked a fine line between appeasing Trump and pushing back on the deployment. She has acknowledged that the campaign has helped push down crime, while arguing that the out-of-state National Guard deployment has not been \u201can efficient use of those resources.\u201d",
      "In a recent brief filed in the D.C. legal case, Attorney General Brian Schwalb argued that the Guard units are operating \u201cas a federal military police force.\u201d The document also indicated that there were plans for the D.C.

    "summary": "The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said.",
    "story": [
      "The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday, reaffirming a decision to put the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican artist on the league's biggest stage that led to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and some of his supporters.",
      "Goodell addressed the Bad Bunny controversy at his news conference following the annual fall owners meeting. It is the first time he has commented on the move announced in late September that garnered worldwide attention, including an increase in streams of Bad Bunny's music, along with backlash.",
      "\"It's carefully thought through,\" Goodell said. \"I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism. It's pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.\"",
      "The 31-year-old born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. He decided to do a 31-day residency in Puerto Rico, avoiding stops in the mainland U.S., citing concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos.",
      "He performs in Spanish and is expected to do so at the Super Bowl.",
      "\"We're confident it's going to be a great show,\" Goodell said, acknowledging there could be more talent added to the lineup along with Bad Bunny. \"He understands the platform that he's on, and I think it's going to be exciting and a united moment.\"",
      "The San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Super Bowl on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It is unclear if Trump plans to be there, though he has made appearing in person at major sporting events a significant part of his second term in the White House.",
      "Trump in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax said he had \"never heard of\" Bad Bunny.",
      "\"I don't know who he is,\" Trump said. \"I don't know why they're doing it. It's, like, crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it's absolutely ridiculous.\"",
      "Goodell defended the decision on Wednesday, explaining it was made because of Bad Bunny's immense popularity.",
      "\"He's one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,\" Goodell said. \"That's what we try to achieve. It's an important stage for us. It's an important element to the entertainment value.\"",
      "Echoing what senior VP of football operations Troy Vincent said Tuesday, Goodell said there has not been much discussion about the tush push quarterback sneak since an effort to ban it narrowly failed to pass in the spring.",
      "Vincent said the primary concern is how tough it is to officiate the maneuver that the Philadelphia Eagles have successfully executed so often. It was not on the formal agenda at this meeting, though owners did get an update on penalties and other football matters.",
      "\"It's something we will continue to monitor on all phases, just like we do every other aspect of the game,\" Goodell said. \"We don't have any proposals to bring it back up. It wouldn't surprise me if something does evolve. But it's not something we're really focused on during the season.\"",
      "Asked about replay reviews and the length of time they are taking, Goodell said game times are actually down through the first seven weeks compared to last season, despite a surge in kick returns after an adjustment was made to the so-called dynamic kickoff.",
      "\"That's quite remarkable when you add the number of kickoffs,\" Goodell said. \"You're going to get more fouls. You're going to get different sets of fouls. You're going to have a little bit (more) length of the game.\"",
      "Goodell said he had breakfast with interim Players Association executive director David White before one of the league's international games this season but expects any talk about a move to an 18-game regular season and other collective bargaining discussions to wait until the union chooses its long-term leader.",
      "The current CBA runs through the 2031 league year. White told The Associated Press last month that an 18-game season was not inevitable.",
      "\"The negotiations will be a lot more than just simply the 18 and two (exhibition games),\" Goodell said. \"There are a lot of issues that we are going to raise and I'm certain that the players will raise, and that's what it should be. That's what collective bargaining is all about. They're going to need time to make sure that they're prepared, that they're ready for the negotiations (and) they have their priorities straight, and then we can begin negotiations.\"",
      "Goodell said work is being done to choose sites for the Super Bowl to cap the 2028 and '29 seasons and expects an announcement on those next year.",

      "Introduction",
      "\"Honey, you're the third Tim Curry to call today,\" she said, and hung up the phone.",
      "It was the spring of 1976. By an extraordinary coincidence, I had recently moved into a great apartment right behind the Waverly cinema, in New York's Greenwich Village. The Waverly was the flagship of several key venues that were experiencing success with a little film called The Rocky Horror Picture Show, whose new life had only just taken off.",
      "I'd been in the stage adaptation, and we'd had an extraordinary run in London and Los Angeles. But when the film was released in 1975, it had bombed rather spectacularly. Less than a year later, it was going through a sort of renaissance, due to some genius marketing and raucous audience participation.",
      "Naturally, I was curious, however hesitant, about this new incarnation. I'd called a day ahead of time, to let them know that I was a member of the cast and to ask if they would be so kind as to reserve a few tickets for my friends and me.",
      "\"And who are you?\" the woman asked. Her accent was rather aggressive and I caught the distinct whiff of exaggerated boredom in her tone.",
      "\"This is Tim Curry.\"",
      "That was when I was informed of the previous two Tims. The receiver dinged, and the line went dead.",
      "I stared at the phone, both bemused and irate by her response. Ultimately, my friends and I showed up anyway (with identification). We didn't wear special costumes or anything like that \u2014 I'm not inclined to do so unless it's required or earned. Luckily, as much renewed success as the show was now having, it wasn't terribly difficult to get tickets. We went in and sat toward the back of the theater. I was far more interested in viewing the spectacle than in participating, and the crowd's engagement was a true delight to behold.",
      "Before long, people started noticing me. A group of girls came up to my seat, giggling, touched my arm or leg, then tittered as they dispersed. It was all rather surreal, especially with the film, the fevered audience participation, and the all-too- familiar music carrying on in the background.",
      "Unintentionally, I'd created a stir among the already animated audience. About a half hour into the film, the woman from the ticket booth of the Waverly \u2014 a slightly bedraggled, very unlikely blonde \u2014 hustled down the aisle and pulled me out of my seat.",
      "\"You are an imposter,\" she hissed. \"You must leave. You're a nightmare! And you are not Tim Curry at all \u2014 you don't even look like him!\" She pointed at the screen, her long red fingernail trembling with emphasis.",
      "I stood up slowly and, with a mixture of embarrassment and triumph (neither of which were particularly founded), I handed her my passport.",
      "She snatched it, squinted at the photo, looked back at my face, then back at the passport. In the flickering light, I watched her haughty expression collapse. Speechless, she seemed to sort of melt in front of me, evoking a wicked witch who had been assaulted by a bucket of water.",
      "Aware I was now on a stage of sorts, I steadied myself and waited for her response.",
      "\"Ohhh my God. Oh, Mr. Curry. I didn't ... Please just ... please sit down.\"",
      "I took my passport back and gestured to my friends.",
      "\"I wouldn't dream of it!\" I said, and promptly strode out of the cinema.",
      "By definition \u2014 as one who has professionally pretended or masqueraded onstage, onscreen, and into a microphone \u2014 there is an argument to be made that I have been a career imposter for most of my life.",
      "But if you ask me, there's a much better word for my vocation and identity, a word that carries me back to my earliest days.",
      "Vagabond.",
      "Vagabonds rove. We travel about and pick up work wherever we go. We wander, drift, stagger, wink. Reluctant to be pinned down, we're enticed by risk, restless if we linger, fueled by curiosity and a sense of wonder.",
      "Vagabonds learn, often from a young age, that indeed time is fleeting. As is fame \u2014 a fairly worthless pursuit, really. We are less startled by life's unpredictable shifts than those who choose to remain safe and settled. We often practice our trade in varied locations.",
      "Those of us with itinerant upbringings or similar proclivities often have no choice but to adapt and reinvent ourselves. Over and over and over again. We rely on charming exteriors and don't mind saying so, leading us to project an inflated sense of self-confidence. We feel deeply but are perhaps less inclined to express our true selves to others \u2014 because our relationships so often prove to be ephemeral.",
      "Of course, these qualities don't apply to all vagabonds. I'm not sure they'll apply to me tomorrow. But it feels about right today.",
      "In Shakespearean times, people of the stage were considered rogues and vagabonds. I always rather liked that. I presume that such labels came about because of actors assuming manifold identities, traveling from one town to the next in pursuit of new audiences and a bit of coin here and there. How can you trust somebody, or truly know somebody, who appears as a king one day and a jester the next? What does it mean when neither role is the true identity of the person, and when that very person might be gone the next day? These entertainers with ever-changing faces and varied costumes were presumed to be scoundrels, not regarded as honorable or honest members of society.",
      "That part doesn't define me, of course.",
      "I'm very trustworthy.",
      "You believe me, don't you?",
      "Over the course of my life, my vagabond blues, hopes, and highs have found their way into varied channels of expression, different creative boxes from which flashes of my real self could emerge. Through my songs. Delivered upon the stage. Exhibited on screens. Cultivated in my homes and gardens. Re-envisioned, attached to, and filtered through more voices and personas than I can recall.",
      "Much of this book has involved returning to those characters, the ones who defined my professional life. As there is a piece of me who either exists in or understands each of the roles we'll be revisiting, surveying them together will hopefully yield a colorful, curious mosaic of who I am, beneath the cosmetics and costumes.",
      "Looking in the rearview mirror is neither my instinct nor my preferred way of being. I'd rather get on with it and keep moving forward. I have never been one to dwell on past performances any more than is required. I do not snatch memorabilia from my films to keep it displayed around my house like glistening ashes. I find little reward lingering in nostalgia. Living gig to gig for the better (and worse) part of half a century, I have grown accustomed to appreciating and accepting lessons offered, then looking forward to the next challenge.",
      "That's the vagabond's way.",
      "And yet, it hasn't escaped my notice that others have jumped at the opportunity to make their own assumptions. I have been described as everything from a confounding sex symbol, to a home designer, to a rock 'n' roll singer, to an imposter, to the prince of Halloween, to a paralyzed tragic case, to a dead legend.",
      "Contrary to village gossip, I am still very much alive.",
      "So, while that remains the case, I believe it's my turn \u2014 and my privilege \u2014 to malign my own reputation.",
      "Why expose myself now? After all, I'm quite comfortable in the shade, and it would be easy enough to remain there. But with time, the thought of sharing my story stayed on my mind and felt just risky enough to intrigue me as a creative pursuit. I've also developed increasing respect for the characters I've played over the course of my life, characters about whom I've spent no small amount of time answering (and avoiding) questions.",
      "More than anything, the challenges presented to me by being alive, by the pandemic, and by sundry health issues have offered an appalling amount of time to reflect. Strewn amid those reflections has been a recurring fantastical notion: Maybe it's time to write my story. Before I could even finish musing about what that might mean, self-doubt had persistently reared up, chuckling malevolently: You've got a nerve.",
      "I'm prone to heed that voice, which has so often intervened, posing the deceptively simple question: Who do you think you are?",
      "However, as loud and obstructive as that voice has been throughout my life, generations of you (yes, you) have continued to flatter me with curiosity and kind attention. In doing so, you have given me permission to mute my self-deprecating instincts \u2014 or at least to hold them at bay.",
      "Today, I am physically unable to take you on a vigorous vagabond's adventure, due to a stroke I endured in 2012 that has limited my capacity as an active tour guide. But my mind and most of my memories have remained intact, and within them exist a multitude of journeys perhaps worth sharing. Before I can no longer be bothered to recount them, I humbly invite you into my stories of living across various environments: seaside living, country living, city living; on the road, on the stage, crossing borders and blurring them, ever in a vagabond state. I've loved inhabiting most of those settings, and \u2014 with some notable exceptions \u2014 enjoy remembering the times I've had.",
      "You should know what you're in for, however.",
      "I'd hate to leave you dissatisfied.",
      "Before we raise the curtains, before the elevator descends, know this:",
      "This will not be a master class. I have stories to impart, not explicit lessons to teach. You may glean profound takeaways from where I've been, how I got there, whom I've met, what I've done, or how I finagled my way into repeatedly being cast as an irresistible villain. Even so, my words are not meant to serve as instructions on how to act, sing, become a voiceover artist, or remain resilient in the face of unforeseen physical hardship. In part, because I do not believe that I have mastered any of those things. Furthermore, since I was a young boy, I've been dubious of anyone who claims to be an authority. Far be it for me to adopt an expert's stance now.",
      "I must also warn (or assure) you that while there are scraps of my nature in all of my characters, I am none of them. That sentence feels too ludicrously obvious to put in writing, but the distinctions between who I really am and who I've pretended to be as an actor have proven to be a source of great disappointment to some audiences. It has not caused me much personal distress, beyond the periodic necessity to deter stalkers.",
      "Nor will this be a juicy Hollywood tell-all. Not because my moral compass won't allow it, or because I haven't had ample run-ins with juicy celebrities \u2014 but simply because I find such books immensely dull and highly susceptible to gathering dust.",
      "I also won't be dishing out lurid details of my love affairs. I guarantee you, if it matters, that I have experienced true love, true heartbreak, and everything in between, including no small amount of wreckage. Which, naturally, helps inform who I am. I have loved and been loved and I hope you have, too. But I'm not interested in your romances. And specifics about my affairs of the heart or the bedroom are \u2014 respectfully \u2014 none of your f***ing business.",
      "With those caveats taken care of, I sincerely hope you enjoy the escapades, illusions, and contradictions I've collected recklessly over the course of my vagabond days.",
      "I trust you're now shivering with antici - I'll play along; I'll SAY IT - pation ...",
      "Let's get on with it.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ben-stiller-examines-the-marriage-of-his-parents-comedy-greats-jerry-stiller-anne-meara/",
    "published": "Sun, 19 Oct 2025 10:10:12 -0400",
    "summary": "After the deaths of his mother and father, actor-director Ben Stiller sought to pay tribute as few sons could: a documentary about their lives on-stage and off. But even he didn't anticipate to what depths his film, \"Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost,\" would go.",
    "story": [
      "A-List actor and director Ben Stiller knows a good story when he sees one, so he knew profiling his late parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, would be compelling. But even he had no idea how deep it would take him. \"No, I didn't!\" he laughed. \"I mean, I didn't know where it was gonna go.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara had been the husband-and-wife comedy team of the 1960s and '70s, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" 36 times. But for Ben and sister Amy, Stiller & Meara were also Mom & Dad \u2013 and that could get confusing.",
      "Stiller's new Apple TV documentary, \"Stiller & Meara\" Nothing Is Lost,\" examines how his parents navigated both roles.",
      "Married 62 years, their family life was shaped by Jerry's relentless ambition, and Anne's resentment doing comedy when her dream was to be a serious actress \u2013 and the drinking that followed. As Ben noted in his film, \"She had to go up there and do that act, because she was so good at it. But it wasn't really her true thing, you know? It wasn't her true happiness.\"",
      "The film is an adult's attempt to answer the complicated question that shaped his childhood: Where did the act end, and the marriage begin?",
      "In one archival interview, Jerry Stiller calls his wife \"the funniest woman in the world off stage and on stage. Now the thing is, when she does these funny things, I am an exploiter and opportunist, and I'll take a pencil and I'll start to write it down.\"",
      "Anne Meara picks up: \"He says we can use that on a show, and I'm ready to kill him! Again, where does the act end and the marriage begin?\"",
      "Ben Stiller said, \"There's so much footage and material and things to show of the good and the bad and the tension and the happy times. I felt it was really important to try to have a balance in the film that would relay to the audience what the reality was of their relationship, which was, I think, grounded in love.\"",
      "From 2010: Stiller & Meara on love and marriage (\"Sunday Morning\")",
      "It wasn't just old clips from long-ago shows that Stiller had access to. He stumbled into some unexpected help while cleaning out the family apartment to sell: Jerry Stiller had secretly taped everything, producing boxes and boxes of recordings. \"I had no idea that there were these sort of arguments and discussions that he had recorded,\" said Ben. \"All of it, I'd never heard before. It brought me back to being a kid in the house when they were working together.\"",
      "For a filmmaker trying to figure it all out, Ben Stiller had struck gold.",
      "Among the recordings was a conversation in which his father talks to his mother about her drinking, and confronts her about it.",
      "I asked, \"Was it important to you in terms of understanding your dad, that you could hear him do that?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ben. \"I was like, 'Oh, okay. He really did speak to her about it.' Because as kids that was never anything we talked about.\"",
      "\"You may be carrying around this sense of, why didn't dad ever confront mom? Guess what \u2013 he did.\"",
      "\"Right! He did,\" said Ben. \"And it changed.\"",
      "This deconstruction of his parents' marriage came while Stiller was wrestling with his own mid-life issues. Separated at the time from his wife, actress Christine Taylor (with whom he later reconciled), Stiller describes himself as having felt out of balance and unhappy, disconnected from his family, and a little bit lost.",
      "He talked about the irony of thinking he was doing so much better than his parents: \"When you're younger, you think, Okay, I'm gonna do everything better. I'm not gonna make THAT mistake. I found myself at a place in my life where things weren't really in sync.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara now had some company under the magnifying glass: their son. \"I didn't want to pretend to be some sort of objective judge of their relationship when I had so many issues in my own relationships and my stuff,\" he said,",
      "Was that a challenging journey to make himself? \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Then it changed everything because it was like, oh, okay. I'm gonna have to, you know, talk about my own feelings! It's stuff that I don't really ever, you know, talk about.\"",
      "Not exactly where he expected to end up, when he started the project. In honest, raw, and revealing conversations with his daughter Ella and son Quin, Ben talked in the film about his own issues being the child of someone famous: \"I remember there was this one time I literally was on the street talking to him about the fact that I felt like he didn't pay enough attention to us, and while we were talking someone on the street came over and said, 'Jerry, I love you work' and he started talking [to them]!\"",
      "Stiller exposes the excruciating challenge of breaking patterns, when his son adds: \"That's hilarious, because just a few weeks ago we were all out at a restaurant and I'd been stressed about college stuff. And then the people there wanted to get a picture of you, and I remember I was so frustrated, like, the world just has to stop to get this picture.\"",
      "Stiller said, \"I was genuinely surprised when he told me that. As a filmmaker I thought, This is an interesting moment in the movie.\"",
      "\"As a father?\" I asked.",
      "\"As a father I was like, Oh, s***,\" he laughed.",
      "Ben Stiller has done something requiring more courage than simply making an honest movie about loved ones; he's made an honest movie about himself.",
      "I said, \"One of the most uncomfortable places you can ever be is the mirror, right? Sometimes your kids are holding up the mirror.\"",
      "\"Yeah, you know, it's kind of like \u2026 it is a bummer, 'cause I'm never gonna get to go back, you know?\" Stiller said.",
      "And that's helped him round the edges from his own childhood \u2013 finding the grace to give his parents by understanding he might need to seek some of his own.",
      "Asked where he stands in his relationship to his parents, Stiller replied, \"I don't know!\"",
      "\"All this work, and you don't know?\"",
      "\"Well, I mean, they're still not here. That was the sad thing for me about finishing the movie. It was like, Oh, now I don't have an excuse to kind of just be connecting with them here.\"",
      "I asked, \"This was an intense reconnection when it sounds like you needed it the most?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Stiller. \"Like my mom probably would have said, like, 'Yeah, go make a movie about it if you wanna figure out how to process your feelings!'\"",

    "summary": "The star of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" \"Clue\" and \"It\" has played roles campy, comical, and menacingly sinister, yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry. He talks about his memoir \"Vagabond,\" the stroke he suffered in 2012, and learning how to speak again.",
    "story": [
      "A stroke 13 years ago left Tim Curry partially paralyzed, but it hasn't diminished his memorable laugh, or the mystique about him. In 50 years on the screen, he's played so many types \u2013 campy, comical, menacingly sinister \u2013 yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry.",
      "And being an enigma is exactly how he wants it. \"I think it's important,\" he said. \"I encourage it.\"",
      "Though Curry is out with a new memoir, \"Vagabond\" (to be published Tuesday by Grand Central), he's keeping some secrets to himself. \"One of the keys is to not encourage an identity, I think, and I've tried to nurse that,\" he said. \"I have protected that, and continue to.\"",
      "Born a military brat in Hong Kong, Curry grew up moving from place to place. As a boy, he worshipped his dad, a chaplain in the British Royal Navy. The last time he saw his father, when he was 10, was when his dad had a stroke: \"And as they were about to take him into the ambulance, he said, 'Look after your mother.'\"",
      "After his father's death, there was no one to buffer the impact of his mother, who would be kind one minute, then cruel the next. \"I actually think now that she was probably bipolar, because she could turn on a dime,\" Curry said.",
      "Acting offered him an escape from his mother's moods \u2013 and access to so different many different lives. He said what excited him about acting was \"the freedom of being somebody else, and I think that I was (like everybody else) drawn to the idea of fame probably, although I came to kind of rather despise it.\"",
      "His first nibble of notoriety came from his first paid gig, in the 1969 London production of \"Hair.\" It was a big deal, but nothing in comparison to what came next: \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" first on stage, then the movie. He joked that he got the part of Dr. Frank-N-Furter because of his legs. It was a transformative performance, for Curry, and the audience.",
      "Curry says what made the role unique was his power: \"He gave a lot of teenagers permission to be different, and I'm very happy that he did have that power.\"",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" earned Curry stardom. It did not earn praise, or even respect, from his mother. She lived well into her son's success, but \"she didn't make much of it,\" Curry said. \"She was scared of it.\"",
      "Why? \"Well, she said to me later that, 'I thought your head was gonna grow too big.' She would have preferred me to operate under the radar!\"",
      "He laughed: \"I never did. I didn't give a s*** about the radar!\"",
      "I asked, \"When Frank is committing his particularly most heinous act in 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' [killing Eddie with an axe], was some of that directed at your mom maybe?\"",
      "\"It's not directed at her, it's just channeling,\" Curry replied.",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" set up Curry to play some memorable screen villains \u2013 under a mountain of prosthetics in \"Legend,\" opposite Tom Cruise; as Pennywise in the Stephen King thriller \"It\"; and as Carol Burnett's scheming and duplicitous brother in \"Annie.\" \"I loved her to bits,\" Curry said of Burnett.",
      "And don't forget the hotel concierge in \"Home Alone 2,\" and the manipulative butler in \"Clue.\"",
      "But then came 2012, and the moment that changed Tim Curry's life. \"It was so strange,\" he said. \"I was actually having a massage, and the guy who was giving me a massage said, 'I'm worried about you. I think we should call a doctor.' I felt fine. I had no symptoms that I was aware of. I wasn't in pain.\"",
      "But he was taken to the hospital, where he learned he'd had a stroke. \"I though immediately of my dad. So, I was scared,\" he said.",
      "He then underwent invasive brain surgery, and had rehabilitation to learn how to speak again. \"That was very weird,\" he said. \"I hated not being able to speak.\"",
      "He also has paralysis on his left side. \"My face kind of went sideways,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"From reading the book, and from talking to the people here who care about you, there hasn't been a lot \u2013 I'm sure there was some self-pity, but it doesn't sound like there was a lot?\"",
      "\"I don't think so,\" Curry said. \"I hope not, because I don't admire self-pity much. Another legacy from my mother, I guess. It's one that I'm thankful for: Why are you so important that we have to pity you?\"",
      "Now 79, he's reached an age he didn't think he'd see back in 2012. Today, he's not remotely afraid of dying \u2013 though exactly what he means remains, fittingly, a mystery.",
      "\"I don't fear death,\" he said. \"I try to avoid it, as I think we all do! But I suspect that in the end, I will welcome it.\"",
      "And what does that mean? \"Well, I think it may be very comforting to go bye-bye \u2013 and I want to earn it!\" he laughed.",

    "summary": "Britain's Prince Andrew will not use his royal titles any longer, he said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Britain's Prince Andrew will not use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, any longer, he said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Friday. The announcement comes after the release of excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had repeatedly claimed to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to Andrew.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "He continued: \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, sued Andrew in 2021, alleging that he forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will when she was 17 years old. The two reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Guiffre's family said they believe Prince Andrew's decision to give up his royal titles is \"vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere.\" They called on Charles to strip him of the title of prince.",
      "\"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me,'\" the statement said. \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"",
      "Giuffre was one of the most vocal accusers of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of helping Epstein groom, recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Giuffre alleged Maxwell connected her with Epstein, which Maxwell denies.",
      "In an excerpt of her memoir published by The Guardian, Giuffre describes her alleged encounters with Andrew in detail.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\"",
      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has long been a source of tabloid fodder because of his links to Epstein, other questionable characters and money woes.",
      "His attempt to refute Giuffre's allegations backfired during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals \u2014 such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring \u2014 and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.",
      "Within days of the interview, Andrew stepped down from his royal duties.",
      "As well as no longer being known as the Duke of York, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.",
      "He will remain a prince, which he has been entitled to since birth.",

    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "With open enrollment starting soon, employees could get sticker shock, with their costs expected to rise 6% to 7% for 2026, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "Open enrollment \u2014 the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits \u2014 may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from consultant Mercer.",
      "That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24.",

      "Jill Hornick, a 59-year-old service representative at a Social Security Administration field office in Illinois, would normally have received her latest paycheck on Friday. Instead, she was last paid on Oct. 10 \u2014 for three days less than she had worked.",
      "Hornick is defined as an essential worker and continues to report to the office on a daily basis during the government shutdown. She said she doesn't have time to search for a second job and isn't eligible for unemployment benefits. Because of the stalemate in Congress, now in its 24th day, Hornick also has no clue on when the next paycheck will arrive.",
      "\"It's very annoying that employees who are furloughed can collect unemployment, but employees who are essential and have to work without pay cannot collect unemployment,\" Hornick told CBS News. \"And yet I am showing up on my own dime because we still have to pay money to put gas in the car, pay the daycare center, because they are not going to take kids for free.\"",

      "Hornick, whose annual income is about $75,000 a year, is now scrambling to stay afloat. That means paring her spending and contacting her mortgage lender and other creditors to ask for lenience.",
      "\"I got a letter from mortgage company saying I was approved for deferred payment and that they wouldn't take foreclosure action against me,\" she said, although she remains anxious about what the future will bring.",

      "\"It's something we were considering anyway with the economy going the way it is, but it's much more urgent now. It's important to hunker down,\" apGovannon said.",
      "Asked if he would consider leaving the federal government for the private sector, apGovannon, who has been in his current role since 2019, said he is \"in it for the long haul.\" But he can appreciate why some colleagues might want to leave government service.",
      "\"lt's hard to say to younger people, 'Hey, come work for us \u2014 you never know if you're going to be fired or not.'\" apGovannon told CBS News. \"Their perception is that government work, which was once safe, no longer is.\"",

    "summary": "Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment is aimed at helping the program's 75 million beneficiaries keep pace with inflation.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration on Friday announced a 2.8%\u00a0cost-of-living adjustment for 2026, an increase that will automatically boost monthly payments for the program's roughly 71 million beneficiaries starting early next year.",
      "The increase represents an uptick from the last year's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, which set the 2025 increase at 2.5%. Inflation has edged higher this year. The Labor Department said Friday that the Consumer Price Index, a closely watched gauge of U.S. inflation, rose at an annual rate of 3% in September.",
      "Next year's COLA increase will boost the average Social Security payment by about $56 to an average monthly benefit of $2,071, starting in January, the Social Security Administration said. People who receive Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income and disabled people, will see their first COLA increase with their Dec. 31, 2025 check, the agency said.",
      "The annual COLA is designed to ensure that seniors, disabled Americans and other Social Security beneficiaries don't lose purchasing power to inflation. Even so, a recent poll by the AARP, an advocacy group for older Americans, found that many seniors think the retirement program's inflation adjustments are falling short and that they need an annual COLA of about 5% to keep up with their daily expenses.",
      "\"The cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security is one of the few inflation-adjusted programs for retirees,\" Jenn Jones, AARP's vice president of government affairs, told CBS News. \"It is incredibly important to millions of Americans, and so although it may not feel like it's quite enough, especially after the last few years, it's critically helpful for keeping pace with rising costs.\"",
      "In a statement, Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano said the cost-of-living adjustment \"is one way we are working to make sure benefits reflect today's economic realities and continue to provide a foundation of security.\"",
      "How SSA calculates its annual COLA",
      "The Social Security Administration announces the COLA each fall based on a metric known as the \"Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers,\" or\u00a0CPI-W, which tracks the average change in prices paid by workers for a basket of commonly bought goods and services.",
      "The COLA is based on that inflation data from July through September.",
      "Some advocates for older Americans say the CPI-W fails to accurately reflect seniors' financial needs because it tracks younger workers, while retirees tend to face higher costs for health care, housing and some other items. Seniors on Medicare, the health insurance program for those over 65, spend 13.6% of their income on health-related expenses, more than double that of younger people, according to KFF.",
      "Meanwhile, poverty is on the rise among America's seniors, with the poverty rate among seniors rising to 15% last year, up from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to recent Census data. The AARP said more older adults are struggling with the rising cost of housing and utility costs.",
      "\"Most Social Security beneficiaries aren't working \u2014 you are on a fixed income, so any inflation increase you feel,\" Jones said. \"If the increases continue, it becomes difficult to figure out how you're going to pay for all of your monthly expenses.\"",
      "How Medicare costs could impact benefits",
      "Advocates for senior citizens say the COLA is likely to fall short, especially given forecasts for increases in Medicare's premiums and deductibles for 2026. The Medicare premium is taken directly from seniors' Social Security checks.",
      "While Medicare hasn't yet announced its 2026 premiums, its trustees report issued earlier this year projected that the standard monthly premium for Part B \u2014 which covers doctors visits and outpatient care \u2014 would likely rise to $206.50, or a 12% boost from its current rate. Deductibles are also projected to rise about 12% next year, the report said.",
      "The result: Seniors could see most of their 2026 COLA eaten up by higher Medicare costs, the National Council on Aging said in a statement.",
      "\"COLA might reflect the inflation rate, but it is woefully insufficient for older Americans who already have high health care costs and are facing even greater increases in their Medicare costs in 2026,\" Ramsey Alwin, CEO of the NCA, said in the statement.",
      "Seniors are likely to be disappointed by the 2026 COLA, which represents the second-smallest bump since 2021. Many are at risk of falling behind, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group.",
      "The Consumer Price Index for September, also released on Friday, showed that medical and elderly care costs are surpassing the 3% annualized pace of inflation. Costs for caring for the elderly at home jumped 11.6% last month on an annual basis, while medical services rose 3.9%.",
      "\"Seniors on fixed incomes are rightly concerned that the Social Security COLA is not keeping pace with the true impact of inflation on their living costs, especially in areas where prices are soaring.\u00a0 Medical, housing and grocery costs are outstripping the COLA,\" Max Richtman, the group's CEO, said in a statement.",

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",

    "summary": "A lapse in funding due to the shutdown could have a devastating effect on the millions of Americans who rely on the federal food stamps program for groceries.",
    "story": [
      "States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.",
      "\"Starting October 16, SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA,\" reads a\u00a0notice from the Pennsylvania state website.",
      "New Jersey,\u00a0Maryland, New York and\u00a0Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.",
      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program.",
      "Advocates and SNAP recipients have warned the effects of being cut off from nutrition assistance could be devastating.",
      "Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger, said delayed SNAP benefits would mean individuals have to make extreme choices such as whether to pay their rent or feed their kids. Many recipients, she said, are living paycheck to paycheck and that's the reason they depend on SNAP.",
      "According to the USDA, 73% of SNAP recipients had a gross monthly income at or below 100% of the poverty level in fiscal year 2023.",
      "While the majority of beneficiaries are not expected to work while on SNAP, primarily because they are children, older adults or disabled people, most SNAP participants who can work do so, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute, said in an April report.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "That could be an issue for SNAP recipients like Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident who receives around $260 a month in SNAP benefits. Powers said she'll be OK if benefits don't come through in November, but a longer delay would force her to change how she shops. The fresh produce she buys to keep a healthy diet would no longer be in her budget, she said.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Powers told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on plans under consideration.",

      "In a separate move Thursday, the United States Conference of Mayors, a nonpartisan organization that represents mayors in over 1,000 cities, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, calling on the USDA to use \"all available resources, including the SNAP contingency fund\" to prevent SNAP benefits from being delayed.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cpi-report-inflation-september-2025-forecast-social-security-cola/",
    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 10:34:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists think inflation around the U.S. continued to climb in September, edging\u00a0farther away from the Fed's 2% annual target.",
    "story": [
      "A delayed inflation report on Friday is expected to deliver sobering data about the direction of U.S. prices, with economists forecasting that the Consumer Price Index in September rose at its fastest pace in 16 months.",
      "CPI last month is projected to have risen 3.1% on an annual basis, which would be the highest since the inflation gauge hit 3.3% in May of 2024, according to economists polled by FactSet. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the September CPI report on Friday at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time, or nine days later than it had originally been scheduled to issue the report before the U.S. government shutdown.",
      "Most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the stalemate. The Department of Labor is making an exception for the September CPI data because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "Inflation has crept higher this year, edging farther away from the Federal Reserve's annual 2% target, partly due to the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, according to economists. U.S. companies that import goods from other nations are on the hook for paying the tariffs, and they are passing on as much as 55% of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis.",
      "\"The forthcoming September CPI data will confirm a renewed acceleration in inflation, with price momentum evident across both goods and services,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco predicted Thursday a research note. \"The tariff impact is increasingly visible, though pass-through remains gradual and uneven.\"",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June of 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and spurred the Federal Reserve to ratchet up interest rates in a bid to quash inflation. When borrowing becomes more expensive, consumers and businesses tend to cut back on spending, which helps temper inflation.",
      "But the recent uptick in inflation is souring some Americans on the economy, with 59% of those\u00a0polled by CBS News earlier this month saying they feel the economy is getting worse. About two-thirds said they had noticed prices going up in recent weeks.",
      "How will inflation impact the Social Security COLA?",
      "The Social Security Administration on Friday is also expected to release its annual cost-of-living adjustment, basing its calculation on the inflation rate from July through September.",
      "That yearly financial bump, which ensures that 75 million Social Security recipients don't lose purchasing power as prices rise, is expected to come in at around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025, according to the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group.",
      "A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly Social Security payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062. Yet some advocates for senior citizens are concerned that retirees could face a financial pinch if prices continue to climb beyond their 2026 Social Security adjustment.",
      "What's the inflation outlook?",
      "Despite the recent rise in consumer prices, the Federal Reserve and most private economists expect inflation to ease next year. In September, the Fed forecast\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures \u2014 a measure of consumer spending and the central bank's preferred barometer of inflation \u2014 would show prices rising at a 3% annual rate in 2025, but then drop to 2.6% next year.",
      "The impact of U.S. tariffs on inflation has been more muted than what many economists were forecasting earlier this year, Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email. Companies have helped blunt the impact by expanding their inventories before the tariffs took effect, as well as absorbing some of the costs in the form of lower profits, she said.",
      "But there's a risk those strategies might not work for long, she added.",
      "\"As inventories deplete, trade routes narrow and margins continue to shrink, firms may be forced to pass on higher costs to consumers,\" she wrote. \"As such, upside risks remain. If pricing pressures spill over into services, it could signal a broader and more persistent inflationary trend.\"",

      "The Consumer Price Index climbed at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in below economists' forecasts as the impact of President Trump's tariffs remain muted.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet had forecast CPI rose at a 3.1% annual clip last month. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",

That's because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "What economists say",
      "Inflation is inching higher partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, according to economists. U.S. businesses are eating some of the costs in the form of lower profits, which has blunted the impact of the import duties on consumers.",
      "Still, companies are also passing on\u00a0as much as 55%\u00a0of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis. Other research shows a lower rate of passthrough tariff costs to shoppers.",
      "\"Tariffs have put upward pressure on prices, particularly in the goods-producing sector of the economy,\" Brandon Zureick, senior managing director and chief economist at investment firm Johnson Investment Counsel, told CBS News. \"We're definitely a little higher than where we started the year, and above the Fed's target\" of 2% annual inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a tool for protecting U.S. manufacturing, as well as to convince businesses to reshore their factories within the country, and for generating billions of new federal revenue.",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and set the Federal Reserve on a path of hiking interest rates. Higher borrowing costs can temper inflation because it makes loans and credit cards more expensive, which can cause consumers and businesses to pare spending.",
      "What does the CPI mean for interest rates?",
      "The recent rise in inflation is complicating the Fed's decision on interest rates, with the central bank scheduled to make its next rate decision on Oct. 29. But today's inflation data could provide additional support for another cut, analysts said Friday.",
      "\"There was little in today's benign CPI report to 'spook' the Fed and we continue to expect further easing at next week's Fed meeting,\" Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a Friday email. \"A December rate cut also remains likely with the current data drought providing the Fed with little reason to deviate from the path set out in the dot plot.\"",
      "Still, inflation is edging higher, which could be an argument for keeping rates steady. But at the same time, the job market is experiencing a\u00a0sharp slowdown in hiring, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited last month when the central bank made its first rate cut of 2025. Lower borrowing costs can help support the job market by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow, encouraging them to expand and hire.",
      "That means the combination of rising inflation and weakening job growt is putting the Fed's dual mandate \u2014 to keep both inflation and unemployment low \u2014 in conflict. Powell said earlier this month that the risks posed by the labor market may be outweighing concerns about rising inflation.",
      "\"The Fed has recognized the trends in the labor market as changing their directives,\" Zureick said. \"We've been dangerously close to a zero level of job growth for a few months.\"",
      "Given the Fed's focus on the labor market risks, the higher CPI rate isn't likely to derail expectations for a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's next meeting later this month, economists say.",
      "The probability of a 0.25-percentage point cut at the Fed's Oct. 29 meeting is pegged at 98.9%, according to CME FedWatch.",

The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",

The Office of Management and Budget estimated that a 2013 U.S. government shutdown cost $2 billion in lost worker productivity.",

    "story": [
      "Turkeys aren't known for flying but their prices are soaring ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A September outlook report from the United States Agriculture Department estimates that wholesale prices for frozen turkeys will be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from 2024's\u00a0average of $0.94 per pound.",
      "The wholesale price is what retailers pay to buy items in bulk. Retailers then decide how much they want to charge consumers.",
      "The reason the birds \u2014 traditionally the centerpiece at the Thanksgiving table \u2014 are getting more expensive comes down to supply. The number of available turkeys has shrunk in recent years amid slightly weakened demand and avian flu outbreaks, according to USDA\u00a0data.",
      "More than 3 million turkeys have been impacted by bird flu outbreaks this year, including over half a million this month alone, USDA data shows.",
      "That translates to less turkeys: USDA forecasts that farmers raised around 195 million turkeys in 2025 compared with 200 million in 2024, a 3% decrease. To be sure, the number of turkeys in supply has been sliding over the last decade. In 2016, farmers raised around 245 million turkeys, roughly 50 million more than today's supply.",
      "Deals abound",
      "Amid the rise in wholesale turkey prices, several companies are floating deals in an attempt to win over budget-conscious customers.",
      "Walmart announced Tuesday that it is offering Butterball turkeys for $0.97 per pound this year. The retailer also said its 10-person meal deal will cost under $4 per person. Grocery chain Aldi has\u00a0offered a similar deal, at $40 for 10 people.",
      "\"Retailers typically use turkeys as a loss leader,\" David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, told CBS News. \"That is, they price them very competitively \u2014 sometimes even below cost \u2014 to draw shoppers into stores ahead of Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Both deals represent a decrease in the average cost for a Thanksgiving meal from 2024, which was $58 for 10 people, according to a\u00a0report from the American Farm Bureau Federation. Frozen turkeys that year accounted for a large share of Americans' holiday grocery bill, at an average retail cost of $25 for a 16-pound bird.",
      "Despite the surge in wholesale turkey prices in 2025, Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation\u00a0 doesn't expect consumer prices to increase much.",
      "\"We see that uptick right now in the wholesale price by about 40%, so we'll definitely see some price increases there, but I don't think they're going to go a whole lot higher above where they are at,\" he said on a Farm Bureau podcast.",
      "\"Higher wholesale prices for turkeys are likely to translate into somewhat higher prices at the grocery store, but the increase consumers see will probably be smaller than what's happening upstream,\" Ortega explained.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-refund-2025-2026-one-big-beautiful-bill/",
    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:10:49 -0400",
    "summary": "New tax cuts in the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act are retroactive to 2025, which means many Americans may get bigger refunds in early 2026. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans could see heftier tax refunds next year when they file their 2025 tax returns, largely due to new provisions enacted through the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act that are retroactive to the start of the current year, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "Total taxpayer savings could amount to an additional $50 billion through bigger tax refunds or a cut in their 2026 taxes, Oxford lead economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in the Oct. 21 report.",
      "A $50 billion boost in tax refunds would represent an 18% increase from the $275 billion in refunds the IRS sent this year to nearly 94 million taxpayers who overpaid on their 2024 federal tax returns, according to data\u00a0from the agency. The average refund in 2025 was $2,939, according to the IRS.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill,\" signed into law by Mr. Trump in July, extended the tax reductions enacted under th 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But the new law also added an array of new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income. It also lifted the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000, a change that is expected to primarily help higher-income Americans.",
      "Although the tax changes are effective this year, the IRS hasn't yet updated its\u00a0withholding tables, which provide guidance to employers on how much in federal tax to withhold from their employees' paychecks, Vanden Houten wrote. As a result, many taxpayers are unlikely to have taken the step of lowering their withholding amounts on their own, she noted.",
      "\"[M]any taxpayers will pay too much in tax this year and see larger tax refunds or smaller tax bills next year than otherwise would be the case,\" Vanden Houten said, adding that will likely produce a \"windfall at tax time in 2026 through larger refunds and lower tax bills.\"",
      "The Oxford analysis doesn't estimate the average size of individual tax refunds next year, but it noted that a \"disproportionate share of the benefits will accrue to upper-income households.\"",
      "That echoes earlier analyses from tax specialists who said that higher-income Americans are likely to see a bigger relative boost from the new tax law compared with lower-income households. For instance, $6 of every $10 in new tax breaks from the \"big, beautiful bill\" will go to the top 20% of households, or people with incomes over $217,000 per year, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis published in July.",
      "Wealthy households also will benefit from the higher SALT cap, which can only be tapped by tax filers who itemize \u2014 typically high-income households with sizable deductions that surpass the standard deduction. That boost from the bigger SALT break will deliver an extra $5.1 billion in total tax savings, Oxford estimated.",
      "Seniors are also likely to enjoy a bigger tax refund in early 2026, with the new $6,000 deduction for people over 65 years old under the \"big, beautiful bill\" providing as much as $9.3 billion in tax savings, the Oxford estimated.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:15:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Financial pros recommend waiting as long as possible to claim your Social Security benefits. Most Americans say they're ignoring that advice.",
    "story": [
      "Nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore one of the most common pieces of financial advice about Social Security: waiting until age 70 to claim benefits, which ensures higher monthly payments, according to a new study from investment firm Schroders.",
      "Social Security allows employees to claim their benefits as soon as they turn 62, years before the so-called \"full retirement age,\" which now stands at 67. But claiming Social Security early has a tradeoff \u2014 it lowers your monthly payment by about 30%, with those lower benefits locked in for the rest of your life.",
      "By contrast, delaying Social Security until age 70 results in a roughly 24% higher monthly payment than if you claimed benefits at age 67 \u2014 also locked in as long you're collecting benefits. As a result, financial experts often recommend that seniors hold off as long as they can, with one study finding that filing early for benefits can cost $182,000 in foregone payments.",
      "The Schroders survey\u00a0suggests that many Americans who haven't yet retired aren't buying that advice. In the survey of 1,500 adults, most respondents said they understand the trade-offs of claiming early, but only 10% plan to wait until age 70, while 44% expect to file for benefits before they reach full retirement age.",
      "Social Security provides an online calculator that lets users plug in their birthdate, then calculate the percentage difference in their monthly payment based on the age at which they plan to claim the retirement benefit.",
      "Another\u00a0new study, released Tuesday by the Allianz Center for the Future of Retirement, finds that a majority of Americans say they don't know much about Social Security or how it will fit into their retirement plan. And about 1 in 5 believe Social Security will provide all the retirement income they need, even though it generally replaces only 40% of a worker's wages when they retire, the study found.",
      "\"Not an oversight\"",
      "The disconnect illustrates the financial reality facing most workers, Deb Boyden, head of U.S. defined contribution at Schroders, told CBS News.",
      "\"The decision to sacrifice extra Social Security income is not an oversight for most Americans,\" she said. \"According to our research, 70% of Americans are aware that waiting longer to claim Social Security leads to higher payments, and yet so few are willing to hold off.\"",
      "Many retirees are facing a shortfall in their own retirement savings, a financial gap that's been well documented as a growing share of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Many workers \"need the income generated by Social Security to meet their expenses immediately upon retiring,\" Boyden noted.",
      "Why many seniors start Social Security early",
      "While the advice to wait as long as possible to claim Social Security makes financial sense, it also doesn't fully account for people's individual needs and circumstances. Many older adults claim benefits early out of financial necessity, while others may do so because health issues or chronic conditions lead them to expect a shorter-than-average lifespan.",
      "Some seniors also weigh the so-called break-even point \u2014 the age at which the total money you've collected from starting benefits early equals what you would have collected if you had delayed claiming Social Security in oder to get a higher monthly check. In other words, someone who starts collecting at 62 will have banked eight years of benefits, as opposed to claiming at age 70.",
      "Based on today's average monthly Social Security benefit of $2,000, that early claimer would receive a reduced benefit of about $1,400 a month. Over the following eight years, that would amount to $134,400 in total benefits received by the time the person started collecting Social Security at age 70.",
      "By filing for benefits at 70, that individual would receive a monthly payment $2,480, but it would take 10.4 years for the extra amount in their monthly payment to surpass the $134,400 that an early filer collected in the prior eight years. That makes the break-even age about 80.4 years old.",
      "The upshot: Some seniors, especially those with health issues, might decide they're unlikely to reach that break-even age and opt to have money in their pockets earlier rather than waiting to start collecting Social Security.",
      "The average life expectancy for a 62-year-old man today is an additional 22 years, or about age 83.6, while a woman the same age is expected to live to around 86.5, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "Concerns about Social Security's future",
      "There's another reason why many Americans plan on claiming their Social Security benefits before reaching full retirement age, she added. That's due to concerns about the future of Social Security, which is fueling concerns that \"the money may not be there if they wait,\" Boyden said.",
      "Social Security is indeed facing a financial crunch, with an aging U.S. population resulting in its payments now outpacing contributions from workers. Without changes to the program, that will result in its trust funds becoming insolvent by 2034, according to the most recent calculation from the Social Security Board of Trustees.",
      "Yet many people wrongly believe that means Social Security will halt payments if the trust funds become insolvent. Payments would continue in such an event, but benefits would be reduced by about 20% \u2014 a potentially major financial hit to the program's more than 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "Still, there are ways lawmakers can shore up the program, such as by raising the income cap on Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100, according to experts. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "In the meantime, non-retired Americans told Schroders they believe they need $5,032 in monthly income to retire comfortably. But today's retirees on average generate about $3,250 in monthly retirement income, Boyden said, adding that the gap signals the need to help workers plan better for retirement.",
      "A recent analysis from Goldman Sachs found three-quarters of younger working Americans say they're struggling to save for retirement because basic expenses such as housing are eating up a bigger share of their income compared with prior generations.",

      "Guidance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) clarifies that a $100,000 fee imposed in September to obtain H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers applies only to new applicants who are living abroad.",
      "In a notice\u00a0posted\u00a0on the agency's website late Monday, USCIS explains what types of visa applicants must pay the new six-figure fee and who is exempt. Applications for H-1B visas filed on or after Sept. 21 for workers outside the U.S. and who are not current H-1B visa holders are subject to the $100,000 charge, USCIS said.",
      "The fee also applies if a petition filed on or after Sept. 21 \"requests consular notification, port of entry notification or pre-flight inspection for an alien in the United States.\"",
      "The $100,000 payment must be paid prior to applying for an H-1B visa, according to USCIS.",
      "Importantly for employers, the fee does not apply when a visa applicant files to move from one type of visa to another, such as from an F-1 visa for non-U.S. students to H-1B status.",
      "The White House had previously said the fee would apply to all new H-1B visa applicants, with exemptions for some specialized workers who do not \"pose a threat to the security or welfare\" of the U.S.",
      "In announcing the new H-1B policy on Sept. 19, President Trump said the new fee was necessary \"to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers.\" He also said some employers take advantage of the visa program to undercut U.S. workers' wages by hiring lower-paid foreign workers.",
      "The Trump administration has said the $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will compel U.S. companies to hire Americans, instead of relying on labor from overseas. Many economists, however, expect mixed results.",
      "In the short term, some U.S. technology workers could see their job prospects improve, as employers turn away from foreign labor because of the hefty fee attached. Other research, however, such as a 2024\u00a0study\u00a0on the impact of U.S. immigration on employment, from the nonprofit IZA Institute of Labor Economics, found that H-1B workers actually \"help firms increase their employment,\" and that every H-1B worker a company hired helped produce additional job gains, which includes domestic hires.",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the Trump administration over the foreign worker visa fee, calling it unlawful. It was the second complaint to be filed challenging the fee, with a coalition of health care groups and labor unions also challenging the policy's legality in a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed in October.",

      "\"Frankly, many customers may have been unaware that a service they used relied upon AWS and are only learning that now, due to system failures,\" said Craig Shue, a professor and the head of the computer science department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.",
      "As Shue explained, companies that are not technology-centric may seek out a cloud service like AWS to host their web servers and databases, allowing them to focus on their day-to-day operations. Amazon, meanwhile,\u00a0 handles the more technical aspects such as server maintenance and responses to fluctuations in customer demand, he added.",
      "Amazon declined to comment directly on the incident, instead sharing a statement from their\u00a0website\u00a0published on Oct. 20.",
      "How the AWS outage started",
      "The outage started Monday morning in Northern Virginia, home to AWS' oldest and biggest cloud computing hub in the U.S. AWS refers to the cluster of data centers in Virginia as US-EAST-1. The company also has cloud computing hubs in California, Ohio and Oregon.",
      "According to expert accounts and Amazon's own\u00a0explanation, the issue was partially tied to AWS' domain name system (DNS) servers. As Shue explained, this is the part of the internet that takes domain names like Amazon.com and converts them to IP addresses, numerical labels that identify locations on the internet.",
      "The service can be used to distribute traffic to multiple servers to make things faster, Shue said.",
      "\"It is akin to waiting in a checkout line that then splits off to multiple cashier lanes,\" Shue explained. \"A staff member can direct the customer at the front of the line to the first available server that can handle the job.\"",
      "This function was disrupted on Monday, leading to a backlog of server requests without anything to route them. It's still unclear how the disruption began, experts said.",
      "For people on the ground, this meant they were unable to carry out simple web-based functions like checking their flight time on an airline app or sending a payment on Venmo.",
      "While the issue started in the eastern U.S. region, its effects were global. Experts say it's difficult to quantify the impact in dollar figures. McCarthy, however, noted that it appears to be one of the most significant outages in recent years.",
      "Amazon said that the issue was resolved around 6 p.m. EDT on Monday, or more than 15 hours after the company first reported a problem on the AWS Health Dashboard, where it tracks service disruptions.",
      "\"This wasn't a minor glitch; it was a cascading failure originating in US-EAST-1, the very nerve center of AWS, which took down everything from gaming and social media to critical financial and educational platforms,\" he said.",
      "Will the outage impact AWS?",
      "While the incident may have sparked a small reckoning with cloud services, it's not expected to shake up the landscape too much, experts told CBS News.",
      "McCarthy doesn't expect the outage to lead to a mass exodus of AWS customers, but he said it could compel companies to diversify their cloud services so they're not reliant on a single provider. That way if one goes down, the company can still keep some operations going.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "There are many big names in a group of unlikely allies seeking a ban, for now, on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says, \"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\"",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\"",

      "OpenAI said Tuesday it is launching an artificial intelligence-powered website browser, heightening the company's competition with Google, the Alphabet-owned unit that has long dominated online search.",
      "The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, is for now only available on Apple laptops that run the company's Mac operating system. Access will soon expand to Apple's iOS, Microsoft Windows and Google's Android platforms, OpenAI said.",
      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 08:41:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists say the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs on imports are boosting consumer prices in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration tariffs imposed this year on dozens of nations and a range of industries are fueling inflation, especially for goods that are widely imported into the U.S., a recent\u00a0analysis\u00a0shows.",
      "Product categories seeing some of the biggest price hikes due to tariffs include\u00a0furniture, car parts, electronics and musical instruments, according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The findings are based on research models estimating tariff-related price hikes and drawing on Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, a widely used gauge of inflation.",
      "Importers bear the cost of tariffs, typically passing at least some of the added expenses to consumers, economic research shows.",
      "The St. Louis Fed researchers found that companies passed 35% of tariff costs onto consumers from May through July. Other research from Goldman Sachs suggests that businesses could eventually pass on as much as 55% of added tariff costs to consumers. Companies would swallow 22% of the extra costs, while foreign exporters would absorb 18% of the expenses, economists with the investment bank found.",
      "How much could inflation rise?",
      "Businesses are expected to continue experimenting with pricing based on how tariffs affect their own costs, according to Max Dvorkin, an economist and one of the authors the St. Louis Fed study.",
      "\"Even if you don't change tariffs anymore, the dynamics of prices will continue to evolve and affect consumers over the next few months,\" he said.",
      "The regional Fed bank found that tariffs account for a sizable share of recent inflation. Between June through August, the tariffs imposed by President Trump added 0.5 percentage points to the headline PCE rate, which averaged 2.85% during that period, according to the findings. The levies added 0.4 percentage points to core PCE, which excludes volatile energy and food prices and which hovered around 2.9% during that three-month period, the study found.",
      "\"Tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" the economists conclude.",
      "As of August, the Consumer Price Index was up 2.9% from a year ago after, remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. Inflation as measured by the index had fallen in April to a low of 2.3%, but has flared during the second half of the year. The Labor Department is expected to release CPI data for September, which has been delayed by the government shutdown, on Friday.",
      "The St. Louis Fed study notes that tariffs haven't driven up consumer prices as sharply as some experts had predicted. That's chiefly because many businesses are waiting to see where tariff rates settle before they adjust their prices, according to the research.",
      "\"We believe the passthrough of tariff increases by U.S. businesses to consumers remains in the early stages, delayed by stop-and-go announcements, pauses and drawn-out implementation,\" anaysts with the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a report on Tuesday.",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News' request for comment. President Trump has defended his administration's trade policy, saying that it will benefit the country's manufacturing sector and boost job growth over the long-term.",
      "Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs will cost businesses in the U.S. an additional $1.2 trillion this year, with consumers shouldering most of those costs, according to S&P Global\u00a0analysts\u00a0who reviewed data from 9,000 companies.",
      "Companies have passed on roughly two-thirds of those tariff costs \u2014 $592 billion \u2014 to consumers in the form of higher prices, S&P said. The levies have reduced corporate earnings by a total of $315 billion.",

      "French law prohibits entities like the Louvre from insuring its property, except when part of a collection is moved or loaned to another institution, Romain D\u00e9chelette, president of France-based Serex Assurances, a fine art insurer, told CBS News.",
      "Because the Louvre is a national museum, its collections are considered state property for which the state alone bears responsibility, according to D\u00e9chelette. The French Ministry of Culture did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "\"Everything that belongs to state museums in France is uninsured, unless it leaves the museum,\" D\u00e9chelette told CBS News.",
      "D\u00e9chelette added that if any of the stolen crown jewels had left the museum for another exhibit, the price of insurance would have been calculated based on an estimated value.",
      "\"There is necessarily a value in the government accounts, and an estimate would be assigned with commissions and experts,\" he explained.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau, who is investigating the incident, said Tuesday that the stolen crown jewels are worth an estimated 88 million euros, or $102 million, according to the Associated Press. That estimate doesn't account for their historical value to France",
      "Prosecutor , whose office is leading the investigation, said about 100 investigators are now involved in the police hunt for the suspects and gems after Sunday's theft from the world's most-visited museum.",
      "Charlie Horrell, head of fine art at insurance broker Marsh, told CBS News that private insurance would cover the cost of any losses that were to occur during transit.",
      "\"It's generally somebody dropping a painting, and we'd cover the repair and restoration cost of that painting, plus the depreciation of that piece,\" he told CBS News.",
      "In the case of the Louvre robbery, were the pieces to be insured privately, \"there's no question that if cover were in place, that claim would be paid out without issue,\" he said.",
      "The French law does not apply to collections housed in private museums, like the Foundation Louis Vuitton in Paris. \"In that case it's different, and they buy insurance,\" D\u00e9chelette said.",
      "\"The state is its own insurer as long as the works belonging to national museums remain in their usual place of storage,\" a spokesperson for the Ministry of Culture said in a statement to Le Parisien.",
      "As a result, neither the museum nor the government will receive any private insurance payments to cover the value of the stolen objects, according to D\u00e9chelette.",
      "While French authorities are likely to locate the robbery suspects, they may not ever recover the stolen national treasures, a criminologist told CBS News.",
      "\"We will catch them,\" Alain Bauer, a professor of criminology at France's National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, told CBS News. \"I don't think we will capture the jewels.\"",
      "While the missing French crown jewels are widely considered to be priceless based on their historical value, they could be broken up into pieces, with the gems sold for millions on the black market, experts have told CBS News.",
      "The heist raises concerns about the national museum's security vulnerabilities. According to a recent security audit, 35% of the rooms in the Denon Wing, where the stolen jewels are displayed, are not monitored by security cameras, Radio France reported.",

    "story": [
      "Six in 10 U.S. workers say their jobs fall short of the standards for a \"quality\" position \u2014 one that offers basics such as fair pay, a steady schedule and career growth \u2014 according to research from advocacy group Jobs for the Future.",
      "Although government labor statistics track how many Americans are employed and how much they earn, the official data doesn't offer a full picture of the state of the job market, researchers behind Jobs for the Future's new study said.",
      "\"We recognize that not only has the way we measure the economy not kept up with way work and the economy is changing, but it has never been sufficient in terms of letting us understand what's going on under hood of economy and across the workforce, which is the engine of economic prosperity in the U.S.,\" said Molly Blankenship, a director in solutions design and delivery at Jobs for the Future, which lobbies for policies aimed at spurring innovation,",
      "The group surveyed workers across industries and different types of jobs, in partnership with Gallup, the Families & Workers Fund and the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.",
      "\"We suspected when we started this work that the majority of Americans were not in jobs that were helping them,\" Blankenship added. \"This data confirms what we suspected, which is that the majority of American workers are not in quality jobs.\"",
      "What makes for a good job?",
      "A quality job is defined by five main criteria, according to Jobs for the Future:",
      "Financial well-being, such as fair pay and stable employmentWorkplace culture and safety, meaning the worker is free from discrimination or harassmentGrowth and development opportunities, allowing employees to develop skills and advance their careerAgency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's jobWork structure and agency, including a predictable schedule and manageable workload",
      "Financial well-being, such as fair pay and stable employment",
      "Workplace culture and safety, meaning the worker is free from discrimination or harassment",
      "Growth and development opportunities, allowing employees to develop skills and advance their career",
      "Agency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's job",
      "Work structure and agency, including a predictable schedule and manageable workload",
      "By those measures, only 40% of the more than 18,000 workers surveyed by the group said they are employed in quality jobs, while the remaining 60% said their jobs fall short of those standards. For example, 62% of employees said they have unpredictable work schedules, while about one-third said they are struggling financially, according to the survey.",
      "Only 27% of those surveyed by Jobs for the Futures said their jobs pay enough for them to feel financially comfortable; nearly 3 in 10 described themselves as \"just getting by\" or \"finding it difficult to get by.\"",
      "Beyond fair pay, workers also want to feel safe and respected in their jobs, while opportunities for growth are also valued, the study noted. One in four employees say they have no opportunities for promotion or advancement at work, the survey found.",
      "Another issue affecting how employees perceive their jobs is how employers use new technologies, such as artificial intelligence.",
      "\"There is tremendous concern over technology, how it's being adopted and how it will impact people's jobs in the future,\" Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and a contributor to the the report, told CBS News. \"The research indicates that they lack input on these issues.\"",
      "The degree of autonomy employees have in their jobs also shapes their daily routine and can affect their overall work-life balance, Jobs for the Future found. More than six in 10 employees said they lack control over their schedules, while more than half of workers said they often or sometimes work more than scheduled.",

      "Crown jewels that were stolen in a dramatic weekend heist\u00a0at the Louvre are worth an estimated 88 million euros, or $102 million, not including their historical value to France, the Paris prosecutor said Tuesday.",
      "About 100 investigators are now involved in the police hunt for the gems and heist suspects, said prosecutor Laure Beccuau, whose office is leading the investigation.",
      "\"The wrongdoers who took these gems won't earn 88 million euros if they had the very bad idea of disassembling these jewels,\" she said in an interview with broadcaster RTL. \"We can perhaps hope that they'll think about this and won't destroy these jewels without rhyme or reason.\"",
      "Questions have arisen about security at the Louvre, the world's most-visited museum, and whether security cameras might have failed as the thieves rode a basket lift up the Louvre's facade, cut their way through a window, smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels on Sunday morning.",
      "But France's culture minister said Tuesday that the security apparatus installed at the Louvre worked properly during the theft.",
      "\"The Louvre museum's security apparatus did not fail, that is a fact,\" the minister, Rachida Dati, told lawmakers in the National Assembly. \"The Louvre museum's security apparatus worked.\"",
      "Dati said she launched an administrative inquiry that comes in addition to a police investigation to ensure full transparency into what happened. She did not offer any details about how the thieves managed to carry out their heist given that the cameras were working. But she described it as a painful blow for the nation.",
      "The robbery was \"a wound for all of us,\" she said. \"Why? Because the Louvre is far more than the world's largest museum. It's a showcase for our French culture and our shared patrimony.\"",
      "Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez said Monday that the museum's alarm was triggered when the window of the Apollo Gallery was broken into.",
      "Police officers arrived on site two or three minutes after they were called by an individual that witnessed the scene, he said on LCI television. Officials said the heist lasted less than eight minutes in total, including less than four minutes inside the Louvre.",
      "Nu\u00f1ez did not disclose details about video surveillance cameras that may have filmed the thieves around and in the museum, pending a police investigation. \"There are cameras all around the Louvre,\" he said.",
      "The theft focused on the gilded Apollo Gallery, where the Crown Diamonds are displayed. Eight objects were taken, according to officials: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife; a reliquary brooch; and Empress Eug\u00e9nie's diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch, a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.",
      "Alain Bauer, a professor of criminology at France's National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, told CBS News that a lot of DNA was left at the scene by the robbers, including on the crown of the empress Eug\u00e9nie, which was left behind by the thieves as they made their getaway on motorcycles.",
      "\"We will catch them,\" he said of the thieves. But he added: \"I don't think we will capture the jewels.\"",
      "The crown jewels are priceless in historical terms, but experts have told CBS News they would still be worth millions of dollars if broken up and sold on the black market.",

    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "With open enrollment starting soon, employees could get sticker shock, with their costs expected to rise 6% to 7% for 2026, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "Open enrollment \u2014 the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits \u2014 may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from consultant Mercer.",
      "That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24.",

    "story": [
      "Norfolk, Virginia \u2014 New York Attorney General Letitia James pleaded not guilty Friday to federal charges of bank fraud in Norfolk, Virginia, after the Justice Department indicted her earlier this month.",
      "\"Not guilty, Judge, to both counts,\" James told U.S. District Judge Jamar Walker, appointed to the federal bench by former President Joe Biden, who is presiding over the case.",
      "A trial in James' case is set to begin Jan. 26, though that could change. Walker said the proceedings should last roughly five days. James was released on her own recognizance.",
      "In remarks outside the courthouse after the proceeding, James thanked supporters \u2014 who were chanting \"we stand with you\" and had gathered for her arraignment. She said their support \"strengthened my spirit.\"",
      "\"This is not about me. This is about all of us and about a justice system which has been weaponized, a justice system which has been used as a tool of revenge \u2026 and a weapon against those individuals who simply did their job and who stood up for the rule of law, and a justice system which unfortunately is being used as a vehicle of retribution,\" she said.",
      "\"But my faith is strong and my faith is \u2026 I have this belief in the justice system and the rule of law, and I have a belief in America,\" James said.",
      "The New York attorney general said she has heard from people across the country urging her to remain strong.",
      "\"There's no fear today, no fear,\" James said. \"Because I believe that justice will rain down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream, and I'm here to say that my work and my job and all that I do all throughout my public career \u2014 I've stood up for the rights of New Yorkers and Americans and I will not be deterred ... I will not be distracted. I will do my job each and every day.\"",
      "James' lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said during the arraignment that he will seek to have the charges against James tossed out on several grounds, including vindictive and selective prosecution, and that the indictment does not allege appropriate charges.",
      "The judge set hearings on those motions for December.",
      "The indictment alleges that James misrepresented how she would use a house she bought in Norfolk in 2020, in order to obtain a lower interest rate on her mortgage. Instead of using the property as a second home, the indictment says, she rented it to a family member, treating it as an investment property, in contravention of the mortgage terms.",
      "According to the indictment, James purchased the home for $137,000 and borrowed $109,600 \u2014 and because she received more favorable lending terms and a larger seller credit, she allegedly saved $18,933 over the life of the loan.",
      "James called the charges \"baseless\" in a video statement.",
      "\"This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system,\" she said.",
      "James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, said James \"flatly and forcefully denies these charges\" and said he is \"deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.\"",
      "In a\u00a0pair of\u00a0legal filings\u00a0Thursday, James' legal team took aim at the Trump-appointed prosecutor overseeing her bank fraud case, accusing interim U.S. attorney Lindsey Halligan of an improper conversation with a journalist and vowing to seek dismissal of the indictment on the grounds that\u00a0Halligan\u00a0was unlawfully named to the job.",
      "Shortly after the proceeding ended, Lowell\u00a0filed\u00a0his bid to have the indictment dismissed on the grounds that Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney was invalid and unconstitutional. He's also seeking a court order that would block Halligan from supervising the prosecution of James' case and exercising any other duties as interim U.S. attorney.",
      "Halligan, he wrote, \"had no authority to litigate this case on behalf of the United States.\"",
      "\"[B]ecause this indictment would not have been sought or obtained absent Ms. Halligan's unlawful appointment \u2026 the indictment's flaws cannot be brushed aside as harmless error,\" Lowell wrote. \"This Court must reject the Executive Branch's brazen attempt to sidestep the constitutional and statutory limitations on the appointment of U.S. Attorneys.\"",
      "Days before James was indicted, a grand jury impaneled by the same federal prosecutor's office handed up an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, on charges of lying to Congress, with whom Mr. Trump clashed during his first term. Comey is also seeking to have the charges against him tossed out on the basis that Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney is invalid and unlawful.",
      "A hearing on those efforts in both Comey and James' cases will be held Nov. 13 in the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, before South Carolina federal judge Cameron Curry.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against Comey and James, as well as Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California, another vocal critic of his administration.",
      "The Justice Department launched a criminal probe into James in May regarding mortgage fraud. Three months later, it expanded its investigation into the Office of the New York Attorney General's handling of the Trump Organization probe.",
      "In February 2024, the state of New York won a civil fraud judgment\u00a0against Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization for $354 million in fines for submitting what the judge said was \"blatantly false financial data\" to accountants in order to borrow more money at more favorable interest rates.",
      "The ruling also barred the Trump Organization from seeking loans from financial institutions in New York for three years and also banned Mr. Trump from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation for three years. An appellate court erased the fine in August, but James is appealing the ruling. The court kept the other sanctions in place, however.",
      "Mr. Trump announced last month that he had selected Halligan, a former White House aide, to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Virginia after the abrupt ouster of the prosecutor he had originally named to the post, Erik Siebert.",
      "Sources told CBS News that Halligan presented evidence to the Comey and Letitia James grand juries alone, rather than with line prosecutors who had worked on the cases. Since Halligan became the interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, several prosecutors have left the office or been fired.",
      "Two federal prosecutors in the office, Kristin Bird and Elizabeth Yusi, were terminated last week from their posts as assistant U.S. attorneys in the Norfolk office after they voiced opposition to the criminal case against James. The office's top national security official, Michael Ben'Ary, was also terminated in recent weeks.",
      "As a result of the turnover, two North Carolina federal prosecutors have been brought in to handle the Comey case, and a federal prosecutor from Missouri will be presenting the James case.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said late Thursday he's ending trade talks with Canada, citing an anti-tariff ad campaign by the province of Ontario that uses late President Ronald Reagan's voice.",
      "\"Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,\" the president wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The president appeared to be referencing an ad released last week\u00a0by Ontario that includes excerpts from a 1987 radio address given by Reagan, in which the former president said tariffs work \"only for a short time\" and \"hurt every American worker and consumer.\"",
      "\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" Reagan said, as quoted by the ad.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Global Affairs Canada.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement on Friday that the Trump administration \"has repeatedly sought to address Canada's longstanding, unfair trade barriers.\"",
      "\"These good-faith efforts with Canadian officials have not led to any constructive progress,\" Desai said. \"Ontario's taxpayer-funded ad campaign on American TV networks \u2014 that misleadingly edited President Reagan's 1987 radio address about trade \u2014 is the latest example of how Canadian officials would rather play games than engage with the administration. As President Trump made clear on Truth Social, further talks are a futile effort if Canada can't be serious.\"",
      "Doug Ford, Ontario's premier, wrote Friday of the close ties between the U.S. and Canada.",
      "\"Canada and the United States are friends, neighbours and allies. President Ronald Reagan knew that we are stronger together. God bless Canada and God bless the United States,\" Ford said in a social media post.",
      "Earlier Thursday, the Ronald Reagan Foundation said in a statement\u00a0that the ad used \"selective audio\" and \"misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address.\" The foundation also said the government of Ontario didn't seek permission to use snippets from Reagan's address, and said it is \"reviewing its legal options in this matter.\"",
      "Mr. Trump pointed to the Ronald Reagan Foundation's statement in his Truth Social post, calling Ontario's ad \"FAKE\" and claiming it \"only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court\" \u2014 referring to a pending case on the legality of Mr. Trump's tariff strategy.",
      "Canada is the second-largest trading partner for the U.S. after Mexico, with the U.S. importing $412.7 billion worth of Canadian goods last year, and Canada buying $349.4 billion in American goods, according to\u00a0U.S. statistics.",
      "But relations between the U.S. and its northern neighbor have frayed amid Mr. Trump's trade strategy. He initially imposed higher tariffs on Canada earlier this year, accusing the country of not doing enough to stem the flow of illicit drugs and migration across the border \u2014 allegations that Canadian officials pushed back on.",
      "Over the summer, Mr. Trump\u00a0hiked tariffs on the country\u00a0to 35%, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "Back in March, Canada imposed 25% retaliatory tariffs on many U.S. products not covered by the USMCA. But in August, as part of efforts to reach a deal on tariffs, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney\u00a0said those retaliatory tariffs were being lifted. The two nations have yet to reach such a deal.",
      "Meanwhile, Carney\u00a0said earlier this week\u00a0the country would seek to double its exports to countries other than the U.S., citing the \"pall of uncertainty\" caused by American tariffs.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Justice Department said Friday that the Trump administration is seeking to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia and said the West African nation has agreed to accept him.",
      "In a\u00a0filing\u00a0with a federal judge in Maryland, Justice Department lawyers said that immigration officials expect to formally notify Abrego Garcia later Friday that Liberia has been designated as the new country of removal. They said the Trump administration expects to be able to deport Abrego Garcia as soon as Oct. 31.",
      "The administration has \"received diplomatic assurances regarding the treatment of third-country individuals removed to Liberia from the United States and are making the final necessary arrangements for [Abrego Garcia's] removal,\" they wrote.",
      "In the court filing, the Justice Department said that Abrego Garcia had identified more than 20 countries that he fears would persecute or torture him if he were removed there, and Liberia is not on the list.",
      "\"Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States's closest partners on the African continent,\" they wrote.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's attorney, said the administration \"has chosen yet another path that feels designed to inflict maximum hardship.\"",
      "\"Their actions are punitive, cruel and unconstitutional,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"Unless Liberia guarantees that it will not re-deport Mr. Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, then sending him to Liberia is no less unlawful than sending him directly to El Salvador a second time.\"",
      "The Trump administration's plan to remove Abrego Garcia to Liberia comes as the Maryland judge, Paula Xinis, is weighing whether to release the Salvadoran man from immigration custody while a challenge to the Department of Homeland Security's ongoing efforts to deport him for a second time moves forward.",
      "Abrego Garcia was removed to his home country of El Salvador in March and imprisoned there despite having been granted a legal status in 2019 that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him there because of possible persecution by local gangs. An immigration official with the Trump administration admitted that Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an error, and Xinis ordered the Department of Homeland Security to facilitate his return to the U.S.",
      "But immigration officials resisted doing so for months. Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. in June, but only after a federal grand jury in Tennessee indicted him on two charges of human smuggling stemming from a November 2022 traffic stop.",
      "Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to the charges, and a judge in Tennessee said he should be released on bail ahead of the criminal trial, which is set to begin in January. But he remained in criminal confinement for several more weeks because his lawyers were concerned that the Trump administration would arrest him again upon his release and deport him.",
      "Abrego Garcia was\u00a0released from the Putnam County Jail in Tennessee in August and returned to Maryland, where he has lived since coming to the U.S. illegally in 2011. Days later, he was taken into custody by immigration authorities after being summoned for an interview at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore. The Trump administration notified Abrego Garcia's lawyers he may be deported to Uganda, though Abrego Garcia expressed fear of persecution and torture, as well as a concern that the Ugandan government would send him back to El Salvador.",
      "Since then, the Trump administration has searched for countries to accept Abrego Garcia and has sought to remove him to the African nations of Eswatini and Ghana. Neither of those two countries nor Uganda have agreed to take him. Abrego Garcia has said he would go to Costa Rica and designated it as his preferred country of removal. While Costa Rica has\u00a0indicated it would provide him refugee status or residency, a Justice Department lawyer said during a hearing earlier this month there had not been discussions about deporting him there.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg, his lawyer, reiterated on Friday that Costa Rica \"remains a viable and lawful option.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 10:48:36 -0400",
    "summary": "Much of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",

      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers.

      "During a government shutdown, all active-duty personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over. Civilian personnel whose work the Defense Department considers essential, or \"excepted,\" will also continue to work, while other civilians are furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "\"After the government shutdown, all government employees will automatically receive back pay, based on the terms of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019,\" said Seamus Daniels, a fellow for Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the \"Pay Our Military Act,\" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.",
      "Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the \"Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,\" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it did not pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.",
      "During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October. The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

      "Republicans have rejected Democrats' push to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 09:58:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the vessel was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang and the strike occurred in the Caribbean.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday that the U.S. carried out another strike on a vessel allegedly operated by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua that he said was trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "Hegseth said on social media that the strike killed all six men who were on board, and took place in international waters. He said it is the first strike to take place at night.",
      "\"The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" he wrote. Hegseth included in his social media post a video, marked unclassified, of the vessel as it was hit.",
      "This latest strike appears to be the 10th carried out by the Trump administration against alleged drug trafficking boats over the past several weeks, which have now led to more than 40 deaths. The first several took place in the Caribbean Sea, but this week, the administration's campaign broadened into the Pacific Ocean.",
      "Two men, one from Ecuador and the other from Colombia,\u00a0survived a U.S. strike on a suspected drug-trafficking submersible vessel in the Caribbean Sea last week and were repatriated. The Ecuadorian man was released after the authorities there found no evidence he committed a crime, Ecuador's attorney general's office said. The Colombian citizen was hospitalized, and authorities there said he would be prosecuted.",
      "Hegseth announced two other strikes that took place Tuesday and Wednesday, both of which he said occurred in the Eastern Pacific. In his social media posts, the Defense secretary has alleged that the vessels were operated by a \"designated terrorist organization,\" but did not name the group.",
      "The Colombian government urged the U.S. earlier this week to stop attacking boats in the Pacific and Caribbean Sea and \"respect the norms dictated by international law.\" In an interview Thursday with CBS News national correspondent Lilia Luciano, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he believes that the White House needs to focus on the leaders of drug cartels, not suspected lower-level traffickers.",
      "\"Killing the workers of the business is easy, but if you want efficiency, you have to capture the bosses of the business,\" Petro told CBS News.",
      "President Trump has attacked Petro as an \"illegal drug leader\" who has a \"fresh mouth toward America,\" and threatened that if he didn't \"close up these killing fields immediately,\" then \"United States will close them up for him, and it won't be done nicely.\"",
      "The administration told Congress earlier this month that the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels and argued that the narcotics they bring into the country illegally is killing tens of thousands of Americans annually, which it said constitutes an \"armed attack.\"",
      "While Hegseth has claimed that the targeted vessels are moving along a \"known narco-trafficking route,\" Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, told \"Face the National with Margaret Brennan\" that the routes through the Caribbean are predominantly used to traffick cocaine to Europe, not the U.S.",
      "The senator also said that when the administration briefed Congress on the strikes, they \"had a very hard time explaining to us the rationale, the legal rationale for doing this and the constitutionality of doing it.\"",
      "The Trump administration's strikes have frustrated lawmakers\u00a0on both sides of the aisle, who have argued it needs congressional authorization to engage in hostilities with the drug cartels. Members of Congress have also said the administration hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the targeted vessels are carrying drugs and have questioned the legality of the strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday that his administration would continue to provide information to Congress on the strikes, but wouldn't seek a declaration of war.",
      "\"I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. Okay? We're going to kill them. You know? They're going to be like, dead,\" he said.",
      "The president also suggested that there could be land strikes next, and may inform Congress about such a step.",
      "\"The drugs coming in by sea are like 5% of what they were a year ago, less than 5%. So now they're coming in by land,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And even the land is a concern, because I told them, that's going to be next. You know, the land is going to be next. And we may go to the Senate, we may go to the Congress and tell them about it. But I can't imagine they'd have any problem with it.\"",

      "\"I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around,\" the president said.",
      "\"Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a 'shot.' Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!\" Trump said in conclusion, mentioning Huang, the CEO of chipmaker Nvidia and Benioff, the CEO and co-founder of Salesforce.",
      "Two Department of Homeland Security officials also told CBS News Thursday afternoon that the planned Border Patrol operation in San Francisco had been canceled.",
      "Lurie said in a separate statement Thursday\u00a0that he had received a call from the president late Wednesday night.",
      "\"I told him the same thing I told our residents: San Francisco is on the rise. Visitors are coming back, buildings are getting leased and purchased, and workers are coming back to the office,\" Lurie said. \"In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem reaffirmed that direction in our conversation this morning.\"",
      "The mayor added, \"I am profoundly grateful to all the San Franciscans who came together over the last several days. Our city leaders have been united behind the goal of public safety. And our values have been on full display\u2014this is the best of our city.\"",
      "At a news conference Thursday afternoon, Lurie noted recently released crime statistics, which showed significant declines.",
      "\"Today, in San Francisco, crime is down nearly 30% citywide. And violent crime is at its lowest levels since the 1950s. Car break-ins are at 22-year lows and homicides are on track to hit 70-year lows,\" the mayor said. \"Our new approach is delivering results.\"",
      "Lurie also revealed that he spoke with Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday, in addition to Noem, and received assurances in tackling the fentanyl crisis.",
      "\"She echoed her willingness to our local law enforcement to combat fentanyl and hold drug traffickers responsible,\" Lurie said.",
      "Benioff sparked controversy earlier this month in an interview with the New York Times, urging Trump to deploy the National Guard to the city to address public safety. The comments were made ahead of the company's annual Dreamforce convention in San Francisco.",
      "Following pushback from city officials and after saying the conference was successful, Benioff apologized for his comments.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom voiced support for Mr. Trump's last-minute change of plan.",
      "\"Trump has finally, for once, listened to reason \u2013 and heard what we have been saying from the beginning,\" said Newsom, who once served as San Francisco's mayor himself. \"The Bay Area is a shining example of what makes California so special, and any attempt to erode our progress would damage the work we've done.\"",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised the mayor in her statement.",
      "\"Mayor Daniel Lurie has demonstrated exceptional leadership in his steadfast commitment to the safety and well-being of San Franciscans,\" Pelosi said. \"He has underscored that public safety must be driven by local priorities, respectful of our values and communities.\"",
      "The announcement came  on the same day Border Patrol agents were expected to arrive at Coast Guard Island in Alameda\u00a0as the Trump administration's nationwide immigration crackdown was set to expand to the Bay Area.",
      "Across the Bay in Oakland, political and community leaders gathered outside Oakland City Hall to denounce the arrival of Border Patrol agents, urging citizens to remain calm despite what Mayor Barbara Lee called the federal government's \"escalated rhetoric and enforcement posture\" in the Bay Area.",
      "\"These federal actions are not about public safety,\" Lee said. \"They're political stunts designed to divide and to intimidate. Oakland will not take the bait. We will remain calm, focused and united.\"",
      "Lee said that while Trump called off a planned immigration enforcement surge in San Francisco, she doesn't know what the administration's plans are for Oakland and neighboring cities.",
      "\"I have not received any communication from the White House or the Department of Homeland Security regarding federal operations in Oakland; however, I am in touch with the Governor's Office and our federal delegation,\" Lee said.",
      "She added, \"We know that border patrol agents are being stationed on Coast Guard Island, but let me be clear, our city, we are fully prepared.\u00a0 We are monitoring developments closely and will keep our residents informed if there are any confirmed changes. We will continue to be a welcoming city for immigrants. \"",

You can't freeze rent, but you are lying and telling people you can do so. We're fighting against a snake oil salesman who has sold us a bill of goods,\" Adams said. \"And who is his base of support?

    "summary": "Lawyers for Letitia James also say they'll ask a judge to toss out the criminal case against her, arguing the Trump-appointed prosecutor is serving in the role unlawfully.",
    "story": [
      "Attorneys for New York Attorney General Letitia James took aim at the Trump-appointed prosecutor overseeing her bank fraud case Thursday, accusing interim U.S. attorney Lindsey Halligan of an improper conversation with a journalist and vowing to seek dismissal of the indictment on the grounds that Halligan was unlawfully named to the job.",
      "The pair of legal filings came the evening before James is set to be arraigned Friday in federal court in Norfolk, Virginia, on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. Prosecutors allege that James bought a house in Virginia and agreed to use it as a second home, but ultimately rented it out and used it as an investment property.",
      "James has denied all wrongdoing and accused the Justice Department of political retribution, after James sued President Trump in civil court and secured a nine-figure fraud judgment. The fine was later erased entirely by an appeals court.",
      "James to challenge Halligan's appointment",
      "In a two-page legal filing, James's lawyers alerted the court that they will file a motion Friday \"to dismiss the indictment that challenges the unlawful appointment of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan.\"",
      "The filing did not lay out the argument her lawyers plan to offer.",
      "Lawyers for former FBI Director James Comey also challenged Halligan's appointment earlier this week, arguing the charges against him for allegedly lying to Congress should be tossed out on the grounds that she was \"defectively appointed to her office.\"",
      "Halligan was appointed after the previous interim U.S. attorney, Erik Siebert, resigned after almost eight months on the job. The role is usually subject to a 120-day limit, but in Siebert's case, the judges in the Eastern District of Virginia voted to extend his term after the 120-day period elapsed. Comey's lawyers argue the 120-day clock began when Siebert started in January, making Halligan's appointment invalid.",
      "Several other temporary U.S. attorneys have faced similar challenges to their eligibility in recent months, including the top federal prosecutors in New Jersey and Nevada.",
      "James alleges Halligan broke Justice Department rules by speaking with reporter",
      "James also asked a judge Thursday to prohibit the Justice Department from disclosing case materials and investigative information to the media, in a court filing that criticized Halligan for texting a journalist last weekend to criticize coverage of the case.",
      "Anna Bower, a senior editor at Lawfare, wrote earlier this week that Halligan sent her unsolicited messages on the encrypted app Signal that criticized her for sharing a New York Times article about the James case on social media. Bower says Halligan accused her of \"jumping to conclusions\" and sharing \"biased\" information that was \"way off.\"",
      "\"You're biased. Your reporting isn't accurate. I'm the one handling the case and I'm telling you that,\" one message from Halligan read, according to Bower.",
      "In Thursday's filing, James's lawyers called Halligan's messages to Bower \"unusual and improper,\" and \"a stunning disclosure of internal government information.\"",
      "They argued the conversation violated court rules and internal Justice Department policies that bar the sharing of grand jury information and restrict prosecutors' out-of-court statements. By casting doubt on the accuracy of the Times article, James' lawyers said, Halligan was \"commenting on the evidence in the case and that which she likely learned as a result of grand jury testimony.\"",
      "This disclosure could undermine James's right to a fair trial, her lawyers claimed.",
      "\"It has been reported that Ms. Halligan has no prosecutorial experience whatsoever,\" the filing read. \"But all federal prosecutors are required to know and follow the rules governing their conduct from their first day on the job, and so any lack of experience cannot excuse their violation.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.",
      "The Justice Department has faced similar pressure in other cases.",
      "Last month, attorneys for accused UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione asked a judge to bar federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty, accusing federal and New York authorities of violating his rights. They pointed to statements by Attorney General Pam Bondi calling the killing a \"premeditated, cold-blooded assassination,\" and criticized a late 2024 perp walk staged by federal and local authorities that looked like a \"scene out of a Marvel movie.\""

    "published": "Thu, 23 Oct 2025 22:17:56 -0400",
    "summary": "Among those taken into custody in the betting investigation today are Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier of the Miami Heat and former NBA player Damon Jones.",
    "story": [
      "Dozens of people including former and current NBA players and a coach have been charged in connection to two investigations into an alleged widespread sports betting scheme and organized crime ring, the FBI and federal prosecutors announced Thursday.",
      "Among those taken into custody were Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Terry Rozier, who has played for the Miami Heat since 2024. Billups, a former star guard and Hall of Famer from Denver who played for multiple NBA teams, was arrested in Portland, Oregon, and Rozier was arrested in Orlando.",
      "The NBA said in a statement that Rozier and Billups were put on leave and that the league is cooperating with authorities.",
      "The arrests are in relation to two federal criminal cases. One involves a sports betting ring involving former and current NBA players, including some who allegedly faked injuries. The other case involves illegal high-stakes poker games involving coaches and operated by organized crime figures. Three people, including former NBA player Damon Jones, were arrested in connection to both schemes, the U.S. attorney's office said.",
      "Thirty-one people are being charged in the poker case, and some of those defendants are allegedly connected to organized crime families known to law enforcement, prosecutors said. Rozier was among the six arrested in connection with the sports betting case, while Billups was one of those arrested in connection to the poker case.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said the charges and the arrests in both cases include wire fraud, money laundering, extortion, robbery and illegal gambling.",
      "Patel called the arrests \"extraordinary,\" saying that they stemmed from a \"coordinated takedown across 11 states.\"",
      "\"Not only did we crack into the fraud that these perpetrators committed on the grand stage of the NBA, but we have also interred and executed a system of justice against La Cosa Nostra to include the Bonanno, Gambino, Genovese and Lucchese crime families,\" Patel said.",
      "Joseph Nocella, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said the defendants allegedly used a \"variety of very sophisticated cheating technologies,\" including self-shuffling machines that had been secretly altered to read the cards in the deck and predict which player at the table had the best poker hand, which was then allegedly sent to an off-site operator. The off-site operator then allegedly sent the information via cellphone to the co-conspirator at the table, who was known as the quarterback. The quarterback then allegedly secretly signaled the information to others and at the table, and together, they used that information to win the games, Nocella said.",
      "Nocella said that in the first case that allegedly involves Rozier, the defendants are accused of having profited off of games played by the Charlotte Hornets, Portland Trail Blazers, L.A. Lakers and Toronto Raptors. The defendants allegedly used non-public information to place bets of hundreds of thousands of dollars, mostly in the form of prop bets on individual player performance in games, Nocella said.",
      "\"Most of these bets succeeded, and the intended losses were in the hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Nocella said. \"The defendants then laundered their illegal winnings in various ways \u2014 peer-to-peer platforms, bank wires and simple cash exchanges.\"",
      "According to the sports betting indictment, between 2022 and 2024, co-conspirators, allegedly including Rozier, provided private information only known to some in the NBA to others in exchange for flat fees or cuts of the bet profits.",
      "In one NBA game in March 2023, when Rozier was a player on the Charlotte Hornets, he allegedly told a co-conspirator that he was going to \"prematurely remove himself from the game in the first quarter due to a supposed injury.\" That co-conspirator sold that information for $100,000 from expected winnings to another defendant, prosecutors said. Shane Hennen, one of the defendants, is accused of placing multiple bets at a sportsbook totalling about $61,200 on Rozier to not eclipse his projected scoring and playing lines in the game. Another co-conspirator allegedly placed bets totalling about $107,000 on the same thing, alongside others who did the same in the gambling ring.",
      "Federal prosecutors said that NBA and team officials were not aware of his injury or plan to leave the game early, and Rozier left the game early.",
      "Another game from March of 2023, the betting circle got access to information that an unnamed player was going to sit out a game while playing for the Portland Trail Blazers because the team was tanking, or intentionally losing, to get a better draft pick in the upcoming draft, the indictment says. The group also allegedly acquired access to information that the Orlando Magic were going to sit their best players in an April 2023 game as well. In both cases, prosecutors allege that the gambling circle bet on those teams to lose and win bets because of the information they had. In both cases, the players did indeed sit out the games.",
      "According to the same indictment, Damon Jones attempted to give inside information to bettors on a prominent NBA player, who appears to be LeBron James, who he played with as a Cleveland Cavalier, and another prominent player. In two games, one in February 2023 and another in January 2024, Jones allegedly sold or attempted to sell non-public information about the players' injuries to bettors. In the 2023 game, Jones is alleged to have shared information about James' injury status to bettors before a game against the Milwaukee Bucks, telling a co-conspirator over text that James was going to be out of the game before it was publicly announced. James did not play in that game and the Lakers lost.",
      "Rozier's attorney, James Trusty, sent a statement to CBS News saying that Rozier had been characterized as a subject, not a target, of investigators, but then \"at 6 a.m. this morning they called to tell me FBI agents were trying to arrest him in a hotel.\" Trusty accused federal prosecutors of wanting \"the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk.\"",
      "Billups had a brief appearance in Oregon federal court Thursday afternoon and was released after agreeing to certain conditions.",
      "According to the poker game indictment, the rigged games were set up at various locations in New York City and on Long Island, in addition to Las Vegas and Miami. In one poker scheme in New York City, a victim was allegedly defrauded over $1.8 million by the crime ring. Prosecutors allege that from the conception of the poker scheme to the present, victims were defrauded of over $7.15 million.",
      "Billups, federal prosecutors said, was allegedly involved in defrauding victims of over $50,000.",
      "To hide the earnings from the scheme, the co-conspirators allegedly laundered their money through shell companies and third-parties, and payments were provided in cash or other forms of payment like cryptocurrency.",
      "According to a detention letter sent to the New York judge who is overseeing the case, the Justice Department is not moving to detain Billups as his case moves forward. It was requested, however, that 13 defendants be detained.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Thursday night, an attorney for Billups wrote that \"to believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his hall-of-fame legacy, his reputation, and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game. Billups has never and would never gamble on basketball games, provide insider information, or sacrifice the trust of his team and the League, as it would tarnish the game he has devoted his entire life to.\"",
      "Nocella said the investigation does not involve college basketball, and added that the investigation is still ongoing.",
      "This is not the first high-profile incident involving alleged illegal betting and the NBA. Earlier this year in a separate case, former NBA player Gilbert Arenas was arrested for allegedly operating an illegal gambling and poker ring out of a California home that he owned.",

    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California, Missouri, North Carolina and Utah's redistricting push could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina is now the latest state to join a mid-decade redistricting gambit that could shake up next year's midterms, following similar moves by Missouri, Texas and California to redraw their House maps, along with a separate court-ordered effort in Utah.",
      "The redistricting push began with President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to find more seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the state's districts and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a push that has drawn national attention. It led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats.",
      "Then, in Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map earlier this month to edge out Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, signed the legislation on Sunday. In October, North Carolina Republicans targeted a single Democratic district as well, passing a map that redraws the 1st Congressional District to make it lean more heavily Republican.",
      "Utah lawmakers have also reworked their state's map after a judge ruled the current districts violated restrictions on gerrymandering. All four of the state's House districts are represented by Republicans.",
      "Challenges remain in all states. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Kehoe's authority to create the new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Civil rights groups are also suing in Texas, claiming the maps are racially biased. And in California, the state's new map must be approved by voters in a November special election before it takes effect.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, includingIndiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats.",
      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains here in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's\u00a0 district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. They've held two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",
      "North Carolina has 14 congressional seats, 10 of which are held by Republicans. But the state is not as solidly red as that breakdown would suggest \u2014 it's closer to a 50/50 state at the presidential level these days, and the state's governor and attorney general are both Democrats.",
      "In the redistricting push undertaken this fall, North Carolina Republicans are targeting a single seat: Rep. Don Davis' 1st Congressional District. Davis' win in 2024 in the northeastern part of the state was a rare bright spot for Democrats, especially after Republicans were able to flip congressional three seats in North Carolina that year.",
      "In the map passed by the North Carolina Assembly on Oct. 21 and 22, Davis' district boundaries move further south, into the current 3rd District. That changes the makeup of the district from one that was 48% Democratic to one that is 44% Democratic.",
      "Utah redistricting",
      "Utah's redistricting is different from the other states' campaigns, starting with the fact that the state does not have any Democratic members of Congress. The redistricting push also wasn't kicked off by Mr. Trump and Republicans or in retaliation for moves by other states. Utah's 2025 redistricting was put in motion this summer when a judge ruled the current districts were in violation of a voter-approved measure to prevent partisan gerrymandering.",
      "The GOP-controlled legislature put forward four maps for public comment, and ultimately on Oct. 6 approved a map that would be the least competitive for Democrats. It will still need a judge's final seal of approval.",
      "The only blue-leaning area of Utah, Salt Lake County, was split into three districts in the maps approved in 2021. But the proposed map will split Salt Lake County into two districts, speading out making Districts 2 and 3 more competitive for Democrats.",
      "But as University of Utah professor Matthew Burbank pointed out in an interview with CBS News, \"however the lines are drawn, Republicans are not likely to lose a whole lot of seats.\" Burbank said if the 2026 election is really competitive in Utah, it will likely have more to do with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"The state is, at the moment, a little uncertain, not because Democrats have really done anything to make themselves more competitive,\" Burbank said. \"It's really been on the Republican side. There is a bit of a split \u2026 this was a state in 2016, a heavily Republican state but clearly not a pro-Trump state.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump won Utah in 2016, it was not by the margins that would be expected in such a red state. But in 2024, Mr. Trump did better in the state and other elected officials in the state seemed to have adjusted to be more pro-Trump \u2014 something that could cause backlash with voters in 2026.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The entire White House East Wing appears to have been demolished, new images show, after the White House said President Trump doesn't need to seek approval to tear it down.",
      "Photos taken Thursday and a new satellite image from Planet Labs PBC show some rubble where the East Wing used to stand, after demolition of the structure only began earlier this week.",
      "The president on Thursday said he plans to give \"millions of dollars\" of his own money to the project, but he declined to offer a specific figure when he was asked about it by reporters.",
      "The move to raze the East Wing \u2014 as well as the rapidity of its destruction \u2014 came as a surprise to many, after the president had previously said in July the current White House structure would be untouched.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday that the president doesn't need approval for demolition \u2014 only for \"vertical construction\" \u2014\u00a0 citing a previous legal opinion from the National Capital Planning Commission. The commission is a federal agency that provides planning policies and reviews of development proposals aimed at preserving the architecture of the nation's capital, although its operations have been affected by the ongoing government shutdown. It has no authority to stop the ballroom project.",
      "\"Their general counsel has said when it comes to Phase 1 of this project, the tearing down of the current East Wing structure, a submission is not required legally for that,\" Leavitt said. \"Only for vertical construction will a submission be required, and that's a legal opinion from them, and we are following that legal opinion.\"",
      "Leavitt said the legal opinion that the president can demolish parts of the White House without approval is one the planning commission has held for many years. CBS News has requested the legal opinion she cited.",
      "She also maintained the White House has been \"transparent\" about the ballroom project.",
      "\"The president has been incredibly transparent,\" Leavitt said Thursday. \"I would reject any notion otherwise, when it comes to this ballroom project.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said the ballroom, which he says is entirely privately funded, would cost $300 million, up from the $200 million figure White House officials initially cited. On Thursday, he repeated that the price tag would be \"in the neighborhood\" of $300 million and added that the donations have exceeded its cost \u2014 estimating \"I think $350 million\" in donations so far.",
      "The White House has also mentioned other presidents who undertook major construction projects at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and published a timeline that trolls some of Mr. Trump's Democratic predecessors.",

      "Changpeng Zhao, a Chinese-born Canadian founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, pleaded guilty in November 2023 to charges of enabling money laundering while serving as CEO of the exchange. The plea was part of a multi-billion-dollar settlement Binance reached with the Biden-era Justice Department in 2023, and Zhao stepped down from his role as CEO.",
      "He served four months in prison after his April 2024 sentencing, and his company was barred from operating in the U.S.",
      "\"President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden administration pursued Mr. Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims.\"",
      "\"The Biden administration sought to imprison Mr. Zhao for three years, a sentence so outside sentencing guidelines that even the judge said he had never heard of this in his 30-year career. These actions by the Biden Administration severely damaged the United States' reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation. The Biden administration's war on crypto is over.\"",
      "Zhao has a net worth of roughly $86 billion, according to Forbes. Zhao, who founded Binance in 2017, still owns the vast majority of the exchange, according to Forbes.",

      "Washington \u2014 Former special counsel Jack Smith is offering to testify in open hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees about the federal investigations into President Trump's handling of sensitive documents and alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, according to a letter from his lawyers to lawmakers.",
      "In the letter obtained by CBS News, Smith's lawyers said he is prepared to answer questions from Congress about the investigations he oversaw and prosecutions of Mr. Trump that stemmed from them, but said doing so \"requires assurance from the Department of Justice that he will not be punished for doing so.\"",
      "Lawyers Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski said Smith needs guidance from the Justice Department about federal grand jury secrecy requirements and authorization as to the issues he can speak about, including the second volume of his final report, which he completed before leaving the role of special counsel. The first volume of Smith's report pertains to the investigation that stemmed from alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and it was submitted to Congress in mid-January. But the second volume, which covers Mr. Trump's handling of sensitive government documents after leaving the White House in 2021, has not been made public.",
      "Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland said in January that he would not release the second volume of Smith's final report because a criminal case involving two of Mr. Trump's co-defendants was ongoing. But after Mr. Trump returned to the White House for a second term, the case against the two, aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira, was tossed out.",
      "Both cases against Mr. Trump arising from Smith's investigations ended after he won the presidential election last November.",
      "\"Given the many mischaracterizations of Mr. Smith's investigation into President Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and role in attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election, Mr. Smith respectfully requests the opportunity to testify in open hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees,\" Smith's lawyers wrote in their letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley and Rep. Jim Jordan, who lead the Senate and House Judiciary panels.",
      "They said that Smith \"steadfastly adhered to established legal standards and Department of Justice guidelines, consistent with his approach throughout his career as a dedicated public servant,\" while leading the investigations into Mr. Trump.",
      "Smith and his team brought two criminal cases against the president in 2023. In the first, prosecutors alleged that Mr. Trump illegally held onto documents marked classified after the end of his first term in January 2021 and kept them at his South Florida property, Mar-a-Lago. He faced 40 counts in all and pleaded not guilty.",
      "The second case involved his alleged efforts to hold onto power after he lost the 2020 presidential election to former President Joe Biden. Mr. Trump faced four charges and pleaded not guilty.",
      "The president and his allies in Congress have long accused Smith of pursuing politically motivated cases against Mr. Trump in an effort to undermine his candidacy for a second term. Smith resigned from the Justice Department before Mr. Trump was inaugurated, but is the subject of\u00a0investigations from congressional Republicans and the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency that is unrelated to Smith's former position of special counsel.",

      "Gov. JB Pritzker signed an executive order on Thursday aimed at addressing federal enforcement in Illinois, telling CBS News that his newly created Illinois Accountability Commission will serve as a permanent record of alleged civil rights abuses by federal agents in Chicago.",
      "Pritzker told CBS News, in an exclusive interview, the state is documenting \"unlawful attacks\" by ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers under Operation Midway Blitz.",
      "\"They are attacking people on the ground \u2014 ICE, CBP \u2014 going after people just because they're Brown or Black,\" Pritzker said. \"No one above them is holding them responsible. Greg Bovino, who is running the operation in Chicago, isn't holding them accountable. No one is. So we're going to have to keep a record.\"",
      "Bovino is accused of violating a temporary restraining order issued by a federal judge after he was seen on video throwing tear gas at protesters in Little Village Thursday.",
      "Pritzker's office said the task force will consist of nine people appointed by him to capture and create a public record of federal law enforcement, ultimately recommending actions to hold the federal government accountable for operations taking place here.",
      "\"The commission will be charged with three core missions. One, creating a public record of the abuses; two, capturing the impact on families and communities; and three, recommending actions to prevent further harm and pursue justice,\" Pritzker said at a press conference announcing his executive order.",
      "He said members will be supported by the Department of Human Rights, and he expects hearings to launch \"several weeks from now.\"",
      "\"Since this began, I have encouraged the people of Illinois to use their phones and to record everything they are witnessing and post it on social media,\" Pritzker said. \"We have a duty to ensure that the truth is preserved.\"",
      "The governor said hundreds of videos and firsthand accounts have already been collected and will be preserved for use in future legal proceedings.",
      "\"These people need to be held accountable,\" he said. \"And they will be \u2014 by the judiciary now, and by Congress or the next administration later.\"",
      "Former Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Ruben Castillo, will lead the commission as chair.",
      "\"This commission is about civil rights. This commission is about the Constitution. This commission ultimately about human rights, Castillo said. \"I see the commission as a lighthouse. What does a lighthouse do? It sheds light on darkness, and there certainly seems to be \u2013 and not prejudging this \u2013 a lot of darkness going around.\"",
      "Pritzker emphasized that Illinois is not waiting for Washington to act, pointing to recent legal victories against federal enforcement actions.",
      "\"We've won at the circuit court level. We've won at the appeals court level. We are taking action now. But it's appalling that the people committing these crimes are still on the job,\" Pritzker said. \"Let's be clear: Congress isn't doing anything right now. They've become sycophants to the President. They're not holding hearings or asking questions.\"",
      "He described reports of Black Hawk helicopters, military-style weapons, and the mass detention of civilians, including children being zip-tied.",
      "\"There are people who just don't believe it until they see it,\" he said. \"We've seen pastors hit with pepper balls while praying outside ICE facilities. Peaceful protesters tackled or shot with tear gas and rubber bullets for exercising their First Amendment rights. ... That's why we're telling everyone: record it, document it, send it in.\"",
      "In his interview with CBS News, Pritzker detailed the timeline on these accountability efforts.",
      "\"We are taking those cases to court, and again we are winning. So we're taking action now. I don't want to make it seem like nothing is happening,\" he said.",
      "The governor said they're taking cases to court now, but other actions could take years, when there's a change in administration at the White House.",
      "\"Someone's got to hold them accountable, and whether it's the courts now or the elected officials later, we've got to make sure we have a record to show,\" he said.",
      "Pritzker said a report will be issued this January related to the work of the commission. They've created a website people can use to track this work and to report activity at ilac.illinois.gov.",
      "Asked about this week's federal court decision blocking the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, Pritzker praised the ruling but voiced concern about what may come next.",
      "\"The courts have done a very good job stopping the worst offenses, but I'm disturbed that the Supreme Court might allow federalized National Guard troops when there is no insurrection, no rebellion,\" he said.",
      "Pritzker said he welcomes help from the FBI, DEA, and ATF to combat illegal guns and drugs, but rejected any military-style presence.",
      "When asked what he'd say directly to CBP Chief of Patrol Bovino, who oversees the federal operation, Pritzker offered a pointed message: \"Follow the law. Follow your own protocols. Do right by the citizens of the United States who live here in Illinois. And, finally, pronounce the name of our state correctly. It's Illinois, not Illinoise.\"",
      "Bovino defends enforcement actions, claiming \"absolute chaos in the streets\"",
      "On Thursday, Bovino also talked with CBS News and pushed back on Pritzker's claims.",
      "\"Pritzker probably ought to set a hotline up for himself, for all the abuses that illegal aliens perpetrate on American citizens,\" Bovino said, accusing him and other Democratic leaders of spreading \"fake news\" about racial profiling. He denied that CBP agents have targeted neighborhoods by race or acted outside policy.",
      "\"We've arrested individuals from 30 non-Latino countries,\" he said. \"We go where the threat is.\"",
      "Bovino defended his agency's tactics, saying federal agents in Chicago have made nearly 2,700 arrests since Sept. 6 and used \"exemplary\" force amid what he called \"absolute chaos in the streets.\"",
      "\"We've arrested a lot of very bad individuals: Latin Kings members, bona fide terrorists, and things like that,\" Bovino told CBS News.",
      "Bovino said roughly 70% of arrests nationwide involve people with \"criminal or immigration history,\" though he declined to provide specific figures for Chicago, when pressed repeatedly. Earlier this month, CBS News Chicago dug into the data behind the arrests, and found some of the numbers reflected people arrested outside of Illinois.",
      "Bovino also defended agents seen deploying tear gas and pepper balls at protesters outside the Broadview detention facility, despite a federal court order restricting chemical agents.",
      "\"The use of force I've seen has been exemplary, the least amount necessary to accomplish the mission,\" he said. \"Those protesters were trespassing and had been given multiple warnings. That was absolutely in line with policy.\"",
      "Bovino dismissed concerns that agents fired from elevated positions or above the waist, insisting, \"It doesn't matter where you fire from. That's not a violation of policy.\"",
      "Asked if any agents had been disciplined for excessive force, Bovino said, \"To my knowledge, no.\"",
      "He also defended the possible deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago, saying they would guard federal facilities, not patrol city streets.",
      "\"That was fake news,\" he said. \"It was never the intention for National Guard to be on the streets.\"",
      "Bovino described Chicago as a \"model\" for nationwide immigration enforcement and said CBP's mission will continue until \"we arrest them all or they self-deport.\"",
      "\"We're here to protect taxpayers from violence and crimes by illegal aliens,\" Bovino said. \"We've had enough, and we're not going anywhere.\"",

Jack Reed, who is the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement to CBS News that \"requiring all Department of Defense communications with Congress to be controlled by Secretary Hegseth's office raises serious questions about transparency and the timely flow of information that lawmakers need to conduct oversight.\"",

      "The memo comes on the heels of nearly every major news organization, including CBS News, leaving their workspace in the Pentagon after declining to sign onto new press requirements that reporters' associations said could infringe on their First Amendment rights. The Defense Department sent reporters a memo in September mandating they sign an agreement acknowledging they would need formal authorization to publish either classified or what the department called \"controlled unclassified information.\" The department said in the memo that \"information must be approved before public release \u2026 even if it is unclassified.\" All organizations with the exception of a handful of hard-right publications refused.

    "summary": "Many Californians think the state sets a national example on tech and culture, but not on tax policy or politics.",
    "story": [
      "As the state draws national attention in part because of Proposition 50 and redistricting, Californians also weigh in on what they think the state more generally can \u2014 and can't \u2014 show the nation, and on the potential prospects of some of its leading political figures.",
      "A large number of Californians in his own Democratic Party say Gov. Gavin Newsom should run for president in 2028, but among California's voters overall, that view is more split.",
      "(Nationally, of course, any entrant on the Democratic side would first need to appeal to the party's rank-and-file in the primaries across many states. The perspective of home-state voters on an elected official, either in opinions or in state race results, is often taken as a view from the voters who've presumably gotten to know their work more closely over the years.)",
      "Newsom's overall approval rating as governor is positive and a little higher than the percentage who want him to run in 2028.",
      "Given that speculation, California voters tend to think Newsom right now is paying attention to both national and state issues \u2014 though fewer feel he is paying mind to their local issues.",
      "By comparison, more California Democrats say Newsom should run in 2028 than say that of former Vice President Kamala Harris, who previously represented California in the Senate.",
      "Fewer than a third of the state's voters \u2014 and just under half of California Democrats \u2014 think she should run. She won her home state when she ran in 2024.",
      "Most independents don't think Newsom or Harris should run, but by comparison, they are much more likely to think Newsom should.",
      "California and the nation: Where does it \u2014 and doesn't \u2014 set an example",
      "As Californians are thinking about\u00a0Prop 50 in national terms, we also wanted to know how they saw the state, relative to the nation on other matters, too.",
      "Californians think the state sets a good example for the rest of the U.S. on technology and innovation, on culture, and for a slight majority, on environmental policy.",
      "But few think it sets a good example on housing policy (most California voters also describe the cost of living in the state more generally as unmanageable), on tax policy, on economic policy or on its politics.",
      "Perhaps related, most Californians \u2014 including many with higher incomes \u2014 describe the cost of living in the state as either somewhat or very unmanageable.",
      "Against that backdrop, California's gubernatorial race will take place next year, with the primary also still many months off to establish the top two vote getters for the November 2026 general election.",
      "As with any contest so distant, voters can and do consider multiple candidates or potential entrants, and long before having to make a single choice. That is reflected here. For many voters, they have not heard enough about many.",
      "In all, current Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California is the most considered name (though he's not a candidate, there are reports he may be considering entering the race) and particularly so among Democrats. He's also won statewide office before and by comparison is best known to voters.",
      "Former Rep. Katie Porter remains slightly more considered than other Democrats besides Padilla, but also has a somewhat higher number saying she's not being considered.",
      "Also as a part of the early process, there is plenty of cross-consideration. Most of the voters considering Porter are also considering Padilla, and vice versa. Democratic voters are often considering a number of the Democrats running.",
      "The overall number who haven't heard enough, and who are cross-considering, only emphasizes the point that in the minds of voters that this next-year contest is only just beginning to take shape.",
      "In a state where voters of one party outnumber the other by such a wide margin, one dynamic to watch is who is seen as trying to earn votes or as taking them for granted. Neither party does especially well overall, with Democrats faring a little better than Republicans on being seen as trying to earn votes, but also worse on perceptions of taking votes for granted. A lot of independents are skeptical of both parties, with only about a quarter of them feeling that California's Democrats or its Republicans try to earn their votes.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a representative sample of 1,504 registered voters in California interviewed between October 16-21, 2025. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, and geographic region based on the voter file and U.S. Census data, as well as to 2024 presidential vote.

    "story": [
      "Two top House Democrats have asked the Trump administration to turn over copies of President Trump's controversial claims \u2014 totaling about $230 million \u2014 for damages over the past criminal investigations into Mr. Trump before the 2024 election.",
      "In the request, which was obtained Thursday by CBS News, the top Democrats on the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Rep. Robert Garcia of California, are seeking records on the administrative claims filed with the Justice Department by Mr. Trump over the two cases.",
      "The first claim is related to the government's investigation into Mr. Trump regarding alleged interference by Russia in the 2016 presidential election, and the second concerns the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago that centered around Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents after he left the White House in 2021.",
      "The request by the House Democrats seeks information about the claims, \"including all documentation, exhibits, affidavits, and evidence submitted with such claims.\" Raskin and Garcia set a deadline of Oct. 30 for the Trump administration to hand over the records. But the House Democrats, who are in the minority, do not have subpoena power to require the administration to hand over records on the matter.",
      "The Democrats are also seeking correspondence that includes Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Associate Attorney General Stanley Woodward. Blanche was one of Mr. Trump's criminal defense attorneys, and Woodward was Trump co-defendant Walt Nauta's defense attorney in the classified documents case. Both of those officials, unless they recuse themselves, could\u00a0be directly involved in determining whether to grant President Trump's claim. If any compensation is approved, it would be paid for by American taxpayers.",
      "In their request, Raskin and Garcia criticized the president for pursuing taxpayer money in his claim. In their letter, the two wrote, \"The Founders feared presidents like you might one day be tempted to use their powers to steal U.S. taxpayer funds. That's why they enshrined a very simple rule into the Constitution, which is called the Domestic Emoluments Clause. As President, you may not receive any payment from the federal government or any of the states, except for your salary, which is currently fixed by law at $400,000 per year.\"",
      "Both of the administrative claims were filed before Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term.",
      "It's unclear whether discussions between the Trump legal team and the Justice Department are underway or whether they have occurred, the source said.",

      "Closing in on Election Day, a potential 2028 presidential candidate will be in Virginia to campaign for Democratic governor hopeful Abigail Spanberger.",
      "CBS News has learned that Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro will campaign with Spanberger in the Hampton Roads area on Sunday as the race to lead Virginia reaches its final days.",
      "Shapiro, who is running for re-election to his own office in 2026, has become nationally known for being able to win his tensely divided state. Shapiro and Spanberger \u2014 who during her time in Congress repeatedly won a competitive House district \u2014 both represent the more moderate part of the Democratic Party at a time when there are clear tensions between centrist-minded politicians and progressive figures on the left about the future.",
      "\"Here in Virginia we know the stakes of this election. and in fact, we know all the challenges coming at us, from Washington, from bad policies, but what we will do this November is not just vote against something, but we will vote for the policies that we believe in,\" Spanberger said at a rally this week.",
      "While Shapiro was a potential running mate option for Vice Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, he is now among a group of Democratic governors emphasizing accomplishments and executive leadership at a time when Democrats are looking to the future amid fatigue with Washington-centric rhetoric.",
      "In the race to succeed Virginia's Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who under state law cannot run for another term this year, Spanberger has been viewed as having an advantage over Virginia GOP Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.",
      "But statewide races in Virginia can become surprisingly close, and Spanberger has struggled as of late to navigate the backlash to violent text messages, made public recently, that were sent several years ago by Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee in the Virginia Attorney General's race.",
      "Spanberger has denounced Jones' words, where he wrote in the past about a hypothetical shooting of a man who was a Virginia House Republican leader. But Jones has remained the Democratic candidate on the ballot in the Nov. 4 election, a reality that has helped unite Republicans messaging in Virginia after struggling to coalesce around a campaign approach for much of this year.",
      "Yet while the controversy could cost Jones the race for attorney general, Democrats remain hopeful about winning back the governor's office in Virginia. President Trump has lost Virginia in the last three presidential elections, and has also so far been unwilling to clearly endorse or campaign for Earle-Sears despite the lieutenant governor's conservative approach.",
      "At the same time, Spanberger is getting support from former Democratic President Barack Obama, who is set to campaign with her the Saturday before election day and former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, another potential 2028 presidential candidate, who rallied with her in Charlottesville earlier this week.",
      "Earle-Sears however has not been getting the same kind of major help on the right. The president has not rallied for her so far this year, but her campaign did move on Monday to publicize comments where Mr. Trump said he thinks \"the Republican candidate is very good and I think she should win,\" before explaining he hasn't \"been too much involved in Virginia.\"",
      "The absence has been especially stark considering Mr. Trump has already given what he described as his \"complete and total endorsement\" on social media to the GOP candidates for New Jersey governor and Virginia attorney general who are also on this fall's Nov. 4 ballot.",
      "Mr. Trump offered a measure of support that could benefit Earle-Sears on Wednesday, writing on social media that voting Republican in Virginia or New Jersey\u2014 including in the race for governor \u2014 \"MEANS A DRASTIC DROP IN ENERGY PRICES AND ENERGY COSTS.\" Yet he didn't name Earle-Sears or explicitly endorse her.",
      "Talking to CBS News last week, Earle-Sears demurred on questions about Mr. Trump and his role, or lack thereof, in her race to that point.",
      "\"I'm not going to talk about when the President and I speak. I've spoken with the President, I've visited him in the Oval Office, which folks for me, as an immigrant to this great country, you just don't see yourself being in the Oval Office. You see it on television and you say to yourself 'my god what a great country that this is,'\" Earle-Sears said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, delivered a marathon speech on the Senate floor that stretched 22 hours and 37 minutes across Tuesday and Wednesday, protesting President Trump's policies in one of the longest addresses in the chamber in recent years.",
      "Merkley, 68, began speaking at 6:21 p.m. on Tuesday and continued until 4:58 p.m. Wednesday. Over the course of the speech, he railed against the Trump administration for its deportation efforts, canceled federal programs, so-called weaponization of the Justice Department and efforts to send the National Guard into American cities \u2014 including Portland, Oregon.",
      "\"I've come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells,\" Merkley said at the outset of his speech. \"We're in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War. President Trump is shredding our Constitution.\"",
      "A slew of Merkley's fellow Democrats took turns asking him extended questions, giving him breaks over the course of his speech and providing a platform for other senators to make their own arguments. The address was the third-longest in the Senate since 1900, according to the Senate Press Gallery.",
      "Portland, which Merkley represents, has been a target of Mr. Trump's ire for years and again came into focus last month, when the president directed the Defense Department to coordinate the deployment of National Guard troops to the city. On Monday, a federal appeals court cleared the way for the administration to federalize and deploy members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland while a legal challenge moves forward.",
      "\"President Trump wants us to believe that Portland, Oregon, in my home state, is full of chaos and riots because if he can say to the American people that there are riots, he can say there's a rebellion,\" Merkley said. \"And if there's a rebellion, he can use that to strengthen his authoritarian grip on our nation. Pretend there are riots, or even try to provoke violence, and tighten his authoritarian grip.\"",
      "Merkley said Portlanders aren't \"taking the bait.\" Instead, he said, \"they are demonstrating with joy and whimsy.\"",
      "\"They want to make it clear to the world that what Trump is saying about there being violent protests or a rebellion in Portland is just not true,\" he added.",
      "The remarks come as Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over how to fund the government, with the shutdown stretching into a fourth week Wednesday. Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, criticized the speech in a post on X before it began Tuesday evening, highlighting that Capitol Police are not being paid.",
      "\"The Democrats are going to make Capitol Police and Capitol support staff \u2014 who they refuse to pay \u2014 work all night so they can give speeches patting themselves on the back for shutting down the government and hurting the American people,\" Barrasso said.",
      "Merkley's marathon address follows a record-breaking speech by Booker on the Senate floor earlier this year, spanning more than 25 hours. The speech was also made in a protest against the Trump administration's policies. In 2017, Merkley delivered one of the longest Senate floor speeches on record when he spoke for more than 15 hours to oppose the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer praised Merkley on the floor as the speech approached 21 hours in the afternoon.",
      "\"I just want to thank the great senator from Oregon for his strength, his fortitude, his integrity, and just shining a spotlight on this erosion of democracy under Trump,\" Schumer said.",
      "\"I've been on the Senate floor to ring the alarm bells for a long time,\" Merkley said as he began wrapping up his remarks.",
      "He thanked members of his staff and the Capitol Police and staff who stayed to continue the chamber's operations, and colleagues who engaged with him during the remarks.",
      "\"We are in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War,\" Merkley said. \"President Trump is shredding our Constitution.\"",
      "Editor's note: A previous version of this story said Merkley's speech was the fourth-longest since 1900, not the third-longest. That was based on a list that included a 23-hour, 30-minute speech by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1986, but a revised version of the list noted that D'Amato took an extended break during his remarks.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have long debated whether dinosaurs were in decline before an\u00a0asteroid smacked the Earth 66 million years ago, causing mass extinction.",
      "New research suggests dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike, but it's only one piece of the global picture, independent experts say.",
      "\"Dinosaurs were quite diverse and now we know there were quite distinct communities\" roaming around before being abruptly wiped out, said Daniel Peppe, a study co-author and paleontologist at Baylor University.",
      "The latest evidence comes from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "Scientists now say those fossils and the surrounding rocks date from around 400,000 years before the asteroid struck, which is considered a short interval in geologic time. The age was determined by analyzing small particles of volcanic glass within sandstone and by studying the direction of magnetic minerals within the mudstone of the rock formation.",
      "The results show \"the animals deposited here must have been living close to the end of the Cretaceous,\" the last dinosaur era, said Peppe.",
      "The findings were published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Differences between the dinosaur species found in New Mexico and those found at a site in Montana that were previously dated to the same time frame \"run counter to the idea that dinosaurs were in decline,\" Peppe said.",
      "The fossils previously found at the New Mexico site include Tyrannosaurus rex and a Triceratops-like horned herbivore.",
      "The biggest dinosaur examined in the study was the plant-eating Alamosaurus, which could weigh more than 30 tons and measure about 100 feet long.",
      "\"Nothing illustrates how dinosaurs were thriving up to the very end more than the fact that Alamosaurus, one of the biggest dinosaurs ever - in fact, one of the very biggest animals to ever live on land in the entire history of the Earth - was there to witness the asteroid,\" University of Edinburgh paleontologist and study co-author Steve Brusatte told the Reuters news agency.",
      "\"So not only were sauropods still around when the asteroid hit, they were still thriving, still sublime, still colossal, still glorious,\" Brusatte told Reuters. \"I can imagine the scene: one minute, a jet plane-sized dinosaur was shaking the ground as it walked, the next minute the whole Earth was shaking with the energy unleashed by the asteroid.\"",
      "A research team in 2019 found that the steroid strike ignited a chaotic day of fires, earthquakes, and tsunamis, which led to a prolonged period of global cooling.",
      "Scientists who weren't involved in the study cautioned that evidence found at a single location might not point to a broader trend.",
      "\"This new evidence about these very late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is very exciting,\" said University of Bristol paleontologist Mike Benton, who was not involved in the study. But he added, \"This is just one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur faunas at the time all over North America or all over the world.\"",
      "Although scientists have found dinosaur fossils on every continent, accurately dating them can be a challenge, said paleontologist and study co-author Andrew Flynn of New Mexico State University. Easily datable material, such as carbon, doesn't survive in fossils, so scientists must look for surrounding rocks with precise characteristics that can be used to determine ages.",
      "Further research might help complete the picture of what range of dinosaur species was alive globally on the eve of the asteroid crash, said Flynn.",

    "story": [
      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says, \"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\"",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\"",

    "summary": "AI companyy said the new browser is now available on Apple laptops that run on macOS and will expand to other platforms soon.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI said Tuesday it is launching an artificial intelligence-powered website browser, heightening the company's competition with Google, the Alphabet-owned unit that has long dominated online search.",
      "The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, is for now only available on Apple laptops that run the company's Mac operating system. Access will soon expand to Apple's iOS, Microsoft Windows and Google's Android platforms, OpenAI said.",
      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon says a massive outage of its cloud computing service has been resolved as of Monday evening, after a problem disrupted internet use around the world, taking down a broad range of online services, including social media, gaming, food delivery, streaming and financial platforms.",
      "The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it suddenly breaks down.",
      "About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was starting to recover, but it wasn't until 6 p.m. Eastern that \"services returned to normal operations,\" Amazon said on its AWS health website, where it tracks outages.",
      "Cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple said \"a slow and bumpy recovery process\" is \"entirely normal.\"",
      "Amazon pinned the outage on issues related to its domain name system that converts web addresses into IP addresses, which are numeric designations that identify locations on the internet. Those addresses allow websites and apps to load on internet-connected devices.",
      "Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages, said in a Facebook post that it received over 11 million user reports of problems at more than 2,500 companies.",
      "The Amazon division provides remote computing services to many apps, websites, governments, universities and companies. Early Monday, users reported issues with Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, online broker Robinhood, the McDonald's app and many others, according to Downdetector.",
      "Even Amazon's own services weren't immune. Users of the company's Ring doorbell cameras and Alexa-powered smart speakers posted on DownDetector that they weren't working, while others said they were unable to access the Amazon website or download books to their Kindle.",
      "By mid-morning, Amazon said it had started to recover, but around 1 p.m. ET, users were still reporting problems. Thousands of Venmo users reported difficulties at about 1:30 p.m. ET, while people also reported problems with AI chatbot Claude, the Wall Street Journal and Amazon services like Alexa around the same time, according to Downdetector.",
      "Some companies and apps posted on social media to alert their users that the AWS outage was impacting their services.",
      "\"An Amazon Web Services outage is impacting information in Transit app. The length of disruption is currently unknown. We apologize for any inconvenience,\" said RTC Southern Nevada, the transit authority for the region, on X at 1:54 p.m. ET.",
      "The outage also had ripple effects in the travel industry, with major airline carriers\u00a0reporting issues.",
      "A Southwest spokesperson said the outage affected the airline's ability to efficiently dispatch some early morning flights, while United said it disrupted customers' access to the United app and website overnight. Delta said the issue caused a small numbers of minor delays Monday morning.",
      "The nation's railroad services were also affected. Amtrak reported at 1:30 p.m. EDT that it was experiencing \"intermittent technical difficulties\" which hobbled SMS, email and push notifications, and prevented customers from booking reservations through Amtrak.com or the mobile app.",

      "How did this start?",
      "Amazon first reported the outage issue at 3:11 a.m. ET. Shortly after, it said its services in its eastern U.S. region were disrupted and engineers were working to understand what was causing the problem. At 5:27 a.m. ET, AWS began reporting progress, saying, \"We are seeing significant signs of recovery.\"",

      "Norfolk, Virginia \u2014 New York Attorney General Letitia James pleaded not guilty Friday to federal charges of bank fraud in Norfolk, Virginia, after the Justice Department indicted her earlier this month.",
      "\"Not guilty, Judge, to both counts,\" James told U.S. District Judge Jamar Walker, appointed to the federal bench by former President Joe Biden, who is presiding over the case.",
      "A trial in James' case is set to begin Jan. 26, though that could change. Walker said the proceedings should last roughly five days. James was released on her own recognizance.",
      "In remarks outside the courthouse after the proceeding, James thanked supporters \u2014 who were chanting \"we stand with you\" and had gathered for her arraignment. She said their support \"strengthened my spirit.\"",
      "\"This is not about me. This is about all of us and about a justice system which has been weaponized, a justice system which has been used as a tool of revenge \u2026 and a weapon against those individuals who simply did their job and who stood up for the rule of law, and a justice system which unfortunately is being used as a vehicle of retribution,\" she said.",
      "\"But my faith is strong and my faith is \u2026 I have this belief in the justice system and the rule of law, and I have a belief in America,\" James said.",
      "The New York attorney general said she has heard from people across the country urging her to remain strong.",
      "\"There's no fear today, no fear,\" James said. \"Because I believe that justice will rain down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream, and I'm here to say that my work and my job and all that I do all throughout my public career \u2014 I've stood up for the rights of New Yorkers and Americans and I will not be deterred ... I will not be distracted. I will do my job each and every day.\"",
      "James' lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said during the arraignment that he will seek to have the charges against James tossed out on several grounds, including vindictive and selective prosecution, and that the indictment does not allege appropriate charges.",
      "The judge set hearings on those motions for December.",
      "The indictment alleges that James misrepresented how she would use a house she bought in Norfolk in 2020, in order to obtain a lower interest rate on her mortgage. Instead of using the property as a second home, the indictment says, she rented it to a family member, treating it as an investment property, in contravention of the mortgage terms.",
      "According to the indictment, James purchased the home for $137,000 and borrowed $109,600 \u2014 and because she received more favorable lending terms and a larger seller credit, she allegedly saved $18,933 over the life of the loan.",
      "James called the charges \"baseless\" in a video statement.",
      "\"This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system,\" she said.",
      "James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, said James \"flatly and forcefully denies these charges\" and said he is \"deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.\"",
      "In a\u00a0pair of\u00a0legal filings\u00a0Thursday, James' legal team took aim at the Trump-appointed prosecutor overseeing her bank fraud case, accusing interim U.S. attorney Lindsey Halligan of an improper conversation with a journalist and vowing to seek dismissal of the indictment on the grounds that\u00a0Halligan\u00a0was unlawfully named to the job.",
      "Shortly after the proceeding ended, Lowell\u00a0filed\u00a0his bid to have the indictment dismissed on the grounds that Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney was invalid and unconstitutional. He's also seeking a court order that would block Halligan from supervising the prosecution of James' case and exercising any other duties as interim U.S. attorney.",
      "Halligan, he wrote, \"had no authority to litigate this case on behalf of the United States.\"",
      "\"[B]ecause this indictment would not have been sought or obtained absent Ms. Halligan's unlawful appointment \u2026 the indictment's flaws cannot be brushed aside as harmless error,\" Lowell wrote. \"This Court must reject the Executive Branch's brazen attempt to sidestep the constitutional and statutory limitations on the appointment of U.S. Attorneys.\"",
      "Days before James was indicted, a grand jury impaneled by the same federal prosecutor's office handed up an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, on charges of lying to Congress, with whom Mr. Trump clashed during his first term. Comey is also seeking to have the charges against him tossed out on the basis that Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney is invalid and unlawful.",
      "A hearing on those efforts in both Comey and James' cases will be held Nov. 13 in the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, before South Carolina federal judge Cameron Curry.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against Comey and James, as well as Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California, another vocal critic of his administration.",
      "The Justice Department launched a criminal probe into James in May regarding mortgage fraud. Three months later, it expanded its investigation into the Office of the New York Attorney General's handling of the Trump Organization probe.",
      "In February 2024, the state of New York won a civil fraud judgment\u00a0against Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization for $354 million in fines for submitting what the judge said was \"blatantly false financial data\" to accountants in order to borrow more money at more favorable interest rates.",
      "The ruling also barred the Trump Organization from seeking loans from financial institutions in New York for three years and also banned Mr. Trump from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation for three years. An appellate court erased the fine in August, but James is appealing the ruling. The court kept the other sanctions in place, however.",
      "Mr. Trump announced last month that he had selected Halligan, a former White House aide, to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Virginia after the abrupt ouster of the prosecutor he had originally named to the post, Erik Siebert.",
      "Sources told CBS News that Halligan presented evidence to the Comey and Letitia James grand juries alone, rather than with line prosecutors who had worked on the cases. Since Halligan became the interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, several prosecutors have left the office or been fired.",
      "Two federal prosecutors in the office, Kristin Bird and Elizabeth Yusi, were terminated last week from their posts as assistant U.S. attorneys in the Norfolk office after they voiced opposition to the criminal case against James. The office's top national security official, Michael Ben'Ary, was also terminated in recent weeks.",
      "As a result of the turnover, two North Carolina federal prosecutors have been brought in to handle the Comey case, and a federal prosecutor from Missouri will be presenting the James case.",

    "story": [
      "Jill Hornick, a 59-year-old service representative at a Social Security Administration field office in Illinois, would normally have received her latest paycheck on Friday. Instead, she was last paid on Oct. 10 \u2014 for three days less than she had worked.",
      "Hornick is defined as an essential worker and continues to report to the office on a daily basis during the government shutdown. She said she doesn't have time to search for a second job and isn't eligible for unemployment benefits. Because of the stalemate in Congress, now in its 24th day, Hornick also has no clue on when the next paycheck will arrive.",
      "\"It's very annoying that employees who are furloughed can collect unemployment, but employees who are essential and have to work without pay cannot collect unemployment,\" Hornick told CBS News. \"And yet I am showing up on my own dime because we still have to pay money to put gas in the car, pay the daycare center, because they are not going to take kids for free.\"",
      "While roughly 670,000 federal employees are furloughed, approximately 730,000 other government employees deemed essential \u2014 such as air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers\u00a0\u2014 continue to work without pay during the shutdown, according to estimates from the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "Hornick, whose annual income is about $75,000 a year, is now scrambling to stay afloat. That means paring her spending and contacting her mortgage lender and other creditors to ask for lenience.",
      "\"I got a letter from mortgage company saying I was approved for deferred payment and that they wouldn't take foreclosure action against me,\" she said, although she remains anxious about what the future will bring.",
      "\"Who knows how long my mortgage company will allow this to go on before they foreclose on my house,\" Hornick added.",
      "Hornick said she has eliminated what she describes as \"all nonessential spending.\"",
      "\"I had a hair appointment for Saturday that I made before the shutdown and it's canceled because I have dogs, so I am making sure they are fed and have veterinarian care,\" she said.",

      "apGovannon said some of his home appliances, including his oven, have stopped working, but repairs will have to wait until he gets paid. To reduce their costs, he and his partner are also cutting back on entertainment, such as going to the movies and eating out.",
      "\"It's something we were considering anyway with the economy going the way it is, but it's much more urgent now. It's important to hunker down,\" apGovannon said.",
      "Asked if he would consider leaving the federal government for the private sector, apGovannon, who has been in his current role since 2019, said he is \"in it for the long haul.\" But he can appreciate why some colleagues might want to leave government service.",
      "\"lt's hard to say to younger people, 'Hey, come work for us \u2014 you never know if you're going to be fired or not.'\" apGovannon told CBS News. \"Their perception is that government work, which was once safe, no longer is.\"",
      "Hornick, who is nearing the end of her career at the SSA and plans to retire from government work, said she would \"not recommend anyone come work for the federal government with everything that's going on.\"",
      "Accruing interest as shutdown continues",
      "Brooke Hardison, 47, a furloughed communications director at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service, said she is accruing interest on unpaid credit card bills and feels like she \"has to protect every penny, because we just don't know what happens next.\"",
      "That's meant canceling travel and delaying repairing a faulty door in her home, Hardison said. Her husband works for a government contractor focused on information technology, potentially putting his income in jeopardy as long as federal funding remains frozen.",
      "\"It is up in the air,\" she said. \"We are bracing for impact to both of our jobs.\"",
      "Like other federal workers, Hardison, who lives in Bowie, Maryland and who has worked for the government for 20 years, said that for the first time she is considering leaving public service for the private sector.",
      "\"I had started thinking about looking outside the government because of the changes that have happened in being a government employee, and the totality of the job,\" she told CBS News. \"I always assumed I would retire from the government.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said late Thursday he's ending trade talks with Canada, citing an anti-tariff ad campaign by the province of Ontario that uses late President Ronald Reagan's voice.",
      "\"Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,\" the president wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The president appeared to be referencing an ad released last week\u00a0by Ontario that includes excerpts from a 1987 radio address given by Reagan, in which the former president said tariffs work \"only for a short time\" and \"hurt every American worker and consumer.\"",
      "\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" Reagan said, as quoted by the ad.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Global Affairs Canada.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement on Friday that the Trump administration \"has repeatedly sought to address Canada's longstanding, unfair trade barriers.\"",
      "\"These good-faith efforts with Canadian officials have not led to any constructive progress,\" Desai said. \"Ontario's taxpayer-funded ad campaign on American TV networks \u2014 that misleadingly edited President Reagan's 1987 radio address about trade \u2014 is the latest example of how Canadian officials would rather play games than engage with the administration. As President Trump made clear on Truth Social, further talks are a futile effort if Canada can't be serious.\"",
      "Doug Ford, Ontario's premier, wrote Friday of the close ties between the U.S. and Canada.",
      "\"Canada and the United States are friends, neighbours and allies. President Ronald Reagan knew that we are stronger together. God bless Canada and God bless the United States,\" Ford said in a social media post.",
      "Earlier Thursday, the Ronald Reagan Foundation said in a statement\u00a0that the ad used \"selective audio\" and \"misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address.\" The foundation also said the government of Ontario didn't seek permission to use snippets from Reagan's address, and said it is \"reviewing its legal options in this matter.\"",
      "Mr. Trump pointed to the Ronald Reagan Foundation's statement in his Truth Social post, calling Ontario's ad \"FAKE\" and claiming it \"only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court\" \u2014 referring to a pending case on the legality of Mr. Trump's tariff strategy.",
      "Canada is the second-largest trading partner for the U.S. after Mexico, with the U.S. importing $412.7 billion worth of Canadian goods last year, and Canada buying $349.4 billion in American goods, according to\u00a0U.S. statistics.",
      "But relations between the U.S. and its northern neighbor have frayed amid Mr. Trump's trade strategy. He initially imposed higher tariffs on Canada earlier this year, accusing the country of not doing enough to stem the flow of illicit drugs and migration across the border \u2014 allegations that Canadian officials pushed back on.",
      "Over the summer, Mr. Trump\u00a0hiked tariffs on the country\u00a0to 35%, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "Back in March, Canada imposed 25% retaliatory tariffs on many U.S. products not covered by the USMCA. But in August, as part of efforts to reach a deal on tariffs, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney\u00a0said those retaliatory tariffs were being lifted. The two nations have yet to reach such a deal.",
      "Meanwhile, Carney\u00a0said earlier this week\u00a0the country would seek to double its exports to countries other than the U.S., citing the \"pall of uncertainty\" caused by American tariffs.",
      "Still, Carney has sought to negotiate with Mr. Trump, visiting the White House earlier this month.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Justice Department said Friday that the Trump administration is seeking to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia and said the West African nation has agreed to accept him.",
      "In a\u00a0filing\u00a0with a federal judge in Maryland, Justice Department lawyers said that immigration officials expect to formally notify Abrego Garcia later Friday that Liberia has been designated as the new country of removal. They said the Trump administration expects to be able to deport Abrego Garcia as soon as Oct. 31.",
      "The administration has \"received diplomatic assurances regarding the treatment of third-country individuals removed to Liberia from the United States and are making the final necessary arrangements for [Abrego Garcia's] removal,\" they wrote.",
      "In the court filing, the Justice Department said that Abrego Garcia had identified more than 20 countries that he fears would persecute or torture him if he were removed there, and Liberia is not on the list.",
      "\"Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States's closest partners on the African continent,\" they wrote.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's attorney, said the administration \"has chosen yet another path that feels designed to inflict maximum hardship.\"",
      "\"Their actions are punitive, cruel and unconstitutional,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"Unless Liberia guarantees that it will not re-deport Mr. Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, then sending him to Liberia is no less unlawful than sending him directly to El Salvador a second time.\"",
      "The Trump administration's plan to remove Abrego Garcia to Liberia comes as the Maryland judge, Paula Xinis, is weighing whether to release the Salvadoran man from immigration custody while a challenge to the Department of Homeland Security's ongoing efforts to deport him for a second time moves forward.",
      "Abrego Garcia was removed to his home country of El Salvador in March and imprisoned there despite having been granted a legal status in 2019 that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him there because of possible persecution by local gangs. An immigration official with the Trump administration admitted that Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an error, and Xinis ordered the Department of Homeland Security to facilitate his return to the U.S.",
      "But immigration officials resisted doing so for months. Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. in June, but only after a federal grand jury in Tennessee indicted him on two charges of human smuggling stemming from a November 2022 traffic stop.",
      "Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to the charges, and a judge in Tennessee said he should be released on bail ahead of the criminal trial, which is set to begin in January. But he remained in criminal confinement for several more weeks because his lawyers were concerned that the Trump administration would arrest him again upon his release and deport him.",
      "Abrego Garcia was\u00a0released from the Putnam County Jail in Tennessee in August and returned to Maryland, where he has lived since coming to the U.S. illegally in 2011. Days later, he was taken into custody by immigration authorities after being summoned for an interview at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore. The Trump administration notified Abrego Garcia's lawyers he may be deported to Uganda, though Abrego Garcia expressed fear of persecution and torture, as well as a concern that the Ugandan government would send him back to El Salvador.",
      "Since then, the Trump administration has searched for countries to accept Abrego Garcia and has sought to remove him to the African nations of Eswatini and Ghana. Neither of those two countries nor Uganda have agreed to take him. Abrego Garcia has said he would go to Costa Rica and designated it as his preferred country of removal. While Costa Rica has\u00a0indicated it would provide him refugee status or residency, a Justice Department lawyer said during a hearing earlier this month there had not been discussions about deporting him there.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg, his lawyer, reiterated on Friday that Costa Rica \"remains a viable and lawful option.\"",
      "Xinis has forbidden the Trump administration from deporting Abrego Garcia while she considers his challenge to his ongoing detention by immigration officials and the efforts to remove him again.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:40:27 -0400",
    "summary": "Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment is aimed at helping the program's 75 million beneficiaries keep pace with inflation.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration on Friday announced a 2.8%\u00a0cost-of-living adjustment for 2026, an increase that will automatically boost monthly payments for the program's roughly 71 million beneficiaries starting early next year.",
      "The increase represents an uptick from the last year's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, which set the 2025 increase at 2.5%. Inflation has edged higher this year. The Labor Department said Friday that the Consumer Price Index, a closely watched gauge of U.S. inflation, rose at an annual rate of 3% in September.",
      "Next year's COLA increase will boost the average Social Security payment by about $56 to an average monthly benefit of $2,071, starting in January, the Social Security Administration said. People who receive Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income and disabled people, will see their first COLA increase with their Dec. 31, 2025 check, the agency said.",
      "The annual COLA is designed to ensure that seniors, disabled Americans and other Social Security beneficiaries don't lose purchasing power to inflation. Even so, a recent poll by the AARP, an advocacy group for older Americans, found that many seniors think the retirement program's inflation adjustments are falling short and that they need an annual COLA of about 5% to keep up with their daily expenses.",
      "\"The cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security is one of the few inflation-adjusted programs for retirees,\" Jenn Jones, AARP's vice president of government affairs, told CBS News. \"It is incredibly important to millions of Americans, and so although it may not feel like it's quite enough, especially after the last few years, it's critically helpful for keeping pace with rising costs.\"",
      "In a statement, Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano said the cost-of-living adjustment \"is one way we are working to make sure benefits reflect today's economic realities and continue to provide a foundation of security.\"",
      "How SSA calculates its annual COLA",
      "The Social Security Administration announces the COLA each fall based on a metric known as the \"Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers,\" or\u00a0CPI-W, which tracks the average change in prices paid by workers for a basket of commonly bought goods and services.",
      "The COLA is based on that inflation data from July through September.",
      "Some advocates for older Americans say the CPI-W fails to accurately reflect seniors' financial needs because it tracks younger workers, while retirees tend to face higher costs for health care, housing and some other items. Seniors on Medicare, the health insurance program for those over 65, spend 13.6% of their income on health-related expenses, more than double that of younger people, according to KFF.",
      "Meanwhile, poverty is on the rise among America's seniors, with the poverty rate among seniors rising to 15% last year, up from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to recent Census data. The AARP said more older adults are struggling with the rising cost of housing and utility costs.",
      "\"Most Social Security beneficiaries aren't working \u2014 you are on a fixed income, so any inflation increase you feel,\" Jones said. \"If the increases continue, it becomes difficult to figure out how you're going to pay for all of your monthly expenses.\"",
      "How Medicare costs could impact benefits",
      "Advocates for senior citizens say the COLA is likely to fall short, especially given forecasts for increases in Medicare's premiums and deductibles for 2026. The Medicare premium is taken directly from seniors' Social Security checks.",
      "While Medicare hasn't yet announced its 2026 premiums, its trustees report issued earlier this year projected that the standard monthly premium for Part B \u2014 which covers doctors visits and outpatient care \u2014 would likely rise to $206.50, or a 12% boost from its current rate. Deductibles are also projected to rise about 12% next year, the report said.",
      "The result: Seniors could see most of their 2026 COLA eaten up by higher Medicare costs, the National Council on Aging said in a statement.",
      "\"COLA might reflect the inflation rate, but it is woefully insufficient for older Americans who already have high health care costs and are facing even greater increases in their Medicare costs in 2026,\" Ramsey Alwin, CEO of the NCA, said in the statement.",
      "Seniors are likely to be disappointed by the 2026 COLA, which represents the second-smallest bump since 2021. Many are at risk of falling behind, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group.",
      "The Consumer Price Index for September, also released on Friday, showed that medical and elderly care costs are surpassing the 3% annualized pace of inflation. Costs for caring for the elderly at home jumped 11.6% last month on an annual basis, while medical services rose 3.9%.",
      "\"Seniors on fixed incomes are rightly concerned that the Social Security COLA is not keeping pace with the true impact of inflation on their living costs, especially in areas where prices are soaring.\u00a0 Medical, housing and grocery costs are outstripping the COLA,\" Max Richtman, the group's CEO, said in a statement.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 10:48:36 -0400",
    "summary": "Much of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",

    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",

      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",

      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns.

      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 10:42:03 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

      "The University of Michigan's October sentiment index, released Friday, shows consumer sentiment decreased by 1.5% on a monthly basis to 53.6%. The index has recovered slightly after dipping to a three-year low in April, but still remains below its January 2025 level over deepening concerns about vulnerabilities in the U.S. economy \u2014 with the impact being felt differently across income groups, experts note.",
      "\"The lower to median end of the income spectrum are increasingly concerned about job prospects and income prospects, and that is weighing on their morale at a time where prices are rising,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Greg Daco told CBS News prior to the index's release. \"So it's really an affordability issue.\"",
      "The closely watched consumer sentiment index gauges Americans' outlook on the job market, wages, inflation, business conditions and personal finances on a monthly basis.",
      "\"It's the only piece of data that we get in the absence of how consumers are spending,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Greg Daco told CBS News.",
      "Inflation expectations crept in October, an indicator that Americans are still feeling the strain of high prices. According to Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at University of Michigan, the increase in long-run inflation expectations from 3.7% last month to 3.9% this month was driven primarily by independents and Republicans.",
      "\"Inflation and high prices remain at the forefront of consumers' minds,\" she said in a statement.",
      "The government shutdown appears to have had little impact on consumers' economic outlooks. Only about 2% spontaneously referenced the shutdown during the University of Michigan's interviews in October, compared with the 10% of consumers in January 2019, when the government shut down for a 35-day stretch, Hsu said.",

    "summary": "Stephan Smerk, a married father in Niskayuna, New York, turns himself in for the cold case murder of artist and mother Robin Lawrence in Springfield, Virginia.",
    "story": [
      "When Stephan Smerk called Fairfax County Police Detective Melissa Wallace on Sept. 7, 2023, she was shocked to hear what he had to say.",
      "\"He says, I'm at the police department to turn myself in,\" Wallace told \"48 Hours\" correspondent Anne-Marie Green, in \"Closing the Cold Case of Robin Lawrence,\" airing Saturday, Oct. 25 at 10/9c on CBS and Paramount+. \"And I said, turn yourself in for what?\"",
      "Smerk, a married 52-year-old father of two living in Niskayuna, New York, was calling to confess to the 30-year-old cold case murder of Robin Warr Lawrence.",
      "\"A million things start going through my mind,\" Wallace said. \"The adrenaline was pumping so hard because the reality hit \u2026 of what this means and that we're getting ready to close this case.\"",
      "Robin Warr Lawrence, an artist and mother, was brutally murdered in her home in Springfield, Virginia, in 1994. For two days, her daughter Nicole, just 2 years old at the time, roamed the house alone before her mother's body was discovered. And for three decades after that, detectives tried to figure out who could have done this to Robin.",
      "\"Who would do such a thing? Why?\" said Mary Warr Cowans, Robin's sister. \"I remember thinking at the funeral, Robin's killer could be in this room with us. We didn't know.\"",
      "It took decades, but eventually the family would get their answers. DNA evidence \u2014 in the form of blood left on a washcloth \u2014 had been found at the crime scene back in 1994, and at the time it had turned up no matches when investigators ran it through CODIS \u2014 the FBI's national database. Years went by and new techniques were developed, including a process called genetic genealogy.",
      "In genetic genealogy, a suspect's DNA is used to find their relatives. Then investigators research those relatives' family trees until a potential person of interest is found \u2014 someone who would have been the right age and in the right place at the right time to commit the crime. Parabon NanoLabs, a DNA technology company that often works with law enforcement, did not have high hopes for solving Robin's case using this technique because the database matches were very distant.",
      "\"Parabon gave us a solvability rate of zero on the case,\" said Wallace.",
      "Fairfax County Police Department volunteer Liz, who asked that her last name not be used, thought she'd take a crack at it anyway. The process proved difficult. \"I was ready to give up a number of times,\" Liz told \"48 Hours.\" \"But I kept thinking, well, I'll just finish this or just do this one more thing.\"",
      "After three years of doing just one more thing, Liz came up with a possible suspect. He'd lived in Virginia in 1994 and would have been around the right age to commit the murder. His name was Stephan Smerk.",
      "\"I wasn't very hopeful at the time,\" Wallace said. \"I was just looking at this guy's background. I'm thinking, there is no way.\"",
      "Smerk had a completely clean record, without so much as a speeding ticket. He worked as a computer programmer in suburban Niskayuna.",
      "Though they had their doubts, Detectives Melissa Wallace and Jon Long took the trip up to Niskayuna to talk to Smerk. Their goal was to get his DNA, to see if he was related to the person who had left their DNA at the crime scene \u2013 or if he was that person.",
      "\"He comes to the door right away,\" Wallace said. \"All we said is we are detectives from Fairfax County, Virginia, and we're looking into a cold case from the 90s.\"",
      "Smerk, detectives say, had no reaction. \"Stone-faced,\" said Long. Smerk gave his DNA willingly, and Wallace and Long went back to their hotel. Then Wallace got that call.",
      "\"I was freaking out,\" Wallace said. \"I run down to [Long's] room, while I'm still on the phone, and I'm banging on his door, and he comes to the door, like, what is the problem? I'm like, we got to go to the police department.\"",
      "When they met Smerk at the Niskayuna Police Department, officers had taken him into custody and he was ready to talk. Wallace and Long sat him down in an interrogation room, and without much prompting, Smerk confessed to the murder of Robin Warr Lawrence. He had gone to Robin's home that night in 1994, he told them, for no other reason than wanting to kill someone.",
      "\"I knew that I was going kill somebody,\" Smerk told the detectives. \"I did not know who I was going to kill.\" At the time, Smerk was in the military and posted at a base nearby and was familiar with Robin Warr Lawrence's neighborhood because a friend had stayed there. He said he had no idea who lived in Robin's house.",
      "\"There could have been 50 people in that house. I don't know. They could have all had guns and shot me dead. I wasn't even thinking about that.\" All Smerk was thinking about, he told detectives, was killing. He said he had compulsions that he couldn't control.",
      "\"I honestly believe that if it wasn't for my wife and my kids, I probably would be a serial killer,\" Smerk said. \"I am a serial killer who's only killed once.\"",
      "\"It's such a shocking statement,\" Wallace told \"48 Hours.\" \"It makes no sense. You know, if you're a serial killer, you don't kill once. But, on the other hand, he was very candid and open and honest throughout the rest of the interview. So, it could be true that he has only killed one person.\"",
      "Is it possible for someone with the impulses of a serial killer to kill just once? Former FBI profiler Mary Ellen O'Toole says it can happen.",
      "\"We have learned over the years with cases like BTK and the Golden State Killer and other cases where they do stop,\" she explained. \"The compulsions don't go away \u2026 they tell us that they rechannel it. They put it into a different activity. So that activity can be something that is less than murder, but it could involve, for example, Peeping Tom behavior, autoerotic behavior \u2026 but you don't just cut those urges off. Something has to replace them.\"",
      "Smerk had zero incidents on his record. O'Toole says it's possible he never committed another crime, but she doubts the ideas in his head went away. She said she'd like to know more about his ideation in order to determine whether he could be a threat in the future.",
      "\"That ideation that really led to the murder in the first place, that would be troubling to me until I knew a lot more about that. What triggered it? What are you doing with it now? Don't tell me it's never there. Don't tell me that it just went out the window after you committed that murder.\"",
      "In his interview, Smerk expressed no remorse for what he had done. When asked if he had anything he'd like to tell Robin's family, he replied, \"How do I say this? I know you're recording \u2026 I don't feel anything for the family. \u2026I feel bad that I did it because I knew someday my personal freedom would be affected.\"",
      "Smerk pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 70 years in prison. He will be eligible for parole in 2037, when he is 65. Robin's family said they are glad to have closure as long as Smerk spends the rest of his life behind bars, but the consequences of his actions will never leave them.",
      "\"It helped to know that a person was found and being held responsible,\" Warr Cowans said in her statement to the judge at Smerk's sentencing, \"but it didn't help to know what he did to [Robin] and how she suffered \u2026 it doesn't help and it doesn't bring her back. She would have been in our lives for the past thirty years. But that was taken from us.\"",
      "She told \"48 Hours\" that for a long time she lived in fear, not knowing who had committed this horrible crime.",
      "\"I actually felt afraid at home, in my bed,\" she said. \"Thinking about someone just from out of the blue could show up from anywhere and kill you in your house ... That's just a scary thought that you're not safe anywhere.\"",
      "\"It's scary,\" echoed Long. \"From a community perspective, that's like your worst nightmare. Like, that's the reason why you tell like your loved ones to make sure that your doors are locked at night. He is the boogeyman.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 10:37:58 -0400",
    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

    "summary": "A lapse in funding due to the shutdown could have a devastating effect on the millions of Americans who rely on the federal food stamps program for groceries.",
    "story": [
      "States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.",
      "\"Starting October 16, SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA,\" reads a\u00a0notice from the Pennsylvania state website.",
      "New Jersey,\u00a0Maryland, New York and\u00a0Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.",
      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program.",
      "Advocates and SNAP recipients have warned the effects of being cut off from nutrition assistance could be devastating.",
      "Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger, said delayed SNAP benefits would mean individuals have to make extreme choices such as whether to pay their rent or feed their kids. Many recipients, she said, are living paycheck to paycheck and that's the reason they depend on SNAP.",
      "According to the USDA, 73% of SNAP recipients had a gross monthly income at or below 100% of the poverty level in fiscal year 2023.",
      "While the majority of beneficiaries are not expected to work while on SNAP, primarily because they are children, older adults or disabled people, most SNAP participants who can work do so, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute, said in an April report.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "That could be an issue for SNAP recipients like Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident who receives around $260 a month in SNAP benefits. Powers said she'll be OK if benefits don't come through in November, but a longer delay would force her to change how she shops. The fresh produce she buys to keep a healthy diet would no longer be in her budget, she said.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Powers told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on plans under consideration.",
      "Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, said in an email note that the administration is legally required to use contingency funds to pay for November SNAP benefits.",
      "\"It could have, and should have, taken steps weeks ago to be ready to use these funds,\" she said.",
      "In a separate move Thursday, the United States Conference of Mayors, a nonpartisan organization that represents mayors in over 1,000 cities, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, calling on the USDA to use \"all available resources, including the SNAP contingency fund\" to prevent SNAP benefits from being delayed.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, according to Plata-Nino.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states.",
      "The fate of WIC funding",
      "Another social safety net program that could be affected by the government shutdown is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. Known as WIC, the program provides nutrition assistance, including infant formula, to around 6.7 million people.",
      "The National WIC Association (NWA), the nonprofit education arm for the government program, warned Tuesday that millions of families could lose access to their WIC benefits as early as Nov. 1, when certain state agencies are set to run out of funds.",
      "The group said the White House provided temporary emergency funds that will stabilize the program through Oct. 31, but noted that those funds are rapidly depleting. To keep the programing running for the first two weeks of November, an additional $300 million is needed, according to NWA.",
      "\"Without additional funding, State WIC Agencies may be forced to take drastic measures that prevent families from accessing the services they need, such as halting food benefits,\" NWA said in a statement.",

      "Republicans have rejected Democrats' push to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",

    "summary": "Economists think inflation around the U.S. continued to climb in September, edging\u00a0farther away from the Fed's 2% annual target.",
    "story": [
      "A delayed inflation report on Friday is expected to deliver sobering data about the direction of U.S. prices, with economists forecasting that the Consumer Price Index in September rose at its fastest pace in 16 months.",
      "CPI last month is projected to have risen 3.1% on an annual basis, which would be the highest since the inflation gauge hit 3.3% in May of 2024, according to economists polled by FactSet. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the September CPI report on Friday at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time, or nine days later than it had originally been scheduled to issue the report before the U.S. government shutdown.",
      "Most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the stalemate. The Department of Labor is making an exception for the September CPI data because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "Inflation has crept higher this year, edging farther away from the Federal Reserve's annual 2% target, partly due to the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, according to economists. U.S. companies that import goods from other nations are on the hook for paying the tariffs, and they are passing on as much as 55% of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis.",
      "\"The forthcoming September CPI data will confirm a renewed acceleration in inflation, with price momentum evident across both goods and services,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco predicted Thursday a research note. \"The tariff impact is increasingly visible, though pass-through remains gradual and uneven.\"",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June of 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and spurred the Federal Reserve to ratchet up interest rates in a bid to quash inflation. When borrowing becomes more expensive, consumers and businesses tend to cut back on spending, which helps temper inflation.",
      "But the recent uptick in inflation is souring some Americans on the economy, with 59% of those\u00a0polled by CBS News earlier this month saying they feel the economy is getting worse. About two-thirds said they had noticed prices going up in recent weeks.",
      "How will inflation impact the Social Security COLA?",
      "The Social Security Administration on Friday is also expected to release its annual cost-of-living adjustment, basing its calculation on the inflation rate from July through September.",
      "That yearly financial bump, which ensures that 75 million Social Security recipients don't lose purchasing power as prices rise, is expected to come in at around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025, according to the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group.",
      "A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly Social Security payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062. Yet some advocates for senior citizens are concerned that retirees could face a financial pinch if prices continue to climb beyond their 2026 Social Security adjustment.",
      "What's the inflation outlook?",
      "Despite the recent rise in consumer prices, the Federal Reserve and most private economists expect inflation to ease next year. In September, the Fed forecast\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures \u2014 a measure of consumer spending and the central bank's preferred barometer of inflation \u2014 would show prices rising at a 3% annual rate in 2025, but then drop to 2.6% next year.",
      "The impact of U.S. tariffs on inflation has been more muted than what many economists were forecasting earlier this year, Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email. Companies have helped blunt the impact by expanding their inventories before the tariffs took effect, as well as absorbing some of the costs in the form of lower profits, she said.",
      "But there's a risk those strategies might not work for long, she added.",

      "Our commentary is from former New York Times columnist Charles Blow, on a disappearing staple of communities everywhere:",
      "Local news is in crisis. By some estimates, more than 3,200 print newspapers have vanished since 2005.",
      "According to Northwestern University/Medill's State of Local News 2024 report, the number of newsroom employees has declined 60 percent since 2000 \u2013 a collapse comparable in scale to the coal industry. And on average, two newspapers close each week.",
      "Public radio and public television are also part of the ecosystem of local news, and they, too, are now under threat after the government clawed back $1.1 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.",
      "To better understand this problem, I partnered with the MacArthur Foundation and Press Forward, a national coalition investing hundreds of millions of dollars to strengthen local newsrooms. For nearly two years, I traveled the country, speaking with policymakers, news entrepreneurs, reporters and residents, both to write about the crisis and to work on a documentary about it.",
      "What surprised me most was the broad recognition, on the ground, of how central these outlets are to community life, and the tremendous sense of loss when they disappear.",
      "The focus of these outlets was not only on \"big J\" journalism \u2013 accountability reporting that fulfills the Fourth Estate's mission to hold power to account. It is also on \"small j\" journalism \u2013 wedding announcements and obituaries, profiles of valedictorians and roundups of high school games. This connective tissue of local news strengthens communities and makes them whole.",
      "This also explains why people, even as they distrust or dislike national media, often embrace their local outlets.",
      "The perception of local news is shifting from a struggling industry to an essential public good. These newspapers are neighbors. They strengthen neighborhoods. Without them, division grows.",
      "A 2018 study published in the Journal of Communication found that \"[t]he decline of local newspapers and the 'nationalization' of political news are polarizing vote choice.\"",

    "summary": "Inflation last month rose at an annual rate of 3%, coming in below economists' forecasts as the impact of President Trump's tariffs remain muted.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index climbed at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in below economists' forecasts as the impact of President Trump's tariffs remain muted.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet had forecast CPI rose at a 3.1% annual clip last month. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "While most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the government shutdown, the Department of Labor is\u00a0making an exception\u00a0for the September CPI data. That's because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "What economists say",
      "Inflation is inching higher partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, according to economists. U.S. businesses are eating some of the costs in the form of lower profits, which has blunted the impact of the import duties on consumers.",
      "Still, companies are also passing on\u00a0as much as 55%\u00a0of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis. Other research shows a lower rate of passthrough tariff costs to shoppers.",
      "\"Tariffs have put upward pressure on prices, particularly in the goods-producing sector of the economy,\" Brandon Zureick, senior managing director and chief economist at investment firm Johnson Investment Counsel, told CBS News. \"We're definitely a little higher than where we started the year, and above the Fed's target\" of 2% annual inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a tool for protecting U.S. manufacturing, as well as to convince businesses to reshore their factories within the country, and for generating billions of new federal revenue.",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and set the Federal Reserve on a path of hiking interest rates. Higher borrowing costs can temper inflation because it makes loans and credit cards more expensive, which can cause consumers and businesses to pare spending.",
      "What does the CPI mean for interest rates?",
      "The recent rise in inflation is complicating the Fed's decision on interest rates, with the central bank scheduled to make its next rate decision on Oct. 29. But today's inflation data could provide additional support for another cut, analysts said Friday.",
      "\"There was little in today's benign CPI report to 'spook' the Fed and we continue to expect further easing at next week's Fed meeting,\" Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a Friday email. \"A December rate cut also remains likely with the current data drought providing the Fed with little reason to deviate from the path set out in the dot plot.\"",
      "Still, inflation is edging higher, which could be an argument for keeping rates steady. But at the same time, the job market is experiencing a\u00a0sharp slowdown in hiring, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited last month when the central bank made its first rate cut of 2025. Lower borrowing costs can help support the job market by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow, encouraging them to expand and hire.",
      "That means the combination of rising inflation and weakening job growt is putting the Fed's dual mandate \u2014 to keep both inflation and unemployment low \u2014 in conflict. Powell said earlier this month that the risks posed by the labor market may be outweighing concerns about rising inflation.",
      "\"The Fed has recognized the trends in the labor market as changing their directives,\" Zureick said. \"We've been dangerously close to a zero level of job growth for a few months.\"",
      "Given the Fed's focus on the labor market risks, the higher CPI rate isn't likely to derail expectations for a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's next meeting later this month, economists say.",
      "The probability of a 0.25-percentage point cut at the Fed's Oct. 29 meeting is pegged at 98.9%, according to CME FedWatch.",

    "story": [
      "Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro has been outspoken in his condemnation of the U.S. military strikes on what the Trump administration says are drug smuggling boats in international waters. Petro calls the strikes easy, but ineffective in tackling the mammoth problem of drug smuggling \u2014  and illegal to boot.",
      "The Trump administration has announced at least 10 such strikes on boats during the past two months, including two off Colombia's Pacific coast this week. The most recent came overnight, when Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the U.S. carried out \"a lethal kinetic strike\" on a vessel he said was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang, \"trafficking narcotics in the Caribbean Sea.\"",
      "Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the strike, which was conducted in international waters \u2014 and was the first strike at night. All six terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed in this strike.\"",
      "Aside from announcing the strikes, the U.S. military and the Trump administration have provided virtually no information about how they are carried out, based on what intelligence, or who, specifically, has been killed.",
      "In an exclusive conversation with CBS News, Petro said some of those killed in the U.S. strikes have been innocent civilians, and he reiterated his accusation that the attacks violate international law.",
      "The White House denies those accusations, and President Trump has defended the strikes as a legitimate part of his fight against drug trafficking gangs.",
      "Asked if he was ready to lower the rhetorical tone in his war of words with Mr. Trump, to seek a diplomatic way of stopping the U.S. attacks on boats, Petro insisted that he was merely replying to the American leader in kind.",
      "The Drug Enforcement Administration says about 90% of the cocaine that reaches the U.S. comes from Colombia, and President Trump has blamed Petro, saying he's failed to rein in drug cartels that operate in his country.",
      "\"They have insulted me,\" he told CBS News. \"And a lot, but all I can do is be frank.\"",
      "\"Colombia's a drug den,\" President Trump said recently. \"You got a lousy leader over there right now. Bad guy, a thug, but they make cocaine at levels that we've never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is correct to note that cocaine production in Colombia has increased in recent years. But Petro said the issue should be addressed as a collaborative effort, not unilateral sneak attacks. He said he would welcome Mr. Trump to his presidential palace for a dialogue, and was adamant that Colombia got no warning about the U.S. strikes.",
      "\"We don't even know where\" they're going to happen, he told CBS News. \"Nothing. We don't know if they had or didn't have cocaine.\"",
      "Petro said launching missiles at small boats carrying a few people is a war crime, and he noted that at least 37 people had been killed in the U.S. strikes \u2014 before Hegseth's announcement on Friday that six more alleged \"narco-terrorists\" were struck.",
      "Petro doesn't call the people killed on the boats traffickers, he says they're people who work for the traffickers",
      "\"Killing the business' workers is easy,\" he said. \"But if you want to be effective, you have to capture the bosses of the business.\"",
      "He said major shipments should be targeted, not small smuggling boats.",
      "This week, President Trump said his war on drugs could soon move from the water onto land, and on Thursday, two long-range U.S. B-1 bombers flew near Venezuela.",
      "Petro told CBS News that he hoped no U.S. operations would cross Colombia's borders, and he warned that any such move could lead to more violence by inspiring more people to join insurgency groups.",
      "\"I myself was an insurgent myself,\" he said. \"I am not threatening, but anyone who reads the history of Colombia in two centuries will know that when farmers are attacked, they head up to hide in the mountains and they take up arms.\"",
      "\"It's better to talk instead,\" he urged President Trump, who has threatened to halt all U.S. aid to Colombia.",
      "Petro said if that happens, his government will be able to fill funding gaps, and he's not losing sleep over the Trump administration's tariffs threats, either.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 09:19:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Ukraine's leader was greeted by King Charles as he arrived in the U.K. on Friday to strategize with European backers on ways to defund Putin's war machine.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014 Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy began his third visit to Britain this year with a highly symbolic show of support from one of his country's most vociferous Western partners.",
      "Zelenskyy was greeted on Friday by both rare British autumn sunshine and King Charles III at Windsor Castle, ahead of a summit with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other European leaders from the so-called \"coalition of the willing,\" who are determined to show that dozens of countries stand united behind Ukraine as Russia's devastating full-scale invasion nears the four-year mark.",
      "After the pomp and ceremony of his meeting with Charles, Zelenskyy headed into central London to spend the day meeting with Starmer and other senior European and NATO figures, discussing how to pile more pressure on Vladimir Putin's Russia to end the war.",
      "The objective, as highlighted this week by newly-announced sanctions against Russia from both the Trump administration and the European Union, is to hit Putin where it hurts \u2014 in the bank account.",
      "Russia's ability to continue selling oil and gas despite the ever-mounting sanctions aimed at choking off Putin's energy-fueled war economy will be one of the primary focuses of the coalition meeting on Friday.",
      "Moscow has proven adept at maneuvering around the sanctions, thanks to willing global partners and a so-called \"shadow fleet\" of tankers that still ply the seas.",
      "Partners including Starmer, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof will be there in person to strategize with Zelenskyy, while about 20 other leaders are set to join via video link.",
      "According to a statement posted online by Britain's government, the leaders \"are expected to use the meeting to focus the world's attention on how they can further strengthen Ukraine's hand and cripple Russia's ability to continue to wage war.\"",
      "\"The only person involved in this conflict who does not want to stop the war is President Putin, and his depraved strikes on young children in a nursery this week make that crystal clear,\" Starmer said in the statement. \"Time and again we offer Putin the chance to end his needless invasion, to stop the killing and recall his troops, but he repeatedly rejects those proposals and any chance of peace. From the battlefield to the global markets, as Putin continues to commit atrocities in Ukraine we must ratchet up the pressure on Russia and build on President Trump's decisive action.\"",
      "The leaders will discuss with Zelenskyy how to disincentivize China and India from buying Russian energy at the discounted prices Moscow gives them. The profits from those sales go to help fund Russia's \"war machine,\" as President Trump put it this week.",
      "Another focus will be on how to use Russian assets frozen by authorities in accounts across Europe to help fund Ukraine's defensive efforts. European authorities say there's as much as $250 billion in such Russian assets held within the EU.",
      "And the coalition summit's hosts will make their own specific announcements of additional support on Friday, with Starmer vowing to speed up delivery of more missiles to Ukraine.",
      "Starmer \"will announce that a U.K. missile building program has been accelerated to deliver more than 100 extra air defense missiles ahead of schedule to bolster Ukraine's defenses through the depths of winter,\" according to the statement from the British government.",
      "The additional missiles are part of a wider deal announced in the spring between the U.K. defense industry and Ukraine's government, worth about $2.1 billion, that will see Britain provide \"more than 5,000 lightweight-multirole missiles (LMM) to support Ukraine's defense,\" the U.K. government statement said.",
      "The laser-guided missiles have a relatively short range, up to about five miles, and they are intended to help Ukraine defend its airspace more than for offense.",
      "Zelenskyy has been pushing for months to get both his European and U.S. partners to supply more long-range missiles, too, but President Trump declined to grant him his biggest wish from Washington during his visit there last week: Tomahawk missiles. With a range of about 1,000 miles, the weapons in the hands of Ukrainian forces would easily be capable of reaching Moscow, and beyond.",
      "The Ukrainian leader says such long range Western missiles \u2014 and the greenlight to use them to target deeper inside Russia \u2014 are vital if his country is to stop the relentless airstrikes that continue to kill civilians on a near daily basis.",
      "With Mr. Trump's push for a ceasefire deal frustrated and going nowhere fast, both Ukraine and Russia continue launching daily attacks. Russia's strikes often hit civilian infrastructure, and they have killed at least six people, including two young children, in the recent days alone, according to Zelenskyy.",
      "Russian authorities say a Ukrainian drone struck an apartment building on the outskirts of Moscow before dawn on Friday, meanwhile, purportedly wounding five people, including one child.",
      "But for the European leaders gathered and calling into London on Friday, the impetus to heap pressure on Putin is growing fast, not only due to his military's daily barrage in Ukraine, but because of Russia's ramped-up probing of NATO defenses.",
      "Lithuania's leader said two Russian fighter jets breached its airspace \u2014 NATO airspace \u2014   again on Thursday night. NATO scrambled two Spanish fighter jets stationed in the Baltics in response.",
      "President Gitanas Naus\u0117da called it \"a blatant breach of international law and territorial integrity of Lithuania. Once again, it confirms the importance of strengthening European air defense readiness.\"",
      "Russia rejected the accusation, saying its jets conducted \"scheduled training flights\" over the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, but that they \"neither deviated from the flight route, nor violated the borders of other countries.\"",
      "But it was just the latest in a series of unclaimed, but suspected Russian drone and other aircraft incursions into NATO's European airspace.",
      "Starmer was due to hold a joint news conference with Zelenskyy later Friday in London. CBS News' partner network BBC News said Keir was likely to urge his fellow European leaders on Friday to ramp up the provision of long-range weapons to Ukraine, following a successful Ukrainian attack on a chemical plant in Bryansk, Russia, using British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles, earlier this week.",

      "The animal has been increasingly encroaching into Japan's towns due to factors ranging from a declining human population to climate change.",
      "In a mountainous village in the northern region of Akita, police received a report of a bear mauling on Friday involving four people.",
      "\"One died and three are being treated at a hospital\" after the attack, a local police officer told AFP.",

    "story": [
      "As many as 48 bags containing human remains were discovered and recovered from a clandestine grave near Guadalajara, Mexican authorities said Thursday.",
      "Guadalajara is the capital of Jalisco state, where one of Mexico's most violent and powerful drug cartels operates and where thousands of people have been reported missing.",
      "The bags with the remains were located four weeks ago by a search group on a vacant lot in Zapopan, a vast outlying municipality in the Guadalajara metropolitan area, the state prosecutor's office said.",
      "Officials said they were still trying to pin down an exact number for victims whose remains were found in the bags. They declined to give an estimate, but said they were carrying on with a search to see if more remains were around.",
      "\"We need to make progress on the forensic issue so that we can tell you how many victims this number of bags represents,\" Blanca Trujillo, deputy state prosecutor for missing persons, told a press conference.",
      "In the meantime, the remains in the 48 bags that were recovered would need to be analyzed, officials said.",
      "Since the grisly discovery, authorities have been working to recover the remains with the support of members of the Guerreros Buscadores collective.",
      "In presenting an official report on the search efforts, Trujillo said her office had the support of the National Commission for the Search for Persons. Because of the vastness of the land, the search has required the use of heavy machinery, she said.",
      "Hundreds of mass graves discovered",
      "The discovery of the grave site adds to dozens of similar cases in Jalisco, the state hardest hit by the crisis of missing persons affecting Mexico, where more than 127,000 victims have vanished nationwide.",
      "The vast majority of disappearances have occurred within the framework of intensified violence that has shaken Mexico since December 2006, when the federal government launched an anti-drug military operation.",
      "One of the\u00a0largest mass graves in Mexico\u00a0was reported in 2017 when more than 250 skulls were found in what appeared to be a drug cartel mass burial ground on the outskirts of the city of Veracruz.",
      "More recently, last June, forensic experts located the remains of 34 people buried near a residential area in Zapopan. In January, at least\u00a056 bodies\u00a0were discovered in unmarked mass graves in northern Mexico, not far from the U.S. border.",
      "According to official data, Jalisco has more than 15,900 cases of missing persons, a toll that experts attribute to the activities of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG).",
      "Last February, the United States designated the CJNG as a \"foreign terrorist organization,\" after identifying it as one of the main organized criminal groups trafficking fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that has caused the deaths of thousands of Americans.",
      "CJNG has been accused of using fake job advertisements to lure new members and of\u00a0torturing and killing recruits\u00a0who resist. In March, a group of people looking for missing relatives found\u00a0charred bones, shoes and clothing\u00a0at a suspected training ground for the cartel.",

    "summary": "Vice President Vance says he was insulted by Israeli lawmakers' \"very stupid political stunt\" with a vote on West Bank annexation.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance criticized on Thursday a vote by the Israeli parliament to advance a bill on the proposed annexation of the occupied West Bank, calling it \"a very stupid political stunt.\"",
      "\"I personally take some insult to it,\" Vance said at Israel's Ben Gurion airport as he departed the country after his visit. \"The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. That will continue to be our policy. And if people want to take symbolic votes, they can do that, but we certainly weren't happy about it.\"",
      "The preliminary vote Wednesday in support of Israeli annexation of the West Bank narrowly passed by 25 votes to 24, during Vance's visit.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office also criticized the vote on that bill and another narrower piece of annexation legislation, calling them \"a deliberate political provocation by the opposition to sow discord during Vice President JD Vance's visit to Israel.\"",
      "Netanyahu's office noted that without his party's support in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, \"these bills are unlikely to go anywhere.\"",
      "The prime minister is facing a domestic political struggle to stave off an early national election, with some members of his far-right coalition government unhappy over the U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza, which has held despite significant challenges over the weekend, with both sides accusing the other of violations.",
      "Though many members of Netanyahu's coalition support the Israeli annexation of the West Bank, they have dialed back their public calls for it since President Trump spoke out against the idea last month.",
      "The wider annexation bill could only become law after at least two more rounds of voting in Israel's 120 seat parliament, which it would be unlikely to survive.",
      "Vance said he hoped an international security force would take over the task of disarming Hamas, which Israel and Mr. Trump have demanded as a key next step in the peace process. He said he also hoped reconstruction of areas in Gaza where Hamas is no longer operating could happen \"fairly quickly.\"",

    "story": [
      "Cape Town, South Africa\u00a0\u2014 A Cuban man deported by the United States to the African nation of Eswatini is on a hunger strike at a maximum-security prison having been held there for more than three months without charge or access to legal counsel under the Trump administration's third-country program, his U.S.-based lawyer said Wednesday.",
      "Roberto Mosquera del Peral was one of five men sent to the small kingdom in southern Africa in mid-July as part of the U.S. deportation program to Africa. It has been criticized by rights groups and lawyers, who say deportees are being denied due process and exposed to rights abuses.",
      "Mosquera's lawyer, Alma David, said in a statement sent to The Associated Press that he had been on a hunger strike for a week, and there were serious concerns over his health.",
      "\"My client is arbitrarily detained, and now his life is on the line,\" David said. \"I urge the Eswatini Correctional Services to provide Mr. Mosquera's family and me with an immediate update on his condition and to ensure that he is receiving adequate medical attention. I demand that Mr. Mosquera be permitted to meet with his lawyer in Eswatini.\"",
      "The Eswatini government said Mosquera was \"fasting and praying because he was missing his family\" and described it as \"religious practices\" that it wouldn't interfere with, a characterization disputed by David. She said: \"It is not a religious practice. It's an act of desperation and protest.\"",
      "Mosquera was among a group of five men from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen deported to Eswatini, an absolute monarchy ruled by a king whom a number of rights groups, and the British government, accuse of clamping down on human rights. The Jamaican man was repatriated to his home country last month, but the others have been kept at the prison for more than three months, while an Eswatini-based lawyer has launched a case against the government demanding they be given access to legal counsel.",
      "Civic groups in Eswatini have also taken authorities to court to challenge the legality of holding foreign nationals in prison without charge. Eswatini said that the men would be repatriated but could be held there for up to a year.",
      "U.S. authorities have said they want to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Eswatini under the same program.",
      "Eswatini is at least the fourth possible destination the Trump administration has floated for Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who was mistakenly deported in March, held in a notorious Salvadoran prison and then returned to the U.S. in June \u2014 only to be detained again and face federal smuggling charges.",
      "The men sent to Eswatini already were convicted of serious criminal offenses that included murder and rape, and were in the U.S. illegally, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said.",
      "It said Mosquera was convicted of murder and other charges. His lawyer disputed that and said Thursday he was convicted of attempted murder and other charges. His full criminal record was not immediately available.",
      "The men's lawyers told the AP they had all completed their criminal sentences in the U.S. and are now being held illegally in Eswatini.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has cast the third-country deportation program as a means to remove \"illegal aliens\" from American soil as part of President Trump's immigration crackdown, saying they have a choice to self-deport or be sent to a country like Eswatini.",
      "The Trump administration has\u00a0sent deportees to at least three other African nations\u00a0\u2014 South Sudan, Rwanda and Ghana \u2014 since July under largely secretive agreements. It also has an agreement with Uganda, though no deportations there have been announced.",
      "New York-based Human Rights Watch said it has seen documents that show that the U.S. is paying African nations millions of dollars to accept deportees. It said the U.S. agreed to pay Eswatini $5.1 million to take up to 160 deportees and Rwanda $7.5 million to take up to 250 deportees.",
      "Another 10 deportees were sent to Eswatini this month and are believed to be held at the same Matsapha Correctional Complex prison outside the administrative capital, Mbabane. Lawyers said that those men are from Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Cuba, Chad, Ethiopia and Congo.\u00ad",
      "Lawyers say the four men who arrived in Eswatini on a deportation flight in July haven't been allowed to meet with an Eswatini lawyer representing them, and phone calls to their U.S.-based attorneys are monitored by prison guards. They have expressed concern that they know little about the conditions in which their clients are being held.",
      "\"I demand that Mr. Mosquera be permitted to meet with his lawyer in Eswatini,\" David said in her statement. \"The fact that my client has been driven to such drastic action highlights that he and the other 13 men must be released from prison. The governments of the United States and Eswatini must take responsibility for the real human consequences of their deal.\"",

      "Washington under President Donald Trump has been applying pressure on Mexico and China to curb drug trafficking, particularly of fentanyl, the powerful painkiller behind an overdose epidemic in the United States. The Trump administration has hit both countries with steep tariffs.",
      "Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 times more powerful than heroin and much easier and cheaper to produce.",
      "It has largely replaced heroin and prescription opioids such as oxycodone as a cause of overdoses in the United States.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's government has ramped up drug seizures under tariff pressure from Mr. Trump, who has threatened further punitive measures unless the problem is solved.",

    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Drone attacks apparently launched by war-torn Sudan's RSF paramilitary forces appeared to derail the reopening on Wednesday of the main airport in the capital Khartoum after more than a year and a half.",
      "The French news agency AFP said residents heard a wave of explosions in the early morning, and local media and Khartoum residents reported drones striking multiple areas of Khartoum on Wednesday, including near the airport.",
      "Sudan's Civil Aviation authority announced earlier this week that Khartoum International Airport would reopen Wednesday for domestic flights after 30 months shuttered due to the ongoing civil war between the RSF (Rapid Support Forces) and the military.",
      "The Reuters news agency, along with local media, cited airline sources as saying the opening had been delayed by at least several days by the drone attacks. Later in the day, however, one Badr Airlines flight from Port Sudan, in the east of the country, did land in Khartoum.",
      "There were new drone strikes in Khartoum reported Thursday morning, however, for a third consecutive day, including near the city's airport. Online booking sites offered flights from Port Sudan to Khartoum on Saturday, but no flights were shown for Thursday or Friday.",
      "CBS News was unable to reach Sudanese government officials for comment on Wednesday regarding the status of the airport. The announcement of a pending reopening was made following several test flights, just months after the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) recaptured the heavily damaged airport.",
      "AFP cited military sources as saying a third drone attack on Khartoum in just a week had been thwarted early on Wednesday, and it was unclear whether the explosions heard by residents were drones being shot down, or whether there was any damage.",
      "RSF leader Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, had warned ahead of the planned airport reopening that his forces would shoot down any plane suspected of supporting the Sudanese army.",
      "The opening of the airport was intended to show full government control of the capital city. The government, led by the president of the Sovereignty Council Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is pushing for international flights to return to the capital as well.",
      "Turkish Air, Egyptair and Ethiopian Airlines have all returned to fly regular flights from Port Sudan, further east, which has remained under the control of government forces. The Sudanese government and army have been pushing for those airlines to resume international flights from Khartoum, too, but the resumption of domestic flights on Wednesday was to be a key step in that direction.",
      "Sudan's government relocated to Port Sudan when the\u00a0civil war erupted in April 2023, and Burhan has been pushing to show a normalization of life in the capital city since then, encouraging Sudanese civilians to return to Khartoum and undertaking a six-month intensive reconstruction campaign across the city.",
      "Burhan is expected to move back to the presidential palace, which had been severely damaged in the fighting, in the relatively near future. He has called on the government's various ministries to move back to their headquarters in Khartoum by early next year.",
      "European diplomats are expected to visit Khartoum by the end of this month, with SAF officials pushing for Western countries to reopen their embassies.",
      "Port Sudan has been Sudan's only functioning international airport since the war began, despite several recent drone attacks in the vicinity of that facility, too.",
      "Residents say Khartoum has been largely calm since the SAF pushed RSF forces out of the capital in March. The RSF has concentrated its military efforts since the spring on the beleaguered Darfur region, where it has been trying for weeks to fully capture the city of el-Fasher, the last Darfur city not under its control.",
      "El-Fasher has been completely surrounded, cut off to the outside world and under siege, for weeks. Residents say the markets are empty after the RSF built earthen berms to surround the city, cutting off vital supplies.",
      "The U.N. has warned that fighting in el-Fasher has intensified, including repeated drone strikes.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said last week that el-Fasher was \"under siege from all directions.\"",
      "Tens of thousands of Sudanese have been killed in the war, with millions forced to flee from their homes.",

      "Ukraine's leader welcomed a raft of new economic sanctions against Russia being imposed by the Trump administration and the European Union on Thursday, calling the increased pressure on Moscow \"very important.\"",
      "CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio says the new U.S. sanctions, announced by the Treasury on Wednesday, essentially block Americans from dealing with anyone at the Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, or with any companies that are more than 50% owned by them.",
      "The sanctions are a win for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But despite President Trump's open frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has refused to negotiate a truce, American pressure on Moscow has increased only economically so far, not with the provision of long-range additional weapons, or even with overt permission to launch attacks deeper inside Russia.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent encouraged allies to \"join in\" as he announced the new U.S. sanctions on Wednesday, and the European Union quickly did.",
      "The EU heaped new economic sanctions on Russia Thursday as part of the broadened effort to choke off the revenue that funds Moscow's three-year invasion of Ukraine and compel\u00a0Putin to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "\"We waited for this. God bless, it will work. And this is very important,\" the Ukrainian leader said in Brussels, where EU countries attending a summit announced the bloc's latest round of sanctions.",
      "Posting earlier on social media as he arrived in Brussels, Zelenskyy thanked Mr. Trump for a \"resolute and well-targeted decision,\" calling the U.S. sanctions a \"clear signal that prolonging the war and spreading terror come at a cost.\"",
      "\"It is a strong and much-needed message that aggression will not go unanswered,\" he said, adding a call later for other nations to join in sanctioning Russia.",
      "Russia dismissive, but ex-president calls sanctions an \"act of war\"",
      "Russia, however, dismissed the sanctions announced by Ukraine's Western partners as counterproductive, with the country's state-run RIA Novosti news agency declaring that they would be \"painful, as usual, but not deadly. Also as usual.\"",
      "\"Pressure or no pressure, it won't make things any sweeter for Zelenskyy. And what's more, it won't bring peace any closer,\" Komsomolskaya Pravda, a popular pro-Kremlin tabloid, said.",
      "Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chair of Russia's National Security Council, went further, as the outspoken figure often does, declaring the U.S. sanctions \"an act of war.\"",
      "\"The U.S. is our enemy, and their talkative 'peacemaker' has now fully embarked on the warpath with Russia,\" Medvedev wrote in a message posted on social media. \"The decisions taken are an act of war against Russia. And now Trump has fully aligned himself with loony Europe.\"",

      "Mr. Trump has also, so far, disappointed Zelenskyy in his long-running bid to secure American-made Tomahawk long-range missiles to use in his country's defense.",
      "Zelenskyy also reiterated on Thursday that Ukraine would not agree to cede any land occupied by Russia as part of a ceasefire agreement. Mr. Trump said this week that the fighting should be paused with the battle lines frozen where they stand \u2014 with Russia's invading forces in control of about 78% of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, he said.",
      "Zelenskyy has called that a reasonable starting point for negotiations, but on Thursday he was quoted by the Euronews outlet, after he arrived in Belgium, as saying a ceasefire agreement could include \"no territorial concessions\" to Russia.",
      "The new EU measures took almost a month to decide. The 27-nation bloc has already slapped 18 packages of sanctions against Russia over the war, but getting final agreement on whom and what to target can take weeks. Moscow has also proved adept at sidestepping sanctions.",
      "The U.S. sanctions came after Mr. Trump said that his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was on hold because he didn't want it to be a \"waste of time.\" It was the latest twist in Mr. Trump's hot-and-cold efforts to end the war as Putin refuses to budge from his demands.",

      "The 76-year-old king, who, by virtue of his role as the monarch also holds the title of supreme governor of the mother church of Anglicanism, flew to Rome Wednesday evening with his wife, Queen Camilla, for what Buckingham Palace described as a \"historic\" trip.",

      "In 1961, the late Queen Elizabeth II, Charles's mother, became the first British monarch to visit the Holy See since the split.",
      "Thursday's service, held beneath Michelangelo's spectacular ceiling frescoes, was centered on conservation and protecting the environment, a cause long championed by Charles.

    "summary": "Chess's governing body says it may discipline a former Russian world champion who kept leveling unproven cheating allegations at Daniel Naroditsky in the year before the American grandmaster died.",
    "story": [
      "Chess's international governing body said Wednesday it's considering disciplinary action against a former Russian world champion who persistently leveled unproven cheating allegations at Daniel Naroditsky in the year leading up to the American grandmaster's death.",
      "The Charlotte Chess Center in North Carolina, where Naroditsky trained and worked as a coach, announced his death Monday. He was 29. The cause of death has not been made public.",
      "Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik, who held the world title for several years in the early 2000s, began accusing the California-born pro of cheating in online chess last October. He continued to share his suspicions on social media over the past year without providing substantial evidence.",
      "Naroditsky, who at 18 became a grandmaster, the highest title in chess aside from world chess champion, had denied the cheating allegations and accused Kramnik of trying to ruin his life.",
      "Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation, said Wednesday he has formally referred all relevant public statements made by Kramnik before and after Naroditsky's death to the body's Ethics and Disciplinary Commission for review. He promised the federation would take \"appropriate action\" in any case where public harassment or bullying is observed.",
      "The body requires substantial evidence to launch a cheating investigation and may sanction a player who makes unfounded accusations based on emotion or insufficient data, according to its anti-cheating laws. There were no documented reports of the federation investigating Naroditsky.",
      "The Associated Press reached out Wednesday to Kramnik via social media for comment.",
      "Naroditsky's accuser severely criticized",
      "The investigation comes as several grandmasters, including Hikaru Nakamura and Nihal Sarin, have called out Kramnik's conduct, saying the Russian pro had harassed Naroditsky and tried to destroy his reputation.",
      "Five-time world chess champion Magnus Carlsen called Kramnik's relentless pursuit of Naroditsky \"appalling.\"",
      "During his last livestream Saturday, Naroditsky told his massive online following that Kramnik's cheating claims had taken a toll on him.",
      "\"Ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions. The issue is just the lingering effect of it,\" Naroditsky said, adding that Kramnik used to be one of his \"heroes.\"",
      "It's not the first time Kramnik has been accused of harassment. The popular internet chess server Chess.com shut down Kramnik's blog on the site in 2023, saying he'd used it to spread baseless allegations about \"many dozens of players.\"",
      "The following year, Kramnik published a list of players on social media with the title \"Cheating Tuesdays\" that included Czech grandmaster David Navara. Navara later shared on his blog that Kramnik's public accusations had pushed him to consider suicide. Kramnik responded by accusing Navara of defamation.",
      "In June, the federation responded to the players' public spat, saying the way Kramnik presents his arguments \"brings a lot of harm to the chess community\" and \"could be ruinous for the careers and well-being of certain players.\" The group invited Kramnik to present the details of his approach and statistical data for official evaluation.",
      "Chess cheating allegations skyrocketed during pandemic",
      "Kramnik's anti-cheating crusade exploded with the game's shift online during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Many elite players traded the physical chess board for a keyboard to continue playing through lockdown, creating a surge in popularity for streaming content and fast-paced online games in which Naroditsky excelled.",
      "Players of the cerebral sport are known to value respectful conduct over the board. But in the digital arena, a new level of toxicity has developed, with cheating allegations growing rampant and becoming much more difficult to prove. Players now have sophisticated computer schemes at their fingertips that could give them an unfair advantage, and new ways to profit off their success online.",
      "In blitz and bullet chess, where players have mere minutes to finish intense matches, experts say top talents often move with speed and precision on par with a computer. Naroditsky was among the world's top 25 blitz players and won the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August.",
      "\"In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people's reputation but their very well-being,\" Dvorkovich acknowledged Wednesday. \"When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks - a particularly serious concern in today's environment.\"",
      "\"The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, and his contributions to our sport are undeniable,\" he continued. \"The same high standards that accompany great achievements, however, also confer a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect and to be ambassadors for the sport.\"",
      "Dvorkovich said the federation will establish a prize in Naroditsky's memory.",
      "Kramnik continued to post about Naroditsky on the day his death was announced, calling it a tragedy and speculating about the cause. Kramink wrote on the social platform X that the death \"should be investigated by police.\" He wrote Wednesday that he received threats after revealing \"public information about the 'dark side' of modern chess.\"",

      "The attack came in waves from Tuesday night into Wednesday and targeted at least eight Ukrainian cities, as well as a village in the region of the capital, Kyiv, where a strike set fire to a house in which the mother and her 6-month-old and 12-year-old daughters were staying, regional head Mykola Kalashnyk said.",

      "Russia fired 405 strike and decoy drones and 28 missiles, mainly targeting Kyiv, Ukraine's air force said.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 15:06:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Master jeweler Stephen Portier said the Louvre robbers might recut the stolen gems, which would significantly decrease their value.",
    "story": [
      "The thieves who made off with priceless treasure from the Louvre may have a hard time cashing in.",
      "The French government valued the pieces \u2014 which include an exquisite tiara and a sapphire necklace worn by French royalty \u2014 at about $102 million. But Stephen Portier, master jeweler and Parisian gem appraiser, says that's only if they're intact.",
      "If the thieves prise the jewels out of their settings to sell on the black market, they will be worth much less, Portier said.",
      "\"Taken apart and sold as stones and metal, their value drops by 90%,\" he said.",
      "Like many jewelry professionals, Portier nurses a sliver of hope that the police will catch the robbers and recover the historic pieces undamaged. But he knows the chances are slim. With so much attention on the pieces, they will be too hard to sell as-is. They will also be highly illegal to buy.",
      "\"The market for fine jewelry is big,\" he said. \"But the network is small. Everybody knows everybody in the world of precious stone.\"",
      "\"The whole world knows about this robbery. Dealers will have pictures of every single piece up in their offices,\" he continued. \"So if they think they're being offered diamonds from the Louvre ... They will ask some hard questions. And contact the police.\"",
      "The Louvre is likely to have minute descriptions of the precious stones in the treasures that were taken in the brazen heist, which saw the thieves enter through a window and smash antique glass cases before escaping with the treasure. The thieves took nine pieces, but dropped the crown of Empress Eugenie as they made their escape.",
      "Each stone in the stolen pieces has \"unique properties,\" like their weight, color and tiny impurities, Portier said. These descriptors \"are like the stones' DNA.\"",
      "Some of the pieces, notably a brooch in the shape of a bow with elaborate tassels, contain hundreds of tiny diamonds. Even these smaller stones will be hard for the thieves to fence.",
      "They're at least a century and a half old, cut in a distinctive old-fashioned style.  Criminal specialists could try re-cutting them to disguise them, says Portier,  but that would make them even smaller and much less valuable.",
      "Among the stolen objects is an exquisite diamond and pearl tiara.",
      "\"Old pearls, especially large ones, are easy to identify by their shape and color,\" said Portier.",
      "Theoretically, it is possible to make the large pearls in it unrecognizable with a risky process known as peeling, Portier said.",
      "\"You need a solvent like perfume, or hairspray.  They dissolve the surface of the pearl and hide the minute cracks of age,\" Portier explained. \"But it's a dangerous game, because it can expose the layer below which may be an unattractive color and so the pearl suddenly becomes much less valuable.\"",
      "Given that getting rid of the jewels will be difficult, and not hugely profitable, why did the thieves commit such a risky crime?",
      "\"Good question,\" Portier said.  \"Good question.\"",

      "According to The Times, which obtained a copy of the leasehold agreement for Royal Lodge, Andrew paid \u00a31 million for the lease, plus at least \u00a37.5 million for refurbishments completed in 2005.

      "An \"independent\" advisory panel of non-federal experts determining which preventative healthcare services insurers must cover is accused of being staffed with doctors who have shown a propensity to prioritize \"woke\" left-wing diversity, equity and inclusion ideals in their work, as opposed to evidence-based science.",
      "The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF), an all-volunteer panel of doctors who serve four-year terms appointed by the Secretary of Health, is made up of experts in preventative medicine, which includes services like screening tests, immunizations, behavioral counseling, and medications that can prevent the development or worsening of health conditions. One of the task force's primary functions is to weigh the efficacy and cost-benefit of such preventative care services, recommendations for which are then used to shape what preventative care services insurance providers must cover.",
      "The task force's ability to make these healthcare recommendations, coupled with what appears to be a membership largely made up of left-wing, DEI proponents, has raised concerns about how the task force could be impacting healthcare.",

      "\"HHS has been made aware of the ideological issues with members of the USPSTF raised by letters from\u00a0Senate Republicans, members of the\u00a0GOP Doctors Caucus, and\u00a0a large group of physicians\u00a0including Associations of American Physicians and Surgeons, America\u2019s Frontline Doctors, and the Pennsylvania Direct Primary Care Association. HHS is troubled by these allegations and is investigating further,\" Emily Hilliard, a Health and Human Services Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital when asked about Kennedy's plans for the future of the current USPSTF.",
      "Meanwhile, others, including the GOP Doctors Caucus and major physician groups including the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, have also raised alarm bells about potential left-wing bias at the USPSTF. One group that has also raised alarm bells about the USPSTF is the conservative watchdog group known as the American Accountability Foundation (AAF), which just released a new report claiming the USPSTF \"has been thoroughly hijacked by left-wing partisans for the purpose of weaponizing science to spread leftist ideology.\"",
      "The AAF report points to Dr. Michael Silverstein, the task force's current chairman, who, in 2023, said that USPSTF is \"dedicated to \u2026 addressing critical issues of health equity\" after he was re-appointed to the task force's leadership team under the Biden administration. As Vice Chair of the task force in 2023, Silverstein co-authored an annual report to Congress highlighting a new partnership with the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA) aimed at helping the task force be more \"inclusive.\"",
      "The partnership, according to the report to Congress, was meant to help develop \"new recommendations on screening for anxiety disorders, and other conditions that affect LGBTQ+ communities to enhance the health, wellness, and quality of life of their patients.\"",
      "Other recommendations from the USPSTF that have come down in the last several years include a 2022 recommendation denoting the need for physicians to consider race when screening for anxiety in children and adolescents. A more recent recommendation, published in April, said that doctors should pay special attention to breastfeeding in black mothers due to the \"lasting psychological impact and stigma of enslaved Black women being forced to act as wet nurses.\"",

      "\"To advance its methods, the USPSTF reviewed its past recommendations that included the use of sex and gender terms, reviewed the approaches of other guideline-making bodies, and pilot tested strategies to address sex and gender diversity,\" the report states. \"Based on the findings, the USPSTF intends to use an inclusive approach to identify issues related to sex and gender at the start of the guideline development process; assess the applicability, variability, and quality of evidence as a function of sex and gender; ensure clarity in the use of language regarding sex and gender; and identify evidence gaps related to sex and gender.\"",

      "For example, Dr. David Chelmow, another task force member, has appeared in several physician-backed American Civil Liberties Union memos about efforts opposing the Trump administration, including one challenging Trump's efforts to implement greater protections around the mail-order abortion drug called mifepristone, which many pro-life OBGYN's have warned is dangerous if not dispensed in-person.

      "In 2019, the task force gave the precautionary anti-HIV drug Preexposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) an \"A\" grade, guidelines for which were later clarified in 2023. The task force's current Vice Chair, Dr. John Wong, also co-authored a 2017 paper on how scaling-up the use of PrEP can help reduce the prevalence of HIV among gay men. But, according to AAF, the active promotion of PrEP creates an atmosphere of dangerous sexual activity that risks public health dangers due to what the foundation says is promotion of risky sexual behaviors. Additionally, at least one Christian-owned business has argued that forcing insurance providers to cover medication that promotes risky sexual behaviors violates their rights.",
      "Earlier this summer, the Supreme Court weighed in on whether the USPSTF's authority to compel coverage of preventative healthcare it gives either an \"A\" or \"B\" grade was unconstitutional. The group that brought the case, Braidwood Management Inc., initially objected on religious grounds to the ACA requirement that insurance providers cover certain HIV-prevention medications for which the task force has issued an \"A\" recommendation, specifically PrEP. However, the case ultimately morphed into a question over the legitimacy of USPSTF's recommendation authority, and whether the circumvention of Senate approval for its members was allowed by the Constitutions Article II clause on advise and consent.",

The Trump administration also argued in its briefs to the High Court that the Secretary had the authority to block, or rescind, task force recommendations as well, according to SCOUTS Blog.",
      "Ultimately, the Supreme Court voted 6-3, in favor of the federal government's argument that the appointment process for the USPSTF, and therefore its legitimacy, did not violate the Constitution.",
      "Shortly after the Supreme Court's decision in the Braidwood case, Health Secretary Kennedy reportedly postponed a long-scheduled task force meeting of the USPSTF, which was the same move he made before firing every member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the main federal entity that helps craft federal vaccine policy. Kennedy has long been a critic of conventional vaccination policies and practices.",

      "One day, we might see glowing cities of glass scattered across the Moon's surface, shining softly under Earth's light. NASA is teaming up with Skyeports, a California-based company, to explore how lunar dust could be turned into massive glass spheres strong enough to live in. These futuristic, transparent habitats could become the first real homes for astronauts on the Moon.",

      "Skyeports\u2019 vision begins with melting lunar dust in microwave furnaces to create durable glass. (Skyeports)",
      "Turning moon dust into homes",
      "Skyeports has developed a way to transform lunar dust, known as regolith, into durable glass that can be shaped into massive spheres. Using a microwave furnace, the regolith melts and expands like a bubble before cooling into a hard, transparent shell. These spheres could one day serve as living and working spaces for astronauts.",
      "The innovation lies in building directly on the Moon using local materials. No costly shipments from Earth are required. The same pipes used to blow the molten glass will become entrances, while 3D printers inside the spheres will create furniture and fittings using lunar materials.",

      "Self-healing and solar-powered living",
      "The planned glass spheres go far beyond simple shelters. They are designed as self-sustaining ecosystems. The glass can repair small cracks caused by micrometeorites or moonquakes, and built-in solar panels will allow each habitat to generate its own energy.",
      "Inside, temperature layers could create condensation to support plant growth. This would produce oxygen, water and food, making each sphere a self-contained life-support system.",
      "The science behind the glass sphere design",
      "The spherical shape is more than a design choice. It evenly distributes pressure, giving the structure incredible strength. By adding elements like titanium, magnesium and calcium, the glass becomes even tougher and stronger than steel.",
      "Dr. Martin Bermudez, CEO of Skyeports, shared that current prototypes are only a few inches wide, but future spheres could stretch up to 1,640 feet across. His long-term vision is a network of glass cities connected by transparent bridges across the lunar landscape.",

      "How Klopatra infects devices",
      "The malicious VPN and streaming app is called Mobdro Pro IP TV + VPN, and it was recently discovered by researchers at Cleafy. Once you install the app, it drops a malware strain called Klopatra. It's a new and highly sophisticated Android malware currently being used in active campaigns targeting financial institutions and their customers.",
      "THIS CHROME VPN EXTENSION SECRETLY SPIES ON YOU",
      "Fake VPN apps can hide dangerous malware that steals your data and money. (iStock)",
      "At first glance, the app looks like a free streaming platform offering high-quality channels, which makes it appealing to Android users. Once installed, though, it deploys a banking Trojan and a remote-access tool that give attackers full control over the infected device. With that level of access, criminals can steal your banking credentials and even carry out fraudulent transactions without your knowledge.",
      "The infection chain is carefully planned. It starts with social engineering, tricking you into downloading and installing the app from outside the official Play Store. From there, Klopatra bypasses Android's built-in protections and reaches deep into the system to gain persistence and control.",

      "VPNs are widely promoted as privacy tools that hide your IP address and encrypt internet traffic. Millions rely on them to bypass geographic restrictions, protect sensitive communications or simply browse more securely. Yet not all VPNs are trustworthy. Various studies have proved that popular commercial VPNs have alarming shortcomings. Some use protocols that are not designed to protect privacy, obscure ownership or fail to encrypt traffic properly.",
      "When fake apps like Mobdro are combined with these weaknesses, users are left exposed. Criminals exploit both the popularity of VPNs and the prevalence of pirated streaming services to distribute malware effectively.

      "Only download VPNs, streaming services and apps from Google Play, Apple App Store or the official developer's website. Avoid links in forums, social media messages or emails promising free content.",
      "Carefully review what access an app requests. If it asks for control over your device, settings or accessibility services unnecessarily, do not install it. Legitimate VPNs rarely require full device control.",

      "An Ohio lawmaker is taking aim at artificial intelligence in a way few expected. Rep. Thaddeus Claggett has introduced House Bill 469, which would make it illegal for AI systems to be treated like people. The proposal would officially label them as\u00a0\"nonsentient entities,\" cutting off any path toward legal personhood.",
      "And yes, it also includes a ban on marrying AI.",
      "Claggett, a Republican from Licking County and chair of the House Technology and Innovation Committee, said the measure is meant to keep humans firmly in control of machines. He says that as AI systems begin to act more like humans, the law must draw a clear line between person and program.",

      "What Ohio's AI marriage ban would do",
      "Under the proposed legislation, AI systems would not be able to own property, manage bank accounts or serve as company executives. They would not have the same rights or responsibilities as people. The bill also makes any marriage between a human and an AI, or between two AI systems, legally impossible.",
      "Ohio lawmakers consider a bill to ban AI from being recognized as a person. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "Claggett believes the concern is not about robot weddings happening anytime soon. Instead, he wants to prevent AI from taking on the legal powers of a spouse, such as holding power of attorney or making financial and medical decisions for someone else.",
      "The bill also specifies that if an AI causes harm, the human owners or developers would be responsible. That means a person cannot blame their chatbot or automated system for mistakes or damage. Responsibility stays with the humans who built, trained or used the system.",
      "Why Ohio is taking action on AI personhood",
      "The timing of the bill is not random. AI is spreading fast across nearly every industry. Systems now write reports, generate artwork and analyze complex data at lightning speed. Ohio has even started requiring schools to create rules for AI use in classrooms. And major data centers are being built to power AI infrastructure in the state.",
      "At the same time, AI is becoming more personal. A survey by Florida-based marketing firm Fractl found that 22 percent of users said they had formed emotional connections with a chatbot. Three percent even considered one a romantic partner. Another 16 percent said they wondered whether the AI they were talking to was sentient.",
      "That kind of emotional attachment raises red flags for lawmakers. If people start believing AI has feelings or intent, it blurs the boundaries between human experience and digital simulation.",
      "Ohio lawmakers consider a bill to ban AI from being recognized as a person. (iStock)",
      "AI COMPANIONS REPLACE REAL FRIENDS FOR MANY TEENS",
      "The bigger picture: Keeping humans in control",
      "Claggett said the bill is about protecting human agency. He believes that as AI grows smarter and more capable, it must never replace the human decision-maker.",
      "Claggett told CyberGuy, \"We see AI as having tremendous potential as a tool, but also tremendous potential to cause harm. We want to prevent that by establishing guardrails and a legal framework before these developments can outpace regulation and bad actors start exploiting legal loopholes. We want the human to be liable for any misconduct, and for there to be no question regarding the legal status of AI, no matter how sophisticated, in Ohio law.\"",
      "The proposed law would also reinforce that AI cannot make choices that affect human lives without oversight.",
      "If passed, it would ensure that no machine can act independently in matters of marriage, property, or corporate leadership. Supporters see the bill as a safeguard for society, arguing that technology should never gain the same legal footing as people.",
      "Critics, however, say the proposal might be a solution to a problem that doesn't yet exist. They warn that overly broad restrictions could slow down AI research and innovation in Ohio.",
      "Still, even skeptics admit that the conversation is necessary. AI is evolving faster than most laws can keep up, and questions about rights, ownership and accountability are becoming harder to ignore.",
      "What other states are doing about AI personhood",
      "Ohio isn't alone in pushing back against AI personhood. In Utah, lawmakers passed H.B. 249, the Utah Legal Personhood Amendments, which prohibits courts and government entities from recognizing legal personhood for nonhuman entities, including AI. The law also bars recognizing personhood for entities such as bodies of water, land and plants.",
      "In Missouri, legislators introduced H.B. 1462, the \"AI Non-Sentience and Responsibility Act,\" which would formally declare AI systems non-sentient and prevent them from acquiring legal status, marriage rights, corporate roles or property ownership.",
      "AI-GENERATED ATTORNEY OUTRAGES JUDGE WHO SCOLDS MAN OVER COURTROOM FAKE: \u2018NOT A REAL PERSON\u2019",
      "In Idaho, H.B. 720 (2022) includes language that reserves legal rights and personhood for human beings, effectively barring personhood claims by nonhumans, including AI.",
      "These measures reflect a broader trend among state governments. Many legislators are trying to get ahead of AI's development by setting clear legal boundaries before the technology becomes more advanced.",
      "Taken together, these proposals show that Ohio's effort is part of a larger national movement to define where technology ends and legal personhood begins.",
      "House Bill 469 aims to keep humans in control as AI becomes more lifelike. (XPENG)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Ohio, House Bill 469 could influence how you use and interact with artificial intelligence. It sets clear boundaries that keep AI as a tool rather than a person. By keeping decision-making and responsibility in human hands, the law aims to avoid confusion about who is accountable when technology fails. If an AI system causes harm or makes an error, the responsibility stays with the humans who designed or deployed it.",
      "For Ohio businesses, this proposal could lead to real changes in daily operations. Companies that depend on AI to handle customer support, financial decisions, or creative projects may need to review how much authority those systems have. It may also require stricter policies to ensure that a human is always supervising important decisions involving money, health, or law. Lawmakers want to keep people firmly in charge of choices that affect others.",
      "For everyday users, the message is straightforward. AI can be useful, but it cannot replace human relationships or legal rights. This bill reinforces that no matter how human-like technology appears, it cannot form genuine emotional or legal bonds with people. Conversations with chatbots might feel personal, but they remain simulations created through data and programming.",
      "DETAILS OF TRUMP'S HIGHLY ANTICIPATED AI PLAN REVEALED BY WHITE HOUSE AHEAD OF MAJOR SPEECH",
      "For people outside Ohio, this proposal could point to what is coming next. Other states are closely watching how the bill develops, and some may adopt similar laws. If it passes, it could set a national example for defining the legal limits of artificial intelligence. What happens in Ohio may shape how courts, businesses and individuals across the country decide to manage their connection to AI in the years ahead.",
      "In the end, this debate is not limited to one state. It raises an important question about how society should balance the power of innovation with the need to protect human control.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Ohio's House Bill 469 is bold, controversial and timely. It challenges us to define the limits of what technology should be allowed to do. Claggett's proposal is not about stopping innovation. It's about ensuring that as machines become more capable, humans remain in charge of the choices that shape society. The debate is far from over. Some see this as a necessary safeguard, while others believe it underestimates what AI can contribute.

      "Do rude prompts really get better answers? Short answer: sometimes. A 2025 arXiv study tested 50 questions rewritten in five tones and found that rude prompts slightly outperformed polite ones with ChatGPT-4o. Accuracy rose from 80.8% for very polite to 84.8% for very rude. The sample was small, yet the pattern was clear.",
      "But not so fast, this story has layers. A 2024 study that looked at multiple languages painted a different picture. It found that impolite prompts often lowered performance, and that the \"best\" level of politeness changed depending on the language. In other words, the details really matter.",

      "Rude prompts made ChatGPT more accurate. Polite ones scored lower. Tone changed the outcome. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why tone might change outcomes",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to mirror the wording they receive. When you sound direct or even a little blunt, you often give clearer instructions. That helps cut down on confusion and pushes the model to deliver sharper, more focused answers. A 2025 paper published on arXiv found that tone alone can shift accuracy by a few points, although more research is needed to confirm those results.",
      "In an earlier study led by researchers from Waseda University and RIKEN AIP, the team compared English, Chinese and Japanese prompts. They discovered that the ideal level of politeness varied by language, showing how cultural norms shape the way AI interprets human requests. In short, what works in one language might not land the same way in another.",
      "Americans split on whether to be polite to AI chatbots",
      "Nearly half of Americans say people should be polite to AI chatbots, according to an April 30, 2025, YouGov survey. Many users do it out of habit or courtesy. Microsoft's design leaders even recommend basic etiquette with Copilot.\u00a0\"Using polite language sets a tone for the response,\" says Kurtis Beavers. Models tend to mirror the professionalism and clarity of your prompt.",
      "A blunt prompt can sharpen results. Direct words help AI focus. Clear beats kind here. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Yes, niceties have a cost",
      "Good manners may be polite, but they are not free. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said people saying\u00a0\"please\" and\u00a0\"thank you\" to ChatGPT costs the company millions of dollars each year. Every extra word adds tokens for the model to process, and those tokens require computing power and electricity.",
      "For a single user, that cost is tiny and hardly noticeable. Yet when millions of users do it all day, those small gestures turn into a major expense. In the end, even kindness comes with a price tag.",
      "CHATGPT MAY ALERT POLICE ON SUICIDAL TEENS",
      "How to prompt for accuracy without being a jerk",

      "Start with the goal.\u00a0Tell the model what you want right away. Include the format and any limits up front so it knows where to focus.Get specific.\u00a0Use numbers instead of vague words. \"Write three bullet points\" works better than \"Write a few ideas.\"Add a check.

      "Researchers tested three languages. Each reacted differently to politeness. Culture shaped every reply. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Rude prompts and ChatGPT accuracy in practice",
      "Here's where things get interesting. If you're writing math problems, multiple-choice questions or coding tasks, a short, no-nonsense tone might actually help. The 2025 study showed that when users dropped the polite fluff and went straight to the point, ChatGPT's accuracy ticked upward.",
      "Still, don't expect miracles. The difference wasn't huge; think a few percentage points, not a full upgrade. Rude or direct prompts can sharpen a model's focus, but they won't suddenly turn an average prompt into a perfect one. The trick is to treat tone as just one lever in your prompt-engineering toolbox. Clarity, structure and context matter more than attitude.",
      "So, how should you use this in real life?",
      "The findings might sound odd, but they offer a clear takeaway for anyone who uses AI tools daily. Here's how to put them into practice.",

Whether you choose a polite tone or a more direct one, what matters is explaining exactly what you need. That is how you get consistent, high-quality answers without resorting to rudeness. So before you send your next question, ask yourself this: Are you being too polite to get results, or just polite enough to be understood?",

One by one, global giants are admitting they've been breached, from tech powerhouses like Google to insurance leaders such as Allianz and Farmers and even luxury brands like Dior. The latest company to report a breach is Discord.

      "How the breach happened and what data was exposed",
      "The company confirmed that the breach, which occurred on September 20, did not involve a direct attack on Discord's servers. Instead, attackers gained unauthorized access to 5CA, one of Discord's third-party customer service providers. This allowed them to view information from users who had reached out to Discord's Customer Support or Trust & Safety teams.",
      "Discord is a chat app primarily used by gamers, but it has expanded to various other communities, enabling text messages, voice chats and video calls. Some even use it as a replacement for Slack. The platform currently has a monthly user base of over 200 million. The data exposed included Discord usernames, real names, emails, limited billing details such as payment type and the last four digits of credit cards, IP addresses and messages exchanged with customer service agents. In some cases, government ID images provided for age verification were also compromised. Discord estimates that around 70,000 users globally may have had government ID photos exposed.",
      "Reports suggest the attackers attempted to use this access to demand a ransom from Discord. Bleeping Computer reported that the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLH) threat group claimed responsibility for the attack earlier this month.

      "Discord disclosed the incident 13 days later, on October 3. Since then, it has cut off the third-party support provider's access, launched an internal investigation with a digital forensics team and started informing affected users. It also clarified that any communication about the breach will come only from noreply@discord.com and that it will never contact users by phone regarding this incident. The company added that some data remained safe: full credit card numbers, CCV codes, account passwords and activity outside of customer support conversations were not exposed.",

First, as stated in our blog post, this was not a breach of Discord, but rather a third-party service we use to support our customer service efforts. Second, the numbers being shared are incorrect and part of an attempt to extort a payment from Discord.

      "6 steps you can take to stay safe after the Discord breach",
      "If you think your details might have leaked in the Discord data breach, below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step when logging in, making it much harder for attackers to access your account even if they have your password. Discord supports 2FA via authenticator apps or SMS. Once enabled, you'll receive a code each time you log in from a new device. This simple step can prevent account takeovers and gives you peace of mind.",
      "The less information available about you, the harder it is for attackers to target you. Review what personal details you've shared online, and remove unnecessary data from websites and apps. A personal data removal service can help scrub your information from data broker sites, making it more difficult for attackers to connect the dots and launch identity theft or phishing attacks.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Reusing passwords across platforms makes it easy for attackers to access multiple accounts if one password is compromised. A password manager can generate long, complex passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember them all. This not only protects your Discord account but also your email, banking and other online services.",

      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if you don't see immediate signs of compromise, attackers can try to exploit stolen data later. Regularly check your email and Discord login history for unusual sign-ins. Services like identity theft protection can scan the dark web for your credentials and alert you immediately if they appear, helping you react quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing attacks often spike after breaches. Attackers may send messages that look like official notifications asking you to reset your password or provide personal information. Always verify the sender, avoid clicking unknown links, and never share sensitive info. Treat every unexpected message as suspicious, even if it appears to come from Discord or another trusted service.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

Weak oversight of third-party providers, delayed responses and inadequate security policies leave personal information exposed and vulnerable to attackers.",

      "Some AI systems meant to help can actually cause harm. Therapists have warned that chatbots sometimes break their own safety rules and give dangerous advice to teens in distress. Some have been caught encouraging self-harm, giving diet tips for eating disorders or pretending to be romantic partners.

      "Researchers at Radware discovered the zero-click vulnerability in June 2025. OpenAI patched it in early August after being notified, but experts warn that similar flaws could reappear as artificial intelligence (AI) integrations expand across popular platforms like Gmail, Dropbox and SharePoint.",

      "Gmail data leaked in a zero-click attack requiring no user action.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the ShadowLeak attack worked",
      "Attackers embedded hidden instructions into an email using white-on-white text, tiny fonts or CSS layout tricks. The email looked completely harmless. But when a user later asked ChatGPT's Deep Research agent to analyze a Gmail inbox, the AI unknowingly executed the attacker's commands.",
      "The agent then used its built-in browser tools to exfiltrate sensitive data to an external server, all within OpenAI's own cloud environment, beyond the reach of antivirus or enterprise firewalls.",

      "Why this threat matters",
      "The Deep Research agent was designed to perform multistep research and summarize online data, but its wide access to third-party apps like Gmail, Google Drive and Dropbox also opened the door to abuse.",
      "Radware researchers said the attack involved encoding personal data in Base64 and appending it to a malicious URL, disguised as a \"security measure.\" Once sent, the agent believed it was acting normally.",
      "The real danger lies in the fact that any connector could be exploited the same way if attackers manage to hide prompts in analyzed content.",
      "What security experts say",
      "\"The user never sees the prompt. The email looks normal, but the agent follows the hidden commands without question,\"\u00a0the researchers explained.",
      "In a separate experiment, security firm SPLX showed another weakness: ChatGPT agents could be tricked into solving CAPTCHAs by inheriting a manipulated conversation history. Researcher Dorian Schultz noted that the model even mimicked human cursor movements, bypassing tests meant to block bots.",

      "Stay alert for updates from OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and other platforms. Security patches close newly discovered vulnerabilities before hackers can exploit them. Turn on automatic updates so you're always protected without having to think about it.",

      "\"Everything\u2019s on the table, whether or not this was a targeted attack, assassination or a robbery gone bad,\" former LAPD Detective Moses Castillo told Fox News Digital, noting that it's likely no theory has been ruled out.",

      "\"They\u2019ll canvas the neighborhood, look for Ring doorbell cameras, check his cellphone, and see whether anything was taken,\" he said. \"If he was shot on the street with multiple rounds, it\u2019s usually an emotional attack \u2014 somebody who knows him.\"",
      "He added that because the attack happened so early in the morning in a low-crime area, it may not have been a random street crime.",

      "From Castillo's perspective, the case remains wide open.",
      "\"Anything and everything\u2019s on the table,\" the detective concluded. \"Whether it was pre-planned, a random attack or an act of revenge \u2014 they\u2019re going to look at it all.\"",

      "The pieces were not insured, which is not uncommon for state collections because of the prohibitive costs, the Times reported, citing France\u2019s culture ministry.

      "As Britain marked the 100th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s birth last week,\u00a0Japan made history of its own on Tuesday by electing its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, a self-declared admirer of the \"Iron Lady.\"",
      "Takaichi, 64, who has long cited Thatcher as a personal and political inspiration, was chosen by Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), during an extraordinary session of the country's lower house, replacing former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and ending several months of political turbulence that saw the party lose its upper-house majority in July.",
      "In remarks after her election, Takaichi said she felt \"the tough work starts here\" and promised to restore public confidence and strengthen Japan\u2019s security posture. Over the years, she has praised Thatcher\u2019s \"strength and womanly warmth\" as qualities she seeks to emulate. In 2013, shortly before Thatcher\u2019s death, Takaichi met her in London \u2014 a moment she later described as \"life-changing.\"",

      "Described by some in Japanese and international media as an ultraconservative and hard-line figure, Takaichi backs strengthening Japan\u2019s defense posture, is a noted\u00a0 China hawk, and supports constitutional revision to expand the role of the Self-Defense Forces.",
      "Economically, she praises Abenomics, the policies adopted by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and favors fiscal and monetary stimulus. Abe was Japan\u2019s longest-serving prime minister and was assassinated in 2022 at a campaign rally, two years after leaving office.",
      "\"She\u2019s very different from the other people in the Liberal Democratic Party, and that\u2019s why she was selected this time,\" said Gordon Chang, author and Asia analyst, in an interview with\u00a0Fox News Digital. \"After losing its upper-house majority, the LDP realized it needed to protect its right flank by electing someone more conservative than in the past \u2014 so the Margaret Thatcher comparison does make sense.\"",
      "Known for her hawkish stance\u00a0on China, Takaichi is expected to maintain Japan\u2019s close alignment with the United States. Chang said her election could bolster Washington\u2019s strategic position in Asia, especially as tensions with Beijing remain high.",

      "\"She\u2019s a hawk on China, and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s needed right now,\" Chang said. \"That\u2019s not going to upset President Trump \u2014 if anything, it strengthens his hand in dealing with Xi Jinping. It shows America\u2019s alliances are strong and getting stronger.\"",
      "Takaichi\u2019s rise has been hailed as a milestone for female representation, though Chang emphasized that her selection was driven more by ideology than identity.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think she was chosen because she was a woman,\" he said. \"She was chosen because the party needed to shore up its right flank \u2014 and it just so happened that the most conservative of the possible candidates was a woman.\"",

Hamas has been very violent, but they don't have the backing of Iran anymore\u2026 They have to be good, and if they're not good, they'll be eradicated \u2014 because absolutely we can, and we have the capacity to do so.\"",
      "The comments came as senior U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with Israeli leaders to shore up the fragile, Trump-brokered, 20-step ceasefire plan after a weekend flare-up. Hamas terrorists killed two Israeli soldiers, prompting Israeli strikes against the terror group. Despite the violence, both Israel and Hamas publicly recommitted to the truce.",

      "NORFOLK, Va. \u2014 New York Attorney General Letitia James, a longtime political foe of President Donald Trump who previously sued him for making misleading statements to banks, pleaded not guilty Friday in federal court to bank fraud charges.",
      "James entered the plea herself shortly after the arraignment began before U.S. District Judge Jamar K. Walker.",
      "The judge set a trial date of Jan. 26, and estimated it would take about five days. James was released on her own recognizance.",
      "In court for the proceedings was Lindsey Halligan, Trump's former personal lawyer and the current acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. She was the lone prosecutor to sign James' indictment earlier this month.",
      "James' attorneys said they plan to argue the case against her should be tossed because it's a selective and vindictive prosecution. The judge scheduled a hearing on the claim for Dec. 5.",
      "James was greeted by cheering supporters as she left the courthouse.",

As a result, James' office has said, he \u201creaped hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019m surprised at how open they\u2019ve been about it,\u201d Thune said in an interview Thursday. \u201cThat statement yesterday by that House member that they know the American people are going to suffer but this is their leverage? This isn\u2019t about leverage. This isn\u2019t a political game. It\u2019s about people\u2019s lives.\u201d",

Of course, there will be families that are going to suffer. We take that responsibility very seriously. But it is one of the few leverage times we have \u2014 it is an inflection point in this budget process where we have tried to get the Republicans to meet with us and prioritize the American people.\u201d",
      "Democrats have used that \u201cleverage\u201d to push Republicans to extend Obamacare subsidies that will expire at the end of the year. Failing to do so would lead to increased health care costs for millions of people. Republicans say Democrats must first reopen the government, but, so far, the party hasn\u2019t budged.",
      "The Democratic Party\u2019s hardened resolve in the shutdown battle seems to have left the Republican majority without answers.",
      "\u201cI think the Democrats at some point have got to come to the conclusion, at least enough of them, reasonable ones, to say that this is not a sustainable position for us,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Asked to respond to Thune, Clark said in a statement Thursday that her Republican critics were taking her remarks \u201cout of context to suggest that, somehow, they are not responsible for the shutdown of a government they control.\u201d",
      "\u201cDemocrats are ready to negotiate on a budget that reopens the government and protects health care,\u201d she said.",
      "Hours later, Democrats again filibustered a GOP-written bill to pay federal workers who are required to work during the shutdown, a move designed to pressure the minority party.",
      "Democrats said it does nothing to address their demands to prevent health care cost increases and argued that the bill would let President Donald Trump \u201cweaponize\u201d the shutdown and \u201cpick and choose\u201d which of his favored employees get to be paid. They offered an alternative to pay all workers.",
      "Democratic voters had pressured their party to take a more confrontational posture toward Trump in the shutdown battle. The new stance may be paying off with the party\u2019s base.",
      "A Quinnipiac University poll conducted June 5-9 found that just 41% of Democratic voters approve of how Democrats in Congress are handling their job. A new Quinnipiac poll taken Oct. 16-20 found that number rising to 58% among self-identified Democrats.",
      "GOP leaders have faced some calls internally to abolish the filibuster and pass legislation to fund the government without Democrats, but Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, conceded that he hasn\u2019t made progress in persuading colleagues to do so.",
      "That means they still need Democratic votes to reopen the government \u2014 and are running out of answers to get them.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Trump should get more involved, as some Democrats have called for.",

People want to know how I feel about getting rid of the filibuster. No, that\u2019s not how we end a government shutdown.\u201d",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, which oversees government funding, said it\u2019s \u201creally important\u201d that Republicans understand they can\u2019t take Democratic votes for granted.",

Benefits were largely uninterrupted over the past three weeks because funding for October was allocated to states before the shutdown began on Oct. 1.",

      "Many states have announced that they plan to suspend SNAP benefits if the shutdown continues into next month. That could upend people\u2019s ability to buy food on an unprecedented scale \u2014 the program has not lapsed during any government shutdown in recent history.",
      "As Nov. 1 approaches, some state leaders are recommending that people turn to food banks or use their remaining benefits to buy non-perishable items.",
      "\u201cIf you have accrued SNAP benefits from previous months on your account, use those funds now to buy shelf-stable foods that can last through November and beyond,\u201d the Arkansas Department of Human Services says on its website.",
      "But food banks say it will be impossible to fill the gap.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way that our charitable food network or the system in this country can provide that much food overnight or quickly. It\u2019s an impossible task,\u201d said Catherine D\u2019Amato, CEO of the Greater Boston Food Bank.",
      "Her organization is already receiving calls from people asking where they can go to feed their families, she said. D\u2019Amato estimated that suspending SNAP benefits would create a deficit of up to 56 million meals in Massachusetts in November.",
      "At least one state, Pennsylvania, has already stopped issuing SNAP benefits. The state announced that \u201cstarting October 16, SNAP benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA.\u201d",
      "Texas, meanwhile, said next month\u2019s SNAP benefits won\u2019t be issued if the shutdown continues past Oct. 27. And in Wisconsin, SNAP recipients got a letter this week informing them that even their remaining funds from October may not carry over.",
      "\u201cBenefits may not be available in November,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThis may include any funds remaining on your card at the end of October. You may want to use your benefits to stock up on food before the end of October.\u201d",
      "The state treasurers of Oregon and Massachusetts said Thursday on a press call that their states have no contingency plans for SNAP if the federal government doesn\u2019t provide the funding. State budgets can\u2019t afford to cover the full cost of people\u2019s benefits, they added.",
      "\u201cAt a time when the cost of groceries continues to go up, SNAP makes the difference between having enough and going hungry,\u201d said Elizabeth Steiner, the Oregon state treasurer. \u201cThis decision on behalf of the federal government is an absolute abdication of its responsibility to families in Oregon and across the United States who are struggling to make ends meet.\u201d",
      "She added that \u201cup until now, every administration, Republican or Democrat, has understood that feeding Americans is a fundamental responsibility of the federal government.\u201d",
      "In response to questions about SNAP funding, a spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture framed the issue as an inflection point for Democrats: \u201cContinue to hold out for healthcare for illegals or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\u201d",
      "In the shutdown standoff, congressional Democrats are holding out for certain health care provisions, including an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits. Under federal law, those credits, along with other forms of federal health care, do not extend to immigrants who illegally reside in the U.S.",
      "Democrats and Republicans will need to come to an agreement on a spending package in order to reopen the government.",
      "WIC, which provides free food to low-income pregnant women, moms and children under 5, is similarly in danger of a funding shortfall in November because of the shutdown. Earlier this month, the Department of Agriculture used tax revenue to allocate $300 million to keep the program \u2014 known in full as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children \u2014 afloat. However, many states worry that the funding could run out at the end of October.",

      "To some opponents of his tariffs, Trump's frequent use of apocalyptic rhetoric about his signature policy ahead of the Nov. 5 oral argument is an obvious attempt to influence the court by focusing on the potential consequences of a ruling against him.",
      "\u201cI will tell you that\u2019s one of the most important cases in the history of our country because if we don\u2019t win that case, we will be a weakened, troubled, financial mess for many, many years to come,\u201d Trump said at the White House on Oct. 15, in just one example of his repeated comments on the subject.",
      "Trump, who has a long history of harshly criticizing judges who rule against him, has even suggested he might attend the Supreme Court in person for the oral argument Nov. 5. There is no official record of any sitting president ever attending a Supreme Court argument, according to the court and the nonprofit Supreme Court Historical Society.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request seeking comment about Trump\u2019s remarks, whether he intends to influence the court or if he will attend the oral argument.",
      "It is not the first time a president has used his bully pulpit to lean on the Supreme Court in a case crucial to his agenda. In 2012, President Barack Obama faced criticism when he said it would be an \u201cunprecedented, extraordinary step\u201d if the Supreme Court struck down the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.",
      "The court later that year narrowly upheld the law, which was Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement.",
      "Trump is known to take a keen interest in cases in which he is personally involved, including criminal and civil cases that were brought against him after he completed his first term as president. He frequently appeared in court for hearings in those cases, even when not required to.",
      "Last year, during his criminal trial in New York over \"hush money\" payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels, the judge refused to allow Trump permission to attend Supreme Court oral arguments in April in the separate election interference case regarding the scope of presidential immunity. Trump secured a major win in that case.",
      "This time around, the court, with a 6-3 conservative majority including three justices Trump appointed, will be considering whether Trump had the power to unilaterally impose the tariffs under a law reserved for use in times of emergency called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "Although the court has ruled in Trump\u2019s favor on numerous occasions in the first few months of his term, experts believe the tariffs case is a closer call.",
      "Trump's remarks over the course of this year reflect a consistent theme: In his view, the tariffs are raising so much revenue and are so important to the country that a court ruling saying that he does not have the authority to impose them would be cataclysmic.",
      "\"If we win the tariff case, which hopefully we will, it\u2019s vital to the interests of our country. We\u2019re the wealthiest country there is. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019ll be struggling for years to come,\u201d Trump said on the Fox News show \"Sunday Morning Futures\" on Oct 19.",
      "He has also weighed in on the litigation via his Truth Social feed.",
      "On Aug. 8, he said there would be a \"Great Depression\" if the tariffs were not upheld. Later that month, he said that it would be a \"total disaster for the country\" if they were struck down.",
      "Trump is also quick to accuse others of seeking to put pressure on the justices. On Thursday night, he posted that he was ending trade negotiations with Canada because he thought the country was trying to influence the Supreme Court to rule against him on tariffs via an ad sponsored by the province of Ontario.",
      "\u201cThey only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "Tariff revenues for the year have raised $174.04 billion, according to the most recent Treasury Department numbers. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, on Sept. 7, told \"Meet the Press\" that the government would have to issue refunds for about half the tariff revenues it has collected if the administration loses at the Supreme Court.",
      "To some lawyers who oppose the tariffs, Trump's remarks are easy to label.",
      "\"It's partial intimidation, it's mostly trying to scare them in terms of consequences,\" said Thomas Berry, a lawyer at the libertarian Cato Institute.",
      "\"Presumably he hopes these statements will influence the Supreme Court,\" said Elizabeth Goitein, a lawyer at the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, a Democrat who, along with other state attorneys general and some small businesses, challenged the tariffs in court, said in a statement that Trump was only \"right about one thing\" in his public statements: It is a significant case on the scope of presidential power.",
      "\"We can't normalize this behavior. We have to draw a line in the sand and hold him accountable,\" Rayfield added.",
      "Trump's characterization of how bad the consequences would be if he loses the case is massively overstated, according to Maury Obstfeld, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"The rhetoric and hyperbole have no basis in fact,\" he said. \"Large swaths of the economy and all consumers would benefit if tariffs were lowered.\"",
      "Goldman Sachs recently said that American consumers are bearing more than half the cost of tariffs, while companies have warned prices will start to increase as the impact of the tariffs are felt.",
      "Major companies like General Motors and Mattel have said they expect to take financial hits as a result of tariffs, while the impact on small businesses is even greater.",
      "The administration has both overestimated potential revenue from tariffs and used those projections to claim that Trump's signature legislative victory, the \"big, beautiful bill,\" is largely revenue neutral, Obstfeld added.",
      "\"The job of the courts is to interpret the law, not to save the government from the consequences of its own bad decisions,\" he said.",
      "Trump's focus on the potentially drastic consequences of a loss are echoed in court papers filed by Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who was previously one of the president's personal lawyers",
      "The opening paragraphs of the brief he filed outlining the government's arguments use language that is just as colorful as Trump's and sometimes quotes the president.",
      "His tone departs from the usual dry style of the Justice Department, which traditionally focuses on the technical legal arguments rather than colorful rhetoric.",
      "The tariffs, Sauer wrote, are \"necessary to rectify America\u2019s country-killing trade deficits\" and limit the distribution of illegal drugs across the border by targeting countries including Mexico and Canada that, the administration alleges, have failed to stem trafficking.",
      "Sauer\u2019s filing included a quotation from Trump saying that before he imposed the tariffs, the United States was \u201ca dead country\" but is now booming.",
      "\"To the president, these cases present a stark choice,\" Sauer wrote. \"With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation.\""

      "\u201cThe vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\u201d Hegseth wrote in a post on X. \u201cSix male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the strike, which was conducted in international waters\u2014and was the first strike at night. All six terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed in this strike.\u201d",
      "Hegseth said that this vessel belonged to the Tren de Aragua gang, which the Trump administration has named a designated terrorist organization, and was hit in the Caribbean.",
      "Earlier this week, Hegseth said he had launched a lethal strike against vessels allegedly carrying drugs to the U.S. in the eastern Pacific Ocean. In that military action, the defense secretary said, three male \u201cnarco-terrorists\u201d were killed.",
      "In his post announcing that strike, he used similar language to Friday\u2019s post, comparing the alleged drug traffickers to the terror group Al Qaeda.",

      "While fentanyl is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths every year in the United States, it is primarily smuggled in hard-to-detect amounts over the U.S.-Mexico land border through legal ports of entry, according to experts and government reports, including the bipartisan Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking.",
      "During a roundtable event with Cabinet secretaries at the White House on Thursday, Trump and Hegseth each touted the success of the recent strikes, with Hegseth promising more.",
      "\u201cWe will find you, we will map your networks, we will hunt you down, and we will kill you,\u201d Hegseth said at the event. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve seen that evidence in the maritime domain, whether it\u2019s in the Caribbean or in the Pacific with the last two strikes. We know exactly who these people are. We know what networks they work with, what foreign terrorist organizations they\u2019re a part of; we know where they\u2019re going, where they originated from, what they\u2019re carrying.\u201d",
      "The president also spoke about the strikes on vessels, explaining why his administration isn\u2019t just capturing the alleged drug traffickers on board and seizing the product they\u2019re carrying.",
      "\u201cBut we\u2019ve been capturing these boats for years, and they get back into the system, they do it again and again and again, and they don\u2019t fear that, they have no fear,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Asked whether Trump would go to Congress to ask for a declaration of war to authorize the ongoing strikes against boats, the president declined to do so.",
      "\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re just gonna kill people that are bringing drugs into our country.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "After the official trailer for \"Regretting You\" dropped, viewers likely had more questions than answers when it comes to the Colleen Hoover story's premise.",
      "The second book by Hoover to be adapted for the big screen, \"Regretting You\" follows 17-year-old Clara Grant (Mckenna Grace) and her mother, Morgan (Allison Williams), in the aftermath of tragedy.",
      "Clara is the daughter of Morgan and Chris Grant (Scott Eastwood), who had her when they were still in high school. Morgan's sister, Jenny, is newly engaged to her former high-school sweetheart Jonah (Dave Franco) after they reconnected, had a one-night-stand and welcomed a baby boy named Elijah.",
      "But the family's close dynamic is shattered when Chris and Jenny are killed in a car accident together, leaving Morgan and Jonah to reckon with why they were together in the first place. Meanwhile Clara, heartbroken by the death of her father and aunt, embarks on a relationship with Miller (Mason Thames), a boy from her school.",
      "In true Hoover fashion, \"Regretting You,\" which comes just over a year after her first movie adaptation, \"It Ends with Us,\" takes viewers through twists, turns and plenty of swoonworthy romance.",
      "The movie hit theaters Oct. 24. After the credits roll, here's your guide to any lingering questions.",
      "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Warning: Major spoilers ahead for the end of \"Regretting You.\"",
      "What Was Going on Between Chris and Jenny?",
      "Chris, Clara's father and husband to Morgan, and Jenny, Morgan's sister who was engaged to Jonah, were having an affair at the time of their death.",
      "It is revealed Chris was driving Jenny's car before the accident, even though their respective partners thought they were both at work.",
      "After the accident, Morgan and Jonah track down the location of Chris's car and find it parked outside of a hotel.",
      "Jonah goes inside and finds Jenny's bag in a hotel room, which was packed with lingerie. This confirms to Morgan that her husband and sister had been having an affair and sends her into a fury.",
      "Later in the film, Jonah finds a stack of letters Jenny had written to Chris in an old toolbox. Morgan and Jonah realize the letters are quite dated, confirming the affair had been going on for a while.",
      "Who Is Elijah's Father?",
      "The revelation of the affair calls into question the paternity of Jenny's 1-year-old son, Elijah.",
      "After the accident, Jonah shows up to Morgan's house and starts to bang on the front door. He announces that Elijah \"has his smile,\" referring to Chris.",
      "Although never explicitly confirmed, it is implied for the rest of the film that Elijah is actually Chris' biological child.",
      "After the initial shock of discovering that Elijah is not his child, Jonah leaves Elijah in the care of Morgan. Jonah does not see Elijah for a few days, until Clara \u2014 whom Morgan has intentionally kept in the dark about her father and aunt's affair \u2014\u00a0shows up to his house and tells him to go and get his child back.",
      "Jonah realizes that even if he is not Elijah's biological father, he loves him and wants to raise him as his son. Jonah runs to Morgan's house and apologizes for leaving Elijah and promises to never leave again.",
      "As Morgan supports Jonah with Elijah, their close friendship from high school resumes and gradually turns romantic. Eventually, it's revealed that when they were teenagers, Jonah had asked Morgan if \"they had it wrong,\" implying he thought he and Morgan were supposed to be together, instead of Morgan and Chris, and Jenny and Jonah.",
      "Does Clara Find out About the Affair?",
      "One of the first scenes of the movie establishes the close relationship between Clara and her aunt Jenny. While running late for family dinner, Clara calls Jenny to tell her a story about Miller, a boy from school who later becomes her boyfriend. She ends the call by saying, \"Don't tell my mom.\"",
      "Their mother-daughter relationship is also strained by Clara\u2019s dreams of studying acting, which Morgan doesn\u2019t believe is a responsible choice.",
      "So when Morgan uncovers the affair, she tells Jonah that Clara can never find out about it, as she does not want to ruin Clara's memories of her dad and aunt.",
      "When Clara arrives home one evening and walks in on Morgan and Jonah sharing their first kiss, she storms into her room upset. Unaware of their shared history, Clara assumes that her mom and her aunt's fianc\u00e9 had moved on.",
      "Clara avoids her mother for a few days, until one morning when Morgan helps her overcome a hangover. As they are sitting at the kitchen table, Morgan finally reveals to Clara that Chris and Jenny had been having an affair.",
      "How Does 'Regretting You' End?",
      "After learning the truth, Clara is able to more healthily pursue her relationship with Miller, and Morgan finally begins a long-awaited relationship with Jonah.",
      "The final scene of the film sees Clara returning home from acting rehearsal to find her family, friends and now boyfriend Miller in front of a projector screen.",
      "Jonah and Morgan sit on a coach together, with baby Elijah laying next to them. The two share a kiss and watch as Miller begins a speech.",
      "Miller announces he has been accepted off the waitlist to a film school, the same school Clara plans to attend for their acting program the next year.",
      "Miller and Clara are overjoyed to be attending the same college, and he plays a short film that he made for Clara. In the film, Miller shows videos of him and Clara from the past year, and he asks Clara to be his date to prom.",
      "After the film, Morgan pulls Clara aside to say she supports her dream to study acting in college, despite her initial doubts. Morgan tells Clara she has an incredible talent, and that she will be able to succeed. The mother and daughter finally embrace."

      "After getting to know each other in the dating pods, six couples got engaged, but only five of them continued on with the experiment since Patrick Suzuki and Kacie McIntosh called it quits before their romantic getaway.",

      "\"I\u2019m honestly surprised this is the first season where nobody got married. While we\u2019re always rooting for our participants to find a lifelong commitment \u2014 because that\u2019s what they all say they come to 'Love is Blind' for \u2014 most importantly, we root for them to make the decisions they feel are right for themselves. And I think that\u2019s what happened here,\" he said.",
      "As viewers make their way through this season, Coelen said he hopes they will \"feel the couples ended up in the right place\" and appreciate the \"bravery and vulnerability of our participants.\"",
      "Coelen knows people have had strong reactions to the Season 9 stars and several of the season's controversies.",
      "\"I love our fans and I love their passion, and I have strong feelings about the Denver pod squad as well. I love that over a season, my feelings (and the feelings of the fans) will evolve in different directions and that our producing team, along with so many viewers, will take away different things from watching the same scenes in the same season. It\u2019s really fun to witness,\" he said.",
      "The Show's Creator Reflected on the Show's Evolution",
      "Even though this is the first time no one has gotten married in a \"Love Is Blind\" finale, Coelen said he still believes that the dating show is viable.",
      "\"I think we\u2019ll see many happy couples continue to come out of the 'Love Is Blind' experiment in the future, who have fallen in love with who they are. We\u2019ll also see couples decide that their love is not enough. Whatever the outcome, the journeys along the way, which reflect our society and some of the amazing people who inhabit it, will continue to be at turns joyful, frustrating, and awe-inspiring \u2014 in a word, human,\" he said.",
      "Looking back on the overall success of the series, Coelen called the dating experiment \u201cone of the most incredible things I\u2019ve been lucky enough to be a part of, personally or professionally.\u201d",
      "Coelen said Season 9 is further proof that the experiment forces couples to examine what they really want in a relationship.",
      "\"In Season 9, at least one member of each couple felt their love was not strong enough to overcome the challenges of the real world, and they chose not to get married. That\u2019s exactly how the experiment is supposed to work, so I would say not only is the experiment working, I think it\u2019s working better than ever,\" he said."

I've done everything that I wanted to do, and I have so much love and respect for that show. That's where I started, that will always be my home. That's always a part of how I got to where I am. So no shade at all.",

I have such a big target and reputation now, if I go back out there like they might let me last a little bit, but nobody's going to let me get to the end.

And that's what I told Jeff way back when ... with the precursor, that if you guys absolutely tell me you need me, I will be there because they've done so much for me over the course of my life.",

    "summary": "What are the best heist movies to watch after the Louvre heist? Here's a list of the best art heist movies and why they appeal.",
    "story": [
      "A seven-minute heist in broad daylight from the most-visited museum in the world is like something straight out of a movie.",
      "For French authorities and officials at the Louvre, the daring robbery by four suspects on Oct. 19 is all too real as they work to try recover eight pieces from France's crown jewels that they say were taken.",
      "The cinematic nature of the heist, which authorities said involved using a truck with a basket lift, cutting tools and a pair of scooters, gave it some of the elements of a classic heist movie.",
      "\"Heist movies where you root the most for the team are when it's against a faceless institution,\" Paul Caiola, co-host of the movie podcast That Aged Well, tells TODAY.com. \"We all know what the Louvre is, and we can romanticize this team thanks to movies and pop culture. We go to a different place because the victim is not a human. I'm sure security guards didn\u2019t have great time afterward, but that\u2019s not who we think about when we think about the heist.\"",
      "The real-life drama brings to mind several films and shows that depict classic works of art or priceless jewels being snatched by a cunning crew.",
      "The best heist films and shows also usually have certain ingredients in common.",
      "\"You have some Robin Hood-type lead played by a movie star like George Clooney, Sandra Bullock or Robert Redford \u2014 someone the audience always loves,\" Caiola says. \"Then you put them against a bad guy the audience wants to root against, or a faceless institution.\"",
      "The feeling of the common man or woman taking from a powerful institution or person is also alluring.",
      "\"The bills, the jewels, the gems, the artworks: they are stowed away behind gates, doors, walls; shielded by locks, safes, impenetrable glass; protected by lasers, surveillance cameras, and motion detectors. Since ordinary people are always denied access to them, this exclusion allegorizes a key experience of modernity: being distanced from the centers of wealth and power,\" Julian Hanich of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands wrote in \"On Pros and Cons and Bills and Gates: The Heist Film as Pleasure\" in 2017.",
      "Once the two sides are established, next up is the crew.",
      "\"We all love found family, and watching people with a particular set of skills joining up to pull off a heist is thrilling,\" Caiola says. \"Then you ultimately get to watch how they do it. How are they going to get Tom Cruise past that pressure-sensitive floor in 'Mission Impossible'? What movie magic is going to get Catherine Zeta-Jones past that laser net in 'Entrapment'? \"",
      "It can't just be some smash-and-grab, either.",
      "\"It has to be complex, with plans within plans, which takes us away from ourselves and gives us that sense of escape,\" Caiola says. \"Then when it's over, what's the fallout? Do they get away with it?\"",
      "While there are a host of classic heist films like \"Ocean's Eleven\" and \"The Town\" where the crew is going after cash, these are focused on stealing precious artworks or valuable jewels.",
      "They also are a little more artsy and refined than a wild Indiana Jones adventure in search of the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant.",
      "There also is a new film that was released on Oct. 17 called \"The Mastermind\" with \"Challengers\" star Josh O'Connor that may quickly join the pantheon. It's inspired by a 1972 robbery of four paintings from an art museum in Massachusetts.",
      "'The Thomas Crown Affair'",
      "The 1999 film stars Pierce Brosnan as a suave billionaire who swipes a Monet painting from New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art and lends another painting to the museum to take its place. It shows him as a classic art thief in that he appreciates the artwork more than he's completely motivated by money.",
      "He's pursued by an insurance investigator played by Rene Russo, who falls in love with him before she believes she is betrayed by him.",
      "'Entrapment '",
      "It turns out 1999 was a big year for art heist films with big movie stars, as this one features Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery.",
      "Just like Russo in \"The Thomas Crown Affair,\" Zeta-Jones portrays an insurance investigator on the hunt for Connery's art thief, although her job turns out to be a cover for her own identity as a thief.",
      "The classic shot from this movie is Catherine Zeta-Jones in a skintight outfit deftly moving through a field of laser beams while wearing a blindfold. She is training at a Scottish castle with Connery for the exact moves she will have to execute for a later heist.",
      "Connery is later revealed to have been an informant for the FBI helping to entrap Zeta-Jones' character, whom he then helps escape before they are reunited.",
      "'Lupin'",
      "The 2021 Netflix hit stars Omar Sy as the title character of Assane Diop, a master of disguise and illusion who was inspired by a fictional early 1900s character named Arsene Lupin.",
      "In his quest to seek revenge in memory of his late father, he steals an expensive diamond necklace from the family that wrongly accused his father of once pilfering it. The theft touches off a series of events that eventually lead to the son of Sy's character being kidnapped at the end of the first season.",
      "An episode in Season 2 involves pretending to steal a priceless Pissaro painting, and the show features numerous escapes, disguises and subterfuge.",
      "'Ocean\u2019s Twelve'",
      "This is the series that more than fulfills Caiola's \"get a big-name movie star to portray the thief\" rule for a good heist film, and then some.",
      "\"Ocean's Twelve\" is the first sequel to the classic \"Ocean's Eleven\" in which a gang of thieves led by George Clooney and Brad Pitt rob a Las Vegas casino owned by Terry Benedict, a villainous character played by Andy Garcia.",
      "\"Ocean's Twelve\" reunites the gang, which also includes Julia Roberts and Matt Damon, after Benedict tracks them down and demands they return the stolen money. He gives them two weeks to come up with it. This time there is more of a precious artifact twist compared to the cash heist in the original film.",
      "Their target becomes the Imperial Coronation Faberg\u00e9 egg, which they plan to take during an exhibition in Rome. A couple of double crosses result in the crew getting their money to pay back Benedict in the end.",
      "'The Score'",
      "Following on the heels of \"Entrapment\" and \"The Thomas Crown Affair,\" this Robert DeNiro vehicle from 2001 stars the legendary actor as an ace safe-cracker.",
      "This one might hit a little close to home for the people of France after the Louvre theft because it's about stealing an item considered in the movie to be a French national treasure.",
      "DeNiro and a crew that also includes Edward Norton aim to steal a royal scepter from the Montreal Customs House in Canada and its impenetrable safe. This fits the goal of complexity for a good heist film because it involves an elaborate scheme that features disguises, explosives and sneaking through sewer tunnels.",
      "'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery'",
      "The sequel to the \"Knives Out\" whodunit, this 2022 movie returns Daniel Craig's master detective Benoit Blanc to unravel a mystery.",
      "A tech billionaire played by Edward Norton hosts a murder mystery at his private island on Greece in which he displays the iconic \"Mona Lisa,\" which he claims to have on loan from the Louvre.",

      "TOKYO \u2014 As Japan tries to placate President Donald Trump amid contentious trade talks, officials may be eyeing an icon of American manufacturing that has virtually no presence there: The Ford F-150 pickup truck.",
      "Trump, who is visiting the key U.S. ally next week as part of his first trip to Asia since returning to office, has long criticized the lack of American vehicles sold in Japan, citing what he believes are non-tariff barriers.",
      "Japanese auto brands such as Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi and Subaru are ubiquitous in the United States, where Japan exported over 1.37 million vehicles last year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA). Cars are Japan\u2019s top export to the U.S., though according to JAMA most Japanese cars sold there are actually assembled in North America.",
      "By contrast, Japanese brands account for more than 90% of new cars sold in Japan, which imported fewer than 17,000 American vehicles last year, according to the Japan Automobile Importers Association.",
      "The Trump administration has been pushing Japan to buy more American cars, including as part of a trade deal announced in July that imposed a 15% tariff on Japanese autos and auto parts. A joint statement on the agreement published last month said Japan would allow vehicles built and certified for safety in the U.S. to be sold in the country without additional testing.",
      "In August, Trump suggested that there would soon be a market in Japan for American cars, specifically the Ford F-150.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re taking the very beautiful Ford 150, which does very well and I\u2019m sure will do very well there,\u201d he told CNBC. The model has long been the best-selling vehicle in America, according to industry outlets.",
      "Reuters reported this week that Ford F-150s were part of a purchase package being finalized to present to Trump during talks in Tokyo next week, citing two sources with knowledge of the preparations. It said the trucks might be used in Japan as snow plows.",
      "Local media in Japan have also said the government is considering buying the trucks.",
      "Japanese officials have not confirmed the reports, and the new trade minister, Ryosei Akazawa, was not asked about them at his first news conference on Friday.",
      "Akazawa, who was previously Japan\u2019s lead trade negotiator with the U.S., said earlier this month that while Trump\u2019s frequent mentions of the Ford F-150 suggested they were a \u201cfavorite\u201d of his, he did not have information to share on any potential purchases by the Japanese government.",
      "Despite the advocacy by Trump, large, expensive American cars have long been a hard sell in Japan, where roads are typically smaller and narrower than their American counterparts.",
      "\u201cFully-sized pickups simply wouldn\u2019t fit on Japanese roads and into the standard pay parking lots,\u201d Mike Smitka, a member of GERPISA, an international network dedicated to the global automobile industry, told NBC News.",
      "Many of the vehicles sold in Japan are mini or \u201ckei\u201d cars that are far smaller and more fuel efficient than the ones produced by American automakers. They are required by law to be no more than about 11.2 feet long and 4.9 feet wide, compared with the F-150 which is typically more than 17 feet long and 6.6 feet wide.",
      "European vehicles are also far more popular in Japan than American ones, accounting for more than 200,000 imports last year. The top-selling European car brand in Japan is Mercedes-Benz.",
      "\u201cUnlike European car companies, Ford and General Motors (GM) don\u2019t have dedicated port facilities or dealerships,\u201d Smitka said in emailed comments. \u201cThey\u2019d be very expensive to import, expensive to market, and because there\u2019s no network, expensive to service.\u201d",
      "Ford did not respond to an emailed request for comment. In 2016, the company said that it would close all operations in Japan, saying it had struggled to gain market share and saw \u201cno reasonable path to profitability.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t try to sell pickups because they understand the market,\u201d Smitka said.",

      "Takaichi, 64, the new leader of the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was elected by lawmakers in the lower house of parliament by a vote of 237-149 over her closest rival, Yoshihiko Noda, leader of the liberal opposition Constitutional Democratic Party. She was also elected by upper house lawmakers in a second vote of 125-46 after falling one vote shy of a majority in the first round.",
      "Though her election is a milestone in a country where women are severely underrepresented in government, Takaichi enters office with a fragile coalition and facing a number of pressing challenges, including a visit next week by President Donald Trump.",
      "Takaichi, who says her hero is former British conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, has appointed two other women to her Cabinet, the same as the previous government. They include Satsuki Katayama, Japan\u2019s first female finance minister.",
      "\u201cI place great importance on equal opportunity, equal chances. And also participation from people from all walks of life,\u201d Takaichi said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cI formed my Cabinet with this idea in mind, bringing together the combined strength of all generations.\u201d",
      "But Takaichi\u2019s victory is not necessarily a victory for women in general, critics say, especially after she secured it by forming an alliance with an Osaka-based party that will pull her coalition even further to the right.",
      "\u201cOne would like to say this is a historic moment in Japan,\u201d Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, told NBC News. \u201cBut it\u2019s really hard to make that case, given her rather poor track record on empowering women.\u201d",
      "Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage and favors keeping succession to men only in Japan\u2019s shrinking imperial family. She also opposes changing the rules to make it easier for married women to keep their maiden names in Japan, where married couples are required to have the same surname.",
      "Progress toward gender equality has been slow in Japan, where women are far outnumbered at the highest levels of business and government and bear a disproportionate responsibility for child care and household chores.",
      "Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, ranked 118th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report. It noted that women make up less than 16% of Japanese lawmakers in the lower house of parliament and 10% of government ministers.",
      "After Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP earlier this month, Japanese feminist author Chizuko Ueno said that the prospect of Japan getting its first female prime minister \u201cdoesn\u2019t make me happy.\u201d",
      "Takaichi \u201csees herself as the Japanese version of Thatcher,\u201d Ueno, 77, said in a post on X. \u201cBritish feminists, who inherited Thatcher, have no illusions about women in leadership positions.\u201d",
      "She noted Takaichi\u2019s opposition to allowing separate surnames for married couples even as she has kept her own maiden name. Though Takaichi changed her legal name in 2004 when she first married Taku Yamamoto, she continued to use her maiden name professionally until they divorced in 2017, in line with legislation she had proposed.",
      "When they remarried in 2021, Yamamoto, a former LDP lawmaker, changed his legal surname to Takaichi.",
      "Takaichi \u2014 who in her youth rode motorcycles and played the drums in a heavy metal band \u2014 has pushed for greater support for women\u2019s health. She has talked about her personal struggles with symptoms of menopause and the importance of raising awareness \u201cso that men can properly understand when women are struggling, whether at school or in the workplace.\u201d",
      "But her campaign was focused mainly on the economy and national defense.",
      "Takaichi is a veteran politician who has served as minister of economic security, internal affairs and gender equality. A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, she advocates tougher immigration policies, the revision of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution and higher defense spending.",
      "Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock exchange closed at an all-time high for the second day in a row Tuesday, on hopes that Takaichi\u2019s policies might help jumpstart the economy.",
      "Earlier this month Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since World War II, after running unsuccessfully in 2021 and 2024. In her victory speech, she underlined her commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cI myself will throw out the term \u2018work-life balance,\u2019\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cI will work and work and work and work and work.\u201d",
      "Her ascension to prime minister was thrown into doubt, however, after a crucial partner, the centrist party Komeito, left the LDP coalition.",
      "To ensure her victory, the LDP signed a deal Monday with the Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin, a far-right party based in Osaka.",
      "Even with the alliance, Takaichi faces an uphill battle in parliament, where she falls short of a majority in both houses after the LDP suffered major losses in recent elections amid voter anger over party corruption scandals and the rising cost of living. Her premiership could thus end up being short-lived \u2014 much like that of her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, who was in office for a year.",

      "Their daring heist pierced the nation\u2019s self-image, too.",
      "Threatening museum staff with their angle-grinders, the otherwise unarmed thieves then smashed through two display cases, taking necklaces, tiaras and brooches from France\u2019s now dispatched royal families, officials said.",
      "This all played out just after the museum had opened, with bystanders able to video one suspect in a high-visibility vest standing at one of the glass boxes housing historical treasures.",
      "Investigators say they are puzzled why the culprits left behind the colossal, 140-carat Regent diamond, which has been valued at $60 million. Had they wandered down that opulent corridor, they would have reached the Mona Lisa \u2014 itself infamously stolen more than a century ago.",
      "As it was, they made off on two scooters, but not before they dropped two items, including the Crown of Empress Eug\u00e9nie, empress to Napoleon III in the 19th century, which was found broken near the scene, officials said.",
      "That item alone is \"worth several tens of millions of euros,\" Alexandre Giquello, president of France's leading Drouot auction house, told the Reuters news agency. \"And it's not, in my opinion, the most important item\" taken by the burglars.",
      "Some experts have said that because the items are unique they cannot be sold, and so the thieves will likely try to melt down their metals and break up their emeralds, sapphires, diamonds and pearls. That means investigators might have less than a week before the jewels are lost forever.",
      "The incident saw the Louvre shuttered Sunday and again Monday morning, with bewildered crowds evacuated from the area just after the assailants had struck.",
      "For a nation whose character is defined by proud displays of history and culture, the incident is being seen in some quarters as a national humiliation.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron called it \u201can attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our history.\u201d He vowed to \u201crecover the works and the perpetrators will be brought to justice,\u201d adding that \u201ceverything is being done, everywhere, to achieve this.\u201d",
      "The Culture and Interior ministries held an emergency meeting Monday and agreed to ask senior officials across France \u201cto immediately assess the existing security measures already in place around cultural institutions, and to strengthen them if necessary,\u201d the Interior Ministry said, according to Reuters.",
      "Justice Minister Gerard Darmanin said the heist gave a \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cdeplorable\u201d image of France. \u201cWhat is certain is that we failed,\u201d he told the radio station France Inter. \u201cThe French people all feel like they\u2019ve been robbed.\u201d",
      "One of Macron\u2019s main political opponents, Jordan Bardella, the far-right leader who is favorite to replace him at the next presidential election in 2027, cast the crime as another example of \u201cthe disintegration of the state\u201d under Macron, and \u201can unbearable humiliation for our country.\u201d",
      "It is not the first time the Louvre has been targeted by thieves.",
      "In 1911, a museum decorator named Vincenzo Peruggia stole the Mona Lisa. And more recently French museums have been hit with a spate of thefts, including raw gold stolen from the National Museum of Natural History and porcelain works reportedly worth around $11 million taken from the Adrien Dubouche Museum in Limoges last month.",
      "After the theft at the Louvre, the union SUD Culture blamed \"destruction of jobs dedicated to security\" and funding shortfalls for security equipment.",
      "That hints at the wider disquiet percolating in France.",
      "Macron has seen multiple governments collapse as he tries to staunch the rise of Bardella\u2019s National Rally. Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest at public spending cuts.",
      "Now, authorities have another crisis at their door.",
      "Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on BFM TV that if the heist was commissioned by a collector, then there is a chance of getting the items back in their original condition.",
      "However, if not, the leading Dutch art detective Arthur Brand told Sky News that the police \"have a week\" before the jewels vanish forever.",
      "\"These crown jewels are so famous, you just cannot sell them,\" he said. \"The only thing they can do is melt the silver and gold down, dismantle the diamonds, try to cut them. That's the way they will probably disappear forever.\"",
      "\"It's a race against time.\"",

      "Friday\u2019s announcement came after the Mail on Sunday and the Sun on Sunday newspapers published an email, not verified by NBC News, reported to have been sent by Andrew to Epstein in 2011, after a photograph was published showing Andrew with his arm around Giuffre, accompanied by Ghislaine Maxwell.",

      "Vice President JD Vance stressed Wednesday that U.S. officials were not seeking to babysit the Gaza Strip ceasefire and that Israel was a partner, not a \u201cvassal state,\u201d as questions rose over the next steps in the Middle East.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has hosted a string of senior American officials in recent days, exchanged words of friendship and optimism with Vance at a joint news conference in Jerusalem as Washington worked to ensure the truce brokered by President Donald Trump will hold.",
      "\u201cI never said it was easy, but what I am is optimistic that the ceasefire is going to hold and that we can actually build a better future in the entire Middle East,\u201d Vance said, speaking alongside Netanyahu.",
      "The vice president\u2019s visit followed the arrival of Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was set to follow Thursday and meet with Netanyahu on Friday, the Israeli government said.",
      "The vice president and the Israeli leader championed each other\u2019s efforts in securing the ceasefire deal, which came into effect on Oct. 10.",
      "But as a succession of U.S. representatives flocked to Israel this week after flares of violence threatened to undermine the ceasefire, Vance also appeared to seek to reassure the Israeli leader \u2014 and the world \u2014 that the U.S. wasn\u2019t looking to overstep.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want a vassal state and that\u2019s not what Israel is. We don\u2019t want a client state,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want a partnership.\u201d",
      "He later clarified the role of the Americans in Israel this week as the ceasefire looked fragile and the path to the second phase of the deal appeared uncertain.",
      "It wasn\u2019t about \u201cmonitoring in the sense of, you know, you monitor a toddler. It\u2019s about monitoring in the sense that there\u2019s a lot of work, a lot a good people who are doing that work and it\u2019s important for the principles of the administration to keep on ensuring that our people are doing what we need them to do,\u201d Vance said.",
      "Netanyahu was asked by a reporter whether Israel was becoming a \"protectorate of the United States.\" He dismissed the idea as \"hogwash\" but maintained that \"we make the decisions for the security of Israel.\"",
      "The planned international security force in Gaza has loomed as a major question mark, with some in Israel concerned that such a force could limit its freedom to act in Gaza in the future.",
      "Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday that \u201cnumerous of our NOW GREAT ALLIES in the Middle East, and areas surrounding the Middle East,\u201d had \u201cexplicitly and strongly, with great enthusiasm, informed me that they would welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into GAZA with a heavy force.\u201d",

      "After \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab,\u201d which counts Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara as executive producers, received a nearly 23-minute standing ovation at its Venice Film Festival premiere in September, filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania took a slew of meetings with potential North American distributors.",
      "Executives praised the film, which follows the Palestine Red Crescent Society\u2019s failed attempt to save Hind, a Palestinian child  who was killed in Gaza in 2024 after being trapped in a car under Israeli fire. But not a single major studio or streamer made an offer on the movie, the official Oscar submission of the Tunisian Culture Ministry, Ben Hania said.",
      "\u201cPeople never say, \u2018I\u2019m afraid to pick up a movie,\u2019\u201d Ben Hania said. \u201cMaybe they are. I don\u2019t know. They can\u2019t openly talk about it, because it\u2019s a shame to be afraid of talking about the killing of a child.\u201d",
      "Four movies that tell stories about Palestinian people, set from 1936 to 2024, are competing for this year\u2019s Academy Award for best international feature, just as a ceasefire takes hold in the region. The films, \u201cAll That\u2019s Left of You,\u201d \u201cPalestine 36,\u201d \u201cThe Sea,\u201d and \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab,\u201d are screening for awards voters this fall. Three of them are slated to run at the American Film Institute Festival in Los Angeles this week.",
      "Despite interest at the start of filming, and in some cases A-list backers, none of these films have secured a deal with a major studio or streamer, which is uncommon when a title receives buzz overseas.

      "As Hollywood has grown more outspoken in recent months about the situation in the Middle East, the challenges of convincing its distributors \u2014 the lifelines that can take movies from obscurity to national recognition \u2014 remain.",
      "The batch of movies arrives as the crisis in the Gaza Strip remains a flashpoint issue in the entertainment industry. More than 5,000 film and television professionals have signed on to a boycott of Israeli film institutions, while two studios, Paramount and Warner Bros.. have condemned the boycott. Just as some in Hollywood have worried about saying the wrong thing in a social media post or a red carpet interview, others have been vocal, like Javier Bardem, who wore a keffiyeh to the Emmy Awards in September and openly criticized the war in interviews on the red carpet, or Amy Schumer, who posted frequently on her Instagram account calling for the release of the Israeli hostages.",
      "Foreign films that get picked up for distribution often land with smaller independent companies, limiting the films to a few cities and small marketing budgets. International films have also long struggled with marketing to English-speaking audiences with non-English language films.",
      "Multiple distributors declined to comment on the record about why studios aren\u2019t buying the movies about Palestinians, but studio sources said either that their slates were already full or that the movies don\u2019t seem likely to draw large audiences to theaters.",
      "Without a major distributor, it can be hard for films from the region to demonstrate theatrical potential. But last year\u2019s Oscar-winning \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a documentary about a Palestinian community in the occupied West Bank, shows both an appetite among American audiences for Palestinian stories and the complex issues these films face.",
      "When \u201cNo Other Land\u201d failed to close a theatrical deal in North America, producers paid to release it in theaters themselves, collecting $2.5 million domestically, enough to make theirs the third highest grossing documentary of the year so far, after films featuring Taylor Swift and Led Zeppelin. The filmmakers then turned down an offer to stream on U.S. platforms from Mubi, citing the London company\u2019s backing from Sequoia Capital, which also invests in an Israeli defense tech startup called Kela. (In August, Mubi\u2019s CEO responded to backlash about Sequoia financing by saying that the profits Mubi generates \u201cdo not fund any other companies in Sequoia\u2019s portfolio.\u201d)",
      "For the filmmakers working in the region over the past two years, it\u2019s been a long, arduous road to reach audiences, as the war impacted their physical productions and made potential distributors wary of facing political backlash for releasing their films.",
      "Seeking to fill what they see as a void in the marketplace, Palestinian-American brothers and producers Hamza and Badi Ali formed their own company, Watermelon Pictures, in April 2024. The duo also tapped model Alana Hadid as Watermelon\u2019s creative director and unofficial brand ambassador.",
      "\u201cTruthfully, we wish there was more competition,\u201d Hamza Ali  said. \u201cIt is almost like all of the pressure is on us to release these films and we feel obligated to do so. We hope that distributors of all sizes will start to engage.\u201d",
      "The Chicago-based company is distributing \u201cAll That\u2019s Left of You,\u201d submitted by the Royal Film Commission\u2013Jordan for Oscar consideration, and \u201cPalestine 36,\u201d submitted by the Palestinian Culture Ministry, both of which also received long ovations at film festivals and strong reviews from critics.",
      "Over a year since the company\u2019s launch, the Ali brothers said that when they meet with executives at larger studios and streamers about buying films on Palestinian people, the buyers defer to higher ranking executives, citing the sensitivity of the subject matter, and effectively ending any conversation about a deal.",
      "For some directors, the barriers have come from their own governments.",
      "In Israel, filmmaker Shai Carmeli-Pollack won the country\u2019s version of the Oscar for \u201cThe Sea,\u201d the Ophir Award, only to have the Israeli government condemn the film and pull funding for the organization that granted the award. Each country chooses its own film to submit for Oscar consideration, and in Israel, the winner of best film at the Ophir Awards is automatically the country\u2019s submission.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised,\u201d said Carmeli-Pollack, whose film is about a 12-year-old Palestinian boy who wants to join a school trip to the beach. \u201cI\u2019m not the first film that they attacked. In a way, they saved us a lot of explaining to the world that we do not represent this government.\u201d",
      "In a statement issued on social media in September regarding the decision, Israeli Culture Minister Miki Zohar wrote in Hebrew that he believes the country\u2019s taxpayers shouldn\u2019t have to support a \u201cceremony that spits on the heroic Israeli soldiers. (The film features a soldier questioning a Palestinian boy and his father as they are trying to go to the beach).",
      "Carmeli-Pollack shot his movie in the West Bank in the summer of 2023, and he said he saw distributors\u2019 enthusiasm for it evaporate after the Oct. 7 attacks. \u201cThe Sea\u201d is now being released in the U.S. by Menemsha Films, a small Los Angeles-based company that distributes a variety of Jewish films.",
      "Stories shot in the Palestinian territories have always faced hurdles when it comes to securing locations, but the crisis in Gaza made physical production virtually impossible, directors who spoke to NBC News said.",
      "Cherien Dabis, the director, writer and star of \u201cAll That\u2019s Left Of You,\u201d was scheduled to start shooting her film in October 2023 in Jericho. Plans changed after the Oct. 7, Hamas-led attacks on Israel, which led Dabis to evacuate her cast and crew from the West Bank.",
      "\u201cWe were hearing fighter jets and cities were being sealed off, checkpoints were closing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought maybe we\u2019d come back to Palestine, things would blow over. We had no idea.\u201d",

      "Dabis, whose movie she said is backed by a mix of European and Arab financing, ended up shooting in Greece, Cyprus and Jordan, telling the fraught history of the region through three generations of one family who were expelled from Jaffa in 1948.",
      "\u201cPalestine 36\u201d director Annemarie Jacir was also scheduled to shoot her historical drama in October 2023 in the West Bank, with a cast that includes British actor Jeremy Irons and Palestinian actress Hiam Abbass.",

      "In order to help their movies find wider audiences, some are enlisting high-profile Hollywood advocates.",

      "Flashes of violence in Gaza in recent days have threatened to unravel the truce deal, with both Israel and Hamas trading accusations that the other side had violated the fragile ceasefire. The two sides also clashed over delays in returning hostage bodies held by Hamas and ongoing barriers to aid access in the enclave.",

    "story": [
      "A boy who swallowed up to 100 high-powered magnets purchased online has undergone major surgery to remove them.",
      "After four days of stomach pain, the 13-year-old boy was admitted to Tauranga Hospital on New Zealand's North Island, where doctors discovered the magnets had joined together to form four chains inside his intestines.",
      "Surgeons extracted the magnets and removed parts of the boy's damaged intestines, according to a report by doctors at the hospital, published Friday in the New Zealand Medical Journal.",
      "The boy, who was not identified in the report, had swallowed \u201capproximately 80\u2013100 5x2mm high-power neodymium magnets\u201d a week prior to his hospitalization, the doctors said. He was discharged after spending eight days in the hospital.",
      "New Zealand banned the sale of small, high-powered magnets in 2013, after the government warned that children could suffer serious injuries if they swallowed the magnets, whether out of curiosity or while playing with them as \u201cmock jewellery.\u201d",
      "\u201cThough these magnets tend to be marketed at adults as office toys and many brands carry strict safety warnings, it is clear from the cases here and overseas that they pose too great a risk to children,\u201d Simon Bridges, then New Zealand\u2019s consumer affairs minister, said in a statement at the time, citing previous child hospitalizations in the U.S. and Australia.",
      "However, the authors of the New Zealand Medical Journal report noted that enforcing the long-standing ban remains challenging, as the magnets can still be easily purchased through online marketplaces.",
      "\u201cWhile these laws can be enforced locally, it is more difficult to regulate products supplied by overseas merchants on large-scale online marketplaces,\u201d the authors said.",
      "\u201cThese platforms are easily accessible especially by children, with purchases being inexpensive and not always requiring age verification,\u201d they added.",
      "The report said that the magnets had been purchased via the Chinese online marketplace Temu. In a statement to NBC News, Temu said it has not yet been able to confirm whether the magnets in question were purchased through its platform.",
      "\u201cWe are sorry to learn about the reported incident and wish the boy a full and speedy recovery,\u201d Temu\u2019s spokespersons said.",
      "\u201cWe take product safety very seriously and continuously monitor our platform to ensure sellers are complying with the safety regulations of the markets they are doing business in,\u201d they said.",
      "The marketplace platform said it has reached out to the New Zealand Medical Journal for more details on the case, and its teams are reviewing relevant listings to ensure they meet local safety standards, adding that any noncompliant products will be removed and sellers found violating platform rules or local laws will face firm action."

    "published": "Thu, 23 Oct 2025 13:15:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Russia reacted with outrage after President Donald sanctioned Russian energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil.",
    "story": [
      "Russia reacted with outrage Thursday after the United States imposed substantial sanctions on its two largest oil companies, the first economic punishments slapped on Moscow by President Donald Trump during his second term.",
      "Experts said it remains to be seen, however, the extent to which this move may damage the Russian economy or Vladimir Putin\u2019s war machine, as Trump hopes to pressure Moscow to halt its assault on Ukraine.",
      "Days after canceling a planned summit with Putin, citing a lack of progress in the negotiations, Trump took the major step by effectively blacklisting Rosneft and Lukoil.",
      "The announcement was welcomed by Kyiv and its European allies, which added their own new raft of sanctions on Moscow, earning the ire of Russian officials and the state-controlled media.",
      "Speaking to journalists at the Kremlin on Thursday, Putin called the sanctions an \"unfriendly act\" but quickly brushed off their likely impact. \"They are serious in nature and will have certain consequences, but they will not have a significant impact on the health of our economy,\" he said.",
      "Putin added that sanctions on Russian oil could lead to \"a sharp increase\" in gas prices across the world, adding: \"If you take into account the domestic political calendar in the United States, it is clear how sensitive some processes would be. Those advising the current administration to adopt such measures should ask themselves whom they are really serving.\"",
      "The Russian leader said that he understood the U.S. wished to \"cancel or postpone\" the planned Budapest summit, adding that \"for both me and the U.S. president, it would be a mistake to approach this lightly and then walk away without the expected result.\"",
      "Hawkish ex-President Dmitry Medvedev, who now serves as the deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, was more forthright in his criticism of the Trump administration. \u201cThe USA is our adversary, and their loquacious \u2018peacemaker\u2019\u201d \u2014 meaning Trump \u2014 \u201chas now fully taken up the path of war with Russia,\u201d Medvedev wrote in a social media post.",
      "Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova added in a news briefing: \u201cIf the current U.S. administration decides to follow the example of its predecessors, who tried to pressure or force Russia to abandon its national interests through illegitimate sanctions, the outcome will be exactly the same: a failure, both politically at home and harmful to global economic stability.\u201d",
      "The sanctions have been received in Russia as another flip-flop by Trump, who has tried to strong-arm both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at different times during his second term.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. president has changed his tune once again,\u201d wrote Komsomolskaya Pravda, Putin\u2019s favorite newspaper. Another paper, Moskovskij Komsomolets, likened the U.S. president to a \u201cKolobok,\u201d a scheming bread bun from Slavic folklore.",
      "Trump has often expressed verbal frustration with Putin, accusing him of making positive diplomatic noises before bombing Ukrainian civilians again, but until now had avoided taking direct action.",
      "This week, he said that meeting with Putin would be a \"waste of time,\" after Russia rejected the American demand that a ceasefire come before talks.",
      "\u201cWe canceled the meeting with President Putin; it just didn\u2019t feel right to me,\u201d Trump said at a White House gathering of reporters. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it, but we\u2019ll do it in the future.\u201d",
      "The sanctions drew praise from Ukraine and its supporters.",
      "\u201cWe waited for this. God bless, it will work. And this is very important,\u201d Zelenskyy said in Brussels.",
      "This is far from the first time that Russia has been punished like this. Under the administration of President Joe Biden, the U.S., along with the European Union and others, tried to squeeze Russia\u2019s banking and energy sectors, attempting to isolate it from the global market.",
      "This did cause Russia some pain, with its oil and gas revenues declining after the initial measure introduced in 2022. However, it has been able to avoid the worst of it, with its 3.6% economic growth in 2024 outpacing even the U.S.\u2019 2.8%. It did this by increasing sales to China and India, and using its so-called \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of vessels to carry exports in off-book moves.",
      "These ships were the target of new E.U. sanctions announced Thursday, which also sought to hit Russian energy and the ability of its diplomats to move freely in Europe.",
      "Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, was bullish about Russia\u2019s ability to weather these moves, as it has done before.",
      "The measures \u201cwill not cause any particular difficulties,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country has developed a strong immunity to Western restrictions and will continue to steadily strengthen its economic and energy potential.\u201d",
      "Western analysts said the picture was more nuanced.",
      "\"Russia is extremely skilled at avoiding the consequences of Western sanctions,\" Brett Bruen, the director of global engagement in the Obama White House and a career American diplomat, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis is clearly a new threshold,\u201d said Fabrice Pothier, NATO\u2019s former director of policy planning who is now the CEO of Rasmussen Global, a consultancy based in Copenhagen, Denmark. But \u201cthe Russian economy has shown its capacity to adapt and reposture itself, especially with Asian economies, starting with China and India.\u201d",
      "So that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a game changer,\u201d he said of the new sanctions, \u201cbut it means it\u2019s just putting more cost on Putin\u2019s actions. Whether the cost is going to be high enough for him to change, I doubt it. It will probably take more.\u201d",
      "Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who served in the Biden administration, called the U.S. sanctions a \u201cheartening move.\u201d Eddie Fishman, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, agreed in that \u201cthis is a big step.\u201d",
      "However, he and others said that success of the sanctions would depend on two things: How strictly the U.S. is willing and able to enforce them; and whether it decides to take any actions on other countries buying Russian energy, namely the two Asian giants propping up Moscow so far.",
      "\u201cThis won\u2019t seriously deprive Putin of his war dollars unless we sanction the eight refineries that buy the oil in China, India,\u201d said Bill Browder, an American-born investment fund manager and key Putin critic.",
      "\u201cTrump does not feel beholden in the same way that Biden was not touching third rails,\" said Bruen \u2014 using the \"third rail\" metaphor to describe Trump's willingness to grapple with previously \"untouchable\" foreign policy issues.",
      "\"And so if he is willing to use secondary sanctions, with more aggressive steps such as expanding the radius of where Ukraine can use Western weapons, all of that will mount pressure on Putin.\u201d",
      "Separately, two Russian aircraft flying from Kaliningrad violated Lithuanian airspace near Kybartai on Thursday, two Lithuanian officials told NBC News.",
      "A Russian SU-30 fighter aircraft and an IL-78 refueling aircraft flew into Lithuanian territory at about 700 meters and fled after having been in Lithuanian airspace for about 18 seconds, they said.",
      "Two Spanish fighters called Eurofighter Typhoons were dispatched as part of the NATO air police mission and flew to the site of the violation.",
      "The officials said the NATO air mission worked, and both praised their efforts. They also said Lithuanian government leaders are discussing a possible response.",
      "The Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Ministry summoned the Russian charge d\u2019affaires to protest the airspace violation. There was no immediate reaction from the Russian Defense Ministry.",
      "Several European countries have in recent months accused Russia of violating their airspace with jets and drones as part of a broader effort to test NATO\u2019s military response measures. The Russian Defense Ministry has denied illegally violating European airspace."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Music met medicine when a patient played a clarinet solo as she underwent brain surgery for Parkinson's disease and proved that the treatment was working in real time.",
      "Denise Bacon, 65, saw her finger movements improve instantly during four hours of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery \u2014 all while staying awake and performing on the musical instrument, London's King\u2019s College Hospital said in a news release Tuesday.",
      "The retired speech and language therapist was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s in 2014, She has since suffered difficulties walking, swimming, dancing and playing her beloved clarinet as the  progressive neurological disorder that affects movement has taken hold of her body.",
      "To help Bacon get these abilities back, Keyoumars Ashkan, professor of neurosurgery, performed DBS on her, implanting electrodes in Bacon's brain and tracking her body\u2019s reaction in real time.",
      "\u201cStimulating electrodes are placed into the deep structures of the brain,\u201d Ashkan said in the hospital\u2019s news release, adding that it was \u201ca long-established procedure to improve motor symptoms in patients with movement disorders.\u201d",
      "Although the brain itself has no pain receptors, Bacon was given local anesthetic to numb her scalp and skull, as doctors made holes half the size of a small coin in her skull and implanted the stimulating electrodes inside.",
      "A pulse generator, similar to a pacemaker, was then connected to the electrodes to send targeted electrical signals to the brain.",
      "\u201cAs a keen clarinetist, it was suggested Denise bring her clarinet into the operating theatre to see whether the procedure would improve her ability to play, which was one of Denise\u2019s main goals for the surgery,\u201d Ashkan said.",
      "An amateur musician, Bacon played the instrument with the East Grinstead Concert Band until Parkinson\u2019s symptoms made it impossible for her to continue five years ago.",
      "However, as she played during the surgery, she noticed an immediate improvement in her hand movements.",
      "\u201cI remember my right hand being able to move with much more ease once the stimulation was applied, and this in turn improved my ability to play the clarinet, which I was delighted with,\u201d she said in the news release.",
      "Brain surgeries usually require general anesthesia, but certain procedures require the patient to be awake so doctors can ensure they aren't damaging vital brain functions.",
      "It is not the first procedure of this kind to be performed by Ashkan at King\u2019s College Hospital. In 2020, a violinist played jazz classics as a tumor was removed from her brain.",
      "Bacon also said she had seen early progress in her walking and is now looking forward to returning to activities such as swimming and dancing.",
      "For the next 20 years, the chest-implanted pulse generator will help Bacon by constantly delivering electrical impulses, and giving her the chance to return to the hobbies and passions she loves, King\u2019s College Hospital said in the release."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 As the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown narrows paths to entry for foreign science and technology workers, China is opening its doors wider \u2014 and drawing backlash from the public.",
      "The new \u201cK visa,\u201d which launched Oct. 1, aims to make it easier for the world\u2019s top young talents in science and technology to live and work longer in China as it vies with the United States for global dominance in the fields.",
      "The new category requires no job offer, with the only requirements being an as-yet-unspecified age cap and having at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in science, technology, engineering or math from a top Chinese or foreign university, or relevant teaching or research experience there.",
      "Though many of the details have yet to be announced, the new Chinese visa program is already drawing interest in India, where China is seen as an increasingly appealing destination amid warming relations and the Trump administration\u2019s surprise announcement last month that it is raising the fee for the equivalent H-1B worker visa to $100,000.",
      "Beijing\u2019s talent-friendly move could also give it a boost amid continuing trade tensions and tech rivalries with Washington, which has imposed export controls on chips and other advanced technology that are spurring China to develop its own.",
      "But the new visa scheme has not gone over so well with young job seekers in China, who face intense competition even as universities churn out millions of new graduates a year amid an economic slowdown. Unemployment among people ages 16 to 24, excluding students, was at 17.7% last month, according to government figures released Wednesday.",
      "People worry that foreign talents may turn an \u201calready fiercely competitive job market even harsher,\u201d said Geng Xiangshun, a Beijing-based commentator experienced in youth career counseling.",
      "\u201cChina already has an abundant, even surplus, supply of highly educated young talent,\u201d Geng wrote in a post on the popular social media platform Weibo. \u201cSince these local talented individuals aren\u2019t even fully employed yet, why do we need to bring in foreign bachelor-degree holders?\u201d",
      "Loosening restrictions",
      "Chinese work visas generally come with strict, complex requirements and allow limited stays for a small group of high-end applicants who are sponsored by employers. Immigrating to China is difficult, and there are many obstacles to living and working there long-term.",
      "Consequently, China is less attractive for foreign professionals than many advanced economies with skilled migration policies, experts say.",
      "Only about 950,000 foreigners work in China, making up just 0.12% of the country\u2019s labor force of about 775 million, according to the Chinese Science and Technology Ministry. In contrast, foreign-born workers accounted for more than 19% of the U.S. civilian work force in 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "The new visa aims to loosen restrictions and enhance China\u2019s global appeal, promising more generous terms such as longer validity periods and multiple entries.",
      "Though China is a relative \u201clatecomer\u201d with this initiative, it represents an \u201cupgrade\u201d to China\u2019s existing talent schemes, said Liu Guofu, a law professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology.",
      "Notably, the new visa does not require employer sponsorship or invitation, resembling \u201cindependent skilled immigration,\u201d Liu said.",
      "However, Liu stressed that Beijing\u2019s new talent scheme, which was announced in early August, \u201cbears little direct relation\u201d to President Donald Trump\u2019s shake-up of the H-1B visa fees, which was announced several weeks later.",
      "With the visa\u2019s focus on early-career STEM talents, Beijing is pivoting away from repatriating Chinese scientists and selectively inviting senior foreign experts, said Denis Simon, a leading expert on U.S.-China science and technology affairs.",
      "\u201cBy codifying a youth-focused, flexible entry channel, Beijing is normalizing inbound STEM mobility as part of its innovation strategy,\u201d Simon said.",
      "It offers a \u201clower-friction alternative\u201d for foreign STEM talents who may be frustrated by the higher U.S. fee for H-1B visas, he added, noting that more than 70% of H-1B visa holders are from India.",
      "\u201cEven small diversions of applicants can shift the geography of labs and startups at the margin \u2014 precisely where innovation clusters are won,\u201d Simon said.",
      "Public backlash",
      "Beijing\u2019s K visa has been met with strong backlash on Chinese social media, where commenters complained of a lack of transparency and public discussion in policymaking.",
      "Matthew Ma, 18, a freshman majoring in integrated circuits in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing, said he was \u201cquite surprised\u201d that he had read \u201cnothing\u201d about the new visa in the two months since it was announced.",
      "\u201cThe biggest misstep they took in this whole process was not giving out enough information in time,\u201d Ma said. \u201cAnd this is, I think, the major reason why people are so angry about this visa.\u201d",
      "Others are angered that the visa requires only an undergraduate STEM degree, saying that is setting the bar too low at a time when young people in China feel pressured to rack up advanced degrees in order to compete with their peers in the job market.",
      "Social media has also been flooded with racist and xenophobic comments, especially about Indians, amid fears that an influx of foreigners could erode national identity in China, where the population has fallen for the past three consecutive years.",
      "In a strongly worded editorial last month, China\u2019s state-run People\u2019s Daily newspaper dismissed such concerns as \u201cstrange,\u201d \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201cmisleading.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo secure its future, China must attract and utilize the best minds from around the globe,\u201d it said, noting that there is a projected shortage of nearly 30 million skilled workers in the country\u2019s key manufacturing sectors this year alone.",
      "\u201cSuch talents are in high demand, and the more we have, the better,\u201d it added. \u201cThe K visa is just to facilitate young foreign science and tech talents to work and live in China. It shouldn\u2019t be equated with immigration.\u201d"

      "Myanmar, where the civilian government was overthrown in a military coup in 2021, is notorious for cybercrime. The Southeast Asian nation is embroiled in a civil war with various ethnic groups fighting the military, creating an almost lawless situation in many parts of the country and allowing scam operations to thrive.",
      "Workers in the scam compounds are often trafficked from third countries, usually under the pretense of a lucrative job offer, and then forced to scam people online with investment pitches or romantic ploys.",
      "Following international pressure, particularly from neighboring Thailand and China, whose nationals have also been trafficked to work in these compounds, the junta \u2014 working alongside the same armed ethnic groups it opposes \u2014 launched a massive operation in February and released hundreds of workers.",
      "The practice is also well documented in other countries around the region such as Cambodia, where the U.S. last week seized more than $14 billion in bitcoin and formally charged the chairman of a Cambodian conglomerate over his alleged involvement in a massive cryptocurrency scam.",
      "The U.S., along with the U.K., also sanctioned the company, which was declared a transnational criminal organization by the Treasury Department.",
      "Last year, Americans lost at least $10 billion to Southeast Asia-based scams, according to the Treasury Department, a 66% increase from the year before."

      "\u201cThere are going to be moments where it looks like things aren\u2019t going particularly well,\u201d Vance added. \u201cCan I say with 100% certainty that it's going to work? No, but you don't do difficult things by only doing what's 100% certain. You do difficult things by trying. And that's what the president of the United States has asked us to do.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s trip to Israel comes at a fraught moment. The Israel-Hamas ceasefire negotiated this month by President Donald Trump has been followed by both sides accusing each other of  breaching the truce, Israeli strikes and a diminished Hamas attempting to reassert its authority over the enclave.",
      "Vance accused American media of overreacting to the setbacks.",
      "\u201cI want to say that there is this weird attitude I\u2019ve sensed in the American media and the Western media, where there\u2019s almost this desire to root for failure \u2014 that every time something bad happens, and every time there\u2019s an act of violence, there\u2019s this inclination to say, \u2018Oh, this is the end of the ceasefire, this is the end of the peace plan,\u2019\u201d Vance said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end. It is, in fact, exactly how this is going to have to happen when you have people who hate each other, who have been fighting against each other for a very long time. We are doing very well.

Hovering over the news conference was a Tuesday morning Truth Social post by Trump, who wrote that Middle East allies \u201cwould welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into GAZA with a heavy force and \u2018straighten [out] Hamas\u2019 if Hamas continues to act badly, in violation of their agreement with us.\u201d",

      "Vance added that he believed Middle East allies, including \u201cour Israeli friends,\u201d are showing a \u201ccertain amount of impatience with Hamas.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we\u2019re going to keep on working at this process,\u201d Vance said, \u201cand we\u2019re going to keep on trying to bring the deceased hostages home, but also make sure that all Gazans are able to live in a prosperous and safe place.\u201d",

      "LONDON \u2014 Prince Andrew may have given up his titles, but the questions about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein haven\u2019t given up on him \u2014 or Britain\u2019s embattled royal family.",
      "Seemingly every day, damaging new reports emerge about Andrew, 65, his friendship with the late pedophile financier, and allegations the prince had sex with trafficked Epstein victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre when she was 17, which he denies.",
      "In her posthumous memoir, \u201cNobody\u2019s Girl,\u201d released Tuesday, Giuffre, who died by suicide in April at age 41, said Andrew acted as though having sex with her \u201cwas his birthright.\u201d",
      "Andrew, who in February 2022 reached a legal settlement with Giuffre after she filed a civil case against him in a New York court, has repeatedly denied having met her.",
      "But the rolling scandal refuses to go away, and it has the potential to inflict further damage on a monarchy whose popularity continues to dwindle after the death of the widely beloved Queen Elizabeth II in 2022.",
      "King Charles III has sought to insulate \u201cthe Firm\u201d from the cloud over his younger brother. Andrew said in a statement last week that with Charles\u2019 \u201cagreement,\u201d he would \"no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me,\u201d including Duke of York.",
      "But there are still unanswered questions about what the palace knew, and when, with calls from lawmakers and others for the royals to oust Andrew entirely.",
      "\u201cThe deep and wide support for the queen meant the family was able to better weather all the controversies that could emerge \u2014 and this is a bad one,\u201d said Craig Prescott, who teaches law at Royal Holloway, University of London and specializes on the constitutional and political role of the monarchy.",
      "\u201cThese specific allegations are, of course, extraordinarily damaging in the first place, but they also run counter to some of the causes that members of the royal family take up,\u201d he said.",
      "Friday's agreement for Andrew to relinquish his titles came after emails published in documents for a court case not involving the prince showed he had been in contact with Epstein for longer than he previously admitted.",
      "That \u201cmakes him look, in black and white, a liar,\u201d NBC News' royal contributor Daisy McAndrew told \u201cTODAY\u201d on Sunday. \u201cAnd so how can you trust anything else he says?\u201d",
      "Then Sunday, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said it was investigating reports that Andrew had asked one of its officers to dig up dirt on Giuffre. A Buckingham Palace official told NBC News these reports should be \u201cexamined in the appropriate way.\u201d",
      "Monday brought two further revelations: First that Andrew had not paid rent on his Royal Lodge residence for 20 years, revealed in a Freedom of Information request by The Times newspaper to the Crown Estate, which handles royal finances. Neither Andrew nor Buckingham Palace have responded to the report.",
      "Then came the publication of Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir.",
      "She wrote that she had sex with the prince on three occasions, including an \u201corgy\u201d involving \u201ceight other young girls\u201d who \u201cappeared to be under the age of 18 and didn\u2019t really speak English.\u201d",
      "She then suffered three weeks of \u201cirregular bleeding,\u201d before waking up in a \u201cpool of blood\u201d and being taken to hospital by Epstein, she wrote.",
      "Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 shortly after he was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, later told her she had suffered a miscarriage, and she suspected him of conspiring with the doctor to keep it quiet, Giuffre said.",
      "On seeing a photo of Andrew and Epstein walking in New York's Central Park in 2010 \u2014 after Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution of someone under the age of 18 \u2014 Giuffre wrote she was \u201crevolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll.\u201d But \"mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal Family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein.\u201d",
      "Andrew has previously denied these allegations, saying that he has \u201cno recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\u201d In his statement announcing the relinquishment of his titles, he said, \u201cI vigorously deny the accusations against me.\u201d",
      "The civil sex abuse lawsuit brought by Giuffre against Andrew was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.",
      "Though Buckingham Palace routinely says it does not speak for the prince, Andrew has enjoyed a prominent role at some recent royal events, including the queen's funeral.",
      "Some lawmakers are demanding that Andrew be formally stripped of his titles by an act of Parliament \u2014 a rare foray into regal matters by Britain\u2019s supposedly separate government.",
      "The last time this happened was in 1917, when Parliament used the Titles Deprivation Act to strip German members of the British royal family of their titles during World War I.",
      "That\u2019s not without risks, according to Prescott at Royal Holloway.",
      "\"If you have legislation removing the dukedom from Prince Andrew, might a cheeky MP want to table an amendment and remove the dukedom of Sussex from Prince Harry?\u201d he said.",
      "The government indicated it does not support this. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said Monday that while \u201cour thoughts have to be with the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, these \u201care matters for the royal family.\u201d",
      "The nuclear option would involve the king himself using something called \u201cLetters Patent\u201d to strip Andrew of his designation as prince.",
      "In doing so, the palace must weigh distancing itself from Andrew with ensuring the blowback from any further censure does not do even more damage to an institution that requires public buy-in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that the monarchy isn\u2019t voted in,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cBut if the public mood shifted and people no longer wanted to have the monarchy, then you imagine that politics would follow.\u201d"
