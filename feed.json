      "Last year\u2019s Oscars was by all accounts a successful show, with memorable performances and unscripted moments, and a winning movie that most people had seen",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014  \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken\u201d is a hard act to follow.",
      "Last year\u2019s Oscars was by all accounts a successful show, with memorable performances and unscripted moments (thanks in part to Emma Stone\u2019s dress), and a winning movie that most people had seen. But the team behind last year\u2019s show is \u201caiming for the stars\u201d once more.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re feeling the pressure,\u201d said Oscars executive producer and showrunner Raj Kapoor. \u201cBut we\u2019re not ones to rest on our laurels. We always want to push the envelope.\u201d",
      "With just days to go until the three-and-a-half hour live broadcast, airing on ABC and streaming live on Hulu Sunday, March 2, the team behind the show gave The Associated Press a little insight into what to expect.",
      "\u201cWe want people when they watch the Oscars to be inspired by the films but also be inspired by the broadcast and feel something like it\u2019s a show that you can watch with your friends and your family and debate on who should have won and who is winning,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cWe want people to have all the feels when they watch the show.\u201d",
      "One of the major things that the producers are excited about this year is their first-time host, Conan O\u2019Brien.",
      "\u201cThat alone brings this fresh, invigorated energy,\u201d Kapoor said. O\u2019Brien, he said, has been a \u201cwealth of ideas and imagination\u201d since he accepted the gig and that he and his team are going to keep writing up until the show \u2014 and as a veteran of live television, he's skilled at in-the-moment improvisation as well.",
      "\u201cHe is going to be this great, exciting, warm hug and guide us through the night,\u201d said Oscars executive producer Katy Mullan. \u201cHe\u2019s got some surprises up his sleeve, which is fantastic because we love to keep people guessing.\u201d",
      "The Oscars this year decided to nix performances of the original songs, but there will still be some big names gracing the stage including \u201cWicked\u201d stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo \u2014 though they\u2019re staying mum on whether any gravity will be defied in that performance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking for months,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a moment that\u2019s been very special.\u201d",
      "Lisa of Blackpink and Doja Cat will also be part of the broadcast, and the producers promised a musical moment that will honor Los Angeles and filmmaking in Hollywood.",
      "The wildfires, Mullan said, will be acknowledged in the show.",
      "\u201cThe Grammys did an incredible job with their show and how it was treated,\u201d Mullan said. \u201cOur show being a month after that and Conan having been affected himself, we\u2019re just looking at the right way to calibrate it so that it feels like the right show for March 2 \u2014 that we do acknowledge it and reflect on it but also allow people the chance to step on that stage and have their moment and celebrate their talent.\"",
      "Last year the Oscars made a moment out of what is usually just a list of names by inviting past Oscar acting winners to speak about each of the nominees before the winner was read. This year it's back, but evolved. It won\u2019t be the actors this time, but some of the other categories that \u201cmaybe don\u2019t normally get the spotlight on the Oscar stage,\u201d Mullan said.",
      "She added: \u201cOur theme is all about collaboration and the alchemy of filmmaking and really taking a look behind the scenes and understanding a bit more of the interconnectedness of how a film comes together.\u201d",
      "First, Mullan said, it\u2019s only Wednesday \u2014 there\u2019s still time to catch the diverse group of 10 best picture nominees before Sunday if you really try. But don\u2019t fret if you\u2019ve only seen a few. The show could be a discovery event.",
      "\u201cIf you love the movies, like come to the Oscars and maybe you\u2019ll discover things that you actually have not seen yet but will want to,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cHopefully you\u2019ll fall in love even with a few pictures while watching the show.\u201d",
      "Also? It's just full of major stars.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got some reunions that I think will hit people in the heart,\" Mullan said.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 09:54:39 -0500",

    "story": [
      "A new album documents jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald in concert in Oakland, California, in 1967",
      "The setting is less grand than suggested by the title of a new Ella Fitzgerald album, \u201cThe Moment of Truth: Ella at the Coliseum.\u201d In this case, the coliseum is not in Rome or Los Angeles, but the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena in Oakland, California.",
      "Jazz giant Fitzgerald\u2019s presence elevated any event, however, and that was the case on June 30, 1967, when she performed at a concert that also included The Duke Ellington Orchestra and other luminaries.",
      "\u201cThe Moment of Truth\u201d documents Fitzgerald\u2019s set, and her incomparable alto is in typically fine form. She bounces and glides, blares and coos, bellows and whoops and scats and swings to the audience\u2019s delight. \u201cIf you love her, clap!\u201d someone shouts.",
      "The album, which will be released Friday, features performances of nine songs unearthed from the private tape collection of Verve Records founder Norman Granz. The vinyl release offers outstanding sound quality and extensive, informative liner notes by the critic Will Friedwald. He notes that while it was unusual for Fitzgerald to sing contemporary pop tunes, the set includes her only known performance of two classics from the mid-1960s \u2014 the Burt Bacharach and Hal David penned \"Alfie\u201d and Bob Crewe's \u201cMusic to Watch Girls By.\u201d",
      "Fitzgerald is accompanied by a piano trio, and on several songs by the Ellington orchestra, with whom she had a lengthy 1960s collaboration. Ellington doesn\u2019t play, however, and the understated arrangements leave the spotlight entirely to Fitzgerald. She\u2019s in a playful mood in her on stage banter, teasing a late arrival, impersonating Louis Armstrong, and ruling out a striptease.",
      "Her singing is radiant as she turns sophisticated melodies into a thrill ride. Their direction is as unpredictable as a pinball, with rhythmic daring and inventiveness that could make an arena sway. And it probably did.",
      "Fitzgerald flies high on \u201cMack the Knife,\u201d and displays jazzy verve on Benny Goodman\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Be That Way\u201d and the Tony Bennett staple \u201cThe Moment of Truth,\u201d while \u201cYou\u2019ve Changed\u201d shimmers with bluesy beauty. On \u201cLet\u2019s Do It (Let\u2019s Fall in Love),\u201d her phrasing is as clever as Cole Porter\u2019s lyrics. In her version, she injects references to the Beatles,James Bond, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.",
      "As Friedwald notes, Fitzgerald rarely drew from the Burt Bacharach-Hal David catalogue. But her interpretation of their classic ballad \u201cAlfie\u201d is a marvel of technique, emotional investment and creativity, including a brief digression. Fitzgerald navigates the complicated melody and rhythm with ease. It's an exemplar of the album, because as always, in keeping with the advice of the lyrics, her heart leads the way.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 09:38:24 -0500",
    "summary": "New York musician Larry Saltzman isn't really a movie fan, but he'll be sure to watch the Oscars this year",
    "story": [
      "New York musician Larry Saltzman isn't really a movie fan, but he'll be sure to watch the Oscars this year",
      "NEW YORK -- He's not a movie buff, so New York musician Larry Saltzman doesn't always watch the Oscars. This year, however, he's got a rooting interest.",
      "Saltzman taught actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet how to play guitar for the role of Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d In turn, Chalamet earned a best actor nomination and the film is also up for best picture at the Academy Awards on Sunday.",
      "A guitarist who's performed with Simon & Garfunkel, Bette Midler and David Johansen, as well as in the pit at Broadway productions \u201cHairspray\u201d and \u201cAin't Too Proud to Beg,\u201d Saltzman has developed a specialty in teaching actors how to play music for their roles. Besides Chalamet, recent pupils have included Adam Driver and Sadie Sink of \u201cStranger Things.\u201d",
      "On a fellow musician's recommendation, Saltzman first got a call from a movie studio about a decade ago. He admits to being cranky as discussions dragged on. \u201cI almost did everything to talk them out of hiring me,\u201d he said.",
      "Not until the fifth phone call did the studio identify the client: Meryl Streep.",
      "She needed to learn the electric guitar for her starring role in the 2015 film \u201cRicki and the Flash,\u201d where she portrayed an aging rocker trying to keep her career and life together in the wake of a series of disappointments.",
      "Working with Streep is a little like a political consultant's first client being elected president. If she likes you and word gets around, other students will follow. Teaching actors now represents about 40% of his business, the 69-year-old said.",
      "\u201cMy time spent with her was excellent,\u201d he said of Streep. \u201cShe's smart. She knows how to learn things. There was a steady progress over three or four months. She did very well.\u201d",
      "Faking it just won't do for serious actors and film directors. It's like lip-syncing \u2014 the audience is going to tell the difference, and the characters will be less believable. That was especially true with Chalamet, who needed to sing and play at the same time for a character whose artistry is the centerpiece of the film.",
      "\u201cWhen the actors come to you, they're kind of vulnerable,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cThey want to do a great job.\u201d",
      "Saltzman had more than 50 sessions with Chalamet, starting in person and retreating to Zoom during the pandemic. It wasn't easy. Chalamet had to learn some 25 songs in the script.",
      "\u201cSometime in 2018 I had my first lesson with this great guitar teacher named Larry Saltzman who at some point became less of a teacher and more a co-sanity artist through COVID,\u201d Chalamet recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI think we were keeping each other sane. We would Zoom three, four times a week and doing songs that never made it into the movie.\u201d",
      "It helped that Saltzman is a Dylan buff. Focusing on imparting \u201cthe guitar playing of \u2018pre-electric Bob,\u2019\u201d he taught his charge so well that Chalamet was a musical guest as well as host on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d performing obscure Dylan cuts last month. Saltzman says, in the course of their sessions, Chalamet \u201cwent the extra mile\u201d and unearthed \u201cvery early, obscure\u201d Dylan songs that weren't even in the script.",
      "Saltzman generally likes teaching actors more than common folk, in part because there's a specific goal: They need to learn certain songs to inhabit a particular character. When it's open-ended \u2014 someone just wants to learn the guitar \u2014 it can be more of a challenge, he said. Saltzman also believes that it's an advantage to not be a regular teacher, someone who may approach clients with a more rigid style.",
      "Actor Johnny Cannizzaro said he appreciated Saltzman's calming \u201cbedside manner\u201d and felt welcome in an apartment filled with guitars. Cannizzaro has the role of E Street Band member \u201cLittle Steven\u201d Van Zandt in the upcoming Bruce Springsteen biopic, \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was never really a moment where he expressed any sort of frustration or impatience with me during a session,\u201d said Cannizzaro, who has background playing keyboards but not guitar. \u201cIf anything, he would express some excitement when you grasped something he was teaching. That put me at ease.\u201d",
      "Saltzman also studied film of Van Zandt so he wasn't just teaching Cannizzaro guitar \u2014 he was showing specifics of how Van Zandt plays, the actor said.",
      "Beyond teaching, Saltzman's time is divided between studio work, playing in New York clubs accompanying different artists and Broadway \u2014 he's just about to begin \u201cSmash.\u201d",
      "It's an eye-opening experience for him to later see his students on screen. That was particularly the case when he saw \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and marveled at Chalamet's ability as an actor.",
      "All the more reason to watch the Oscars, and to take some pride in his own work.",
      "\u201cIn my own humble way, I'm a small gear in that machinery,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is rewarding is knowing that in some small way I'm contributing to making a better film.\u201d",

      "The protest album features recordings of empty studios and performance spaces, to show what they fear will be the fate of creative venues if the plan goes through. The titles of the 12 tracks spell out: \u201cThe British government must not legalize music theft to benefit AI companies.\u201d",
      "Profits will be donated to the musicians\u2019 charity Help Musicians.",

      "\u201cIt is a plan that would not only be disastrous for musicians, but that is totally unnecessary,\u201d Newton-Rex said. \u201cThe U.K. can be leaders in AI without throwing our world-leading creative industries under the bus.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Often when Robert Pattinson gets a script, one of the first things he does \u2014 to the annoyance of his girlfriend, Suki Waterhouse \u2014 is try on different voices to bring his character to life.",
      "\"I\u2019ve always had that sort of response to a script,\u201d he reflected, but said it became a practice while making his 2014 film, \u201cThe Rover.\u201d \u201cI think I feel very uncomfortable just doing something in my own accent. And for a while I felt like just doing an American accent felt like I was acting more.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unsurprising, then, that when he was offered a starring role in \u201cMickey 17\u201d \u2014 director Bong Joon Ho\u2019s first feature film since his Oscar-winning \u201cParasite\u201d \u2014 Pattinson\u2019s wheels immediately began turning over what his character(s) would sound like.",
      "\u201cMickey 17,\u201d a Warner Bros. release hitting theaters March 7, tells the story of Mickey Barnes, a naive but sympathetic protagonist who signs up to be an \u201cexpendable\u201d in a world that makes use of \u201chuman printing\u201d for dangerous tasks and research. When an expendable dies on the job, another version of them is printed with their consciousness and memories of their death intact.",
      "But Mickey\u2019s immortality is threatened when a very different version of him is printed while the 17th Mickey is mistakenly believed to be dead.",
      "\u201cI needed to find an actor who could cover both personalities,\u201d Bong said through a translator, recalling Pattinson\u2019s performances in \u201cThe Lighthouse\u201d and \u201cGood Time\u201d as he considered the more sinister and conniving Mickey 18.",
      "The film is based on Edward Ashton's 2022 novel, \u201cMickey7.\u201d But Pattinson, who read the book before he got the script, said he still can\u2019t believe how different they are from one another. \u201cWhen I read the script and Bong\u2019s changes to it, I was like, \u2018How did you see this tone in this book at all?\u2019 It\u2019s very, very different tonally. But I thought it\u2019s fascinating to have that interpretation,\u201d he said.",
      "Although Pattinson was eager to work with the acclaimed Korean filmmaker, he wasn\u2019t given a lot of initial information about the movie or role. \u201cThe only thing I knew was that it was in English and that the part was impossible,\u201d Pattinson said, laughing.",
      "As he eventually gleaned more about the story and his character, ideas for Mickey \u2014 and Mickey\u2019s voices \u2014 began swirling around in his head.",
      "Pattinson envisioned slapstick montages of his myriad deaths \u00e0 la \u201cThe Tom and Jerry Show\u201d \u2014 but that portion of the film turned out to be much darker than he expected. One early idea for voices that Bong shut down was inspired by Steve-O and Johnny Knoxville \u2014 Pattinson was a devout \u201cJackass\u201d fan growing up and even repped a \u201cJackass\u201d T-shirt to school \u201calmost every day.\u201d",
      "But one initial idea the 38-year-old had did stick. \u201cMy first thought, on pretty much the first read of it, was, \u2018It\u2019s like Ren and Stimpy,\u2019\u201d he said of the irreverent animated Nickelodeon series from the 90's about a cat and dog.",
      "The dynamic between the two Mickeys is an apt comparison given Ren\u2019s short temper and diabolical nature (Mickey 18), which stands in stark contrast to Stimpy\u2019s naivete (Mickey 17). The similarities in their voices can also be heard.",
      "\u201cI kind of wanted to do this like cartoon character performance. You start out really, really extreme and then kind of gradually tone it down,\" he said of how he refined the characters. \u201cWhen directors just let you do stuff, you just come out of the box doing whatever and wherever your instinct is taking you.\"",
      "In addition to Pattison, the sci-fi comedy boasts an impressive cast, including Mark Ruffalo,Steven Yeun,Toni Collette and Naomi Ackie. Although Ackie, who plays Mickey\u2019s romantic partner in the film, hadn\u2019t worked with Pattinson before, she said they quickly hit it off.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re both quite similar in how we work, which is very chatty up until the point of \u2018Action,\u2019 and then we do the acting. And I really enjoy that kind of separation between character and self. I find it quite difficult to hold onto characters once there\u2019s no cameras on,\u201d she said.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t just Pattinson who made the experience a positive one for her. \u201cI\u2019m pretty certain you could ask anyone who works with Bong Joon Ho, \u2018Would you go back?\u2019 And they\u2019d be like, \u2018I\u2019d pay money.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite the notoriety the director has reaped since \u201cParasite\u201d racked up four Oscars in 2020, including best picture and best director, Bong said the experience hasn't changed him.",
      "\u201cIt was fun and exciting to meet with all these famous artists and filmmakers during the campaign, but I didn\u2019t feel like I was like on cloud nine. It was actually very mentally and physically exhausting because the campaign is so long and I just remember thinking, \u2018Wow, this is really tough,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe kept just like handing each other vitamins.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Paul McCartney 's next book, coming out this fall, is a reminder that the Beatles were not his only band.",
      "\"Wings: The Story of a Band on the Run\" is an oral history about the group McCartney formed in the early 1970s, after the Beatles broke up. With members including guitarist Denny Laine and McCartney's then-wife, keyboardist Linda McCartney, Wings rose from driving to shows in a van to selling millions of records with such hits as \u201cBand on the Run,\u201d \u201cJet,\u201d \u201cMy Love\u201d and \u201cSilly Love Songs.\u201d The band broke up in 1981.",
      "Edited by historian Ted Widmer, the illustrated, 528-page book draws in part on hours of interviews with McCartney. W.W. Norton & Company, which also published McCartney's \u201cThe Lyrics\u201d and \u201c1964: Eyes of the Storm,\u201d announced Wednesday that \u201cWings\u201d will be released Nov. 4.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so very happy to be transported back to the time that was Wings and relive some of our madcap adventures through this book,\" McCartney, 82, said in a statement. \"Starting from scratch after The Beatles felt crazy at times. There were some very difficult moments and I often questioned my decision. But as we got better I thought, \u2018OK this is really good.\u2019 We proved Wings could be a really good band. To play to huge audiences in the same way The Beatles had and have an impact in a different way. It was a huge buzz.\u201d"

      "Five days before the Academy Awards, nearly every nominee gathered for a cocktail reception, dinner and class picture shoot that served as an Oscars orientation.",
      "The event Tuesday night at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures was a stand-in for the annual Oscars luncheon usually held about a month earlier but scrubbed because of the Southern California wildfires.",
      "With the voting over and winners determined, contenders got chummy and the mood was cheerful. Best actress favorites Mikey Madison and Demi Moore hugged and chatted. So did best actor front-runners Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Adrien Brody.",
      "\u201cEveryone say Oscar nominee!\u201d best actress nominee Cynthia Erivo shouted gleefully from the front row of the museum's David Geffen Theater, where the dozens of nominees sat for their group picture.",
      "Clustered in front with Erivo were three best supporting actress nominees: her \u201cWicked\u201d castmate Ariana Grande, Monica Barbaro of \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and Zoe Salda\u00f1a of \u201cEmilia Perez\" along with Madison, nominated for \u201cAnora.\u201d The five women stood in a circle and talked happily together after the photo, and kept the conversation going as they descended the stairs together to dinner.",
      "In the back of the theater, a trio of best actor nominees sat together: Sebastian Stan of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d Colman Domingo of \u201cSing Sing\u201d and Brody, of \u201cThe Brutalist.\"",
      "After the photo was taken, Academy President Janet Yang gave the orientation presentation, reminding everyone that the 97th Academy Awards will be held Sunday.",
      "She greeted first-time nominees and acknowledged there were also some with more than one.",
      "Denis Villeneuve, director of \u201cDune: Part 2\u201d and a four-time nominee, raised his hand. Sixteen-time best original song nominee Diane Warren raised both of hers.",
      "Yang emphasized that the wildfires made this year different, and emphasized \u201cthe importance of community and an atmosphere of support.\u201d",
      "But, she said, \"The show, the big show, the Oscar show, you know what I'm talking about, will of course go on, and we simply must honor the talent, your talents, this year, as we have every year.\"",
      "She gave the annual, usually fruitless, guidance that acceptance speeches should be limited to 45 seconds, and had the class repeat the number back to her. \u201cForty-five!\u201d they shouted.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't sound like a lot, but you can definitely get a lot in there,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat works best is to be heartfelt, humorous if you like, poignant, inspirational, but brief.\u201d",
      "A straggling nominee then showed up, and Grande shouted to the official photographer, \u201care you ready to go again, Trevor?\" and they reshot the picture.",
      "As the big group broke up, Chalamet greeted several reporters by name and hugged them.",
      "It was a fun night for the famous, but in some ways it's an even bigger evening, as Sunday will be, for the majority of nominees \u2014 from short film animators to sound mixers \u2014 who are neither famous faces nor household names.",
      "Here they were treated as equals with their A-list peers. All were identified by the same black name tags.",
      "Madison and Isabella Rossellini, up for best supporting actress for \u201cConclave,\u201d each wore theirs as they stood and talked at length during the cocktail reception. Many others dropped in on the conversation including Moore, \u201cAnora\u201d director Sean Baker, and best supporting actor nominee Jeremy Strong from \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d",
      "Rossellini and Madison pulled out their phones and shared dog photos.",
      "\u201cYes, you have like a farm!\u201d Strong said to Rossellini.",
      "Samantha Quan, a best picture nominee as an \u201cAnora\u201d producer and Baker's wife, asked Rossellini, \u201cDo you have any goats?\u201d",
      "\u201cOh yes,\u201d Rossellini replied.",
      "\"The Brutalist\u201d director Brady Corbet stopped to talk to the women too, but stood aside when they were asked to get closer for a photo.",
      "\u201cI don't want to get them sick,\u201d he said.",
      "The attire for the evening was listed as \u201ccocktail\u201d and the outfits ran the gamut. Madison, Grande and Moore wore evening gowns. Rossellini wore a smoking jacket and necktie with a gold brooch. Strong wore a brown bomber jacket with running shoes. Chalamet wore, if there is such a thing, a black, shiny, formal version of a denim jacket and jeans, with a blingy gold chain around his neck.",
      "Media members, publicists, partners and all others were eventually told to stand aside while the nominees sat for a dinner that was exclusive to them.",
      "The roll call that normally goes with the photo was skipped, so it was difficult to determine who wasn't there, but apparent absentees included Elton John, up for best original song, Ralph Fiennes, up for best actor for \u201cConclave,\u201d and Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, nominated for best actress for \u201cEmilia Perez.\u201d"

      "LOS ANGELES -- As the cast of \"Conclave\" descended steps leading to backstage at the Shrine Auditorium, they got a fresh round of applause from staff and crew at the Screen Actors Guild Awards to go with the big ovation they'd gotten moments earlier from the ballroom crowd.",
      "The esteemed group of Ralph Fiennes, Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow had enough collective gravitas on their own, but Harrison Ford, who had just presented them the best ensemble award, the night's big prize, also walked among them.",
      "He was among the generations of stars, including the night's other big winners and nominees, to congratulate the elite performers from the papal potboiler as they made their way through the behind-the-scenes winners' obligations at the SAG Awards, with an Associated Press reporter in tow.",
      "A photographer asked the \u201cConclave\u201d winners to stop and pose, and shouted \u201cGet in there Mr. Ford!\u201d",
      "Ford, not wanting to horn in, walked backwards up the steps back on to the stage.",
      "SAG staffers tried to lead the group to their next stop, but they had to wait. \u201cI have to go get my purse!\u201d Rossellini said, and returned to the ballroom. Lithgow went back in too to get his wife.",
      "A gleeful Jamie Lee Curtis descended on the two before they left and gave congrats and kisses to each.",
      "Fiennes walked ahead alone for a moment, and happened on Ariana Grande, whose cast of \u201cWicked\u201d had been up against \u201cConclave\u201d for best ensemble.",
      "'Yay, congratulations!\" she told Fiennes. \u201cI was really happy for you guys I was screaming!\"",
      "She then introduced him to her date, Broadway's \u201cSpongebob SquarePants\u201d actor Ethan Slater.",
      "Next came a station, normally a bar, where the actual SAG statuettes are handed out. (The ones they accept on stage are just props.)",

      "Fiennes pulled her aside and quietly praised the call-to-arms political speech she made during the show.",
      "\u201cYou nailed it,\u201d he said, adding that she expressed \u201cwhat no one is saying.\u201d",
      "Rossellini reappeared, gave a big hug to Fonda, and introduced her to the fourth \u201cConclave\u201d cast member in attendance, Sergio Castellitto, who played the vaping Cardinal Tedesco in the film.",

      "The wins for \u201cConclave\u201d and Chalamet threw a wrench into expectations for the Oscars that are just a week away, with Chalamet, Fiennes and Rossellini all nominees. The presumed Oscar frontrunner, \u201cAnora,\u201d was shut out.",
      "Lithgow returned to the group, and when Chalamet saw him he shouted, \u201cHey John, not bad eh?\"",

      "\u201cI don't want to boast, but..,\u201d he said with a shrug to the AP reporter.",
      "The group moved along and signed show posters, then made their way to the area where winners pose for press photos.",
      "Actors always say awards are heavy when they get them, but by all accounts the SAG statue truly is. Kieran Culkin made the heft the subject of half his acceptance speech for best supporting male actor.",
      "While he waited for the photo session, the 62-year-old Fiennes did some presses with his award with each arm.",
      "The 79-year-old Lithgow held his over his head with one arm as the photos were snapped.",
      "His wife of more than 40 years, UCLA business professor Mary Yeager, found a bench nearby to sit down after the long night.",
      "The group then stood for virtual questions from reporters at a news conference, and made their way into the official after-party, where they got their statuettes engraved.",

      "They later made their way to Ford, who wanted to talk with them for a while before taking a picture.",

      "The SAG Awards are also a union meeting, and this group, who went on a historic strike in 2023, were asked through fliers at place settings, a video that played during a break, and a pre-telecast plea from their leader to support their striking colleagues who work on video games.",
      "Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, also spoke of the need for legislation putting strict limits on the use of artificial intelligence to create actors' performances.",

      "A London judge has dismissed part of a lawsuit against the British band The 1975 over the lead singer\u2019s gay kiss that led Malaysian authorities to shut down a music festival",
      "LONDON -- Members of the British band The 1975 cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Matty Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage, a London judge ruled Monday.",
      "The organizer of the Good Vibes Festival is seeking 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country's anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "Future Sound Asia sued The 1975 Productions LLP in the High Court over breach of contract and said its four members owed a duty of care. But the band\u2019s lawyer argued that the suit should only target the company \u2014 not the musicians.",
      "Judge William Hansen said the claims against the band members were \"bad as a matter of law and that there is no good reason why the matter should go to trial.\" He allowed the case to proceed against the company, but ordered FSA to pay 100,000 pounds ($126,000) in legal costs.",
      "Band attorney Edmund Cullen had argued the claim was an \u201cillegitimate, artificial and incoherent\u201d attempt \u201cto pin liability on individuals\u201d because FSA only had a contract with the band's company.",
      "FSA\u2019s attorney Andrew Burns said authorities had initially refused to let the band perform because of reports about Healy\u2019s drug addiction and subsequent recovery. They relented after the band promised he would follow guidelines and regulations, he said.",
      "When the band played the same festival in 2016, they had agreed not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, Burns said.",
      "Burns said the band deliberately provoked Malaysian authorities in 2023 by smuggling a bottle of wine on stage, and through Healy's \u201cobscene speech\u201d and the kiss. He said the band also performed a \u201csecond-rate set of songs\u201d to upset the crowd.",
      "\u201cThey could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" Burns said.",
      "The band was supposed to be paid $350,000 (276,000 pounds) for a one-hour set, Burns said.",
      "The show wasn't the first time Healy made a political statement in the name of LGBTQ+ rights: he kissed a male fan at a 2019 concert in the United Arab Emirates, which outlaws same-sex sexual activity.",
      "After the show in the Malaysian capital, The 1975 canceled its concerts in Taiwan and Jakarta, Indonesia.",
      "The Malaysian government has blacklisted the band."

      "The other major awards \u2014 including the BAFTAs, the Producers Guild Awards, the Directors Guild Awards and the Golden Globes \u2014 have all had their say. But actors make up the largest piece of the film academy pie, so their picks often correspond strongly with Academy Award winners.",
      "After wins from the PGA and the DGA \u2014 and last night, the Independent Spirit Awards \u2014 Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d is seen as the favorite to win best picture in a week\u2019s time at the Oscars. But Edward Berger\u2019s \u201cConclave\u201d won last weekend at the BAFTAs, the latest wrench in an award season full of them. That\u2019s included the unlikely rise and precipitous fall of another top contender, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d",
      "So there are plenty of questions heading into the SAG Awards, hosted by Kristen Bell from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Can \u201cWicked\u201d make a late push and win the guild\u2019s top award, best ensemble? Can Adrien Brody hold off Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet for best actor? Can Mikey Madison keep the momentum and win best actress over Demi Moore?",
      "The 31st SAG Awards will be streamed live by Netflix beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. An official pre-show will start an hour earlier, also on Netflix. Last year\u2019s show, the first to air on the streaming platform, drew an audience of 1.8 million, roughly on par with earlier SAG ceremonies broadcast by TNT and TBS.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d comes in the leading film nominee, with five nods, while \u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d heads the TV categories.",
      "Jon M. Chu\u2019s hit musical hasn\u2019t yet had a major awards win, but the Screen Actors Guild has often favored populist contenders. Also up for best ensemble are \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d \u201cConclave\u201d and \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "The best actor and best actress categories should be nail biters. While Brody (\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d) has won a string of awards, Chalamet (\u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d) and Ralph Fiennes (\u201cConclave\u201d) could easily pull off the upset. Best actress could go to either Moore (\u201cThe Substance\u201d) or Madison (\u201cAnora\u201d).",
      "In the supporting categories, Kieran Culkin (\u201cA Real Pain\u201d) and Zoe Saldana (\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d) are the favorites.",
      "In addition to the competitive categories, Jane Fonda will be given the SAG Life Achievement Award.",
      "The devastating wildfires that began in early January forced the guild to cancel its in-person nominations announcement and instead issue a press release. The guild has launched a disaster relief fund for SAG-AFTRA members affected by the fires. Producers have said the show will honor those affected."

      "Hunter Schafer says \u201cit\u2019s important to just keep track of where things are in our country,\u201d a day after the \u201cEuphoria\u201d star posted a video in which she revealed her new passport had been issued with a male gender marker",
      "SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Hunter Schafer says \u201cit's important to just keep track of where things are in our country,\u201d a day after the \u201cEuphoria\u201d star posted a video in which she revealed her new passport had been issued with a male gender marker.",
      "Speaking to The Associated Press on the red carpet at the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday, the 26-year-old actor, who is trans, said she felt \u201cit was a good, necessary point\u201d to share. Schafer, also a presenter at the award show, was nominated for best lead performance for \u201cCuckoo. \u201d",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office instituting a new and narrow federal government definition of the sexes. As part of the order, the federal government defines sex as only male or female and says that must be reflected on official documents, like passports. The State Department, responsible for passports, is no longer issuing passports with the \u201cX\u201d marker that\u2019s been available since 2021 and is not honoring requests to change gender markers between \u201cM\u201d and \u201cF.\u201d",
      "In an 8 \u00bd-minute video posted to TikTok on Friday, Schafer, who transitioned as a young teen, said the passport that was meant to carry her well into her 30s was stolen while she was filming in Spain. After receiving an emergency passport, she later had to apply for a new, permanent one in Los Angeles. Having had female gender markers on her license and passport since she was a teenager, Schafer marked \u201cfemale\u201d on her application \u2014 but received a passport that identified her as male, she said. In the video, she said she had not had her birth certificate amended.",
      "Schafer acknowledged the executive order in her TikTok video: \u201cBecause our president, you know, is a lot of talk, I was like, \u2018I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u2019 And, today, I saw it,\u201d Schafer said, holding up her new passport page with the \u201cM\u201d marker. She said she was making the video not to \u201cfearmonger or like create drama or receive consolation,\u201d but to note the reality of the situation.",
      "\u201cI wasn't even really looking for support, but I have an amazing community around me and it's one of the greatest blessings of my life and so I felt very supported throughout, before and then now,\u201d she told the AP on Saturday.",
      "The State Department said in response to a request for comment that it was implementing Trump\u2019s executive order but declined to comment on specific cases, citing privacy laws and restrictions.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't really change anything about me or my transness. However, it does make my life a little harder,\u201d Schafer said in the video, saying she has to travel for the first time with the new passport next week.",
      "\u201cTrans people are beautiful. We are never going to stop existing. I'm never going to stop being trans. A letter and a passport can't change that,\u201d she concluded.",

      "\u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d soared on opening weekend, but crash-landed in its second go-around with audiences",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d soared on opening weekend, but crash-landed in its second go-around with audiences.",
      "\u201cBrave New World,\u201d the latest sign that the Marvel machine isn\u2019t quite what it used to be, remained No. 1 at the box office in its second frame with $28.2 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. But after a debut of $100 million over four days and $88 million over three days, that meant a steep drop of 68%.",
      "While blockbusters often see significant slides in their second weekends, only two previous MCU titles have fallen off so fast: 2023\u2019s \u201cThe Marvels,\u201d which fell 78%, and 2023\u2019s \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,\u201d which dropped 70%.",
      "The Anthony Mackie-led \u201cCaptain America\u201d installment has been slammed by critics, and audiences also have graded it poorly, with a \u201cB-\u201d CinemaScore. \u201cBrave New World,\u201d which fans had hoped would right the Marvel ship, has been largely met as another example of a once impenetrable brand struggling to recapture its pre-\u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d aura of invincibility.",
      "Still, \u201cBrave New World\u201d has quickly grossed $289.4 million worldwide, with international sales nearly reaching $150 million. And with few big-budget offerings arriving in theaters in the coming weeks, it will have scant competition through much of March.",
      "The biggest new release of the weekend was Oz Perkins\u2019 \u201cThe Monkey,\u201d the director\u2019s follow-up to his 2024 horror hit, \u201cLonglegs.\u201d Adapted from a Stephen King short story, \u201cThe Monkey\u201d opened with $14.2 million for Neon, the second-best debut for the indie distributor. The best? \u201cLonglegs,\u201d which launched with $22.4 million.",
      "Neon had much to celebrate over the weekend. Its top awards contender, \u201cAnora,\u201d by Sean Baker, continues to gather momentum into next Sunday's Academy Awards. The best-picture favorite added wins at the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday.",
      "Perkins, Neon and Blumhouse, which partnered in the release of \u201cThe Monkey,\u201d have found a productive low-budget collaboration, with more on the way. Even if \u201cThe Monkey\u201d doesn\u2019t reach the heights of \u201cLonglegs\u201d ($126.9 million globally), Perkins and Neon return with \u201cKeeper\u201d this October.",
      "\u201cThe Monkey,\u201d starring Tatiana Maslany and Theo James, revolves around an old monkey toy found in an attic. Reviews have been good (77% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), though audiences were less impressed, giving it a C+ CinemaScore. Horror films, though, typically grade low.",
      "As it did with \u201cLonglegs,\u201d Neon leaned into cryptic promotion for \u201cThe Monkey,\u201d along with some macabre marketing. A funeral premiere was held Los Angeles\u2019 Immanuel Presbyterian Church, and fan screenings took place at Hollywood Cemetery. The film, produced by James Wan, cost $10 million to make.",
      "Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cThe Unbreakable Boy\u201d opened with a paltry $2.5 million in 1,687 theaters. The Christian-themed Jon Gunn-directed film starring Zachary Levi and Meghann Fahy, is about parents who learn their son is autistic and has brittle bone disease.",
      "\u201cPaddington in Peru,\u201d the third installment of the marmalade-mad bear, fell to third place in its second weekend. It grossed $6.5 million in 3,890 locations, bringing its two-week total to $25.2 million. \u201cPaddington in Peru\u201d has been most popular overseas, where it's collected $125 million thus far.",
      "\u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d the animated Chinese juggernaut, took in $3.1 million from 800 theaters in its second weekend.

Those totals put \"Ne Zha 2\" past \u201cInside Out 2\u201d ($1.66 billion) as the highest grossing animated film ever.",

      "The great Roberta Flack has died",
      "NEW YORK -- In an era where popular music is fluid, it is easy to forget the listening world was not always so open. Unless, of course, Roberta Flack's career is closely examined.",
      "Flack, whose intimate vocal and musical style made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after, died Monday. She leaves behind a rich repertoire of music that avoids categorization. Her debut, \u201cFirst Take,\u201d wove soul, jazz, flamenco, gospel and folk into one revelatory package, prescient in its form and measured in its approach.",
      "Flack will likely be remembered for her classics \u2014 \u201cThe First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\u201d and \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\u201d among them. As she should be. But her talents extend well beyond the familiar titles.",
      "Read on and then listen to all of the tracks on our Spotify playlist, here.",
      "Picking one standout from \u201cFirst Take\u201d is a fool's errand, but listeners would be wise to spend time with Flack's cover of the Leonard Cohen classic \u201cHey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye,\u201d a strong case for a reimagination eclipsing the original. Her voice transforms Cohen's lament. It's almost impossible to believe this song, let alone the entire record, was recorded over a period of just 10 hours at Atlantic Studios in New York in February 1969. But it was.",
      "Also from \u201cFirst Take\" is \u201cAngelitos Negros,\" performed entirely in Spanish by Flack. It's a song based on a poem by the Venezuelan writer Andr\u00e9s Eloy Blanco titled \u201cP\u00edntame Angelitos Negros,\" with a title lifted from the 1948 Mexican film of the same name.",
      "The movie navigates interracial relationships when a white couple gives birth to a dark-skinned child. Beyond Flack's soaring vocal performance \u2014 delivered atop a robust string section and nylon-string guitars \u2014 the song serves as an anthem against racial discrimination and a stunning example of the singer's cross-boundary approach to music making.",
      "As the well-documented lore suggests, Roberta Flack's mainstream success story begins when her dreamy cover of \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" written by English folk artist Ewan MacColl for his wife Peggy Seeger, was used in a love scene between Clint Eastwood and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \u201cPlay Misty for Me.\"",
      "It quickly topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year. But her relationship with the song, and her singular ability to bring it to such great heights, was almost kismet. Before recording the ballad, she had real familiarity with it, having taught it while working with a glee club during her years as an educator.",
      "It is Flack's best-known hit and one of the great love songs of the 20th Century. Flack first heard Lori Lieberman\u2019s \u201cKilling Me Softly with His Song\u201d while on a plane and immediately fell in love with it. While on tour with Quincy Jones, she covered the song, and the audience feel in love with it, too, as they'd continue to for decades.",
      "Her voice is otherworldly in her recording \u2014 pinpointing a kind of neo-soul R&B that would dominate for years to come \u2014 and she was recognized for it. Flack became the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record with this one.",
      "The song would win again in the \u201890s, when hip-hop trio the Fugees\u2019 would offer their masterful take on Flack's cover and introduce much of the world to singer Lauryn Hill's gift.",
      "A standard for R&B and jazz musicians alike \u2014 no doubt due to the grandeur of Flack's version \u2014 \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love\u201d is her third career No. 1. It's a mediative seduction, Flack embodying each lyrical vignette in her delivery. \u201cStrollin\u2019 in the park / Watchin\u2019 winter turn to spring,\u201d she opens the song, \u201cWalkin\u2019 in the dark / Seein\u2019 lovers do their thing.\u201d",
      "A soulful collaboration with her close friend Donny Hathaway, \u201cThe Closer I Get to You,\" is a reflective romance, both big-voiced and bigger-hearted singers lifting each other up. But despite its splendor, the song's legacy is marred in tragedy: In 1979, Flack and Hathaway started work on an album of duets when he suffered a breakdown during recording and fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan.",
      "The '80s brought soft rock detouring for Flack, another experimentation for the innovative performer. \u201cTonight, I Celebrate My Love,\" a duet with the R&B balladeer Peabo Bryson, is at the intersection of a few genres and simultaneously timeless \u2014 a feat for a song anchored in shimmery, synthetized production.",
      "In her later career, Flack continued to meet the current moment. A great example is \u201cSet the Night to Music,\u201d a glossy pop song with English singer Maxi Priest. It was released on her 1991 album of the same name, which also features a then-contemporary cover of Philadelphia soul group The Stylistics' 1970s R&B hit \u201cYou Make Me Feel Brand New.\""

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In the about 1,000 days between her drunken-driving crash in May 2022 and her death, South Korean mainstream news organizations published at least around 2,000 stories on film actor Kim Sae-rom.",
      "They illustrate how the local media often cover a celebrity\u2019s fall from grace. Previously one of the brightest young stars in South Korean cinema, Kim was condemned and ridiculed for driving drunk; for talking about her financial struggles after losing roles; for taking a job at a coffee shop; for attempting a comeback in theater; for going out with friends instead of \u201cshowing remorse\u201d; and for being seen smiling on set while shooting an indie movie.",
      "After the 24-year-old actor was found dead at her home Sunday, the headlines predictably swung to calling for changes to the way celebrities are treated in the public arena.",
      "Kim\u2019s death, which police consider a suicide, adds to a growing list of high-profile celebrity deaths in the country, which some experts attribute to the enormous pressure celebrities face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that seizes on every misstep.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: In South Korea, callers can receive 24-hour counseling through the suicide prevention hotline 1577-0199, the \u201cLife Line\u201d service at 1588-9191, the \u201cHope Phone\u201d at 129 and the \u201cYouth Phone\u201d at 1388.",
      "___",
      "Here's a look at the intense pressure faced by South Korean celebrities who fall from grace.",
      "South Korea is notoriously harsh on its celebrities, particularly women.",
      "Kim rose to stardom as a child actor with the 2010 hit crime thriller \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d and garnered acclaim and popularity for her acting in movies and TV dramas for years.",
      "But that changed after May 18, 2022, when Kim crashed a vehicle into a tree and an electrical transformer while driving drunk in southern Seoul. She posted a handwritten apology on Instagram and reportedly compensated around 60 shops that lost power temporarily because of the crash, but that did little to defuse negative coverage and she struggled to find acting work.",
      "When a Seoul court issued a 200 million won ($139,000) fine over the crash in April 2023, Kim expressed her fears about the media to reporters, saying many articles about her private life were untrue.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m too scared to say anything about them,\u201d she said.",
      "In the wake of Kim's drunken-driving crash, celebrity gossip channels on YouTube began posting negative videos about her private life, suggesting without providing evidence that she was exaggerating her financial straits by working at coffee shops, and arguing that social media posts showing her socializing with friends meant she wasn't showing enough remorse.",
      "Other entertainers, especially female, have struggled to find work after run-ins with the law, including drunken driving or substance abuse, and experts say many of them are reluctant to seek treatment for mental health problems like depression, fearing further negative coverage.",
      "Kwon Young-chan, a comedian-turned-scholar who leads a group helping celebrities with mental health issues, said celebrities often feel helpless when the coverage turns negative after spending years carefully cultivating their public image. Kwon, who stayed with Kim's relatives during a traditional three-day funeral process, said her family is considering legal action against a YouTube creator with hundreds of thousands of subscribers for what they describe as groundless attacks on Kim's private life.",
      "Peter Jongho Na, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, lamented on Facebook that South Korean society had become a giant version of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d the brutal Netflix survival drama, \u201cabandoning people who make mistakes or fall behind, acting as though nothing happened.\u201d",
      "The National Police Agency said officers found no signs of foul play at Kim's home and that she left no note.",
      "But a spate of high-profile deaths has sparked discussions about how news organizations cover the private lives of celebrities and whether floods of critical online comments are harming their mental health. Similar conversations happened after the 2008 death of mega movie star Choi Jin-sil; the death of her former baseball star husband, Cho Sung-min, in 2013; the deaths of K-Pop singers Sulli and Goo Hara in 2019; and the death of \u201cParasite\u201d actor Lee Sun-kyun in 2023.",
      "Sensational but unsubstantiated claims like from social media are widely recycled and amplified by traditional media outlets as they compete for audience attention, said Hyun-jae Yu, a communications professor at Seoul\u2019s Sogang University.",
      "Struggling with a sharp decline in traditional media readership, he said, media turn to covering YouTube drama as the easiest way to drive up traffic, often skipping the work of reporting and verifying facts.",
      "Following the 2019 deaths of Sulli and Goo Hara, which were widely attributed to cyberbullying and sexual harassment both in the public and media, lawmakers proposed various measures to discourage harsh online comments. These included expanding real-name requirements and strengthening websites\u2019 requirements to weed out hate speech and false information, but none of these proposed laws passed.",
      "South Korean management agencies are getting increasingly active in taking legal action to protect their entertainers from online bullying. Hybe, which manages several K-Pop groups including BTS, publishes regular updates about lawsuits it\u2019s filing against social media commentators it deems malicious.",
      "But Yu said it's crucial for mainstream media companies to strengthen self-regulation and limit their use of YouTube content as news sources. Government authorities could also compel YouTube and other social media platforms to take greater responsibility for content created by their users, he said, including actively removing problematic videos and preventing creators from monetizing them.",
      "The South Korean office of Google, YouTube's parent company, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Heo Chanhaeng, an executive director at the Center for Media Responsibility and Human Rights, said news organizations and websites should consider shutting down the comments sections on entertainment stories entirely.",
      "\u201cHer private life was indiscriminately reported beyond what was necessary,\u201d Heo said. \"That\u2019s not a legitimate matter of public interest.\u201d",

      "A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show last week",
      "NEW DELHI -- A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show, raising questions about freedom of speech in a country where digital creators in the past have come under fire for their content.",
      "The controversy began last week when social media influencer and YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia made remarks to a participant on a comedy show about his parents' personal relationship. The joke was quickly condemned by social media users, public figures and political leaders.",
      "Multiple police complaints were filed against Allahabadia and Samay Raina, who hosts the show \u201cIndia\u2019s Got Latent.\u201d Both of them, along with some other participants on the show, were summoned by police for questioning and the issue was also raised in Parliament.",
      "On the show, Allahbadia asked a contestant: \u201cWould you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?\u201d",
      "Allahbadia, who has interviewed senior Indian ministers and Bollywood celebrities on his YouTube channel, has since apologized for the comments. Raina, meanwhile, has removed all videos of the show from his YouTube channel and said he was \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the authorities.",
      "India\u2019s Supreme Court on Tuesday shielded Allahbadia from arrest but said his conduct showed \u201clack of responsibility\u201d and was \u201ccondemnable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is something that is dirty in his mind that has been vomited by way of this program,\u201d the judge hearing the case said.",
      "The court also ordered Allahbadia to surrender his passport at a police station and barred him from leaving the country.",
      "The case, however, prompted a parliamentary panel to write to the country's Information Technology Ministry seeking steps to amend existing laws to clamp down on such content.",
      "One lawmaker also asked Parliament to enact a law to regulate social media platforms, raising fears that the controversy will be used by the federal government to regulate online content.",
      "Indian content creators on social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram and X are worried after the government last year proposed draft legislation that aims to overhaul and regulate broadcasting services in the country.

      "(RNS) \u2014 The winner of the 2025 Grammy Award for best new age, ambient or chant album \u2014 a category once dominated by Enya \u2014 was an album titled \u201cTriveni,\u201d meaning \u201cthe confluence of three rivers\u201d in Sanskrit, an apt description for its weaving of Vedic chants, melodic flute and cello by India\u2019s Chandrika Tandon, South Africa\u2019s Wouter Kellerman and Japan\u2019s Eru Matsumoto.",
      "The name, which is given to the meeting point of the holy Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati rivers, said singer Tandon, came to her in one of her daily meditations.",
      "\u201cIt was a beautiful coincidence that our album called Triveni won the Grammy on Vasant Panchami when the Maha Prayag was going on,\u201d Tandon told RNS, referring to the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela festival held where the three rivers meet in Prayagraj, India, considered one of the holiest pilgrimage sites in the nation. The world\u2019s largest gathering of humanity, with 400 million people attending this year, the Kumbh Mela happens every 12 years, with this year\u2019s celebration, the Maha Kumbh Mela, happening only every 144 years, when the sun, the moon and Jupiter align.",
      "\u201cThink what you like, say what you like, but one has to just smile at this incredible coincidence,\u201d Tandon said.",

      "Tandon was a prominent business mogul for more than half her life, the namesake of New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering and sister to former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi. Twenty-five years ago, however, Tandon faced what she describes as a \u201ccrisis of spirit.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew I had everything, and yet I felt like I had nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I died today, what is it that I want to have accomplished? Is it just more money, more climbing up the ladder, or was there something else that would just give me happiness and make each day complete?\u201d",
      "That something else, she found, was devotional music. Pulling from the mantras she once heard as a little girl in Chennai, Tandon found a new purpose in creating melodies and \u201cpraying into the notes\u201d as a form of meditation. \u201cMusic helped me find myself,\u201d said Tandon, the creator of six albums of her own.",
      "And according to Tandon, the Grammy win signifies a larger cultural moment, helping young people all over the world discover the \u201cextraordinary gems\u201d of the ancient Vedic traditions. \u201cInstead of a traditional Indian ornate piece of jewelry, I\u2019ve simply put them in a completely Western jewelry setting,\u201d said Tandon. \u201cSuddenly it\u2019s more apparent, it\u2019s more discernible, more relatable. And suddenly there\u2019s this curiosity about, \u2018What is that? It makes me feel so good!\u2019\u201d",
      "According to Tandon and other devotional musicians, the melodic repetition of Vedic mantras, often associated with the many names of the tradition\u2019s various deities, has proved to calm the mind for centuries. The 21st is no different, they say, as they see a burgeoning space for the spiritually curious youth seeking a respite from the fast-paced internet culture they grew up in. Now, a new generation of kirtan artists is leading the charge on Hindu sacred music.",
      "Amid confusing times, says devotional musician Gaura Vani, Generations Z and X have found a way to articulate their complicated emotions and feelings through the call-and-response style of kirtans, the devotional songs commonly associated with the Hare Krishna faith.",
      "\u201cThis is almost a miraculous thing to say, but in this world of social media and phone addiction and all that, the kids in the Krishna community are doing the craziest thing: Without anyone telling them to, they will find a weekend where everyone\u2019s free, they will dress to the nines together, and find a temple or a space where they will do kirtans for, like, 10 hours straight,\u201d he told RNS. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. It makes no sense in the modern world, but they\u2019re doing it.\u201d",
      "Vani, born into an American Hare Krishna family, just performed his first solo live concert at Mumbai\u2019s Royal Opera House in late January. Once the head of the successful early 2000s \u201cKrishna-conscious\u201d rock band As Kindred Spirits, Vani joined musicians from the East and the West for a fusion of world music, mantra, pop and rock. \u201cIt\u2019s all about spiritual stories and spiritual music from around the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of my jam.\u201d",
      "Some form of singing or chanting takes place in almost every Hindu tradition, says Vani, but the bhakti, or devotional, tradition practiced by members of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness, or ISKCON, places an emphasis on music as a way to connect with the Divine, and \u201cas a way to create harmony, peace in the world, peace in oneself and to heal both spiritually and physically.\u201d",
      "The Maha Mantra, a repetition of the words \u201cHare,\u201d or praise, \u201cKrishna\u201d and \u201cRama,\u201d set to any melody the singer, or kirtaniya, chooses, is an ISKCON staple. This Sanskrit call-and-response, with the names of God sung alongside a harmonium and a mridanga, a type of drum, says Vani, can lead participants to a \u201cflow state\u201d where it may feel like \u201cmusic is kind of descending from the heavens and coming out through you.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the closest thing to ecstasy I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d said Vani.",
      "Steeped in this tradition since birth, Vani and his wife, a trained Indian classical dancer, have now surrounded their three teenage children with song and dance. But as Vani has taught his kids, spiritual meaning is not limited to kirtans: \u201cIf you look for it, spiritual music is all around us, in all cultures,\u201d he said, from gospel to Sufi Zikr to praise music from South Africa. And, says Vani, it\u2019s in his daily playlist of Nora Jones, George Harrison, the Talking Heads and The Police. (The latter\u2019s song \u201cSpirits in the Material World\u201d is, he said, a personal family favorite.)",
      "Premanjali Dejager, a 24-year-old \u201cKrishna kid\u201d \u2014 a term of endearment for those raised in a Hare Krishna household \u2014 lives in New York\u2019s Bhakti Center ashram and doesn\u2019t go a day without chanting the Maha Mantra a few times. The kirtaniya, who grew up in Australia, says kirtans can feel like a \u201cspiritual dance party,\u201d where \u201cteenage angst\u201d and \u201cclub dance moves\u201d meet in a safe, nondestructive environment.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the midst of it, like, when someone is really singing from their heart and, like, really connecting, you feel that sense of connection in the room,\u201d Dejager, who grew up in Australia, told RNS. \u201cIt\u2019s just contagious.\u201d",
      "Dejager has sung around the world with her guru Indradyumna Swami, known as the Travelling Monk, since graduating gurukul, or \u201cspiritual high school,\u201d in 2018. But, she said, she wasn\u2019t always so musically inclined. \u201cI was actually a really terrible singer,\u201d she said, recalling that she was removed from her primary school\u2019s singing group because she \u201cjust couldn\u2019t sing on key.\u201d",
      "Yet taking singing lessons in jazz and pop music grew Dejager\u2019s confidence, and she started posting devotional singing videos on social media, some of them \u201creally cringy.\u201d Today, she has more than 50,000 Instagram followers and her own virtual kirtan school, where she has, since 2021, taught other aspiring singers over Zoom that what\u2019s important is \u201cbeing real,\u201d or coming as you are to the devotional practice.",
      "\u201cSometimes, if I\u2019m feeling really sad or going through something difficult or having to make a difficult decision, that\u2019s what\u2019s on my mind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be a prayer offering of like, \u2018Krishna, I need your help here. I need your guidance.\u2019 And sometimes it does happen where I\u2019m having to catch myself from like spacing out, and my mind goes everywhere. It is a practice of constantly trying to bring the mind back and just trying to bring my heart into the picture.\u201d",
      "Nikita Bhasin, a California native, considers herself more spiritual than religious. A certified yoga instructor since the age of 17, Bhasin was raised attending and singing devotionals at the Kali Mandir in Laguna Beach \u2014 a common story of being \u201cdragged along by my family.\u201d",
      "\u201cI left all the kirtan stuff behind because I was older and I didn\u2019t have to do what my parents told me to do,\u201d Bhasin, 27, told RNS.",
      "But Bhasin eventually found her way back to the music, when she learned yoga from an instructor who began practice with the same chants she heard as a child, but in a \u201cmore digestible\u201d 10-minute format rather than the three hours she spent at the temple. She took up the harmonium and now opens and closes each of her yoga classes in New York, barring if they are in a gym setting, with a Sanskrit chant, often to the theme of the asanas, or postures, such as repeating \u201cJai Ma,\u201d or hail Mother Earth, in a class about \u201cbalancing opposition.\u201d",
      "Many of her students have never chanted before, holding varying beliefs (or no beliefs) about God, some coming only for the physical asanas of yoga. Bhasin invites them to \u201cput their own spin\u201d on the ancient practice.",
      "\u201cA lot of these chants, you are chanting to something higher than yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of interpretations of that. There\u2019s thousands of lineages that think of God or divine as something different: Divine could be a hug from your friend, or it could be feeling like you\u2019re not on autopilot and are grateful and connecting with people in your life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting, because a lot of people tell me after class that they haven\u2019t sung since they were like 10 years old, and this is how they\u2019re coming back to their body and coming back to this childlike spirit of just letting go,\u201d she said."

      "NEW YORK -- In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry, Amazon MGM announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",

      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.5 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007 concluded with 2021's \u201cNo Time to Die,\u201d Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",

      "VANNES, France -- A former surgeon is set to stand trial in France on Monday for the alleged rape or sexual abuse of 299 victims, most of them children who were his patients, in what investigators and his own notebooks describe as a pattern of violence spanning over three decades.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, now 74, will face hundreds of victims during a four-month trial in Vannes, Brittany. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, on top of 15 years he has been serving after being found guilty in 2020 of rape and sexual assault of children.",

      "A subsequent search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions, according to investigation documents.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is reinstating some of the hundreds of staffers it fired last week",
      "Associated Press -- Barely a week after mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration, some probationary staffers received unexpected news over the weekend: The government wants them back.",
      "Beginning Friday night, FDA employees overseeing medical devices and other key areas received calls and emails notifying them that their recent terminations had been \u201crescinded effective immediately,\u201d according to messages viewed by The Associated Press.",
      "Three FDA staffers impacted by the decisions spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity because they planned to continue working for the agency and weren\u2019t authorized to discuss its internal procedures.",
      "The reversal is the latest example of President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's chaotic approach to cost-cutting, which has resulted in several agencies firing, and then scrambling to rehire, employees responsible for nuclear weapons, national parks and other government services.",
      "The FDA reinstatements followed pushback by lobbyists for the medical device industry, which pays the agency hundreds of millions of dollars annually to hire extra scientists to promptly review products. The industry's leading trade group said Monday \u201ca sizeable number\u201d of device reviewers would apparently be returning to FDA.",
      "\u201cThis would be welcome news, and I appreciate the administration for acting quickly,\u201d AdvaMed CEO Scott Whitaker said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe all share the same goal \u2014 an efficient, effective FDA review process that helps advance the medical technologies American patients depend on.\u201d",
      "FDA staffers said entire teams of five or more medical device reviewers had been reinstated. There did not appear to be a similar effort to rehire staffers in other parts of the agency, including its food and tobacco centers.",
      "The agency hasn\u2019t released official numbers on the terminations, but former FDA officials have pegged the number at roughly 700, with more than 220 coming from the medical device center. That would represent roughly 10% of the program's total staffing.",
      "The FDA did not respond to requests Monday about how many employees were being reinstated.",
      "Like other agencies, the FDA terminations went to employees in their probationary period, typically the first two years of federal employment. But that approach resulted in the terminations across key areas where the agency has been working to beef up staffing, including rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence and digital health. The cuts also included agency leaders who were recently hired for senior roles.",
      "\u201cThe disarray caused by the wholesale termination of a wide swath of device center staff was counterproductive and appears to have caused a variety of unintended and negative results,\u201d said Steve Silverman, a former FDA device official who now runs a consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see a shift in the opposite direction that recognizes the critical expertise of these staffers.\u201d",
      "Many reviewers have advanced degrees in specialized medical and technological fields. They can typically earn more in the private sector than in government.",
      "Last week, the lobbying group AdvaMed pushed back on the firings, calling on Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reverse course. The group warned that the cuts would result in slower approvals for companies and fewer new treatment options for patients.",
      "\u201cFDA will lose hundreds of new employees, the best and most innovative hires under our most recent agreement,\u201d Whitaker wrote in a statement posted online. He noted that the hiring of FDA device reviewers is largely financed through an ongoing five-year agreement between the FDA and medical device companies.",
      "More than half the device program\u2019s $791 million budget last year came from industry fees, according to federal figures. In return, the FDA is obligated to meet certain benchmarks for quickly and predictably reviewing applications for new and updated devices.",
      "FDA staffers who were reinstated said their immediate supervisors received no explanation or advance notice on the decisions. Instead, staffers received calls or emails from the FDA\u2019s \u201cOffice of Talent Solutions,\u201d informing them that their access to FDA computer systems and offices had been restored.",
      "\u201cWe are so grateful to still have you working for the FDA and serving the American public!\u201d the emails concluded.",
      "A week earlier, the same employees received emails stating that they were \u201cnot fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the agency\u2019s current needs.\u201d",
      "Nearly half the FDA\u2019s budget, or about $3.3 billion, comes from fees paid by drugmakers, device and tobacco companies. The result is that broad cuts to those programs won\u2019t add much toward Musk\u2019s stated goal of shrinking the federal budget.",
      "But the financial support of industry fees did not appear to help staffers in other parts of the agency.",
      "The agency\u2019s tobacco center \u2014 which reviews new products like electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches \u2014 is 100% funded by industry fees. But there did not appear to be an effort to rehire any of the estimated 100 or so employees fired from that center.",
      "Similarly, the recalls did not appear to apply to the agency\u2019s food program, which recently went though a major restructuring to better oversee essential products like infant formula and baby food.",
      "Last week, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, Jim Jones resigned, citing \u201cthe indiscriminate firing\u201d of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP. The employees fired included those with \u201chighly technical expertise in nutrition, infant formula, food safety response\u201d and chemical safety, Jones said.",

      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn\u2019t allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral",
      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn't allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral.",
      "A bill sponsor and an organization opposed to fluoridating water said Utah's proposal would set a precedent in the U.S. \u2014 and it would come as new federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, which is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Utah's bill cleared its final hurdle in the legislature Friday, and heads to Gov. Spencer Cox for his approval. A spokesperson for Cox didn't immediately respond to a question about whether he'd sign it.",
      "Already, some cities across the country have tossed fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "Utah ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data published in 2022 by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "Lawmakers who backed the bill, which was sponsored by state Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius and state Sen. Kirk Cullimore, said putting fluoride in the water is too expensive.",
      "\u201cI don't dispute that there can be positive benefits from fluoride, which is why the bill also includes a deregulation of the prescription,\u201d Gricius said in a text message to The Associated Press, referencing a fluoride pill. \u201cThis isn't anti-fluoride legislation, it is pro-informed consent and individual choice.\u201d",
      "Fluoridation is the the most cost effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "\u201cI think the anti-fluoride people, they\u2019re latching onto Kennedy\u2019s opportunity with his beliefs and using that now as a way to kind of get in the door to stop water fluoridation,\u201d Koci said.",
      "She added that fluoridated public water is often the only form of preventive dental care for some people, and the impacts may be most visible in low-income Utah residents.",
      "Fluoride strengthens the teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population drinks fluoridated water.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state's biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "In 2023, voters in Brigham City, north of Salt Lake City, struck down a measure that would have removed fluoride from its public water supplies. The proposal was defeated by more than a two-to-one margin.",
      "Val Radmall, the executive director of the Utah Dental Association, said he and others met with Gricius to try to get her to rethink the bill. He worked in a non-fluoridated community for three decades, and said the lack of fluoride showed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d have a patient come in without cavities or anything else like that, and I\u2019d say, \u2019You didn\u2019t grow up here. Where did you grow up?' ... because everybody here has lots of cavities!\u201d he said.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- An annual United Nations conference on biodiversity that ran out of time last year will resume its work Tuesday in Rome with money at the top of the agenda.",
      "That is, how to spend what's been pledged so far \u2014 and how to raise a lot more to help preserve plant and animal life on Earth.",
      "The talks in Colombia known as COP16 yielded some significant outcomes before they broke up in November, including an agreement that requires companies that benefit from genetic resources in nature \u2014 say, by developing medicines from rainforest plants \u2014 to share the benefits. And steps were taken to give Indigenous peoples and local communities a stronger voice in conservation matters.",
      "But two weeks turned out to be not enough time to get everything done.",
      "The Cali talks followed the historic 2022 COP15 accord in Montreal, which included 23 measures aimed at protecting biodiversity. Those included putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030, known as the Global Biodiversity Framework.",
      "\u201cMontreal was about the \u2018what\u2019 \u2014 what are we all working towards together?\u201d said Georgina Chandler, head of policy and campaigns for the Zoological Society London. \u201cCali was supposed to focus on the \u2018how\u2019 \u2014 putting the plans and the financing in place to ensure we can actually implement this framework.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey eventually lost a quorum because people simply went home,\u201d said Linda Krueger of The Nature Conservancy, who is in Rome for the two days of talks \u201cAnd so now we\u2019re having to finish these last critical decisions, which are some of the the nitty gritty decisions on financing, on resource mobilization and on the planning and monitoring and reporting requirements under the Global Biodiversity Framework.\u201d",
      "The overall financial aim was to achieve $20 billion a year in the fund by 2025, and then $30 billion by 2030. So far, only $383 million had been pledged as of November, from 12 nations or sub-nations: Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Province of Qu\u00e9bec, Spain, and the United Kingdom.",
      "Participants will discuss establishing a \u201cglobal financing instrument for biodiversity\u201d intended to effectively distribute the money raised. And a big part of the talks will be about raising more money.",
      "Chandler and Kruger both said the finance points at Colombia's talks were particularly contentious.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really about how do we collect the money and how do we get it distributed fairly, get it to the ground where it\u2019s needed most, so that that\u2019s really the core issue,\u201d said Kruger.",
      "Oscar Soria, chief executive of The Common Initiative, a think tank specializing in global economic and environmental policy, was pessimistic about raising a great deal more money.",
      "\u201cWe are completely off track in terms of achieving that money,\u201d Soria said. Key sources of biodiversity finance are shrinking or disappearing, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat was supposed to be a good Colombian telenovela in which people will actually bring the right resources, and the happy ending of bringing their money, could actually end up being a tragic Italian opera, where no one actually agrees to anything and everyone loses,\u201d Soria said.",
      "Susana Muhamad, Colombia's former environment minister and the COP16 president, said she's hopeful of \u201ca good message from Rome.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat message is that still, even with a very fragmented geopolitical landscape, with a world increasingly in conflict, we can still get an agreement on some fundamental issues,\" Muhamad said in a statement. \"And one of the most important is the need to protect life in this crisis of climate change and biodiversity.\u201d",
      "Global wildlife populations have plunged on average by 73% in 50 years, according to an October report from the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London.",

      "Chandler said deforestation in the Amazon has far-reaching impacts across South America, just as it does in the Congo Basin and other major biodiverse regions worldwide.",

    "story": [
      "A court battle is set to resume over the Trump administration\u2019s drastic cuts in medical research funding",
      "BOSTON -- A court battle is set to resume Friday over the Trump administration\u2019s drastic cuts in medical research funding that many scientists say will endanger patients and delay new lifesaving discoveries.",
      "A federal judge in Massachusetts temporarily blocked the cuts from taking effect earlier this month in response to separate lawsuits filed by a group of 22 states plus organizations representing universities, hospitals and research institutions nationwide.",
      "The new National Institutes of Health policy would strip research groups of hundreds of millions of dollars to cover so-called indirect expenses of studying Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease and a host of other illnesses \u2014 anything from clinical trials of new treatments to basic lab research that is the foundation for discoveries. Now U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden, must decide whether to extend the temporary restraining order blocking those cuts.",
      "The states and research groups say such a move is illegal, pointing to bipartisan congressional action during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term to prohibit it.",
      "\u201cYet here we are again,\u201d attorneys argued in a court motion, saying the NIH is \u201cin open defiance\u201d of what Congress decreed.",
      "In its own written arguments, the Trump administration said NIH has authority to alter the terms after awarding grants and that Kelley\u2019s courtroom isn\u2019t the proper venue to arbitrate claims of breach of contract.",
      "States and researchers \u201chave failed to show that they would suffer an irreparable injury,\u201d according to the administration motion.",
      "The NIH, the main funder of biomedical research, awarded more than 60,000 grants last year totaling about $35 billion. The total is divided into \"direct\" costs \u2013 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and laboratory supplies \u2013 and \u201cindirect\u201d costs, the administrative and facility costs needed to support that work.",
      "The Trump administration had dismissed those expenses as \u201coverhead\u201d but universities and hospitals argue they\u2019re far more critical. They can include such things as electricity to operate sophisticated machinery, hazardous waste disposal, staff who ensure researchers follow safety rules and janitorial workers.",
      "Different projects require different resources. Labs that handle dangerous viruses, for example, require more expensive safety precautions than a simpler experiment. So currently each grant\u2019s amount of indirect costs is negotiated with NIH, some of them small while others reaching 50% or more of the total grant.",
      "If the new policy stands, indirect costs would be capped at 15% immediately, for already awarded grants and new ones. NIH calculated that would save the agency $4 billion a year.",
      "A motion filed earlier this week cited a long list of examples of immediate harm in blue states and red states. They included the possibility of ending some clinical trials of treatments at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, that could leave \u201ca population of patients with no viable alternative.\"",
      "Officials at Johns Hopkins University were more blunt, saying the cut would end or require significantly scaling back research projects potentially including some of the 600 NIH-funded studies open to Hopkins patients.",
      "\u201cThe care, treatments and medical breakthroughs provided to them and their families are not \u2018overhead,\u2019\u201d university president Ron Daniels and Hopkins Medicine CEO Theodore DeWeese wrote to employees.",
      "Attorneys also argued the cuts would harm state economies. The University of Florida would need to cut \u201ccritical research staffing\u201d by about 45 people, while construction of a new research facility in Detroit expected to create nearly 500 new jobs could be paused or even abandoned, they wrote.",
      "\u201cImplementing this 15% cap will mean the abrupt loss of hundreds of millions of dollars that are already committed to employing tens of thousands of researchers and other workers, putting a halt to countless lifesaving health research and cutting-edge technology initiatives,\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "Gunfire erupted after officers went to engage the shooter, whom Barker identified as Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49. He said Archangel-Ortiz was holding at gunpoint a female staff member who had her hands bound with zip ties when police opened fire.",

      "Barker added that while the investigation is in its early stages, it appears Archangel-Ortiz had previous contact with the hospital's ICU earlier in the week for \u201ca medical purpose involving another individual\u201d and he intentionally targeted the workers there.",
      "No one answered the door Saturday at an address in York believed to be that of Archangel-Ortiz.",

      "The shooting is part of a wave of gun violence in recent years that has swept through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make health care one of the nation's most violent fields, with workers suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in any other profession, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

      "The Planned Parenthood Federation of America says the Missouri legislation is the first of its kind, though fears over the potential tracking of pregnant women are nothing new.",

Some Democratic-led states have taken steps to protect such health data in recent years.",

      "\u201cThe broader discussion in the media has made patients very aware and very concerned about these things,\u201d Knutter said.",
      "Oklahoma\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday voted 6-2 against advancing a proposal to allow murder charges against women who obtain abortions, with possible punishments including the death penalty and life in prison.",
      "A week earlier, North Dakota\u2019s House rejected a measure with similar features 77-16.",
      "Groups including the National Right to Life Committee and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America have for years been urging lawmakers not to consider those measures, arguing that women are often coerced into abortion and should not be punished.",

      "\u201cWhile the abortion clinics no longer offer or perform abortion, there is a massive loophole in Oklahomans' laws,\u201d Sen. Dusty Deevers, who sponsored the Oklahoma measure, told the judiciary committee during a hearing Wednesday. \u201cNamely, they don\u2019t apply to the mothers themselves.\u201d",
      "Deevers said his approach is the only way to stop the flow of abortion pills prescribed by doctors in other states via telehealth and shipped in. A survey conducted for the Society of Family Planning, which advocates abortion access, found that there were nearly 1,000 abortions via telemedicine in Oklahoma in the second half of 2023. The Guttmacher Institute, another research organization that supports abortion rights, has found that by 2023, more than 6 in 10 abortions in the formal healthcare system nationally involved pills.",
      "Democrats and some Republicans on the committee had concerns, including that the law could lead to criminal investigations of women who have miscarriages, that such an extreme approach could rally support for a state constitutional amendment to allow abortion, or that enforcement would be hard.",

    "summary": "Spending all day standing can take a toll on a worker&rsquo;s body",
    "story": [
      "Spending all day standing can take a toll on a worker\u2019s body",
      "NEW YORK -- While traveling in Europe, Margaux Lantelme noticed something different about the store cashiers: they did their work sitting down. It was a stark contrast to Chicago, where Lantelme works the register at REI and cashiers typically spend eight hours a day on their feet.",
      "For Lantelme, a former kayaking instructor, prolonged standing can trigger flare-ups of chronic pain that limit her mobility. She requested a chair to use during her shift and got one. But after a change in management, she had to fill out paperwork to keep the chair, which required multiple doctor visits and insurance co-payments over a period of months. She's still waiting for final approval.",
      "\u201cNot having access to a chair without approval from a doctor, which costs money and time and energy, is really ridiculous,\u201d Lantelme said. \u201cI personally think that people should be able to have access to seating at work anytime they need it.\u201d",
      "Standing for long periods can lead to low back pain, fatigue, muscle pain and leg swelling, and it can increase the risk of cardiovascular problems and pregnancy complications, according to a review conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Researchers there concluded that movement, whether walking or shifting from a standing to a seated or leaning position, appeared to be the best way of reducing those health hazards.",
      "Being on one's feet for an extended time also can lead to chronic venous insufficiency, a disease in which damaged veins impact blood circulation, according to the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses, which represents operating room nurses.",
      "The association recommends trying \u201cfatigue-reducing techniques such as alternate propping one foot on a footstool, the use of anti-fatigue mats, using a sit-stand stool and wearing supportive footwear,\u201d said Lisa Spruce, senior director of evidence-based perioperative practices at AORN.",
      "Many jobs besides nursing require extended standing: department store sales clerks, hairdressers, surgeons, restaurant cooks and airport workers are just some of the people who perform their roles on their feet.",
      "Cecilia Ortiz, 43, used to work as an airport wheelchair attendant in Phoenix. \u201cIt takes a really hard toll on the knees,\u201d she said. The break room had three or four chairs, which wasn\u2019t enough for everyone, so workers often went to the hallway and sat on the floor, Ortiz said.",
      "She said she once got written up by her boss for sitting down at an electronic device charging station for 15 minutes after she'd been on her feet for five hours without a break.",
      "Ortiz now works for a warehouse that provides supplies to the airport, and when she needs to sit, she can.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not so strict over there. If we needed to sit down for any reason there wouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Ortiz said.",
      "Her former employer, Prospect Airport Services, said it adheres to all local, state and federal labor regulations regarding breaks. \"Our employees are welcome to take their breaks and meals in our designated break room or in any common-use space throughout the airport,\" company spokesperson Jackie Reedy said. \"This policy allows our employees to choose the location that best suits their needs.\u201d",
      "Unionized workers at the Barnes & Nobles store in Manhattan's Union Square have made access to chairs and the right to sit down under certain conditions a part of their negotiations for their first contract.",
      "\u201cThe longer I\u2019ve been at the job, I\u2019ve started noticing knee issues, especially because we do a lot of bending down and standing back up when we\u2019re shelving books and showing customers things and creating displays,\u201d bookseller Bear Spiegel, 28, said. \u201cBeing able to have a stool available would be really useful just so I could rest my knees for a couple of minutes throughout the day while I\u2019m doing things on the computer while I\u2019m at the registers.\u201d",
      "Spiegel\u2019s coworkers suggested wearing a knee brace and athletic tape, and those solutions have helped, but it\u2019s hard for him to predict what days he\u2019ll need the extra support because his symptoms vary each day, he said.",
      "\u201cThere have been days that I\u2019ve requested a stool and thankfully my managers have allowed me to take them out and use them when needed,\u201d Spiegel said.",
      "Barnes & Noble uses chairs or stools routinely for those working off the sales floor when it\u2019s sensible to do so, but a lot of a bookseller\u2019s work is done on the move, including unpacking, sorting and shelving books, a company spokesperson said.",
      "The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents about 100,000 workers, has been pushing to include in the contracts it negotiates, including at Barnes & Noble, a guaranteed right to sit during work that can be done seated, said Stuart Appelbaum, the union's president.",
      "During one bargaining session, an employer objected to the demand. Union negotiators used a break that emptied the conference room to underline their position. \u201cThe employer came back and saw we had removed all chairs from the negotiating table,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cI think the point was made.\u201d",
      "In the end, the union got the chairs it wanted written into the contract, he said.",
      "Around the turn of the 20th century, most states in the U.S. had laws requiring seating for female workers. Women were increasingly entering the workforce, and there was a fear that if their jobs were too physically taxing, they might not become pregnant, said Eileen Boris, a labor historian and professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
      "Women were seen as the \u201cmothers of the human race, and thus we have to protect motherhood,\u201d Boris added. \u201cAlmost every state had laws, but they weren\u2019t enforced.\u201d",
      "Those laws were repealed over time because they applied only to women. One reason was that the women's movement was pushing for equal rights, rather than special treatment, Boris said.",
      "Labor movements in other countries were more successful in establishing requirements about seating. \u201cThe English shop movement was much stronger and had more men in it than the U.S.,\" Boris said.",
      "In 1964, the International Labour Organization, a U.N. agency, adopted workplace standards requiring employers to furnish sufficient and suitable seats, as well as reasonable opportunities for workers to use them. More than 50 countries ratified the agreement, but the U.S. was not one of them.",
      "Today, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon and Wisconsin are among the states with \u201cright to sit\u201d laws that obligate employers to provide suitable seating for all workers, regardless of gender, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, approved an ordinance in October that requires manufacturers, retail stores, laundromats, hotels, restaurants, hairdressers, barbers and skin care professionals to let workers sit down as along as sitting doesn\u2019t interfere with their duties. A statewide bill also was introduced in Michigan last fall.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 01:35:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A U.S. aid freeze is threatening the lives of HIV-positive orphans at Nyumbani Children&rsquo;s Home in Nairobi",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. aid freeze is threatening the lives of HIV-positive orphans at Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Two-year-old Evans was brought to the Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi, Kenya a year ago, suffering from HIV and tuberculosis. With no family to care for him, Evans was referred to the orphanage by a health center after he stopped responding to medical treatment.",
      "Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home is the reason Evans is still alive. But political decisions made thousands of miles (kilometers) away might spell the end of his short life. Nyumbani provides him and around 100 other children with antiretroviral medication, which they have been receiving from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Kenyan government.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order to freeze USAID\u2019s funding means Nyumbani\u2019s access to life-saving antiretroviral drugs, which stop the HIV virus from replicating in the body, may end soon.",
      "Trump\u2019s order seeks to review almost all U.S. foreign aid for 90 days and his administration has moved to shut down USAID. The effects are beginning to set it in, with thousands of people losing their jobs globally and humanitarian programs around the world disrupted.",
      "For children at Nyumbani Children's Home, it's a life and death situation.",
      "As he plays with other preschoolers, Evans is oblivious to his uncertain future, despite the worry on his caregivers\u2019 faces.",
      "The tiny graves at one end of the orphanage compound are a bleak reminder of what a future without USAID looks like for the children. It's a scenario Sister Tresa Palakudy \u2014 who has been looking after children here for 28 years \u2014 is well familiar with having worked at the orphanage before USAID started helping.",
      "\u201cWhen we started caring for them, they didn\u2019t look like they had life in them,\u201d she said. \u201cOne after another, they died. It was so painful, and I don\u2019t want to see that happen again.\"",
      "When Nyumbani, which means \u201cHome\u201d in Swahili, was started in 1992 by Christian missionaries, antiretroviral medication had not been introduced. Back then, it operated as a rescue center for orphaned and abandoned children living with HIV, offering largely palliative care.",
      "The 2003 inception of the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, provided new hope for children living with HIV around the continent, including the orphans at Nyumbani. PEPFAR\u2019s humanitarian aid to combat HIV in Kenya was funded largely by USAID.",
      "\u201cUSAID started bringing ARVs free of charge,\u201d said Palakudy. \u201cWe put all our children on ARVs and their lives changed. They became healthy and were able to go to school and live like other children.\u201d",
      "Over the last two decades, the U.S government, through PEPFAR, has spent more than $8 billion on HIV/AIDS treatment for close to 1.3 million people in Kenya.",
      "USAID and PEPFAR have been critical to operating Nyumbani, having donated more than $16 million to the home between 1999 and 2023. This has enabled the home to reach up to 50,000 children through the rescue center, as well as its two outreach programs Lea Toto and Nyumbani Village. The aid included direct funds to the home, which was used to run the two outreach programs.",
      "Direct funding from USAID was discontinued in 2023, about the same time the orphanage came under scrutiny over allegations of sexual abuse of children by volunteers and staff members.",
      "According to a Washington Post report, six former residents claimed that administrators at the home covered up allegations of sexual abuse. The home disputed the claims of a cover up, insisting that all allegations were handled according to protocols including reporting to local authorities and providing counseling to affected residents.",
      "Executive Director Judith Wamboye said investigations by the Kenyan police were inconclusive. The discontinuation of the funds was not related to the investigations and was in line with a change in USAID policy to channel aid through the government rather than directly to organizations.",
      "The policy change affected all organizations receiving funding. Rather than giving money directly to non-governmental organizations, funding would be channeled through government programs that catered to similar needs. As a result, Nyumbani scaled down its outreach programs and referred beneficiaries to government institutions.",
      "With the discontinuation of direct funding from USAID, the two outreach programs under Nyumbani were scaled down and children in the program were referred to other centers. However, Nyumbani has still been reliant on USAID to supply the lifesaving PEPFAR HIV treatment drugs for free.",
      "\u201cThe future is uncertain,\u201d said Wamboye. \u201cThe Kenyan government announced that they only have ARV stocks to last six months.\u201d",
      "According to data from amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, about 1.3 million people are on HIV/AIDS treatment in Kenya, and 1,602 orphans and vulnerable children in Kenya are dependent on PEPFAR. amfAR warns that President Trump\u2019s freeze on foreign aid could sever their access to critical medical care.",
      "One such child is Mercy, who has been under the care of Nyumbani for the last 12 years. The ARVs saved her life. \u201cI had a very weak immune system,\" she said. \"This led me to contracting many serious illnesses like tuberculosis and skin diseases.\u201d",
      "Mercy was placed on HIV treatment, giving her a lifeline, but recent news on the freeze order has her scared for her life.",
      "\u201cI am very afraid that previous illnesses that I experienced when I was young will reoccur. And now that I have finished high school and am ready to join college, I am scared it will ruin everything,\u201d she said.",
      "On average, the children's home requires $1,139 per child annually for HIV treatment. In addition to antiretrovirals, the home needs reagents to enable regular testing of the viral load in the children, as well as medicines to treat opportunistic illnesses, which are common among HIV patients.",
      "Wamboye said that should PEPFAR be discontinued permanently, the cost of ARVs could go up and become unaffordable, which will mean children living with HIV will die.",
      "\u201cThis is a life-saving situation and we cannot sit and wait and bargain on human life. So for us, it\u2019s about human life, the lives that we need to save. Something needs to be done urgently,\u201d she said.",

      "New York is suing several large electronic cigarette distributors for allegedly selling vaping flavors that can appeal to children",
      "New York on Thursday sued some of the country\u2019s biggest distributors of electronic cigarettes, accusing the companies of violating state laws that prohibit the sale of vaping flavors and designs that appeal to children.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James announced the lawsuit targeting middlemen that distribute fruit- and candy-flavored e-cigarettes like Puff Bar and Elf Bar to hundreds of convenience stories and gas stations across the state. The approach differs from past litigation by New York and other states, which targeted vaping manufacturers, such as Juul Labs.",
      "Widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend, Juul has paid more than $1 billion to settle dozens of state and local lawsuits and investigations into its early marketing practices, which included launch parties and product giveaways. The company stopped selling flavors like mango and mint in 2019 and is no longer popular with teens.",
      "Instead, Chinese-made disposable e-cigarettes like Elf Bar have become the top choice among high school and middle school students. None of the products are approved by federal health regulators but they continue shipping into the U.S., often mislabeled as batteries, cell phones or other products.",
      "The state\u2019s nearly 200-page legal complaint points to \u201cwidespread evidence of illegal conduct, including documents showing illegal shipments of flavored vapes to New York.\u201d The filing also includes photos of brightly colored e-cigarettes that resemble soft drinks and candy and come in flavors like \u201cfruity bears freeze,\u201d \u201ccotton candy,\u201d and \u201cstrawberry cereal donut milk.\u201d",
      "New York banned all vaping flavors other than tobacco in 2020.",
      "\u201cFor too long, these companies have disregarded our laws in order to profit off of our young people, but we will not risk the health and safety of our kids,\u201d James said in a statement.",
      "The lawsuit seeks hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from the companies, as well as a permanent ban on their sales of flavored vapes in New York.",
      "In 2022 litigation, the co-founder of Buffalo-based Demand Vape told a federal judge that his company had sold more than $132 million worth of Elf Bar e-cigarettes in the past year. The company that makes Elf Bar is based in Shenzhen, China, and sells flavors including \u201cstrawberry mango\u201d and \u201clemon mint.\u201d",
      "Despite the continued availability of disposable e-cigarettes, the vaping rate among U.S. teens has fallen to a 10-year low of under 6%, according to federal figures released last year. Government health officials attribute the drop to more aggressive U.S. enforcement, including hundreds of warning letters sent to retail stores selling unauthorized vaping products.",

    "story": [
      "Israeli and Hamas officials say they have reached an agreement to exchange the bodies of dead hostages for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners",
      "JERUSALEM -- JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israeli and Hamas officials said Tuesday they have reached an agreement to exchange the bodies of dead hostages for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, keeping their fragile ceasefire intact for at least a few more days.",
      "Israel has delayed the release of 600 Palestinian prisoners since Saturday to protest what it says is the cruel treatment of hostages during their release by Hamas. The militant group has said the delay is a \u201cserious violation\u201d of their ceasefire and that talks on a second phase are not possible until they are freed.",
      "The deadlock had threatened to collapse the ceasefire when the current six-week first phase of the deal expires this weekend.",
      "But late Tuesday, Hamas said an agreement had been reached to resolve the dispute during a visit to Cairo by a delegation headed by Khalil al-Hayya, a top political official in the group.",
      "The breakthrough appeared to clear the way for the return of the bodies of four more dead hostages and hundreds of additional prisoners scheduled to be released under the ceasefire.",
      "The prisoners previously slated for release \u201cwill be released simultaneously with the bodies of the Israeli prisoners who were agreed to be handed over,\u201d along with the release of a new set of Palestinian prisoners, the Hamas statement said.",
      "An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, confirmed an agreement to bring home the bodies in the coming days. He gave no further details.",
      "But Israeli media reports said the exchange could take place as soon as Wednesday. The Ynet news site said the Israeli bodies would be handed over to Egyptian authorities without any public ceremony.",
      "Hamas has released hostages, and the bodies of four dead hostages, in large public ceremonies during which the Israelis were paraded and forced to wave to large crowds. Israel, along with the Red Cross and U.N. officials, have said the ceremonies were humiliating to the hostages, and Israel last weekend delayed the scheduled prisoner release in protest.",
      "The latest agreement would complete both sides' obligations of the first phase of the ceasefire \u2014 during which Hamas is returning 33 hostages \u2014 including eight bodies \u2014 in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "It also could clear the way for an expected visit by the White House\u2019s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the region. Witkoff, who is expected in the region in the coming days, has said he wants the sides to move into negotiations on the second phase, during which all remaining hostages held by Hamas are to be released and an end to the war is to be negotiated. The Phase 2 talks were supposed to begin weeks ago, but never did.",

      "A court in Bosnia has sentenced separatist Bosnian Serb President Milorad Dodik to one year in prison and banned him from politics for six years because of his unconstitutional actions",
      "SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- A court in Bosnia on Wednesday sentenced Milorad Dodik, the pro-Russia Bosnian Serb president, to one year in prison and banned him from politics for six years over his separatist actions as tensions mount in the fragile Balkan state.",
      "The landmark ruling by the court in Sarajevo came after a yearlong trial against Dodik on charges that he disobeyed the top international envoy overseeing peace in the Balkan country. The judgment becomes final after the appeal process.",
      "The leader and his lawyers weren't in court during the sentencing. Dodik has said that he would disobey any conviction and threatened \u201cradical measures\u201d in response, including eventual secession of the Serb-run entity in Bosnia called Republika Srpska from the rest of the country.",
      "Dodik has repeatedly called for the separation of the Serb-run half of Bosnia to join it with neighboring Serbia, which prompted the United States and the United Kingdom to impose sanctions against him and his close allies. Dodik is also accused of corruption and pro-Russia policies.",
      "Dodik\u2019s separatist threats stoked fears in Bosnia, where a 1992-95 war left 100,000 people killed and displaced millions. The U.S.-sponsored Dayton Accords ended the war nearly three decades ago and created two regions, Republika Srpska and the Bosniak-Croat Federation.",
      "The two regions were given wide autonomy but kept some joint institutions, including the army, the top judiciary and tax administration. Bosnia also has a rotating three-member presidency made up of Bosniak, Serb and Croat members.",
      "Bosniak official Camil Durakovic said the verdict against Dodik showed that \u201cno individual is above the state and that everyone will be held accountable for their actions.\u201d",
      "Dodik was in the Bosnian Serb administrative capital Banja Luka, where thousands gathered Wednesday in his support.",
      "\u201cThey say I am guilty, but now people here will say why I am not guilty,\u201d Dodik told the crowd shortly after the verdict was announced. \u201cThere is no reason to worry. I have learned to deal with tougher situations. It is important that you are here.\u201d",
      "In neighboring Serbia, populist President Aleksandar Vucic called an urgent session of the national security council there.",
      "Dodik is unlikely to be sent to prison, because he enjoys the full support of Vucic, who can provide shelter to him in Belgrade. Dodik is also expected to appeal the conviction.",
      "Dodik told the crowd in Banja Luka that he spoke on the phone with Vucic and with Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whom he called a friend. He invited Vucic to come to Banja Luka to discuss \u201cwhat we are going to do next.\u201d",
      "Dodik said the Bosnian Serb parliament will vote later Wednesday to reject the legal proceedings against him. Lawmakers will also approve several laws banning the work of central Bosnian legal institutions from the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia, he said.",
      "Dodik has repeatedly clashed with top international envoy Christian Schmidt and declared his decisions illegal in Republika Srpska. The Dayton peace agreement envisages that the high representative can impose decisions and change laws in the country.",
      "The war in Bosnia erupted when the country\u2019s Serbs rebelled against the country\u2019s independence from the former Yugoslavia and moved to form a mini-state of their own with the aim of uniting it with neighboring Serbia."

      "Taiwan\u2019s coast guard intercepted the Togolese-flagged cargo ship Hongtai in waters between its main island\u2019s west coast and the outlying Penghu Islands early Tuesday, according to a statement by the coast guard.",
      "The coast guard had earlier been notified by telecommunications provider Chunghwa Telecom that one of its undersea cables had been severed 6 nautical miles (11 kilometers) northwest of Jiangjun Fishing Harbor.",
      "The Hongtai had been anchored in that same area since Saturday evening, the coast guard said. From Saturday until early Tuesday, authorities in the nearby Anping Port in Tainan had sent signals to the vessel seven times but had received no response. After the Chunghwa Telecom cable damage report, the coast guard approached the ship, which had begun to sail northwestward, and escorted it to Anping Port.",
      "Taiwanese authorities said the ship\u2019s entire eight-person crew were Chinese nationals and the case was being handled \u201cin accordance with national security-level principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe cause of the underwater cable break, whether it was due to intentional sabotage or simply an accident, is still pending further investigation for clarification,\u201d the coast guard said.",
      "\u201cThe possibility of this being part of a gray-zone incursion by China cannot be ruled out,\u201d it added.",
      "Communications on the Penghu Islands were not disrupted because Chunghwa Telecom had successfully activated a backup cable, the coast guard said.",
      "This is the latest in a series of incidents in recent years in which undersea Taiwanese cables have been damaged \u2014 with Taipei in some instances blaming China. Earlier this year, a Chinese cargo ship was suspected of severing a link northeast of the island.",

    "story": [
      "A small group of foreign tourists has visited North Korea in the past week",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A small group of foreign tourists has visited North Korea in the past week, making them the first international travelers to enter the country in five years except for a group of Russian tourists who went to the North last year.",
      "The latest trip indicates North Korea may be gearing up for a full resumption of its international tourism to bring in much-needed foreign currency to revive its struggling economy, experts say.",
      "The Beijing-based travel company Koryo Tours said it arranged a five-day trip from Feb. 20 to Feb. 24 for 13 international tourists to the northeastern North Korean border city of Rason, where the country\u2019s special economic zone is located.",
      "Koryo Tours General Manager Simon Cockerell said the travelers from the U.K., Canada, Greece, New Zealand, France, Germany, Austria, Australia and Italy crossed by land from China. He said that in Rason, they visited factories, shops, schools and the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the late grandfather and father of current leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "\u201cSince January of 2020, the country has been closed to all international tourists, and we are glad to have finally found an opening in the Rason area, in the far north of North Korea,\u201d Cockerell said.",
      "\u201cOur first tour has been and gone, and now more tourists on both group and private visits are going in, arranging trips,\u201d he added.",
      "After the pandemic began, North Korea quickly banned tourists, jetted out diplomats and severely curtailed border traffic in one of the world\u2019s most draconian COVID-19 restrictions. But since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing curbs and reopening its borders.",
      "In February 2024, North Korea accepted about 100 Russian tourists, the first foreign nationals to visit the country for sightseeing. That surprised many observers, who thought the first post-pandemic tourists would come from China, North Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner and major ally.",
      "A total of about 880 Russian tourists visited North Korea throughout 2024, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said, citing official Russian data. Chinese group tours to North Korea remain stalled.",
      "This signals how much North Korea and Russia have moved closer to each other as the North has supplied weapons and troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. Ties between North Korea and China cooled as China showed its reluctance to join a three-way, anti-U.S. alliance with North Korea and Russia, experts say.",
      "Before the pandemic, tourism was an easy, legitimate source for foreign currency for North Korea, one of the world\u2019s most sanctioned countries because of its nuclear program.",
      "North Korea is expected to open a massive tourism site on the east coast in June. In January when President Donald Trump boasted about his ties with Kim Jong Un, he said that \"I think he has tremendous condo capabilities. He\u2019s got a lot of shoreline.\u201d That likely refers to the eastern coast site.",
      "A return of Chinese tourists would be key to making North Korea's tourism industry lucrative because they represented more than 90% of total international tourists before the pandemic, said Lee Sangkeun, an expert at the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank run by South Korea's intelligence agency. He said that in the past, up to 300,000 Chinese tourists visited North Korea annually.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea has been heavily investing on tourism sites, but there have been not much domestic demand,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe can assess that North Korea now wants to resume international tourism to bring in many tourists from abroad.\u201d",
      "The restrictions that North Korea has typically imposed on foreign travelers \u2014 such as requirements that they move with local guides and the banning of photography at sensitive places \u2014 will likely hurt its efforts to develop tourism. Lee said that Rason, the eastern coast site and Pyongyang would be the places where North Korea feels it can easily monitor and control foreign tourists.",

    "story": [
      "Venezuelan migrants handed over to Mexico like it\u2019s a U.S. immigration detention facility",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Venezuelan migrants handed over to Mexico like it\u2019s a U.S. immigration detention facility. Families from Central Asia flown to Panama and Costa Rica to await voluntary repatriation to their countries. Venezuelans from Guantanamo Bay handed off on a Honduran tarmac and returned to Caracas.",
      "It all sends the unmistakable message that trying to get to the U.S. border is no longer worth it. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has laid the groundwork to reverse the region\u2019s migration flow. And while the numbers remain modest, an outline of how the U.S. hopes to overcome limited detention space as it gears up its deportation machine is emerging.",
      "In its first month, the Trump administration has reached deals with Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama to act as stopovers or destinations for migrants expelled from the U.S. It has brokered deals with Venezuela to pick up its people in Texas, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and Honduras.",
      "But none of the agreements have been detailed for the public, raising concerns about evading international protections for refugees and asylum-seekers. Adam Isacson, a researcher with the Washington-based human rights advocacy organization WOLA, suspects many were little more than improvised \u201chandshake deals.\u201d",
      "They were requests made while Trump threatened tariffs and to take back the Panama Canal. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio moved through the region while U.S. foreign aid was suspended, bestowing exemptions when merited.",
      "Trump made deals during his first presidency with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to take in asylum-seekers, though only Mexico and Guatemala actually received them.",
      "But the agreements in his second term are more varied, ranging from Honduras letting Venezuelans get off a U.S. plane and board a Venezuelan one in its territory last week, to El Salvador offering to imprison deportees \u2014 and even U.S. citizen prisoners.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re being much more ambitious now,\u201d Isacson said. \u201cThe idea of sending people to be warehoused like goods, to deport them to third countries wasn\u2019t an issue\u201d in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "The numbers remain relatively small, but images of deportees deplaning in shackles and deportees holding up signs asking for help in the Panama hotel where they\u2019re held are powerful.",
      "This is still a preliminary phase because Congress has not approved a new budget, Isacson said. \u201cWhile they\u2019re at that lowest level of resources they are doing all of the shock and awe possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea is to scare them.\u201d",
      "Now the migration flow that is visible is of deportations and migrants boarding boats in Panama to take them south to Colombia rather than migrants riding trains north through Mexico or massing at the U.S. border.",
      "In just a month, Mexico has received more than 3,300 foreign deportees, who advocates say were from at least seven nationalities.",
      "A number of them carried unusual U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement documents that read: \u201cReason for transfer: removal. Name of new facility (immigration): MEXICO.\u201d They appear to have nothing to do with the Remain in Mexico program from Trump\u2019s first term that made asylum-seekers wait out the U.S. process from Mexico.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum has said little about Mexico\u2019s participation other than highlighting her administration\u2019s willingness to cooperate. The U.S. Department of State has praised Mexico for receiving deportation flights and for returning migrants from elsewhere to their countries.",
      "Farther south the numbers are smaller, but the imagery has been stronger.",
      "Panama, where more than 500,000 migrants passed en route to the U.S. border in 2023, suddenly became a bridge this month for U.S. efforts to deport asylum seekers. Nearly 300 U.S. deportees from 10 mostly Asian countries were held in a Panama City hotel. Some put signs to their windows that read \u201cHelp\u201d and \u201cWe are not save (sic) in our country.\u201d",
      "About one-third of those in the hotel who refused to voluntarily return to their countries were then sent to a remote camp back in the very jungle they had probably crossed in the other direction. One deportee in the camp told The Associated Press they were not informed of their rights and weren't told how long they would be in the camp, which concerned her because of its poor conditions.",
      "Similar flights landed in Costa Rica last week and they were sent to a remote facility that had also previously received migrants headed north.",
      "In addition to those flights, 50 to 75 migrants are moving south through Costa Rica on their own daily, according to Omer Badilla, Costa Rica\u2019s vice minister of the interior.",
      "He raised the possibility of Panama and Colombia getting involved to organize boat trips south for migrants, but neither of those governments has publicly confirmed their involvement. Panama and Costa Rica say U.N. agencies are assisting with the repatriations and that the U.S. government is paying.",
      "The International Organization for Migration said that it was helping authorities provide basic services and facilitating voluntary repatriations \u201cwhen it is safe to do so.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith the old flow (south to north) the situation is pretty under control,\u201d Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said Thursday. \u201cThat shows that now the problem is coming in the opposite direction and we hope that can be managed in an orderly fashion.\u201d",
      "Even with the involvement of U.N. agencies, concerns abound about vulnerable migrants being passed from country to country and even sent back to countries they fled.",
      "Advocates worry the U.S. may be using third countries to deport migrants from countries where the U.S. may not have diplomatic relations or strained ones, to get around constraints in international law that are supposed to prevent people from being sent back to places they would not be safe.",
      "Gretchen Kuhner, director of IMUMI, a nongovernmental legal services organization in Mexico, said recently a flight carrying Venezuelans from the United States to Venezuela made a stop in Cancun. But IMUMI wasn\u2019t able to speak with the migrants aboard directly to know if they wanted to try to request asylum in Mexico while in the country\u2019s territory.",
      "Isacson said among the Venezuelans sent back to that country have been people who deserted the armed forces, who would now be in the hands of the military. The risks could be even more dire for some migrants from Iran and Afghanistan.",
      "The region\u2019s governments are understandably sensitive about appearing to be aiding in Trump\u2019s deportation efforts, but Isacson said transparency will better shield them from those criticisms.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In a final statement at his impeachment trial, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol defended his martial law decree that plunged the country into chaos as a bid to inform the public of the danger of the opposition-controlled parliament as he vowed Tuesday to push for political reform if reinstated.",
      "Yoon spoke at the Constitutional Court as it wrapped up arguments in his impeachment trial. The court is expected to rule by mid-March on whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate his presidential powers.",
      "The liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly impeached Yoon, a conservative, after his short-lived Dec. 3 martial law decree caused political turmoil, rattled its financial markets and hurt its international image. He has been separately arrested and indicted on rebellion charges in connection with his decree. If convicted, he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment.",
      "Yoon has denied any wrongdoing and blamed the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda, impeached many senior officials and slashed key parts of the government's budget bill, for the political crisis. During his marital law announcement, Yoon called the assembly \u201ca den of criminals\u201d and \u201canti-state forces.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe reason why I declared martial law was because of desperation as I could no longer neglect a do-or-die crisis facing this country,\u201d Yoon said. \u201cI tried to inform the people of these anti-state acts of wickedness by the mammoth opposition party and appealed to the people to stop it with intense surveillance and criticism.\u201d",
      "After declaring martial law, Yoon sent troops and police officers to the assembly, but enough lawmakers still managed to enter an assembly chamber to vote down Yoon\u2019s decree unanimously, forcing his Cabinet to lift it.",
      "Yoon reiterated Tuesday that he had no intentions of disrupting assembly work and that deploying troops and police was meant to maintain order. But some commanders of military units sent to the assembly have testified that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to prevent them from overturning his decree.",
      "During the hearing, Democratic Party lawmaker Jung Chung-rai said that Yoon must be dismissed as he undermined the constitution by trying to seal the assembly and suppress its authority with armed troops. Jung also said Yoon's imposition of martial law disturbed public order because South Korea wasn't in an emergency that required such a drastic step.",
      "\u201cYoon Suk Yeol is still refusing to have self-reflection and soul-searching and repeating sophistry and crafty remarks that say his emergency martial law was a high-level act of governance,\u201d Jung said. \u201cWe should dismiss him as soon as possible to get the Republic of Korea back on track.\u201d",
      "Massive rallies by opponents and supporters of Yoon have divided the streets of Seoul and other major South Korean cities. Whatever the Constitutional Court decides, experts say it will likely further polarize the country and intensify its conservative-liberal divide. If Yoon is formally thrown out of office, a national election must take place within two months to find his successor.",
      "During more than an hour of testimony Tuesday, Yoon said that he would push for political reforms and a constitutional revision to change the current presidential system if he regains his presidential powers. He also suggested stepping down before his single five-year term ends in 2027 to promote \u201cpolitical reform.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether and how Yoon\u2019s statement could affect the court's ruling.",
      "South Korea adopted the current system that limits a president to a single five-year term in 1987, following decades of military-backed dictatorships. After Yoon\u2019s martial law stunt, there have been calls to change it. Some favor a parliamentary Cabinet system, others want a U.S.-style setup in which a president can run for a second four-year term or a system in which a president and prime minister split key responsibilities."

At the talks, Moscow and Washington agreed to start working toward ending the war and improving their diplomatic and economic ties.",

Prior to Trump's second administration, ties between Moscow and Washington had fallen to Cold War lows after Russia illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and invaded Ukraine in 2022.",

      "\u201cIf one assumes that the Son of God is partly responsible for the terrible acts of abuse that have also and especially occurred in the Catholic Church, a line has been crossed that cannot be justified for any reason in the world,\u201d the archdiocese's letter said.",
      "Several members of the center-right Christian Democratic party, including a former Cologne mayor, also expressed anger over the float. In a letter they said the image, \u201cwhich cannot be surpassed in terms of embarrassment and tastelessness, should not belittle the Cologne Shrove Monday procession and carnival as a whole,\u201d German news agency dpa reported.",
      "Cologne is a traditionally Catholic city, known for its iconic, double-domed cathedral. It was one of the most important European places of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages.",
      "However, many German Catholics, also in Cologne, have turned their backs on the churc h in recent years. Many say they felt betrayed by the scale of the sex abuse allegations and disappointed by what they describe as inadequate prosecution of perpetrators by the church.",
      "In 2018, a church-commissioned report concluded that at least 3,677 people were abused by clergy in Germany between 1946 and 2014. More than half of the victims were 13 or younger, and nearly a third served as altar boys.",
      "The head of the Cologne Carnival Committee, Christoph Kuckelkorn, rejected any criticism of the provocative float.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the depiction of abuse that is tasteless and embarrassing, but rather the abuse itself and how it is dealt with,\u201d Kuckelkorn told dpa, adding that carnival is all about satire and to make people think.",

      "The tiny island of Yonaguni on Japan\u2019s western frontier is too small for even a chain convenience store",
      "YONAGUNI, Japan -- This tiny island on Japan's western frontier has no chain convenience stores. Nature lovers can dive with hammerhead sharks and watch miniature horses graze on a hill.",
      "But the wooded mountain ranges now carry radar sites. A southern cattle ranch has been replaced with the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force's Camp Yonaguni. Japan and its ally, the United States, hold joint military exercises here. Plans are underway to add a new missile unit and expand a small airport and port.",
      "All of the buildup has cemented the island as a front line in a potential clash over Taiwan, the self-governing democratic island that China claims as its own.",
      "\u201cAs a child, I was so proud of this westernmost border island,\u201d said Fumie Kano, an innkeeper on Yonaguni. \u201cBut recently, we are repeatedly told this place is dangerous, and I feel so sad.\u201d",
      "The militarization has been especially felt as the island's population shrinks. There are less than 1,500 local residents. Supporters say new servicemembers arriving are needed for the island's safety and struggling economy. Opponents like Kano say the military buildup is damaging the environment, making the island's economy dependent on the military and could provoke an attack.",
      "Yonaguni is only 110 kilometers (68 miles) east of Taiwan, around which China has bolstered military activity. Worried about a conflict, Japan has made a \u201csouthwestern shift\u201d in its military posture and accelerated defense buildup and spending around the front line.",
      "Missile units for PAC-3 interceptors have been deployed on Yonaguni and nearby Ishigaki and Miyako islands.",
      "Yonaguni residents find themselves at the center of the geopolitical tension. A recent government plan to deploy more missiles, possibly long-range, has caused unease about the future of the island, even among those who initially supported hosting troops.",
      "Kano, a Yonaguni native, recalls that officials and residents once wanted to improve the economy and environment through commercial exchanges with Taiwan by operating direct ferries between the islands. But that was set aside when a plan to host Japanese troops became an easier alternative to gain government subsidies and protection.",
      "Disagreement about the plan has divided the small community. Support for hosting Japanese troops carried in a 2015 referendum; that meant the island's fate would be largely decided by the central government\u2019s security policy.",
      "A year later a 160-member coast watch unit was set up to monitor Chinese military activity, with radars built on Mount Inbi and elsewhere. Now there are about 210 troops, including an electro-warfare unit. Servicemembers and their families account for one-fifth of the island\u2019s total population.",
      "The local economy largely depends on the servicemembers and their families who use local shops, schools and community services.",
      "There's worry on the island about the pace and extent of the militarization, says Kyoko Yamaguchi, a potter. \u201cEverything is pushed through in the name of the Taiwan emergency, and many feel this is too much.\u201d",
      "A nonfatal crash in October of a Japanese army tilt-rotor aircraft Osprey during a joint exercise with the U.S. military on the island also caused apprehension.",
      "Japan's air and maritime forces in Okinawa\u2019s prefectural capital of Naha are key to protecting the country's southwestern airspace and territorial waters.",
      "The Naha-based Southwestern Air Defense Force is the busiest of Japan\u2019s four regional air forces. In fiscal 2023, the force was scrambled 401 times, or 60% of the national total of 669, mostly against the Chinese, according to the Defense Ministry.",
      "Rear Adm. Takuhiro Hiragi, commander of Fleet Air Wing 5 of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, says his group's mission is to fly P-3C aircraft over the East China Sea near Okinawa and its remote islands, including Yonaguni, and the Japanese-controlled Senkaku island, which Beijing also claims.",
      "\u201cWe have to be mobile, quick and thorough to keep tabs in this region,\u201d Hiragi said, noting the presence of key sea lanes in the area, including those that China uses to navigate the Pacific Ocean. \u201cWe watch over their exercises, not only near Taiwan but wherever necessary.\u201d",
      "Defense officials say China has been accelerating its military activities in the area between Taiwan and Yonaguni.",
      "In August, a Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance plane briefly violated Japanese airspace off the southern main island of Kyushu, prompting Japan\u2019s military to scramble fighter jets and warn the plane. A Chinese survey ship separately violated Japanese territorial waters off a southern island days later. In September, the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning and two destroyers sailed between Yonaguni and nearby Iriomote, entering a band of water just outside of Japan\u2019s territorial waters.",
      "Yonaguni fisherfolk, who closely monitor foreign vessels, have been among the first to see the growing Chinese military activity.",
      "In 2022, several ballistic missiles China fired as part of an exercise landed off Japan's southwestern waters following then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Taiwan visit in August. One of them landed just 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Yonaguni while more than 20 local fishing boats were operating.",
      "Though it caused no injuries or damage, the Chinese drills kept fisherfolk from operating for a week, Yonaguni fisheries association chief and town assembly member Shigenori Takenishi said. \u201cIt was an extremely dangerous exercise that really made us feel China's potential threat right next to us.\u201d",
      "Fear of a Taiwan war rekindles bitter memories here of the Battle of Okinawa, in which about 200,000 people, nearly half of them civilians, were killed. Historians say the army sacrificed Okinawa to defend Japan\u2019s mainland. Today Okinawa 's main island hosts more than half of the 50,000 American troops in Japan.",
      "\"Being at the center of this issue is very stressful for residents,\" said shopkeeper Takako Ueno. \u201cI don't want people to imagine this beautiful island turning into a battlefield.\u201d",
      "To keep that from happening Yonaguni needs to be fortified, says Mayor Kenichi Itokazu, a military buildup advocate who has campaigned for the deployment of more Japanese troops for decades.",
      "Some residents feel uneasy about their vulnerability, even amid the military buildup.",
      "A government evacuation plan last year showed moving 120,000 people from five remote islands, including Yonaguni, to Japan's main islands would take at least six days. Some question whether such an evacuation is even possible.",
      "Itokazu, the mayor, wants to build a shelter in the basement of a new town hall and to expand the Higawa port for evacuation by ship, a plan opposed by environmentalists who say there are rare marine species there.",
      "But there's skepticism from some.",
      "\u201cIt's absurd,\u201d Kano said of the evacuation plan, because all of Japan would be in danger if Okinawa is dragged into fighting. \u201cI just hope the money will be spent on policies that will help the people in Yonaguni live peacefully.\u201d",

      "A report by the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog says Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium as tensions between Tehran and Washington rise after the election of U.S. President Donald Trump",
      "VIENNA -- Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium as tensions between Tehran and Washington rise after the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, a report by the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog seen by The Associated Press on Wednesday showed.",
      "The report by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said that as of Feb. 8, Iran has 274.8 kilograms (605.8 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%. That\u2019s an increase of 92.5 kilograms (203.9 pounds) since the IAEA\u2019s last report in November.",
      "That material is a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.",
      "A report in November 2024 put the stockpile at 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds). It had 164.7 kilograms (363.1 pounds) last August.",
      "\u201cThe significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium by Iran, the only non-nuclear weapon State to produce such nuclear material, is of serious concern,\u201d the confidential report stated. According to the IAEA, approximately 42 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium is theoretically enough to produce one atomic bomb, if enriched further to 90%.",
      "The IAEA also estimated in its quarterly report that as of Feb. 8, Iran\u2019s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds), which represents an increase of 1,690.0 kilograms (3725.8 pounds) since the last report in November.",
      "During his first presidential term, Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers and reimposed sanctions on Iran. He also ordered the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force.",
      "Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make \u201cseveral\u201d nuclear bombs if it chose to do so.",
      "Iranian officials have increasingly suggested Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb. U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has \u201cundertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.\u201d",
      "Iran\u2019s accelerated production of near weapons-grade uranium puts more pressure on Trump as he\u2019s repeatedly said he\u2019s open to negotiations with the Islamic Republic while also increasingly targeting Iran\u2019s oil sales with sanctions as part of his reimposed \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy.",
      "Even Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, in a speech in August opened the door to talks with the U.S., saying there is \u201cno harm\u201d in engaging with the \u201cenemy.\u201d",
      "More recently, he tempered that, saying that negotiations with America \u201care not intelligent, wise or honorable\u201d after Trump floated nuclear talks with Tehran.",
      "The IAEA already warned last December that Iran was poised to \u201cquite dramatically\u201d increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium as it has started operating cascades of advanced centrifuges.",
      "That move came as a response to the Board of Governors at the IAEA passing a resolution condemning Iran for failing to cooperate fully with the agency. In the past, Iran has repeatedly responded to resolutions by the IAEA Board of Governors by further enhancing its nuclear program.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s report also said that Iran has also not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to ban some of the agency\u2019s most experienced inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program.",
      "\u201cThe Director General deeply regrets that Iran, despite having indicated a willingness to consider accepting the designation of four additional experienced Agency inspectors, did not accept their designations,\u201d the report said.",

      "LONDON -- Prime Minister Keir Starmer committed to raise U.K. defense spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2027, saying Tuesday that Europe is in a new era of insecurity.",
      "The U.K. currently spends 2.3% of gross domestic product on defense, and the government had previously set a 2.5% target, without setting a date.",
      "Starmer told lawmakers that the increase amounts to an additional 13.4 billion pounds ($17 billion) a year. He said the goal is for defense spending to rise to 3% of GDP by 2035.",
      "To pay for it, overseas development aid will be slashed from 0.5% to 0.3% of national income, he said.",

      "The scale of the power outage appeared to take authorities off guard. The government declared a state of emergency alongside a mandatory nighttime curfew that will last until 6 a.m. Wednesday.",
      "\u201cOur first concern, and the reason for this announcement, is to ensure people\u2019s safety,\u201d Interior Minister Carolina Toh\u00e1 said in announcing the exceptional measures. The ministry deployed thousands of soldiers across the country to help maintain order and enforce the curfew.",

      "But the lights \u2014 and, on a hot summer night in the Southern Hemisphere, the air conditioning and fans that keep people cool \u2014 began to return in spurts seven hours after the electric failure first struck. Cheers rung out on the streets where lights flickered back on.",
      "At around 11 p.m., power was restored to around half of the 8 million affected households, said President Gabriel Boric.",

The conflict has been marked by atrocities including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the U.N. and rights groups. The International Criminal Court is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "Aid groups have made pleas for access for months in Zamzam and elsewhere, with little success. The U.N.\u2019s top humanitarian official in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, has accused the RSF of preventing life-saving aid from reaching many in Darfur. The RSF and allied militias control most of that region."

      "Apple shareholders rebuffed an attempt to pressure the technology trendsetter into joining President Donald Trump's push to scrub corporate programs designed to diversify its workforce.",
      "The proposal drafted by the National Center for Public Policy Research \u2014 a self-described conservative think tank \u2014 urged Apple to follow a litany of high-profile companies that have retreated from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently in the Trump administration's crosshairs.",
      "After a brief presentation about the anti-DEI proposal, Apple announced shareholders had rejected it without disclosing the vote tally. The preliminary results will be outlined in a regulatory later Tuesday.",
      "The shareholder vote came a month after the same group presented a similar proposal during Costco's annual meeting, only to have it overwhelmingly rejected. A similar outcome is expected during Apple's annual meeting despite the vocal objections of critics.",
      "Just as Costco does, Apple has steadfastly stood behind diversity and inclusion efforts that its management contends make good business sense.",
      "But the National Center for Public Policy Research's proposal has attacked Apple's diversity commitments for being out of line with recent court rulings and said the programs expose the Cupertino, California, company to an onslaught of potential lawsuits for alleged discrimination. The group estimated about 50,000 Apple employees could file cases against Apple without detailing how it arrived at that figure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\u201d the National Center for Public Policy Research says in its proposal.",
      "The specter of potential legal trouble was magnified last week when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a federal lawsuit against Target alleging the retailer's recently scaled-back DEI program alienated many consumers and undercut sales to the detriment of shareholders.",
      "In its rebuttal to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple said its program is an integral part of a culture that has helped elevate the company to its current market value of $3.7 trillion \u2014 greater than any other business in the world.",
      "\u201cWe believe that how we conduct ourselves is as critical to Apple\u2019s success as making the best products in the world,\u201d the company said in its statement against the proposal. \u201cWe seek to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "In its last diversity and inclusion report issued in 2022, Apple disclosed that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees. Nearly two-thirds of its employees were men.",
      "Other major technology companies for years have reported employing mostly white and Asian men, especially in high-paid engineering jobs \u2014 a tendency that spurred the industry to pursue what have been largely unsuccessful efforts to diversify.",

      "The price of bitcoin fell below $90,000 and other cryptocurrencies saw large drops Tuesday morning, erasing some of the gains digital assets have made since President Donald Trump took office on a pro-crypto agenda.",
      "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, was trading at about $89,000 as the U.S. stock market opened. That\u2019s down from about $106,000, which was the price around Trump\u2019s inauguration. The decline in bitcoin and other crypto assets accelerated after a report showed a bigger-than-expected drop in consumer confidence for this month.",
      "Cryptocurrency is highly volatile, and prices can change rapidly. Even with Tuesday's drop, bitcoin is still up significantly since Trump won last year's election. Supporters said the price drops represent a good investment opportunity.",
      "\u201cBuy the dips!!!\u201d Eric Trump, the president\u2019s son, said on the social media platform X. He replaced the letter B with the symbol for bitcoin.",
      "It\u2019s been a mixed bag for the cryptocurrency industry in recent weeks. The president and pro-crypto members of Congress have promised to usher in a golden age for the industry and pledged quick action to craft friendly regulations. And in recent weeks, regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission have signaled plans to drop enforcement actions against key industry players, like Coinbase and Robinhood.",
      "But a large hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange -- one of the biggest thefts of all time -- and a major scandal involving the president of Argentina and a meme coin have highlighted some of the vulnerabilities in a relatively still nascent industry.",
      "Last week the Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit announced it was a victim of a sophisticated hack that stole about $1.5 billion worth of digital currency. A number of security researchers believe North Korea, which authorities have blamed for several other major crypto hacks, was behind the theft.",
      "Argentine President Javier Milei is facing a corruption probe into his promotion of a meme coin, called LIBRA, whose price soared then quickly crashed after Milei posted about it on X. Milei has distanced himself from the meme coin and denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Meme coins are a highly speculative form of cryptocurrency that are mostly minted as jokes and have no intrinsic value but can sometimes soar in price.",
      "One of the crypto developers involved in the LIBRA coin said meme coins are essentially a rigged game that benefits a small group of people at the expense of retail investors in a recent interview with an independent journalist.",
      "That developer, Hayden Davis, also revealed he was involved in the launch of First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s meme coin just before her husband took office. The Melania meme coin was trading at about 90 cents on Tuesday, down from more than $13 when it first launched. The president also helped launch a meme coin just before he took office that\u2019s seen a similar price trajectory.",
      "Solana, a major cryptocurrency that\u2019s a key player in the meme coin ecosystem, has seen its price roughly cut in half since Trump\u2019s inauguration."

    "story": [
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson will try against the odds to muscle a Republican budget blueprint to passage this week",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson will try against the odds to muscle a Republican budget blueprint to passage this week, a step toward delivering President Donald Trump's \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d with $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $2 trillion in spending cuts over stiff opposition from Democrats \u2014 and even some Republicans.",
      "With almost no votes to spare in Johnson's bare-bones GOP majority, the speaker is fighting on all fronts \u2014 against Democrats, uneasy rank-and-file Republicans and skeptical GOP senators \u2014 as he works to keep the package on track. Votes set for Tuesday evening are in jeopardy, and the outcome is uncertain.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to get everyone there,\u201d Johnson, of Louisiana, said at an event at the start of the week, half-joking that he had a \u201cprayer request\u201d involved.",
      "The package, if approved, would be a crucial part of the budget process as Trump pushes the Republicans who control Congress to approve a massive bill that would extend tax breaks, which he secured during his first term but are expiring later this year, while also cutting spending across federal programs and services.",
      "But Republicans are running into a familiar problem: Slashing federal spending is typically easier said than done. With cuts to the Pentagon and other programs largely off limits, much of the other government outlays go for health care, food stamps, student loans and programs relied on by their constituents.",
      "It's all unfolding as billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk is tearing through federal agencies with his Department of Government Efficiency firing thousands of workers nationwide, and angry voters are starting to confront lawmakers at town hall meetings back home.",
      "\u201cWhile we fully support efforts to rein in wasteful spending and deliver on President Trump's agenda, it is imperative that we do not slash programs that support American communities across our nation,\u201d wrote Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, and several other GOP lawmakers in the Congressional Hispanic Conference.",
      "Democrats in the House and the Senate are vowing to fight the whole process. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York was planning to gather lawmakers on the Capitol steps in protest during Tuesday\u2019s session.",
      "\u201cThis is not what people want,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., during a rules debate ahead of planned votes.",
      "\u201cWe all know that trickle-down economics,\u201d he said about the 2017 tax breaks that flowed mainly to the wealthy, \u201cdon\u2019t work.\u201d",
      "Trump has signaled a preference for the \u201cbig\u201d bill but also appears to enjoy a competition between the House and the Senate, lawmakers said, as he pits the Republicans against each other to see which version will emerge on a path toward approval.",
      "Senate Republicans, wary that Johnson can lift his bill over the finish line, launched their own scaled-back $340 billion package last week. It\u2019s focused on sending Trump money his administration needs for its deportation and border security agenda now, with plans to tackle the tax cuts separately later this year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m holding my breath. I\u2019m crossing my fingers,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who said he is rooting for the House's approach as the better option. \"I think a one-shot is their best opportunity.\u201d",
      "Johnson, whose party lost seats in last November\u2019s election, commands one of the thinnest majorities in modern history, which means he must keep almost every Republican in line or risk losing the vote.",
      "Already, several lawmakers have objected to the package either because it cuts too much or because it doesn't cut enough.",
      "The most conservative Republicans warn it will pile onto the nation\u2019s $36 trillion debt load, because the cost of the tax breaks, at least $4.5 trillion over the decade, outweighs the $2 trillion in spending cuts to government programs.",
      "More moderate Republican lawmakers worry that the enormous budget cuts being eyed \u2014 some $880 billion to the committee that handles health care spending, including Medicaid, for example, or $230 billion to the agriculture committee that funds food stamps \u2014 will be too harmful to their constituents back home.",
      "GOP leaders are trying to convince lawmakers that the details will be debated in the weeks to come and that this week's vote is just a first step.",
      "The budget is being compiled during a lengthy process that first sends instructions to the various House and Senate committees, which will then have several weeks to devise more detailed plans for additional debate and votes.",
      "\u201cThe committees need time to go work to find savings,\" said Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La. \"But we can\u2019t even get to that if we don\u2019t get through the budget. So, we\u2019ve got to get the first step done later this week.\u201d",
      "Ten House GOP chairmen of the committees involved issued a joint statement in a show of force to push the package forward.",
      "\u201cThe House\u2019s \u2018one big beautiful bill\u2019 delivers on the entirety of President Trump\u2019s policy agenda,\u201d they wrote in a letter obtained by The Associated Press. \u201cWe must meet this historic moment with the bold action it requires.\u201d",
      "Rep. Jodey Arrington, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, told reporters he recognizes the tension between Republicans who want more cuts and those from politically competitive districts who \u201chave a higher level of sensitivity to some of the spending reforms.\"",
      "Arrington said with economic growth assumptions, from 1.8% as projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to 2.6% as projected by House Republicans, the package would generate about $2.6 trillion in savings over 10 years and would ensure the plan helps reduce the deficit.",
      "Some fiscal advocacy groups view the GOP\u2019s economic projections as overly optimistic.",

      "The company, which sells servers used in AI and other computing, had delayed filing its annual report and other required forms after its former accounting firm raised concerns about some of its financial reporting and governance. Super Micro then had to get extensions from Nasdaq to file the financial reports as it conducted a review and hired another public accounting firm.",

      "It will be the first earnings report for the company and its CEO, Jensen Huang, since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, upended the AI industry by saying it developed a large language model that can compete with big U.S. rivals without having to use the most expensive chips. That called into question all the spending Wall Street had assumed would go into not only Nvidia\u2019s chips but also the ecosystem that\u2019s built around the AI boom, including electricity to power large data centers.",

      "NRG Energy jumped 10.3% Wednesday after announcing it's joining with GE Vernova and a subsidiary of Kiewit on a venture to generate more electricity to power generative AI data centers. GE Vernova rose 6.5%.",

      "The lawsuit stems from protests in 2016 and 2017 against the Dakota Access oil pipeline and its controversial Missouri River crossing upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation.

    "story": [
      "The White House says its officials \"will determine\" which news outlets cover President Donald Trump",
      "The White House said Tuesday that its officials \u201cwill determine\u201d which news outlets can regularly cover President Donald Trump up close \u2014 a sharp break from a century of tradition in which a pool of independently chosen news organizations go where the chief executive does and hold him accountable on behalf of regular Americans.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the changes would rotate traditional outlets from the group and include some streaming services. Leavitt cast the change as a modernization of the press pool, saying the move would be more inclusive and restore \u201caccess back to the American people\u201d who elected Trump. But media experts said the move raised troubling First Amendment issues because the president is choosing who covers him.",
      "\"The White House press team, in this administration, will determine who gets to enjoy the very privileged and limited access in spaces such as Air Force One and the Oval Office,\" Leavitt said at a daily briefing. She added at another point: \u201cA select group of D.C.-based journalists should no longer have a monopoly of press access at the White House.\u201d",
      "Leavitt said the White House will \u201cdouble down\u201d on its decision to bar The Associated Press from many presidential events, a departure from the time-tested and sometimes contentious practice for more than a century of a pool of journalists from every platform sharing the presidents' words and activities with news outlets and congressional offices that can't attend the close-quarter events. Traditionally, the members of the pool decide who goes in small spaces such as the Oval Office and Air Force One.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s beyond time that the White House press operation reflects the media habits of the American people in 2025, not 1925,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "The change said one expert on presidents and the press, \u201cis a dangerous move for democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201dIt means the president can pick and choose who covers the executive branch, ignoring the fact that it is the American people who through their taxes pay for the running of the White House, the president\u2019s travels and the press secretary\u2019s salary,\u201d Jon Marshall, a media history professor at Northwestern University and author of \u201cClash: Presidents and the Press in Times of Crisis.\u201d",
      "Eugene Daniels, president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, said the organization consistently expands its membership and pool rotations to facilitate the inclusion of new and emerging outlets.",
      "\u201cThis move tears at the independence of a free press in the United States. It suggests the government will choose the journalists who cover the president,\u201d Daniels said in a statement. \u201cIn a free country, leaders must not be able to choose their own press corps.\"",
      "Leavitt spoke a day after a federal judge refused to immediately order the White House to restore the AP's access to many presidential events. The news outlet, citing the First Amendment, sued Leavitt and two other White House officials for barring the AP from some presidential events over its refusal to call the Gulf of Mexico the \u201cGulf of America\u201d as Trump ordered. AP has said its style would retain the \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d name but also would note Trump's decision.",
      "U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden said said the AP had not demonstrated it had suffered irreparable harm. But he urged the Trump administration to reconsider its two-week-old ban, saying that case law in the circuit \u201cis uniformly unhelpful to the White House.\u201d",
      "McFadden\u2019s decision was only for the moment, however. He told attorneys for the Trump administration and the AP that the issue required more exploration before ruling. Another hearing was scheduled for late March.",
      "The AP Stylebook is used by international audiences as well as those within the United States. The AP has said that its guidance was offered to promote clarity.",
      "Another Trump executive order to change the name of the United States\u2019 largest mountain back to Mount McKinley from Denali is being recognized by the AP Stylebook. Trump has the authority to do so because the mountain is completely within the country he oversees, AP has said."

      "Some of the humidors on display at this year's fair resembled iconic buildings, adorned with Cuban flags, intricate train designs, or striking abstract patterns. One particularly eye-catching humidor emulated a shark\u2019s fin, soaring over a meter in height. Innovation was also evident, with features like remote-controlled trunks and hidden compartments.",

      "The deal gives the government an increasing share of diamond sales through the Debswana company \u2014 its joint venture with De Beers, a subsidiary of Anglo American.",
      "Botswana, a sparsely populated and arid country in southern Africa, is the biggest producer of diamonds by value and the second biggest by volume behind Russia. Diamonds account for around 80% of Botswana's exports and a quarter of its GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund.",
      "But a decline in the price and demand for mined diamonds has badly hampered the Botswana economy and was a central issue in a national election last year. The party that had ruled for 58 years since independence from the British was voted out in a stunning result that was largely a reaction to new economic hardships related to the downturn in the diamond industry.",

      "Finance Secretary Paul Chan said during a budget speech that there would be a \u201ccumulative reduction\u201d of government recurrent expenditure by 7% from now until 2027-2028. Hong Kong\u2019s deficit had reached $87.2 billion Hong Kong dollars ($11.2 billion) for the financial year of 2024-2025, making it the third straight year of losses.",
      "\u201cIt gives us a clear pathway towards the goal of restoring fiscal balance,\u201d Chan said.",
      "He said 10,000 civil servant posts would be cut by April 2027, representing a reduction of about 2% of the civil service in each of the next two years. Salaries will also be frozen in the civil service this year.",
      "Chan also said that up to $195 billion Hong Kong dollars ($25 billion) worth of bonds will also be issued in the next five years to ensure progress of important infrastructure projects, with more than half used to refinance sort-term debt.",
      "To boost income, Hong Kong will also raise its airport departure tax from 120 Hong Kong dollars ($15.50) to 200 Hong Kong dollars ($25.70) from the third quarter of the year, representing a 67% increase.",

      "The caramel brown liquid, red-and-white soda cans and splashy big font bear remarkable resemblance to an iconic American soft drink",
      "SALFIT, West Bank -- Order a Coke to wash down some hummus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank these days and chances are the waiter will shake his head disapprovingly \u2014 or worse, mutter \u201cshame, shame\u201d in Arabic \u2014 before suggesting the popular local alternative: a can of Chat Cola.",
      "Chat Cola \u2014 its red tin and sweeping white script bearing remarkable resemblance to the iconic American soft drink's logo \u2014 has seen its products explode in popularity across the occupied West Bank in the past year as Palestinian consumers, angry at America\u2019s steadfast support for Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza, protest with their pocketbooks.",
      "\u201cNo one wants to be caught drinking Coke,\u201d said Mad Asaad, 21, a worker at the bakery-cafe chain Croissant House in the West Bank city of Ramallah, which stopped selling Coke after the war erupted. \u201cEveryone drinks Chat now. It\u2019s sending a message.\u201d",
      "Since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered Israel's devastating military campaign in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian-led boycott movement against companies perceived as supportive of Israel gained momentum across the Middle East, where the usual American corporate targets like McDonald\u2019s, KFC and Starbucks saw sales slide last year.",
      "Here in the West Bank, the boycott has shuttered two KFC branches in Ramallah. But the most noticeable expression of consumer outrage has been the sudden ubiquity of Chat Cola as shopkeepers relegate Coke cans to the bottom shelf \u2014 or pull them altogether.",
      "\u201cWhen people started to boycott, they became aware that Chat existed,\u201d Fahed Arar, general manager of Chat Cola, told The Associated Press from the giant red-painted factory, nestled in the hilly West Bank town of Salfit. \u201cI'm proud to have created a product that matches that of a global company.\"",
      "With the \u201cbuy local\u201d movement burgeoning during the war, Chat Cola said its sales in the West Bank surged more than 40% last year, compared to 2023.",
      "While the companies said they had no available statistics on their command of the local market due to the difficulties of data collection in wartime, anecdotal evidence suggests Chat Cola is clawing at some of Coca-Cola\u2019s market share.",
      "\u201cChat used to be a specialty product, but from what we\u2019ve seen, it dominates the market,\u201d said Abdulqader Azeez Hassan, 25, the owner of a supermarket in Salfit that boasts fridges full of the fizzy drinks.",
      "But workers at Coca-Cola's franchise in the West Bank, the National Beverage Company, are all Palestinian, and a boycott affects them, too, said its general manager, Imad Hindi.",
      "He declined to elaborate on the business impact of the boycott, suggesting it can't be untangled from the effects of the West Bank's economic free-fall and intensified Israeli security controls that have multiplied shipping times and costs for Palestinian companies during the war.",
      "The Coca-Cola Company did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Whether or not the movement brings lasting consequences, it does reflect an upsurge of political consciousness, said Salah Hussein, head of the Ramallah Chamber of Commerce.",
      "\u201cIt's the first time we've ever seen a boycott to this extent,\u201d Hussein said, noting how institutions like the prominent Birzeit University near Ramallah canceled their Coke orders. \u201cAfter Oct. 7, everything changed. And after Trump, everything will continue to change.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s call for the mass expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, which he rephrased last week as a recommendation, has further inflamed anti-American sentiment around the region.",
      "With orders pouring in not only from Lebanon and Yemen but also the United States and Europe, the company has its sights set on the international market, said PR manager Ahmad Hammad.",
      "Hired to help Chat Cola cash in on combustible emotions created by the war, Hammad has rebranded what began in 2019 as a niche mom-and-pop operation.",
      "\u201cWe had to take advantage of the opportunity,\u201d he said of the company's new \u201cPalestinian taste\u201d logo and national flag-hued merchandise.",
      "In its scramble to satisfy demand, Chat Cola is opening a second production site in neighboring Jordan. It rolled out new candy-colored flavors, like blueberry, strawberry and green apple.",
      "At the steamy plant in Salfit, recent college graduates in lab coats said that they took pains to produce a carbonated beverage that could sell on its taste, not just a customer\u2019s sense of solidarity with the Palestinians.",
      "\u201cQuality has been a problem with local Palestinian products before,\u201d said Hanna al-Ahmad, 32, the head of quality control for Chat Cola, shouting to be heard over the whir of machines squirting caramel-colored elixir into scores of small cans that then whizzed down assembly lines. \u201cIf it\u2019s not good quality, the boycott won\u2019t stick.\"",
      "Chat Cola worked with chemists in France to produce the flavor, which is almost indistinguishable from Coke\u2019s \u2014 just like its packaging. That's the case for several flavors: Squint at Chat's lemon-lime soda and you might mistake it for a can of Sprite.",
      "In 2020, the Ramallah-based National Beverage Company sued Chat Cola for copyright infringement in Palestinian court, contending that Chat had imitated Coke's designs for multiple drinks. The court ultimately sided with Chat Cola, determining there were enough subtle differences in the can designs that it didn't violate copyright law.",
      "In the Salfit warehouse, drivers loaded \u201cfamily size\u201d packages of soda into trucks bound not only for the West Bank but also for Tel Aviv, Haifa and other cities in Israel. Staffers said that Chat soda sales in Israel's predominantly Arab cities jumped 25% last year. To broaden its appeal in Israel, Chat Cola secured kosher certification after a Jewish rabbi's thorough inspection of the facility.",
      "Still, critics of the Palestinians-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, or BDS, say that its main objective \u2014 to isolate Israel economically for its occupation of Palestinian lands \u2014 only exacerbates the conflict.",
      "\u201cBDS and similar actions drive communities apart, they don\u2019t help to bring people together,\u201d said Vlad Khaykin, the executive vice president of social impact and partnerships in North America for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization. \u201cThe kind of rhetoric being embraced by the BDS movement to justify the boycott of Israel is really quite dangerous.\u201d",
      "While Chat Cola goes out of its way to avoid buying from Israel \u2014 sourcing ingredients and materials from France, Italy and Kuwait \u2014 it can't avoid the circumstances of Israeli occupation, in which Israel dominates the Palestinian economy, controls borders, imports and more.",
      "Deliveries of raw materials to Chat Cola\u2019s West Bank factory get hit with a 35% import tax \u2014 half of which Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinians. The general manager, Arar, said his company's success depends far more on Israeli bureaucratic goodwill than nationalist fervor.",
      "For nearly a month last fall, Israeli authorities detained Chat's aluminum shipments from Jordan at the Allenby Bridge Crossing, forcing part of the factory to shut down and costing the company tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "Among the local buyers left in the lurch was Croissant House in Ramallah, where, on a recent afternoon, at least one thirsty customer, confronting a nearly empty refrigerator, slipped to the supermarket next-door for a can of Coke.",
      "\u201cIt's very frustrating,\u201d said Asaad, the worker. \u201cWe want to be self-sufficient. But we're not.\u201d"

      "British energy company BP has confirmed it is to slash spending on green ventures and up its oil and gas production",
      "LONDON -- British energy company BP confirmed Wednesday that it would slash spending on green ventures and increase its oil and gas production, a change in direction that it hopes will bolster its flagging share price but has been met with incredulity from climate action campaigners.",
      "In a statement titled \u201cReset BP,\u201d the company said it will reduce its spending on net zero transition businesses by $5 billion a year to up to 2 billion. By contrast, it said it would increase its investments in oil and gas production by about 20% to $10 billion.",
      "CEO Murray Auchincloss said that the company is focusing its spending on BP\u2019s \u201chighest-returning businesses to drive growth\" and that will be \u201cvery selective\" in its investments in renewables.",
      "\u201cThis is a reset BP, with an unwavering focus on growing long-term shareholder value,\" he said.",
      "The strategy represents a pullback from the company's much-vaunted plan five years ago, under then CEO Bernard Looney, to shrink oil and gas production in favor of net zero businesses.",
      "The update, which came before a major shareholder meeting in London later Wednesday, is clearly aimed at bolstering investor support in light of the company's flagging share price.",
      "So far, the heavily-trailed update doesn't appear to have appealed to investors, and the company's share price was down 0.8%. However, the stock has been rallying in recent weeks on speculation that the company was about to change tack.",
      "The company's stock underperformance against its peers such as Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron, has stoked market speculation that it may move its share listing to New York from London, or even make it a takeover target.",
      "The influential U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management recently took a nearly 5% stake in BP, and it is believed that it has sought to push BP back towards fossil fuels to boost profit.",
      "Auchincloss has already spun off BP\u2019s offshore wind business in a joint venture while he's looking to offload its onshore wind arm. The group has also been slashing costs in the face of tougher trading. Recently, it announced it would cut more than 5% of its workforce.",
      "BP's change of strategy is facing sharp criticism from environmental campaigners, who had previously warmed to the company's insistence that the future was green.",
      "\u201cThis move by oil giant BP clearly demonstrates why super-rich corporations and individuals, chasing short-term profit for themselves and shareholders, cannot be trusted with fixing the climate crisis or leading the transition to renewable energy we so badly need,\" said Matilda Borgstr\u00f6m, U.K. campaigner at climate action group, 350.org.",
      "\u201cPumping money into more oil and gas increases the risk of climate impacts for us all, flies in the face of legal climate targets, and with the renewables sector growing exponentially is a big risk to the shareholders that BP is so keen to please,\u201d she added."

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has already made the U.S. an even friendlier environment for fossil fuels. Congress is helping, too, with the House set to vote on a measure to repeal a Biden administration-era methane fee on oil and gas producers.",
      "Here are some ways the Trump administration has done so:",
      "The Biden administration last year paused evaluations of new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals. That pleased environmentalists concerned that a big surge in exports would contribute to planet-warming emissions. The pause didn't stop projects already under construction, but it delayed consideration of new projects.",
      "Trump reversed that pause.",
      "On Tuesday, oil and gas giant Shell said global LNG demand is forecast to rise by around 60% by 2040.",
      "The United States is expected to play a major role in meeting that demand, with its export capacity expected to double before 2030, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "\u201cI think investors have become much more comfortable that they can move towards final investment decisions without the concerns that they had over the last four years about potential roadblocks,\u201d said Christopher Treanor, an energy and environmental attorney at the law firm Akin.",
      "Trump has opened more land for oil and gas lease sales, shifting away from Biden's efforts to protect environmentally sensitive areas like Alaska\u2019s National Wildlife Refuge and to prevent large swaths of ocean from being available for offshore drilling, including major areas off coasts in the Pacific, Atlantic and parts of Alaska.",
      "Environmental groups are suing to stop Trump's moves.",
      "Expanding the area available for companies to lease and drill doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that more oil and gas will be produced. When leases were made available in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge, for example, only smaller companies bid and there were no buyers for a second lease sale.",
      "The Army Corps of Engineers marked hundreds of Clean Water Act permits for fast-tracking, citing Trump\u2019s order on energy, then removed that notation in its database. The agency said it needed to review active permit applications before publishing which ones will be fast-tracked.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to be backing off,\" said Tom Pelton, spokesman with the Environmental Integrity Project. \u201cThey are just going to refine the list.\u201d",
      "Many of the permit applications that had been listed for expediting are for fossil fuel projects, but some others have nothing to do with energy, including a housing subdivision proposed by Chevron in southern California, according to the Environmental Integrity Project.",
      "David Bookbinder, the organization\u2019s director of law and policy, said the Trump administration is using the \u201cpretext of a national energy emergency\u201d to ask a federal agency to circumvent environmental protections to justify building more fossil fuel power plants. Bookbinder said there\u2019s no shortage of energy.",
      "Pat Parenteau, professor emeritus at Vermont Law & Graduate School, said Trump's policy changes aren't nearly as important as the deep cuts to the federal government that eliminate vital expertise.",
      "\u201cI think they are going to accomplish what no other administration has been able to do in terms of crippling the institutional capacity of the federal government to protect public health, to conserve national resources to save endangered species,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is where we are going to see long-term, permanent damage.\u201d",
      "Trump's energy emergency calls, for example, for undermining Endangered Species Act protections to ensure fast energy development, even assembling a rarely used committee \u2014 the so-called \u201cGod Squad\u201d \u2014 that could have authority to dismiss significant threats to species. That move was coupled with recent deep cuts to the Fish & Wildlife Service, which administers the law.",
      "Parenteau said some species are likely to go extinct.",
      "Trump also targeted wind energy with an order to temporarily halt offshore wind lease sales in federal waters and pause federal approvals, permits and loans for projects both onshore and offshore.",
      "In another order, he listed domestic energy resources that could help ensure a reliable, diversified and affordable supply of energy. Solar, wind and battery storage were omitted, though solar is the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in the United States. Trump has vowed to end tax credits for renewables as well, which would push up prices.",
      "Substantially slowing renewables could leave the U.S. wedded to coal and gas for far longer as coal plants are extended and new gas plants are built, said David Shepheard, partner and energy expert at the global consultant Baringa.",
      "Shepheard said the U.S. is facing unprecedented growth in electricity demand largely to meet needs from data centers and artificial intelligence, and increasingly the deck is stacked against renewables to meet it.",
      "A Baringa analysis found Trump\u2019s policies will drive up emissions and put the agreed-upon international climate threshold further out of reach.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Dockworkers on the U.S. East and Gulf coasts overwhelmingly approved a six-year contract Tuesday, averting the threat of a strike that could have crippled the economy.",
      "The yes vote was expected after the leadership of the International Longshoremen's Association union reached a tentative contract agreement in January with the U.S. Maritime Alliance of ports and shipping companies.",
      "The alliance approved the contract last month, and on Tuesday rank-and-file members voted for it with nearly 99 percent in favor, the union said in a statement.",
      "The contract calls for a 62% pay hike over six years that would lift hourly wages at the top of the union pay scale from $39 an hour to $63 an hour.",
      "ILA President Harold Daggett, who served as the union\u2019s chief negotiator, was quoted in the statement as saying the agreement is \u201cthe \u2018gold standard\u2019 for dockworker unions globally.\u201d",
      "He remarked that it was a difficult contract to negotiate and even required a three-day strike last fall, but \u201cWe now have labor peace for the next six years.\u201d",
      "The union and the alliance also reached a truce on the most contentious labor issue on America's docks: automation. The union worries that machines \u2014 especially semi-automated cranes \u2014 will replace human workers. Port operators and shipping companies argue that U.S. ports are falling behind more automated ones such as those in Rotterdam, Dubai and Singapore.",
      "The new contract gives ports more leeway to introduce modernizing technology. But they have to hire new workers when they do, and full automation is off the table.",
      "\u201cThe pending contract opens the door a little more for advanced technology and automation,\u201d Brian Lynch, leader of the transportation sector at the consulting firm EY Americas, said before the vote. \u201cThe door\u2019s cracked a bit.\u201d",
      "The union went on the three-day strike in October but suspended it to allow for more talks. A prolonged shutdown at 14 ports stretching from Boston to Houston could have delayed shipments to American factories and retailers and driven up costs.",
      "The two sides are expected to meet the week of March 10 to sign the agreement, after which it would go into effect.",
      "Before his inauguration, President Donald Trump voiced support for the union. Claiming to \u201cknow just about everything there is to know\u201d about automation, Trump wrote on social media, \u201cThe amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt, and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen.\u201d"

The public hears about a nursing shortage and thinks there are not enough nurses or people who want to become nurses, but the problem is more complicated than that, she says.",
      "While nurses are the largest group of health care professionals and the backbone of health care, their contributions are frequently undervalued by health care systems, and many are underpaid and experience a higher rate of burnout than other medical professionals, according to Aiken and other nursing experts.",
      "Many more people want to become nurses than there are spots available in nursing schools because there are not enough nursing professors. As a result, nursing schools can accept few of the students who apply.",
      "In 2022, roughly 78,000 qualified applicants were not accepted to U.S. nursing schools because of insufficient faculty, classrooms and lab space, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. There are also about 2,000 full-time nursing faculty vacancies at U.S. nursing schools, says Katie Fioravanti, director of the foundation arm of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.",
      "\u201cAttracting people to teach nursing is challenging because they can make considerably higher salaries in actual practice,\u201d Fioravanti says. \u201cBy the time they get a Ph.D. and go back to become a nursing faculty member or a dean, they\u2019re already in their 50s, and that means they retire sooner.\u201d",
      "The Conways didn\u2019t know much about nursing when they decided to donate to the field. With the help of a colleague whose wife was a nurse, the couple began learning about the profession and university nursing programs.",
      "They first gave money to support tuition at nursing schools, largely at the behest of Joanne Conway, a onetime scholarship student, and because her husband wanted to ensure students graduated without the burden of college debt.",
      "\u201cI wanted them to be free to be the kind of nurse they wanted to be,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they wanted to work in an inner-city clinic and not make too much money or if they wanted to work someplace where they were going to make a lot of money, I wanted them to do what they wanted.\u201d",
      "Gradually, Conway supported building projects that expanded classroom and lab space, the hiring of additional faculty, and scholarships for nurses seeking advanced degrees to teach.",
      "His giving process has mostly stayed the same. When Conway is considering a first-time gift, he and the head of his Bedford Falls Foundation, Elizabeth Carrott Minnigh, visit nursing schools, meet with deans and ask for data related to graduation rates and nursing licenses.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking to see if it\u2019s going to be a partnership where we could fund a reasonably large number of students who would actually get to the finish line without debt that will cripple them in their career choices and opportunities,\u201d Carrott Minnigh says.",
      "Conway and Carrott Minnigh then visit the schools regularly to talk to deans, faculty and students about any challenges they might be facing. These conversations have often translated into more targeted grants.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a one-size-fits-all grant-making process,\u201d Carrott Minnigh says. \u201cIt\u2019s all customized to what we hear at the schools about what they want and need.\u201d",
      "For example, in 2013, the Conways gave $4 million to Catholic University\u2019s nursing school. Since then, their giving to the institution \u2014 now named the Conway School of Nursing \u2014 has grown to more than $64 million, expanding full scholarships, largely paying for a new nursing school building and backing graduate nursing programs. The Conways also have supported mentoring efforts and a review course to prepare students for the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses.",
      "\u201cCalling his donations transformational is not saying enough,\u201d says Marie Nolan, dean of Catholic\u2019s nursing school.",
      "Over the past decade, Conway has also significantly funded the University of Virginia\u2019s nursing school. In 2013, he gave $5 million for nursing scholarships and over time has donated nearly $50 million to expand scholarships for undergraduate and graduate nursing programs, support nurses who want to become professors, and help people pivot into nursing.",
      "UVA\u2019s nursing school\u2019s dean, Marianne Baernholdt, says Conway\u2019s extensive giving to nursing programs, and particularly his efforts to help nursing students early in their education, is rare among wealthy donors.",
      "\u201cThere are a couple of nursing schools that got big sums to increase their advanced practice nursing programs,\u201d Baernholdt says. \u201cBut very few invest in pre-licensure, which is what the Conways have done.\u201d",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration says an American Airlines plane arriving at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport discontinued its landing, performing a go-around to avoid getting too close to another aircraft departing from the same runway",
      "ARLINGTON, Va. -- An American Airlines plane arriving at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport discontinued its landing, performing a go-around at an air traffic controller\u2019s instruction to avoid getting too close to another aircraft departing from the same runway, the Federal Aviation Administration said.",
      "The maneuver involving American Flight 2246 from Boston occurred around 8:20 a.m. Tuesday, less than two hours before another plane attempting to land at Chicago\u2019s Midway Airport was forced to climb back into the sky to avoid another aircraft crossing the runway. Southwest said Flight 2504 from Omaha, Nebraska, safely landed \u201cafter the crew performed a precautionary go-around to avoid a possible conflict with another aircraft that entered the runway,\u201d an airline spokesperson said in an email. \u201cThe crew followed safety procedures and the flight landed without incident.\u201d",
      "The American flight \u201clanded safely and normally\u201d at National Airport after air traffic control instructed pilots to complete a go-around \u201cto allow another aircraft more time for takeoff,\u201d American Airlines said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAmerican has a no-fault go-around policy as a go-around is not an abnormal flight maneuver and can occur nearly every day in the National Airspace System,\u201d the airline said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tool in both the pilot\u2019s and air traffic controller\u2019s toolbox to help maintain safe and efficient flight operations.\u201d",
      "The past few weeks have seen four major aviation disasters in North America. They include the Feb. 6 crash of a commuter plane in Alaska that killed all 10 people on board and the Jan. 26 midair collision between an Army helicopter and an American Airlines flight at National Airport that killed all 67 aboard the two aircraft.",
      "A medical transport jet with a child patient, her mother and four others aboard crashed Jan. 31 into a Philadelphia neighborhood. That crash killed seven people, including all those aboard, and injured 19 others.",

    "summary": "Ludvig Aberg and Brian Campbell don't have much in common except winning on the PGA Tour",
    "story": [
      "Ludvig Aberg and Brian Campbell don't have much in common except winning on the PGA Tour",
      "One week the PGA Tour winner was Ludvig Aberg, a Swede so supremely talented that he played in a Ryder Cup before his first major, entered the top 10 in the world ranking just nine months after he left college and has been there ever since.",
      "The next week it was Brian Campbell, a 31-year-old who averaged $7,999 for the 186 tournaments he played over the last decade \u2014 one full year on the PGA Tour, the rest on the Korn Ferry Tour \u2014 before winning the Mexico Open. That was worth $1,260,000.",
      "Golf needs them both.",
      "Stars are what fuel interest. The PGA Tour gets a boost from these 72-man signature events with $20 million purses because they tend to deliver big names and often big moments. Scottie Scheffler has won four of them over the last two years. Rory McIlroy has won twice.",
      "There also has been some discussion over the last 25 years \u2014 dating to the World Golf Championships \u2014 that smaller fields make it easier to win no matter how stacked they are. But the signature events have not disappointed.",
      "Campbell, however, was a reminder that anyone can win on any given week. He had never won, not in his short time on the PGA Tour or what seemed like an eternity on the Korn Ferry Tour. That's one of the great charms about golf and always will be.",
      "His victory also showed those longshot moments still exist, even as the PGA Tour moves to reduce the number of full cards from 125 to 100 this year, and starts reducing the size of fields next year, including the elimination of some Monday qualifiers.",
      "Yes, the numbers are shrinking, but the opportunity is there.",
      "Meritocracy has not left the building.",
      "Campbell had a career season on the Korn Ferry Tour last year with three runner-up finishes to finish No. 8 on the points list and earn a ticket back to the big leagues. That gave him access to tournaments like the Mexico Open, where the final hour was no less compelling than when Aberg tracked down Maverick McNealy at Torrey Pines.",
      "An otherwise sleepy week at the Mexico Open \u2014 only two players from the top 30, four from the top 50 in the world \u2014 produced a duel over the final hour that was fun to watch considering what was at stake.",
      "There was Aldrich Potgieter, full of promise and power, a 20-year-old South African who won the British Amateur at the age of 17 and last year became the youngest Korn Ferry Tour winner. He's only getting started, and he simply smashes it off the tee.",
      "Potgieter led the field at Vidanta Vallarta by averaging 324.7 yards for all his measured drives, nine of them at 350 yards or longer.",
      "Campbell couldn't keep up with that \u2014 he was on average 39 yards shorter off the tee \u2014 and he didn't try. He spent the weekend alongside Potgieter and never flinched. He played with what he had, and it was enough.",
      "Both felt the nerves of trying to win their first PGA Tour title.",
      "\u201cI thought I was going to throw up at multiple times during the day,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "\u201cPressure is a big thing. You can't really beat it, you just have to learn and adjust to it next time you're in this position,\u201d Potgieter said.",
      "The playoff was as fickle as golf gets. Potgieter twice pounded drives into the fairway on the par-5 18th holes, leaving him only a 6-iron to the green. Both times he could only manage par.",
      "Campbell pushed his drive so badly on the second playoff hole that it was sailing out-of-bounds until it crashed into the trees and caromed back into play. He was on hardpan, 94 yards behind Potgieter. He ripped a 3-wood back into position and hit lob wedge 3 1/2 feet from the hole.",
      "Potgieter missed his birdie putt from 6 feet. Campbell made his for the win, and the shock of it all didn't wear off for some time, especially after his girlfriend, Kelsi, just about tackled him on the 18th green and he swung her around in pure joy.",
      "\u201cI'm literally freaking out on the inside,\u201d Campbell told NBC when he regained his footing. \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "Here's what is going on. Campbell is headed to The Players Championship to compete for a $25 million purse. Then he has the Masters, and the PGA Championship. Along the way, he'll be in five of the $20 million signature events left on the PGA Tour schedule.",
      "Everyone expects Aberg or McIlroy or Scheffler or a dozen other stars to win. Not many knew anything about Campbell, who became a PGA Tour footnote as the last person assessed a penalty for slow play for two bad times in 2017 in New Orleans.",
      "(That was a weird one, the first year the Zurich Classic went to two-man teams. Campbell and teammate Miguel Angel Carballo each got a bad time, and because it was foursomes, they counted as one competitor).",
      "Now he's a PGA Tour winner, a feel-good story, just like Rafael Campos last year when he arrived in Bermuda two hours before his tee time because his wife had just given birth to their first child. In danger of losing his card, he won for the first time.",
      "They don't move the needle. That doesn't mean there's no room for them in this sport.",
      "The PGA Tour hopes to be stronger by rewarding the top performers and by reducing jobs and field sizes. That's harsh for those who don't make it, but they have no excuses as long as they have a tee time \u2014 whether that's in signature events, regular events or opposite-field events, or even if they have to go back to the Korn Ferry Tour or Q-school.",
      "No one ever wants to hear the solution is to play better, either because they have heard it for too long or they know it's true.",
      "A leaner tour \u2014 fewer cards, smaller fields \u2014 eliminates those who don't perform. That was Campbell in 2017 and for the next seven years in the minor leagues.",
      "And now he's going to the Masters.",

      "Vanderbilt freshman Mikayla Blakes knows each time she drops the ball in the basket it will bring more attention",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Vanderbilt freshman Mikayla Blakes knows each time she drops the ball in the basket it will bring more attention.",
      "That's what happens when someone scores 53 points, then sets the NCAA freshman single-game scoring record with 55 just 17 days later.",
      "\u201cEverybody wants to stop you now,\" Blakes said about being a bigger target for opponent's scouting plans. \u201cSo I think just continuing to keep going and continue to keep working on my weaknesses and turn them into strengths is definitely going to help me.\u201d",
      "Blakes has scored at least 30 points in five games, tied for fourth-most by any NCAA Division I player this season and most among freshmen. She ranks second in the Southeastern Conference averaging 23.3 points a game.",
      "South Carolina coach Dawn Staley called Blakes special after her No. 6 Gamecocks held the freshman to 19 points last weekend. Blakes got only two in the fourth quarter as the Gamecocks made Blakes work hard on both ends of the court.",
      "\u201cTo come in our league and to have done what she\u2019s done, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a bigger offensive impact,\" Staley said. \"I mean, she\u2019s very, very efficient.\u201d",
      "Blakes already is in exclusive company.",
      "Her 55 points are the ninth most scored in NCAA history. She also joined Patricia Hoskins of Mississippi Valley State as the only players to score 53 or more points twice in the same season. Blakes scored 53 on Jan. 30 in a win at Florida.",
      "With Vanderbilt trailing by 15 with 6:55 left at Auburn, even her brother Jaylen watching on TV thought that game was over. Then she took over, scoring 30 of her 55 points over the final 10 minutes, 25 seconds of regulation and overtime in the victory.",
      "Blakes also went 23 of 24 at the line. She knocked down down her first 23 attempts on her way to the single-game scoring record first set by Elena Delle Donne with 54 as a redshirt freshman at Delaware in a 2010 loss to James Madison.",
      "It's just not about the points. Her brother knows only too well the sister he worked out with and played 1-on-1 with couldn't let the Commodores lose.",
      "\u201cShe hates losing,\" Jaylen said. \"At the end of the day, she hates losing more than she loves winning and for her, that was the most important thing, I think. Obviously the 55 was great, but she was so happy about just winning that game.\u201d",
      "Tara VanDerveer tried to get Blakes to play at Stanford: \u201cShe\u2019s fantastic. She\u2019s a star. She\u2019s awesome.\u201d",
      "The now retired Hall of Fame coach called it disappointing not to get the 2024 McDonald's All-American from Somerset, New Jersey. VanDerveer said she's mad that Jaylen came to Stanford as a graduate transfer this season from Duke and didn't bring his sister with him.",
      "Joking aside, VanDerveer said she loves the Blakes family and called Mikayla a great student and that she is really happy for the 5-foot-8 freshman.",
      "\"She\u2019s doing really well,\u201d VanDerveer said.",
      "Everybody wanted Blakes. Stanford, UCLA, Tennessee, Indiana, Wisconsin and Rutgers were among those recruiting her. Shea Ralph convinced Blakes to become her highest-rated recruit yet for the coach's fourth season at Vanderbilt.",
      "Jaylen, who joined the family on some Zoom calls as coaches pitched away, knows why Mikayla chose a program with only one Final Four berth way back in 1993 and now is on the verge of a second straight NCAA Tournament berth after a 10-year drought.",
      "\u201cShe was just about building something,\u201d Jaylen said.",
      "Thanks to Stanford playing on Wednesdays and Saturdays and the Vanderbilt women on Thursdays and Sundays, the Blakes siblings are able to keep up with each other's games.",
      "In that comeback against Auburn, Mikayla Blakes joined LeBron James as the only basketball players to score 55 or more points playing every second of a game since 2005 whether at the NBA, WNBA, NCAA men or women's basketball level.",
      "She also earned both the SEC player and freshman of the week, something not done in this league since Candace Parker in 2006.",
      "Ralph said while Blakes has not been a secret for a long time now, she liked how the point guard played against South Carolina. Ralph is focused on making sure her freshman doesn't have to score 50 to win as the Commodores host Texas A&M on Thursday night in their final home game of the regular season.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s done it in moments where we\u2019ve really needed it,\" Ralph said. \u201cBut she also has to get a little bit of help.\u201d",

      "Pass rusher Abdul Carter says he should be the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NFL draft",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Former Penn State star Abdul Carter made one thing clear Wednesday: He should be the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NFL draft.",
      "Carter was in the first group of players to speak with reporters at the NFL's annual scouting combine in Indianapolis, and he wasted no time declaring himself the top player in the 2025 draft class.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m the best player in the country and the best player should be picked first,\" he said. \"It\u2019s the work I put in with my dad, who trained me, and all the sacrifices I made, I know I\u2019m the best.\u201d",
      "Of course, such pronouncements have come to be expected during combine week.",
      "Still, Carter certainly has a case after finishing last season with 68 tackles, a Football Bowl Subdivision-leading 23 1/2 tackles for loss and 12 sacks to finish seventh nationally.",
      "He was the Big Ten's top defensive player in 2024 and finished his three-year career with 39 1/2 tackles for loss, 23 sacks and 14 passes defensed.",
      "The question is whether the 6-foot-3, 259-pound Carter is a better fit at defensive end or outside linebacker. Either way, he's likely to be the first or second defensive player selected April 24 in Green Bay, Wisconsin.",
      "Going No. 1 overall remains a challenge, though.",
      "Since 2007 only three defensive players have been chosen No. 1 overall \u2014 Jadeveon Clowney in 2014, Myles Garrett in 2017 and Travon Walker in 2022. Each was chosen primarily because of their pass-rushing ability.",
      "And leapfrogging the top two quarterbacks, Cam Ward of Miami and Shedeur Sanders of Colorado, or Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter could prove difficult.",
      "\u201cI think quarterbacks have kind of a lock on that or maybe a great pass rusher,\u201d Cincinnati Bengals director of player personnel Duke Tobin said Tuesday when asked about a non-quarterback being the top overall selection. \u201cOr maybe a guy that plays six positions like the one from my alma mater. We\u2019ll see.\u201d",
      "Tobin, who attended Colorado, was referring to Hunter, who is listed as a cornerback but hopes to also play receiver in the NFL as he did in college.",
      "Yet Carter believes he can defy the odds and become the third Penn State player to hear his name called first on draft weekend. Tennessee holds the No. 1 overall pick.",
      "\"Defensive players impact the game just as much as the quarterback,\u201d the 21-year-old Carter said. \u201cAll the teams that have won Super Bowls, they have that one standout player. I feel like I\u2019m that.\u201d",

      "The 76ers are a team in trouble",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Yes, the Philadelphia 76ers played without two-time NBA scoring champion and the always-injured Joel Embiid. Yes, they haven't been a playoff contender this season, even with two other All-Stars in the starting lineup.",
      "Yet, there it was, on the scoreboard, on all the social media derision, on the top of the implausibility-meter when the 76ers broke camp for the Bahamas.",
      "That was no misprint on the ticker in the fourth quarter: Bulls 136, 76ers 86.",
      "Down 50!",
      "Did the Sixers quit? Do the Sixers realize \u2014 with or without whatever Embiid and his balky left knee can give them \u2014 their season is over?",
      "\u201cI don't want to believe that,\u201d nine-time All-Star Paul George said. \u201cI don't sense that in the locker room and I don't believe that.\u201d",
      "George has little choice publicly but to stand by the Sixers, even as they lost their eighth straight game and 10th of 11 overall \u2014 142-110 on Monday nigh t to the 23-win Chicago Bulls \u2014 and see even the odds of a play-in tournament berth dip to the point where fans are already looking at next season.",
      "Not that it promises anything better than the mess that's unraveled in South Philly this year.",
      "\u201cI'm not quite sure what fell apart to give up 140 points, at home, against the Chicago Bulls,\u201d George said.",
      "The real bad news \u2014 you know, before six Bulls scored at least 15 points \u2014 came hours ahead of this debacle when the Sixers offered no real update on Embiid. Embiid missed his 38th game of the season for the sagging Sixers, and all options \u2014 from rest to potential surgery to playing through pain \u2014 remain on the table, depending on the results of continued testing and imaging.",
      "Embiid has played in just 19 of 57 games for the Sixers, who fell to 20-37 an have only a faint shot at earning a berth in the NBA play-in tournament. Embiid has averaged 23.8 points \u2014 he averaged at least 30 and won two scoring titles the last three seasons \u2014 and scored only 29 points combined in his last two games.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody envisioned it going like this,\u201d coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing on a lot of levels. He wants to play. We want him to play. Our best version is of with him playing. It hasn\u2019t worked out like that. Yet.\u201d",
      "The 76ers are a franchise in turmoil and suffering through an internal tug-of-war when it comes to Embiid. Can he play through the pain and should he, even with the woeful record? Why not just shut him down and try again next year?",
      "Even George \u2014 who left the Los Angeles Clippers to sign a four-year, $212 million free-agent contract \u2014 conceded the juice might not be worth the squeeze when it comes to a potential Embiid return. The 76ers are one of the worst teams in the league and are trending closer to Toronto, Charlotte, Washington and a lottery pick than making a serious run in the postseason.",
      "Maybe sitting Embiid is for the best \u2014 just as it was seemingly was early in the Process.",
      "The 76ers\u2019 first-round pick is top-six protected or else it goes to the Oklahoma City Thunder, perhaps one more reason the Sixers could shut down Embiid and cut their losses on the season.",
      "\u201cWe're showing no signs of a team that will compete,\u201d George said. \u201cWe just don't have the habits of a championship or a playoff-contending team would have. To be honest, right now, it's a little farfetched. All we can do is work hard. Try to just keep going for one another. We've shown no signs of, forget championship, but a playoff contending-team here.\u201d",
      "Does Nurse survive and earn a third season on the bench?",
      "What about team president Daryl Morey, who built this mishmashed roster full of patchwork free-agents and needlessly gave Embiid a three-year, $193 million contract extension ahead of training camp.",
      "Just as former Eagles running back Ricky Watters once said: For who? For what?",
      "\u201cWe've got to be more dialed in. More effort. More energy,\" George said. \"More pride on the defensive end. Again, same conversations we've been having. Low communication. It baffles me just how easy we give up layups in this league. I don't understand.\u201d",
      "Join the club.",
      "So where is the next win on the schedule? Wednesday night against a Knicks team winning at a 65% clip at Madison Square Garden? Against Steph Curry and the Warriors?",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a vision, but we have a lot of games left,\u201d 2024 All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey said.",
      "Not really. Certainly not enough to make anyone who watched a 1-9 February \u2014 and has four of 20 wins against Charlotte \u2014 believe the season can be saved. The 76ers are only 7-8 this season when Embiid, George and Maxey start together.",
      "\u201cEverybody needs to look at themselves, at what they can do better, and then look at what they can do better for the team. And do our jobs, man. Be professional,\u201d Nurse said.",

      "Travis Hunter arrived at the NFL's annual scouting combine with a Heisman Trophy resume, an invitation to work out at two positions and ready to answer any and all questions",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Travis Hunter arrived at the NFL's annual scouting combine with a Heisman Trophy resume, an invitation to work out at two positions and ready to answer all doubters.",
      "The former Colorado star already appears to have completed one task this week in Indianapolis \u2014 convincing coaches and general managers he can become the league's first true two-way player in decades, and maybe even play special teams, too.",
      "Hunter is more than a just a curiosity now.",
      "\"What do you do with a player like him? And where do you first start him? And where does he help you on all sides of the ball?\" Tennessee coach Brian Callahan said. \u201cHe can return punts. He\u2019s got a really unique skill set. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s many players you can compare him to.\u201d",
      "Sure, some players have been featured in special packages on both sides of the ball. Some of the most prominent names on that list include Mike Vrabel and Troy Brown of the New England Patriots, William \u201cThe Refrigerator\u201d Perry of the Chicago Bears and Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders, whose most productive offensive season came as a receiver with the Dallas Cowboys in 1996.",
      "Most consider Hall of Famer Chuck Bednarik the last true two-way star. He started at linebacker and along the offensive line for the Philadelphia Eagles from 1949 to 1962.",
      "The closest contender to Bednarik probably would be either Sanders or Roy Green, who was drafted as a safety, caught 33 passes while playing both ways in 1981 and then led the league with 1,555 yards receiving in 1984.",
      "But unlike 1997 Heisman winner Charles Woodson, the only other defensive player to win college football's most prestigious award, it appears nothing is out of Hunter's reach.",
      "\u201cHe can be whatever he wants to be, he's that talented,\u201d Denver Broncos general manager George Paton said. \u201cWe're still working through it, you know, but I think he's going to play on both sides of the ball. I'll just leave it at that.\u201d",
      "Hunter certainly thrived in both spots in college, first at Jackson State in Mississippi before following his coach, Sanders, to Boulder, Colorado. In his final two college seasons, Hunter had 153 receptions, 1,979 yards, 20 TDs, broke up 11 passes and had four interceptions.",
      "Combine organizers gave Hunter a defensive backs T-shirt, partly because it gives him the option of doing on-field drills with the defense Friday and offense Saturday \u2014 if he chooses.",
      "The first indication he'll do either, or both, could come Thursday when he's scheduled to speak with reporters.",
      "Sanders is already lobbying publicly for his star player, urging any team that doesn't intend to use Hunter as a cornerback and as a receiver to pass on drafting him.",
      "Yet most executives who fielded questions Tuesday seem to concur with Sanders' assessment that Hunter can excel at both, even if they believe he should start at cornerback as a rookie.",
      "\u201cTravis is obviously an exceptional talent. He can do it all, that\u2019s no secret,\u201d Carolina Panthers coach Dan Morgan said. \"Yes, he can play both sides of the ball. That\u2019s up to the team to decide that, whatever team that drafts him.\u201d",
      "One lingering question is how many snaps can Hunter be expected to play at the pro level without declining production?",
      "He held up relatively well at Colorado, where he logged roughly 2,500 snaps between 2023 and 2024. But he'll be facing bigger, stronger, faster opponents in the NFL, plus a more physical style, a 17-game regular season and even more games if his team makes the playoffs.",
      "Few would argue Hunter is the best athlete in this year's draft or a legitimate top-five talent, but everyone is trying to figure out just how high someone with Hunter's talent will go in a draft where quarterbacks tend to be the first pick, the second pick and last year the top three picks.",
      "That could the case again with Tennessee, Cleveland and the New York Giants holding the top three selections with each presumably looking for new franchise quarterbacks.",
      "\u201cI think quarterbacks have kind of a lock on that or maybe a great pass rusher,\u201d Cincinnati Bengals general manager Duke Tobin said when asked about a non-quarterback being the top overall selection. \u201cOr maybe a guy that plays six positions like the one from my alma mater (Colorado). We'll see.\u201d",
      "But with third-year quarterback Will Levis still on the Titans roster, Callahan and general manager Mike Borgonzi aren't ruling out anything. Even taking Hunter, who could fill two holes in their rebuilding effort.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a special player,\u201d Borgonzi said. \u201cWe were watching him, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anybody that\u2019s actually done what he\u2019s done in modern-day football, playing both offense and defense during the course of a season. He\u2019s definitely a special player.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words, it really is, what this means. When someone\u2019s defined the game, when someone\u2019s had such an impact on so many people and so many places. You can\u2019t define it with a quote,\u201d UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. \u201cIt\u2019s a life that is a novel, it\u2019s a movie, it\u2019s a miniseries, it\u2019s a saga. It\u2019s the life of an extraordinary person who, I think, had as much to do with changing women\u2019s basketball as anyone who\u2019s ever played the game.\u201d",

Her name is synonymous with the Phoenix Mercury and she will forever be part of our family.\u201d",
      "Taurasi made the all-WNBA first team 10 times and was on the first or second team a record 14 times. She's also an 11-time WNBA All-Star, four-time USA Basketball female athlete of the year and was the 2004 WNBA rookie of the year.",

      "Australia's sports minister, Anika Wells, described the comments as \u201cboorish, boring, wrong\" and soccer's national players' union said \u201cit is important such ignorance does not go unchecked.\u201d",
      "The \u201ccomments were disgusting, pathetic and deeply misogynistic, showing a complete lack of respect for women\u2019s sport and football as a whole,\u201d Professional Footballers Australia chief executive Beau Busch said. \u201cThe Matildas have inspired countless Australians as players and fans. To diminish their achievements \u2014 or women\u2019s sport more broadly \u2014 is not just insulting but shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the importance of our sport in this country.\u201d",
      "The Triple M network said the comments didn't \u201calign with (its) views and values\u201d and took the program off air. It said a new drive show would be announced soon. Sheargold also issued an apology.",
      "\"Any comedy, including mine, can miss the mark sometimes, and I can see why people may have taken offense at my comments regarding the Matildas. I sincerely apologize,\u201d Sheargold said.",

      "The NBA is on the cusp of accomplishing something that it hasn\u2019t seen before",
      "The NBA is on the cusp of accomplishing something that it hasn't seen before. The jury's still out on whether it's a good thing.",
      "With about seven weeks left in the season, 2-point shots are accounting for 49% of scoring. And if that stat holds up \u2014 there's no indication that it won't \u2014 this will be the first season in which 2-pointers make up less than half of the league's point production.",
      "The current breakdown: a record-low 49% of scoring comes from 2-pointers, a record-high 36% comes from 3-pointers, and a near-record-low 15% comes from the foul line. Those numbers are just more proof of how the 3-point shot continues permeating the game, and that's why plenty of people are wondering aloud if the league has a real problem on its hands.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have any problem with guys and teams shooting a lot of 3s,\u201d said Golden State's Stephen Curry, the league's all-time leader in 3-pointers and someone closing in on 4,000 such makes for his regular-season career. \u201cObviously, that\u2019s the way that I play, and I love that factor in the game. But you\u2019ve also got to put the work in behind the scenes to take full advantage of it.\u201d",
      "This isn't a new phenomenon.",
      "Barring some sort of major shift in how the game is played over the next seven weeks, the league is on pace to break the record for 3-pointers in a season (it\u2019ll be the 15th consecutive season in which the 3s-per-game record falls) and 3-pointers attempted in a season (a new mark will be set there for the 19th time in the last 22 seasons).",
      "Boston is leading the 3-point assault this year, though the Celtics are hardly the only 3-happy team. But the defending NBA champions are clearly more reliant on the shot than anyone else, with 46% of their points this season coming from beyond the arc. They'll almost certainly become only the third team in NBA history to finish a season with more points from 3s than 2s, joining the 2018-19 Houston Rockets and 2020-21 Utah Jazz.",
      "\u201cEverybody can\u2019t play the same way,\" Celtics All-Star forward and two-time Olympic gold medalist Jayson Tatum said. \"You've got to have the right personnel. But, you know, the way we play works for us. So, we play to our strengths.\u201d",
      "The Celtics are the only franchise in NBA history to have eight different players make 100 3s in a season; they've done it in each of the last two seasons and are on pace to do it again this year. For them, the 3-pointer is the golden ticket; they're 33-6 this season when they make at least 17 3s, and just 8-10 when they don't make that many.",
      "They had five 3-point shooters on the floor together last season and the result was an NBA championship. It was, at times, impossible to guard. Golden State rode the brilliance of Curry and Klay Thompson to four NBA titles in their years as the Warriors' \u201cSplash Brothers,\" a duo that helped usher in a new era of 3-point reliance. And the math is simple: shooting 40% on 3s gets you more points per attempt than shooting 50% on 2s does.",
      "\u201cRight now, I think the defense has to catch up and maybe NBA teams will shoot less 3s,\u201d San Antonio star Victor Wembanyama said at the All-Star break, before he was shut down for the year with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder. \u201cBut analytics back it up, so it makes sense.\u201d",
      "Wembanyama was averaging 8.8 3-point tries per game this season, the most of any center in the league, and his 403 attempts on the season from beyond the arc is still more entering this week than some of the game's best shooters \u2014 a list of players that includes Phoenix's Devin Booker, the Los Angeles Lakers' Austin Reaves and Miami's Duncan Robinson.",
      "But the numbers say it's a good shot. So, Wembanyama took them. A lot of them. The Spurs, for years, were a team that didn't prioritize the 3-pointer. And now, it's a weapon for them and everyone else in the league.",
      "\u201cThe game has evolved,\u201d said Golden State coach Steve Kerr, an elite shooter in his playing days.",
      "It keeps evolving. Commissioner Adam Silver said earlier this month that he listened to an off-the-record conversation between Kerr and broadcaster Bob Costas at the tech summit during All-Star weekend, the keynote address of sorts for those who were invited to that event. Silver later shared that Kerr conceded there may be a bit too much 3-point shooting in today's NBA, but that he liked the current state of the game and wouldn't recommend any changes.",
      "Silver thinks it's all cyclical. He said when the All-Star weekend last came to the Bay Area in 2000, \u201cmany people were saying it was too physical, we were too dependent on the dunk, that players weren\u2019t sufficiently skilled as they were than in the old days.\u201d",
      "It's all very different now.",
      "\u201cThe fact now that you can\u2019t play in this league unless you can shoot, that even 7-footers have to be able to shoot these days and have to be able to shoot at long range, I actually think that\u2019s a beautiful thing,\u201d Silver said.",

      "Auriemma is the winningest coach in women's basketball history, leading UConn to 11 national championships, and has won an NCAA record 1,239 games in his 40 years at the school. Off the court, the Huskies boast a perfect 100% graduation rate among his four-year players.",
      "The Hall of Fame coach has a long-standing bond with Martelli back to when Auriemma was an assistant coach for him at Bishop Kenrick High School. Martelli recommended Auriemma for an assistant position at Virginia with Debbie Ryan, a job he held before getting the UConn position in 1986.",
      "Martelli led Saint Joseph's for 24 seasons as the head coach, guiding the Hawks to seven NCAA Tournament appearances. His 2004 team made the Elite Eight after going undefeated in the regular season. Martelli's squad lost in the conference tournament to Xavier and then was beaten by Oklahoma State in the East Regional Final. He was the AP Coach of the Year that season and won 444 games in his career.",
      "Steratore was a Division I men's basketball official from 1997-2018, working in the Big East, Big Ten and Atlantic 10 conferences. He also worked two Sweet 16 games in the NCAA Tournament. Steratore also has been on CBS broadcasts during March Madness providing rule explanations. It's a role he's also done in the NFL. Steratore was an NFL official for 15 seasons.",
      "McLaughlin served as Fordham's athletic director from 1985-2012 before being promoted to the role of associate vice president of student affairs for athletic alumni relations and external affairs/athletic director emeritus. He retired in 2023.",
      "Before becoming an AD, McLaughlin was a college coach, leading the Harvard men's basketball team from 1977-85. The team went 15-9 in his final year there.",
      "This is the 17th year the award will be presented to those who have shown the character traits of Lapchick, who coached at St. John\u2019s and with the New York Knicks. The quartet will be honored at a luncheon on Sept. 19 in New York.",

      "LAUSANNE, Switzerland -- The International Olympic Committee has taken a key step toward retaining boxing on the program for the Los Angeles Games in 2028 as it recognized a new governing body for the sport.",
      "The IOC board granted provisional recognition Wednesday to World Boxing, a group which was founded in 2023 as a breakaway from the long-established but troubled International Boxing Association, and has picked up many former IBA members.",
      "The IOC said that World Boxing showed that 62% of boxers from last year's Paris Olympics were affiliated with its members. The IOC added that World Boxing \u201chas demonstrated strong willingness and effort in enhancing good governance and implementation, to be compliant with the appropriate standards.\u201d",
      "Former boxing great Gennady Golovkin, who heads the commission tasked with establishing World Boxing as a credible body to run Olympic bouts, said it was an important moment but much work remained.",
      "\u201cReceiving provisional Olympic recognition from the IOC is an important achievement and demonstrates that our sport is on the right path. This decision brings us one step closer to our main goal - preserving boxing at the Olympic Games,\" Golovkin said in a statement.",
      "The IOC suspended the IBA in 2019 following long-running disputes over governance, its finances and the integrity of bouts and judging, and took the rare step of banishing it from the Olympic movement entirely in 2023, shortly after the World Boxing breakaway.",
      "The IOC organized the boxing tournaments itself at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and the Paris Games last year but said it needed a new partner in time for 2028.",
      "Since it was suspended, the IBA and its Russian president Umar Kremlev have continued to feud with the IOC, particularly over the rules on eligiblity for women's boxing at the Paris Olympics, with a focus on gold medalists Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting.

The British driver joined Ferrari last month and will line up in the 2025 season alongside Leclerc, who has been at Ferrari since 2019.",

      "Apple announced Monday that it plans to invest more than $500 billion in the United States over the next four years, including plans to hire 20,000 people and build a new server factory in Texas",
      "NEW YORK -- Apple announced Monday that it plans to invest more than $500 billion in the United States over the next four years, including plans to hire 20,000 people and build a new server factory in Texas.",
      "The move comes just days after President Donald Trump said Apple CEO Tim Cook promised him that the tech giant\u2019s manufacturing would shift from Mexico to the U.S. Trump noted the company was doing so to avoid paying tariffs. That pledge, coupled with Monday's investment commitment, came as Trump continues to threaten to impose tariffs that could drive up the cost of iPhones made in China.",
      "\u201cWe are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we\u2019re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country\u2019s future,\u201d Cook said in a company blog post.",
      "Apple outlined several concrete moves in its announcement, the most significant of which is the construction of a new factory in Houston \u2014 slated to open in 2026 \u2014 that will produce servers to power Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI features. The company claims this factory will create \u201cthousands of jobs.\u201d",
      "The announcement is similar to one Apple made in early 2018 \u2014 during the first Trump administration \u2014 that promised to create 20,000 new jobs as part of a $350 billion spend in the U.S. Trump was also mulling a tariff then that could have affected iPhones at the time, but he didn't end up targeting those devices during his first administration."

      "Officials say a first-of-its-kind project will use a swarm of small, independent submersibles to monitor, protect and provide data on offshore artificial reefs whose purpose is to attract new marine life in otherwise barren sections of sea",
      "AYIA NAPA, Cyprus -- A first-of-its-kind project will use a swarm of small, independent submersibles to monitor, protect and provide data on offshore artificial reefs whose purpose is to attract new marine life in otherwise barren sections of sea, officials said Monday.",
      "The small, autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, hailed as the \u201cfuture of underwater surveillance\u201d will be equipped with sensors and high-definition cameras to give scientists at the Cyprus Marine and Maritime Institute a clear picture on the effectiveness of their intricate artificial reefs designed and built using 3D printing.",
      "Made of an environmentally friendly cement mixture, the artificial reefs will be embedded with a docking station at which the AUVs can recharge and transmit collected data including video, said CMMI CEO Zakarias Siokouros.",
      "The advantage of the AUVs lies in their ability to loiter underwater for as long as a month at a time and provide a continuous flow of data while \u201cprotecting\u201d the reefs by alerting scientists to any disturbance in protected waters from illegal fishing and encroaching boats. Scientists would, in turn, notify local authorities.",
      "A trial run of the project, dubbed EONIOS, is currently underway off Cyprus\u2019 Ayia Napa marina. Scientists plan to place the artificial reefs in waters off Cyprus\u2019 southern coastal town of Limassol at a depth of around 20 meters (66 feet) where sunlight can still reach the seabed.",
      "\u201cThe reefs attract everything from vegetation to large fish and for waters off Cyprus where there isn\u2019t enough food for fish, we aim to create the appropriate environment to bring such fish there,\u201d Siokouros told The Associated Press following a demonstration of the AUVs' capabilities at the Ayia Napa Marina.",
      "EONIOS is a partnership between the CMMI, AUV makers Arkeocean of France, Cypriot tech company SignalGeneriX and French consultancy company Lanego.",
      "Siokouros said the partnership aims to market EONIOS to other countries who would want to build up their fish stocks using artificial reefs.",
      "A key selling point for the AUVs is that they can provide surveillance, 3D data collection and area protection at a significant discount compared to tethered submersibles, said Arkeocean official Tamara Brizard.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to make a system under which six of our mini-drones can do the same work for the price of one conventional drone,\u201d Brizard said.",
      "Arkeocean AUVs can currently pack a maximum 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of sensors and other gear and can operate to a depth of 300 meters (984 feet) although newer versions are being designed to reach 3,000 meters (9,842 feet). The AUVs receive commands through an attached acoustic antenna and can pinpoint their location.",
      "Battery-powered thrusters make the AUVs very stealthy and nearly undetectable, Brizard said, making them extremely useful for defense purposes such as surveillance in restricted waters. The AUVs can operate anywhere in the world thanks to an Iridium satellite antenna.",
      "The AUVs can also use undersea currents to roam, extending battery life. Another application is in the energy field where the submersibles can be used to detect seismic activity for offshore oil and gas exploration as well as finding suitable areas on which to build offshore wind and solar farms, said Brizard."

    "story": [
      "A bill to ban the sale of so-called lab-grown meat might seem like a no-brainer in Nebraska, where beef is king",
      "LINCOLN, Neb. -- The prospect of banning the sale of so-called lab-grown meat might seem like a no-brainer in Nebraska, where beef is king, but some of the proposal's staunchest opposition has come from ranchers and farming groups who say they can compete without the government\u2019s help.",
      "Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen \u2014 one of the largest pork producers in the country \u2014 is behind the push to ban cultivated meat, saying he wants to protect ranchers and meat producers. The Republican governor signed an executive order last August to keep state agencies and contractors from procuring lab-created meat, even though it could be years before such products are on store shelves.",
      "A number of ranchers and meat industry groups are pushing back on the governor's plan.",
      "Dan Morgan is a fourth-generation cattle rancher from central Nebraska who supplies high-end beef to all 50 states and six countries. He welcomes companies seeking to produce lab-grown meat to \u201cjump into the pool\u201d and try to compete with his Waygu beef. Stifling competition in a free market should be anathema in a Republican-dominated state like Nebraska, he said.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a bunch of right-wing Republicans echoing a bunch of left-wing Democrats,\u201d he said, adding that the government should be limited to regulating the new product's labels and inspecting its facilities to ensure food safety.",
      "\u201cAfter that, it's up to the consumer to make the decision about what they buy and eat.\u201d",
      "Nebraska is among about a dozen states that have introduced measures to ban the manufacture, sale or distribution of lab-grown products, according to . Two states \u2014 Florida and Alabama \u2014 have already enacted such bans.",
      "The target of the bills is \u201ccell-cultivated\u201d or \u201ccell-cultured\u201d meat, which is grown from the cells of animals in bioreactor steel tanks. The cells are bathed for weeks in nutrients, prompting them to grow and divide, turning them into skeletal muscle, fat and connective tissues.",
      "The push to ban cultivated meat comes well before the innovation could be considered an industry. While more than two dozen companies are working to develop such meat products, only two \u2014 Upside Foods and Good Meat, both based in California \u2014 have been approved by the federal government to sell cultivated chicken in the U.S. Even then, none of the companies are close to mass producing and selling the products on store shelves.",
      "In recent weeks, supporters of the Nebraska bill have shifted their arguments from industry protection to questions of safety surrounding cell-cultured meat. That includes its sponsor, state Sen. Barry DeKay, a Nebraska rancher, and Sherry Vinton, the director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. Both testified in support of the bill at a committee hearing earlier this week, calling cultured meat \u201csynthetic food\u201d and voicing concern about possible health implications from eating it.",
      "But it's been no secret that the push for a ban is rooted in shielding Nebraska's traditional meat industry. Nebraska tops all other states for beef production and beef exports, according to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture.",
      "Pillen named the ban among his top priorities during his State of the State address last month.",
      "\u201cThe backers of these products are cut from the same cloth as the anti-farmer activists who want to put our agriculture producers out of business, and we need to recognize them as such,\u201d he said.",
      "The Association for Meat, Poultry and Seafood Innovation, the lobbying group for the emerging cultured meat industry, disputes Pillen's insistence that it's a threat to the traditional meat industry, noting studies that show global demand for meat-based protein will double by 2050.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really a complementary component here,\u201d said Suzi Gerber, executive director of the association. \u201cSo it\u2019s a little bit mystifying to me why any individual stakeholder would see this as a threat.\u201d",
      "Several farm organizations, including Nebraska Farm Bureau, Nebraska Cattlemen and the Nebraska Pork Producers, agree they're not worried about competition from the emerging industry. Those groups prefer a sister bill that would only require they be clearly labeled as lab-grown products to separate them from traditional meat. More than a dozen states have also issued similar labeling bills, and some \u2014 like Colorado \u2014 have seen ban efforts abandoned in favor of labeling measures.",
      "Paul Sherman is an attorney with the Institute for Justice, which is representing Upside Foods in its lawsuit challenging the Florida ban. He said it's no surprise most of the proposed bans are being pushed by those with connections to traditional agriculture.",
      "\u201cI think it certainly shows that the purpose of these laws isn\u2019t about protecting public health and safety,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about protecting traditional agriculture from economic competition. And that is not a legitimate use of government power.\u201d"

      "A new and massive study finds that climate change is melting the world\u2019s mountain glaciers faster than ever",
      "Climate change is accelerating the melting of the world's mountain glaciers, according to a massive new study that found them shrinking more than twice as fast as in the early 2000s.",
      "The world's glaciers lost ice at the rate of about 255 billion tons (231 billion metric tons) annual from 2000 to 2011, but that quickened to about 346 billion tons (314 billion metric tons) annually over about the next decade, according to the study in this week\u2019s journal Nature.",
      "And the last few years, the melt has accelerated even more, hitting a record 604 billion tons (548 billion metric tons) lost in 2023, the last year analyzed.",
      "The study drew on an international effort that included 233 estimates of changes in glacier weight. In all, the world's glaciers have lost more than 7 trillion tons of ice (6.5 trillion metric tons) since 2000, according to the study.",
      "\u201cThe thing that people should be aware of and perhaps worried about is that yes, the glaciers are indeed retreating and disappearing as we said they would. The rate of that loss seems to be accelerating,\u201d said William Colgan, a glaciologist for the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland and one of about 60 authors of the study.",
      "Glaciers in Alaska are melting at the fastest rate of any of the 19 regions studied, losing about 67 billion tons (61 billion metric tons) of ice a year, producing the biggest net ice loss, the study found.",
      "In the past 24 years, Central Europe\u2019s glaciers have lost the highest percentage of ice of any region, now 39% smaller than they were in 2000, the paper said. Colgan said he worries most about the Alps because \u201celevated summer temperatures have been hammering the Alps. \u201d",
      "Fifteen years ago, scientists were worried most about the Andes and the Patagonia glaciers, but the Alps have shrunk so fast they could eventually disappear, Colgan said.",
      "\u201cGlaciers are apolitical and unbiased sentinels of climate change, and their decline paints a clear picture of accelerated warming,\u201d said Gwenn Flowers, a professor of Earth Sciences at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who wasn't part of the study.",
      "University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos, who also wasn't part of the study, said glaciers shrank and grew in the past for local, well-understood reasons that were not climate change. What's happening now is different and clear, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s due to greenhouse gas increases caused directly by coal, oil, and natural gas burning. ... No amount of rhetoric, tweeting, or proclamation will change that.\u201d",
      "Scambos, Flowers and other outside scientists called the assessment sobering and accurate but not surprising.",
      "Colgan said that many places \u2014 such as those in the U.S. West \u2014 are seeing extra water now from fast-melting glaciers and benefiting from that boost, but that will soon disappear as the glaciers melt beyond a point of no return.",
      "Melting glaciers contribute more to sea level rise than ice loss in either Greenland or Antarctica. Only the expansion of water as it warms plays a bigger role in sea level rise, the paper said.",
      "The overall glacier loss rate is similar, if maybe slightly less, than that found by earlier and less comprehensive studies. But this new work will probably trigger new predictions that will be even gloomier in the future because of better information and worsening warming, Colgan said.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re losing 5.5% of the global ice volume in just over 20 years, clearly that\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cThat's going to catch up with you.\u201d",
      "The more than 600 billion tons of glacier loss in 2023 \u201csounds incredible now, but it might sound pretty normal in 10 years from now,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cMountain glaciers as a whole can flip into collective ice loss pretty darn quick.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration is investigating delays and cost overruns in California\u2019s high-speed rail project",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Trump administration is once again targeting California's controversial high-speed rail project, with federal transportation officials on Thursday announcing an investigation and possible withdrawal of about $4 billion in federal funding.",
      "Voters first approved $10 billion in bond money in 2008 for a project designed to shuttle riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles in less than three hours. It was slated to cost $33 billion and be finished by 2020. But the project has been beset by funding challenges, cost overruns and delays.",
      "Now, state officials are focused on a 171-mile (275-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced, which is set to be operating by 2033. The entire San Francisco to Los Angeles line will now cost an estimated $106 billion to finish and officials hope to complete it in the next 20 years if there is money.",
      "\u201cI am directing my staff to review and determine whether the (California High-Speed Rail Authority) has followed through on the commitments it made to receive billions of dollars in federal funding. If not, I will have to consider whether that money could be given to deserving infrastructure projects elsewhere in the United States,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a news conference in Los Angeles.",
      "President Donald Trump canceled nearly $1 billion in federal funding for the high-speed rail project in 2019, during his first term. The Biden administration later restored the funding and, in December 2023, allocated $3.3 billion more.",
      "Losing that money would be a major blow to the project. The rail authority's most recent business plan counts on receiving up to $8 billion in federal money to help close a funding gap.",
      "Ian Choudri, CEO of the California\u2019s High-Speed Rail Authority, which oversees planning and funding for the project, said he welcomes the investigation.",
      "\u201cWith multiple independent federal and state audits completed, every dollar is accounted for, and we stand by the progress and impact of this project,\u201d Choudri said.",
      "He said the project has created nearly 15,000 jobs and that more than 50 major structures have been completed so far.",
      "Several Republican Congress members have taken aim at the project over its costs. On Thursday, Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, who represents 3rd Congressional District that stretches alongside much of the state\u2019s border with Nevada and includes Sacramento\u2019s northeastern suburbs, called the California high-speed rail \u201cthe worst public infrastructure failure in U.S. history.\u201d",
      "\"There is no plausible scenario where the cost to federal or state taxpayers can be justified. It is past time to stop throwing good money after bad, and we must formally end this project,\u201d said Kiley, who introduced a bill earlier this year to make the project ineligible for further federal funding.",
      "Kiley joined Duffy in Los Angeles' Union Station for the announcement of the probe. Those present were interrupted at times by booing by about 30 demonstrators. The protesters also chanted \u201cbuild the rail!\u201d and held up signs that read \u201cCA has no king\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t delay our train.\u201d",
      "Eli Lipmen, executive director of Move LA, an organization that advocates for efficient public transit systems, said the high-speed train project remains popular among many Californians.",
      "\u201cThey said they\u2019re going to start an investigation, but come on, this is a sham investigation,\u201d Lipmen, who was at Union Station during the announcement, told KABC-TV.",
      "Greg Regan and Shari Semelsberger, president and secretary-treasurer of the Transportation Trades Department coalition that includes all the country's rail unions, said the project is the most ambitious and innovative transportation project in the country and urged Trump to become \u201ca Builder-in-Chief by bringing high-speed rail to America.\u201d",
      "\u201cBuilding ambitious projects requires bold leadership and a commitment to getting the job done. Just last year, President Trump complained that the United States does not have bullet trains similar to Japan. We agree with him that it is past time for our country to have these kinds of modern, efficient, high-capacity transportation systems,\" they said in a statement.",

      "SUSONO, Japan -- Woven City near Mount Fuji is where Japanese automaker Toyota plans to test everyday living with robotics, artificial intelligence and autonomous zero-emissions transportation.",
      "Daisuke Toyoda, an executive in charge of the project from the automaker's founding family, stressed it\u2019s not \u201ca smart city.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re making a test course for mobility so that\u2019s a little bit different. We\u2019re not a real estate developer,\u201d he said Saturday during a tour of the facility, where the first phase of construction was completed.",
      "The Associated Press was the first foreign media to get a preview of the $10 billion Woven City.",
      "The first phase spans 47,000 square meters (506,000 square feet), roughly the size of about five baseball fields. When completed, it will be 294,000 square meters (3.1 million square feet).",
      "Built on the grounds of a shuttered Toyota Motor Corp. auto plant, it\u2019s meant to be a place where researchers and startups come together to share ideas, according to Toyoda.",
      "Ambitious plans for futuristic cities have sputtered or are unfinished, including one proposed by Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet in Toronto; \u201cNeom\u201d in Saudi Arabia; a project near San Francisco, spearheaded by a former Goldman Sachs trader, and Masdar City next to Abu Dhabi\u2019s airport.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 15:04:59 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump hheld the first Cabinet meeting of his second term on Wednesday. In attendance was Elon Musk.",
    "story": [
      "Musk, wearing a black hat and coat, at times took the spotlight.",
      "President Donald Trump held the first Cabinet meeting of his second term on Wednesday and in the room, and at times taking center stage, was Elon Musk.",
      "For little more than an hour, Trump sought to tout his administration's work so far and fielded questions on everything from the status of Musk's efforts to force federal firings to negotiations to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Despite not being a member of the Cabinet, Musk has outsized influence in the administration as he oversees the Department of Government Efficiency's work to reduce the size and scope of the government.",
      "\"We put together a great Cabinet,\" Trump said as he began the meeting. \"And we've had tremendous success.\"",
      "Here are key takeaways from the gathering.",
      "Musk was the first to speak at the meeting after Trump's introduction. Donning a \"Tech Support\" t-shirt and a black \"Make America Great Again\" cap, Musk stood in the corner of the room to talk about DOGE.",
      "Musk defended the entity's controversial actions, saying the overall goal is to cut the deficit and warned if cuts aren't made the country will \"become de facto bankrupt.\"",
      "\"That's the reason I'm here. And taking a lot of flak, and getting a lot of death threats, by the way,\" he said.",
      "His presence among Trump's agency heads came amid confusion stemming from a Musk-directed ultimatum to federal workers to list their weekly accomplishments or possibly face termination. Senior White House officials were initially caught off guard, ABC News reported, when Musk first posted about the directive and it's since created tension among Cabinet members as multiple agency heads told employees to hold off on replying.",
      "When Musk was asked by a reporter if any Cabinet members were unhappy, Trump interrupted.",
      "\"Is anybody unhappy with Elon?\" Trump said to the group, many of whom started laughing.\"If you are, we'll throw him out of here. Is anybody unhappy? They have a lot of respect for Elon and that he's doing this,\" as members started applauding.",
      "Trump said federal employees who didn't respond to Musk's email are on a firing \"bubble.\"",
      "\"I'd like to add that those million people that haven't responded though Elon, they are on the bubble. You know, I wouldn't say that we're thrilled about it,\" Trump said. He went on to claim, without evidence, that maybe those employees \"don't exist.\"",
      "ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce asked Trump about his interest in doing another round of emails demanding federal workers' accomplishments and what the requirements would be.",
      "\"I think Elon wants to, and I think it's a good idea because, you know, those people, as I said before, they're on the bubble,\" he responded, emphasizing his desire to find out if workers exist,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump signaled the United States will not be providing much in security guarantees to Ukraine -- a key factor for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in any agreement to bring the conflict to a close.",
      "\"Well, I'm not going to make security guarantees beyond very much,\" Trump said. \"We're going to have Europe do that because it's in you know, we're talking about Europe is the next-door neighbor, but we're going to make sure everything goes well.\"",
      "Trump later said the mineral resources deal between the U.S. and Ukraine will be \"automatic security\" because the U.S. will be investing in the nation, suggesting that would be a barrier to Russia.",
      "\"Nobody's going to be messing around with people when we're there,\" Trump said. \"And so we'll be there in that way.\"",
      "After weeks of public statements on what Ukraine will likely have to sacrifice in negotiations, including their goal of returning to pre-war borders, Trump indicated for the first time that Russia's Vladimir Putin may have to make concessions.",
      "\"Yeah, he will. He's going to have to,\" Trump said of Putin.",
      "Notably, he did not elaborate on what those would be.",
      "When later asked what concessions Putin would have to make, Trump shifted toward Ukraine and said they could \"forget\" about NATO membership.",
      "ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce asked Trump about the budget bill that passed in the House Tuesday night -- which includes a goal of at least $2 trillion in cuts to mandatory federal spending -- and whether Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security would be cut.",
      "\"I have said it so many times ... This won't be read my lips anymore. We're not going to touch it,\" Trump responded, echoing the statement George H.W. Bush famously made about \"no new taxes\" and then later had to reverse.",
      "Trump claimed that there would be a reduction in fraud in those programs. Trump has echoed false claims stemming from Musk that dead Americans are receiving Social Security.",
      "Experts told ABC News that is not true, and that Musk is misreading Social Security's network of databases when he claims 200-year-olds are in the system.",
      "Trump stressed that he is still planning to push tariffs on foreign countries to improve the economy and claimed the European Union in particular left the U.S. with billions in debt and was formed to \"screw the United States.\"",
      "\"We have made a decision, will be announcing it very soon and it'll be 25%, generally speaking, and that'll be on cars and all other things,\" he said.",
      "Trump said the tariffs against Mexico and Canada are expected to go into effect next week on April 2, after a monthlong pause.",
      "But then Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested another pause may be possible based on fentanyl prevention and progress on the border.",
      "\"If they can prove to the president they've done an excellent job,\" Lutnick said. Trump quickly jumped in: \"It's going to be hard to satisfy.\"",

    "story": [
      "The majority of cases have occurred among unvaccinated people.",
      "An unvaccinated school-aged child in Texas has died of measles, the first associated with an outbreak in the western part of the state that has infected more than 100 people.",
      "Lubbock city spokesperson Lauren Adams confirmed the death to ABC News on Wednesday.",
      "In a press release, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) said the child was hospitalized in the northwestern city of Lubbock last week and tested positive for measles.",
      "As of Wednesday, 124 cases of measles have been confirmed associated with the outbreak, according to data from DSHS.",
      "Almost all of the cases are in unvaccinated individuals or individuals whose vaccination status is unknown, and 18 people have been hospitalized so far, DSHS said.",
      "Children and teenagers between ages 5 and 17 make up the majority of cases with 62, followed by 39 cases among children ages 4 and under.",
      "The outbreak began in Gaines County, which has become the epicenter, with 80 cases confirmed among residents, according to DSHS.",
      "The outbreak has since spread to several counties in the region and is \"suspected\" to have spread into New Mexico, according to New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH). Nine cases have been confirmed in Lea County, which borders Texas. Of the nine cases, four are among children, according to NMDOH.",
      "\"This death underscores the real danger of measles -- it's a severe disease that can take lives despite being preventable with vaccination,\" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and ABC News contributor. \"Every new case is a reminder of why vaccination is critical. Tragically, with an outbreak of this scale, a fatal case was not unexpected, especially among those unvaccinated. Given how contagious measles is, we anticipate more cases in the coming weeks.\"",
      "During Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, Health and & Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded to a question about the outbreak, saying the agency was following the cases in Texas.",
      "Kennedy appeared to downplay the outbreak, noting there have been four outbreaks so far this year compared to 16 last year. However, the number of cases in Texas alone amount to nearly half of the 285 cases confirmed in 2024.",
      "\"It's not unusual; we have measles outbreaks every year,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Judge Amir Ali said the administration violated a court order.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali denied the Department of Justice's request to push the midnight deadline by which the Trump administration needs to pay more than $1.9 billion in foreign aid.",
      "The case is now in the hands of a panel of three appellate judges \u2013 each nominated to the bench by Democratic presidents \u2013 who will decide whether to issue an emergency stay of the deadline.",
      "In his decision denying the request to stay his deadline, Judge Ali criticized the Trump administration for waiting until Tuesday to raise the argument that they lack the ability to restart the funding.",
      "\"This is not something that Defendants have previously raised in this Court, whether at the hearing or any time before filing their notice of appeal and seeking a stay pending appeal. That is so even though Plaintiffs' motion to enforce explicitly proposed compliance on this time frame,\" Ali wrote.",
      "Ali ordered the Trump administration on Tuesday to dole out delayed payments that could total nearly $2 billion, according to a USAID official, to multiple nonprofit groups, determining the Trump administration violated the terms of a temporary restraining order issued two weeks ago regarding freezing foreign aid.",
      "A top official with the United States Agency for International Development claims that complying with Tuesday's court order would require paying foreign aid groups nearly $2 billion, arguing the payments \"cannot be accomplished\" in the timeframe set by the court.",
      "Lawyers with the Department of Justice asked Ali in a late-night filing on Tuesday to issue a stay of his order that requires the Trump administration to pay by Wednesday at 11:59 p.m. any outstanding debts to foreign aid groups for work completed prior to Feb. 13. The Trump administration initially tried to freeze the payments via an executive order before Judge Ali ordered the payments to resume two weeks ago.",
      "DOJ lawyers argued that fulfilling the payments is not only technically impossible but would also prevent the Trump administration from ensuring the payments are \"legitimate.\"",
      "\"The order apparently requires the Government to expend taxpayer dollars without regard to any processes for ensuring that the expenses are legitimate\u2014even though Executive Branch leadership harbors concerns about the possibility of waste and fraud and is in the process of developing revised payment processing systems to address those concerns,\" DOJ attorney Indraneel Sur wrote in a late-night filing.",
      "According to Peter Marocco, the deputy administrator of USAID and director of foreign assistance at the State Department, complying with the court order would require dispersing $1.5 billion between 2,000 payment requests at USAID and an additional $400 million in payments at the State Department.",
      "Judge Amir Ali, a Biden-era appointee, excoriated Trump administration attorneys during a lengthy hearing on Tuesday over its failure to pay the groups for work they conducted prior to President Trump's Jan. 20 executive order, which froze all foreign aid for 90 days. Ali also signed an order to enforce a temporary restraining order he signed on Feb. 13, ruling the groups must be paid by 11:59 p.m. Wednesday.",
      "\"Plaintiffs submitted evidence that defendants have not lifted the suspension or freeze of funds as the [temporary restraining order] required. Defendants have not rebutted that evidence, and when asked today, defendants were not able to provide any specific examples of unfreezing funds pursuant to the Court's TRO,\" Judge Ali said after a two-hour hearing today.",
      "Lawyers with the Department of Justice acknowledged that the Trump administration ignored the temporary restraining order, which prohibited them from freezing foreign aid funds since the order was issued. Instead, they argued that they should not be required to pay back the money because of \"sovereign immunity.\"",
      "During an extended exchange with Ali, a DOJ lawyer struggled to answer basic questions about the Trump administration's compliance with the temporary restraining order, which prevented the administration from freezing funds.",
      "\"I'm not sure why I can't get a straight answer from you on this. Are you aware of an unfreezing of the disbursement of funds for those contracts and agreements that were frozen before February 13?\" Ali asked. \"Are you aware of steps taken to actually release those funds?\"",
      "\"I'm not in a position to answer that,\" DOJ attorney Indraneel Sur said.",
      "\"We're 12 days in and you're here representing the government...and you can't answer me whether any funds that you've kind of acknowledged or covered by the court's order have been unfrozen?\" Judge Ali responded.",
      "\"All I can do, really, is say that the preparations are underway for the joint status report on compliance,\" Sur said.",
      "At one portion of the lengthy court hearing, Sur attempted to offer a legal justification for the Trump administration's noncompliance, prompting a stern response from the judge about his order, the terms of which he said were \"clear as day.\"",
      "\"The purpose of this hearing is to understand and to hear arguments on the motion to enforce TRO. It is not an opportunity to re-litigate the TRO,\" Ali said.",
      "The DOJ filed a notice of appeal Tuesday.",
      "A lawyer representing the nonprofits who brought the case argued that the lack of a response from the Trump administration amounts to defiance of the court order.",

    "summary": "The House passed the GOP budget plan for Trump's agenda Tuesday night after briefly pulling it from the schedule.",
    "story": [
      "Speaker Mike Johnson faced a major test to rally enough Republican votes.",
      "Following chaos and delay, the House on Tuesday passed the Republican budget resolution to start the process to enact President Donald Trump\u2019s legislative agenda by a vote of 217-215 -- a big and critical win for Speaker Mike Johnson, who was dealing with an extremely narrow GOP majority.",
      "GOP leaders were able to successfully flip Reps. Tim Burchett, Warren Davidson and Victoria Spartz, three of four holdouts. The other, Rep. Thomas Massie, was the only Republican who voted against the resolution. Republicans could afford to lose only one vote.",
      "\"A lot of work yet to be done, but we're going to celebrate tonight, and we'll roll up our sleeves and get right back at it in the morning,\" Johnson said to reporters after the vote.",
      "It was not clear whether Republicans would have the votes to pass the measure on Tuesday afternoon and into the evening. At least four Republicans members had said they would vote no on the plan and Johnson could afford only one defection.",
      "House Republicans held open their first vote Tuesday night for more than an hour as leadership tried to wrangle votes for the funding resolution and Democrats protested.",
      "GOP leaders then briefly pulled the budget resolution -- the next vote in a series -- from the schedule and rescheduled it a few minutes later and called the entire House back to the chamber.",
      "Democratic leaders were able to get more of their members to attend the critical vote. Rep. Brittany Pettersen, who is on maternity leave, showed up to vote with her son. Rep. Kevin Mullin, who has a medical condition, showed up with a walker. House Democratic leaders complained in a message to Democrats that Johnson was trying to \u201cjam\u201d the budget resolution through after assuring them there would be no further votes in the House for the night.",
      "Before the vote, Johnson told reporters, \"We are trying to work through concerns and issues. A lot of people want to make sure we are cutting an appropriate amount \u2026 it's a very complicated negotiation \u2026 we will get there.\"",
      "The resolution now heads to the Senate, where it is an open question as to what leadership will do with the blueprint. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has a different approach in the upper chamber -- focusing one bill on defense and border security spending and a later one that would deal with tax cuts and the debt ceiling, although the president has wholly endorsed the House Republican blueprint.",
      "Republicans plan to use reconciliation, a tactic that requires only a simple majority to pass. But under reconciliation, both chambers must adopt the exact same resolution.",
      "\"This is the first important step in opening up the reconciliation process. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us,\" Johnson said after the vote. \"We are going to deliver the America First agenda. We're going to deliver all of it, not just parts of it, and this is the first step of that process.\"",
      "Republicans leaned on Trump to pressure the holdouts and other GOP members who were undecided.",
      "\"The president has talked to a number of members. He's made his intentions well known and he wants them to vote for this and move it along so we can start the process,\" Johnson said.",
      "But later Tuesday, while signing executive orders in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm not involved in that. They know what I want.\"",
      "Burchett told ABC News that he spoke to Trump, but declined to divulge details on the conversation.",
      "Johnson earlier was uncertain if the vote would happen Tuesday, suggesting it could get pushed.",
      "\"There may be a vote tonight. There may not be. Stay tuned. That's why you get paid. Hang around here,\" he said to reporters.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise defended the budget -- contending that Democrats were \"lying\" when they asserted that Republicans are primed to make deep cuts to Medicaid.",
      "\"This bill doesn't even mention the word 'Medicaid' a single time, and yet, all Democrats are doing is lying about what's in the budget because they don't want to talk about the truth,\" Scalise said. \"Instead of just sitting back and licking their wounds that they're completely out of touch with the American people, their only choice is to resort to lying about what's in this vote today. There is no Medicaid in this bill. There are no Medicaid cuts in this bill. Yet that's all they're saying.\"",
      "While the blueprint itself does not mention Medicaid directly, it sets a goal of at least $2 trillion in cuts to mandatory federal spending, which includes funding for entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.",
      "Johnson and his leadership team worked for weeks to mollify concerns.",
      "Following a closed-door conference meeting Tuesday, Massie quipped that GOP leaders have \"convinced him\" to vote no -- predicting the measure would actually increase the deficit by billions of dollars.",
      "Nevertheless, Johnson defended the blueprint.",

      "A Maryland-based technology consulting firm said it cut 20% of its staff when a federal funding freeze left the business unable to pay its bills.",
      "A career-development company in Colorado said it lost out on four of every five dollars in revenue when the federal government canceled all of its contracts.",
      "An Alaska-based logistics firm scrubbed mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, from hundreds of federal documents within 36 hours to salvage millions in government funds, the company said.",
      "A cost-cutting spree carried out by President Donald Trump's administration has put thousands of public employees out of work, but the slash-and-burn approach has also spilled over into the private sector, crippling some small businesses with ties to the federal government and weakening a federal agency tasked with supporting small firms, according to interviews with seven small business owners, as well as small business advocates.",
      "Companies connected to the U.S. government account for about 7.5 million jobs, the Brookings Institution found. That figure amounts to roughly 4.5% of the nation's workforce.",
      "Many of those firms are small businesses, which received a total of roughly $180 billion in federal contracts over the year ending in September, or nearly $3 of every $10 in contracts over that period, according to the U.S. Small Business Administration, a government agency.",
      "John Arensmeyer, founder and CEO of advocacy group Small Business Majority, warned earlier this month that the Trump administration's actions had left the organization \"deeply worried.\"",
      "\"Directives to halt all federal funding will make it impossible for small businesses to access critical loans and grants,\" Arensmeyer added.",
      "In response to ABC News' request for comment, the White House touted Trump's approach to supporting small business.",
      "\"After small business optimism hit record lows under the Biden administration, President Trump's economic policies are uplifting true 'mom and pop' businesses across the country \u2013 not government contractors making tens of millions of dollars off of taxpayers,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told ABC News. \"He will continue to cut wasteful spending, deliver transparency and usher in a new Golden Age for taxpayers, families and small business owners alike.\"",
      "Trump's push to halt federal funding included an executive order last month pausing funding for USAID, a federal foreign-aid agency.",
      "Occams Group, a technology consulting firm based in Columbia, Maryland, saw its revenue nearly cut in half this month after the Trump administration paused funding for a USAID contractor that makes up one of Occams Group's largest clients, founder and CEO Ali Sinan told ABC News.",
      "Some invoices from as far back as December remain unpaid, Sinan added, saying business with the contractor accounted for $200,000 per month in revenue. Annual revenue at Occams Group stands at more than $5 million, Sinan said.",
      "\"I was left scrambling,\" Sinan said. \"We couldn't make payroll.\"",
      "The firm cut ties with about 10 of its 50 staff members, while the remaining employees worked longer-than-normal hours as the company sought new business, he added.",
      "\"The small business is supposed to be the engine of the economy,\" Sinan said. \"My company has been left behind.\"",
      "On Feb. 13, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that lifted the pause on foreign aid. As of Friday, Sinan said Occams Group had not received payment from the client that contracts with USAID.",
      "On Monday, a federal judge found the Trump administration had violated the restraining order, calling on the White House to fulfill millions in foreign aid payments.",
      "Layoffs from private sector contractors may impact the economy faster than some federal job cuts, Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, told ABC News.",
      "Federal employees who accept a buyout offered by the Trump administration are set to receive full pay through September. By contrast, private sector employees who lose their jobs could miss out on pay and benefits almost immediately, delivering a quicker blow to the economy, Pollak said.",
      "\"There's a degree of worry and concern and uncertainty that extends a lot further than the federal workforce,\" Pollak added, pointing to the pullback of federal funding as a factor in a recent decline of consumer attitudes about the economy.",
      "\"There are many, many businesses and nonprofits that get a substantial share of their budgets from the federal government, and they're now worried they may be affected by these cuts,\" Pollak said.",
      "In addition to a wide-reaching push for government spending cuts, Trump issued an executive order last month cancelling federal contracts and grants for DEI initiatives. The move aimed to \"terminate\" all \"equity-related\" contracts and grants, the order said, cutting funding for businesses that helped provide the programs.",
      "Hanaa Jiminez, who runs Gold Cardinal Consulting, a management advisory firm in Aurora, Colorado, said the federal government in recent weeks canceled all of its contracts, which accounted for $14.5 million or about 80% of the company's annual revenue.",
      "\"The first contracts to go were the DEI ones, but then the leadership and coaching ones that we were providing were also canceled,\" Jiminez said. \"It was very sad to learn.\"",
      "The company may need to layoff some of its five employees, Jiminez said, but first she will explore ways to reduce her take-home salary.",
      "\"It's really to make sure we can prevent layoffs as much as possible,\" Jiminez added.",
      "A federal judge in Maryland on Friday blocked the White House order cutting DEI grants and contracts. As of Tuesday, however, the company's contracts had not been reinstated, nor had the company received an indication that they would be, Jiminez said.",
      "The push to eradicate DEI from federal contracts has also imposed onerous compliance challenges, Christine Hopkins, who runs a pair of logistics companies in Anchorage, Alaska, told ABC News.",
      "A government official who oversees the firms' government contracts urged Hopkins to remove all mentions of DEI from hundreds of documents within a day and a half to ensure that the contracts remained in place, Hopkins said.",
      "Government contracts totaling about $7 million make up about 80% of revenue at the two companies: SCI Federal Services and Advanced Supply Chain International, she said.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court seemed to find common ground in a high-profile case brought by a straight woman alleging \"reverse\" job discrimination in favor of gay people.",
    "story": [
      "It seemed poised to make it easier for white, straight people to make claims.",
      "It was a high-profile legal debate at the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday with potentially big implications for America's raging culture wars.",
      "In the end, justices appeared to come to rare consensus -- to find what Justice Neil Gorsuch called \"radical agreement\" -- in the case of a straight white woman alleging \"reverse discrimination\" by her employer on the basis of sexual orientation.",
      "The plaintiff, Marlean Ames, had asked the justices to reverse a lower court ruling that tossed out her employment discrimination lawsuit against the Ohio Department of Youth Services, where she had worked for more than 15 years.",
      "After a little under an hour of oral arguments, it appears she will get her wish -- though it's far from certain she will ultimately win her discrimination case.",
      "Ames alleges her employer denied her a promotion and later demoted her, in both cases selecting gay candidates instead who were less qualified. Her supervisor at the time was also gay.",
      "Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and sexual orientation.",
      "The Supreme Court has said that plaintiffs bringing claims under Title VII must, as a first step, show a prima facie case -- or initial set of facts that, if unexplained, plausibly amount to discrimination.",
      "The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals concluded that Ames didn't meet that bar because -- as a straight woman -- she failed to show the necessary \"background circumstances\" necessary to show a plausible case of discrimination against her as a member of a majority group.",
      "Ames argued the \"background circumstances\" requirement was an unfair added burden on her simply because she's straight. Nearly all of the justices seemed to agree -- even the attorney for the state of Ohio.",
      "\"We agree, Ohio agrees, that it's wrong to treat people differently,\" Ohio Solicitor General Elliot Gaiser told Justice Amy Coney Barrett during questioning.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's senior liberal member, suggested that hat the very least there was \"something suspicious\" about Ames' situation that warranted further examination by the lower courts.",
      "\"We're in radical agreement today on that, it seems to me,\" quipped Justice Neil Gorsuch about the need for the Court to reassert that Title VII applies to everyone equally.",
      "Gaiser argued, however, that even if the Court overturned the Sixth Circuit's \"background circumstances\" rule for white, straight, and/or male (i.e. majority-group) plaintiffs it should make clear that Ames still may not have presented a sufficiently plausible case of discrimination to move forward.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested the Court will likely deliver a narrow opinion leaving to a lower court further fact-based deliberations about Ames' allegations and whether they should move forward.",
      "All the Court needs to say, Kavanaugh said, \"is a really short opinion that says discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, whether it's because you're gay or because you're straight, is prohibited, and the rules are the same whichever way that goes.\"",
      "From Jonathan Segal, partner at Duane Morris:",
      "Employment law experts suggested such a ruling would effectively make it easier for members of majority groups to bring cases of alleged discrimination in court.",
      "\"On a broader level, the ruling will reinforce to the public that the law prohibits discrimination equally against majority and minority groups alike,\" said Jonathan Segal, an employment lawyer and partner at Duane Morris LLP, a private firm based in Philadelphia. \"This likely will increase in all circuits the already increasing number of claims by members of so-called majority groups.\"",
      "\"Of course, the Ames decision cannot be viewed in isolation,\" Segal added. \"It will take place at a time when DEI programs already are under the legal microscope A finding of 'reverse discrimination' may subject an employer\u2019s DEI programs to federal and state investigations.\"",
      "A decision in the case -- Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services -- is expected by the end of June.",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine now finds itself under pressure from both Russia and the U.S.",
      "LONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his leadership team spent much of 2024 cautiously courting both sides of America's widening political divide -- well aware that repelling Russia's ongoing invasion relied, in large part, on U.S. largesse.",
      "Kyiv appeared hopeful it could weather President Donald Trump's dramatic return to the White House, assuring itself and the world that his campaign trail alignment with Russia's narrative would be tempered by the geopolitical realities of the world's most powerful office.",
      "But the first month of Trump's second term has already delivered a radical American pivot. The opening of U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia -- intended to secure peace in Ukraine, but conducted without Kyiv's involvement -- and subsequent fraying of U.S.-Ukrainian ties, poses a new crisis for a nation that has grown used to living with existential peril.",
      "Volodymyr Fesenko, a political scientist and the \u0421EO of the Center for Political Studies \"Penta\" in Kyiv, told ABC News that recent developments represent \"the most acute crisis in relations between the U.S. and Ukraine in their entire history.\"",
      "\"In the worst case, this is a strategic turn of the U.S. towards Russia, rapprochement with Putin and weakening -- or even the destruction -- of previous partnership relations with Europe and Ukraine,\" Fesenko said. \"I am afraid that this is the scenario that will gradually be realized.\"",
      "\"With Trump's businesslike approach to bilateral relations, and with his interest in restoring relations with Russia, the previous special partnership relations between the U.S. and Ukraine will no longer exist,\" Fesenko said.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's commitment to involving Kyiv in any talks to end the war was embodied by the \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\" motto. That approach appears to have been replaced with Trumpian transactionalism.",
      "The White House now appears to be strongarming Kyiv into economic, territorial and political concessions, with Trump himself berating Zelenskyy -- celebrated by many Americans for his stoic wartime stewardship -- as a \"dictator without elections\" who \"better move fast or he is not going to have a country left.\"",
      "Zelenskyy and his top officials have pushed back, noting that Ukraine is unable to hold new elections while under martial law. Kyiv has said it is happy to work with the new administration on mutually beneficial economic and security deals, while urging American partners to treat Moscow's narrative with skepticism. Ukraine's parliament on Tuesday voted to affirm Zelenskyy's legitimacy and agree that no elections can be held while the war continues.",
      "The situation is \"beyond disturbing\" for Kyiv, a source close to the Ukrainian government told ABC News. \"It's hard to imagine that it can be pulled back.\"",
      "Ukraine's leadership is trying to chart a course through the minefield of Trump's second term, the source added.",
      "\"They feel that they're striking this balance of not being impolite or disrespectful when it comes to countering some of the things that, again, at the end of the day, no Ukrainian leader can accept,\" the source said.",
      "\"They feel that they're managing it well, which doesn't mean that they don't have anxiety,\" they added. \"They do, because it is a fact that they rely on U.S. support, it is a fact that Europe cannot totally compensate for that support.\"",
      "\"They're striking this balance of pushing back, but not in a way where they're coming off as totally obstructionist and obstinate,\" the source continued.",
      "This month's historic U.S.-Russia meeting in Riyadh laid bare the new administration's approach to Moscow. The two sides agreed to normalize diplomatic relations and continue talks aimed at ending Russia's war, all without Ukraine's involvement.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's bid to win access to hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Ukrainian mineral resources further unsettled Kyiv. \"We're going to get our money back,\" the president said of the would-be deal, the first draft of which Zelenskyy rejected, declaring, \"I can't sell our state.\"",
      "But after a week of intense negotiations, both sides now suggest they have all but reached a deal, with Trump saying Monday he expects to see Zelenskyy in Washington next week.",
      "The reversal of the U.S. approach is striking. Where once Biden and his team refused to engage with Moscow outside of an unprecedented sanctions campaign, Trump and his top officials are now lauding a revival in bilateral ties.",
      "Where Biden once led the \"ironclad\" commitment to defending Ukraine against Kremlin aggression \"for as long as it takes,\" Trump falsely suggested Ukraine \"should have never started\" the war.",
      "The Biden administration's steady flow of vital military and economic aid, meanwhile, has been replaced with Trump's push to recoup what he sees as poorly invested American money. \"I want them to give us something for all of the money that we put up,\" Trump told CPAC on Saturday.",
      "The president has focused in on the value of American aid to Kyiv, which he claims is as high as $500 billion. Zelenskyy disputed the figure and said American aid was given as grants, not loans. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy -- a research institute in Germany that tracks foreign aid to Ukraine -- said the U.S. has contributed around $119 billion to Ukraine over three years of war. The majority -- $67 billion -- was in the form of military equipment.",
      "America's rising Ukraine-skepticism is being expressed on all fronts. In an extraordinary illustration of the re-alignment on Ukraine, the U.S. sided with Russia in a vote against a United Nations General Assembly resolution condemning Russia, which passed on Monday with the support of the U.S.' traditional Western allies. The UN Security Council passed a U.S.-drafted resolution which called for an end to the conflict without criticizing Russia. France and the U.K. abstained on the UNSC vote.",
      "Zelenskyy has said Ukraine will not agree to any peace deal that does not protect it against renewed Russian aggression. The Trump administration's rapid policy shift has pushed European allies to mobilize to provide their own long-term support -- and protection -- of Ukraine. Britain, France and others are discussing deploying European troops to Ukraine to guard any peace deal.",
      "Though financially and logistically dependent on foreign partners, Ukraine's armed forces are among the world's most potent and experienced. Zelenskyy said in January that 980,000 Ukrainians are now under arms, dwarfing any other European military.",
      "Despite Trump's unproven claims to the contrary, well-respected polling organizations in Ukraine have found that Zelenskyy retains the trust of the majority of Ukrainians. His compatriots want the war to end on what they consider fair terms, but a December survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll indicates that 57% are prepared to carry the conflict's burden for as long as necessary, despite heavy casualties, ongoing attacks on infrastructure and severe economic strain.",
      "There are more testing days to come. Moscow has said that the U.S. and Russian negotiating teams will meet for a second round of talks within the next two weeks.",
      "\"It should not look like Americans and Russians are trying to reach a deal about Ukraine's fate behind our backs,\" Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament representing Zelenskyy's party, told ABC News.",

      "A state judge tossed out racketeering charges against New Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross and those charged alongside him",
      "TRENTON, N.J. -- A state judge on Wednesday agreed to toss out racketeering charges against New Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross and those charged alongside him.",
      "Superior Court Judge Peter Warshaw granted Norcross' and other defendants' motion to dismiss a state grand jury's indictment on racketeering charges brough by Attorney General Matt Platkin.",
      "Platkin said in a statement he plans to appeal the judge's ruling.",
      "The charges stem from a June 2024 indictment, announced by Platkin at a news conference at which Norcross himself took the unusual step of appearing at in person and sitting directly in front of the attorney general. The charges accused Norcross and five other defendants of running \u201can enterprise\u201d going back to 2012 to use their political influence to craft legislation to serve their own interests.",
      "In a nearly 100-page ruling, the judge found the prosecution's allegations did not amount to criminal coercion or extortion and are time-barred.",
      "\u201cDefendants correctly argue that when considering private parties negotiating economic deals in a free market system, threats are sometimes neither wrongful or unlawful. In these situations, there may be nothing inherently wrong in using economic fear to obtain property,\u201d Warshaw wrote.",
      "Among the allegations against Norcross were charges that he threatened a developer who would not relinquish his rights to waterfront property in Camden, New Jersey, on Norcross\u2019 terms. The indictment cites a profanity-laden phone recording of Norcross in which he tells the developer he will face \u201cenormous consequences.\u201d The person asks if Norcross is threatening him, according to the indictment. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Norcross replies.",
      "The indictment also said Norcross and the co-defendants extorted and coerced businesses with property rights on Camden\u2019s waterfront and obtained tax incentive credits, which they then sold for millions of dollars. Platkin described Camden as long suffering from economic decline.",
      "At the time, defense lawyer Michael Critchley had accused Platkin of having a \u201cvendetta\u201d against Norcross, noting that the waterfront development had been investigated for years by several agencies, including federal prosecutors in Philadelphia and New Jersey, as well as Platkin\u2019s predecessor.",
      "Those investigations came to nothing, Critchley said.",
      "Norcross, who served as executive chairman of the insurance firm Conner Strong & Buckelew, had been widely viewed as among the most influential unelected Democrats in the state.",
      "He was a Democratic National Committee member until 2021 and previously served as the head of the Camden County Democratic Party. A close friend to the former state Senate president, he was a behind-the-scenes power player and well-known financial backer to Democrats in the state and nationwide.",
      "In addition to dismissing the indictment against Norcross, the judge's order applied to his brother and co-defendant Philip A. Norcross, a New Jersey lawyer; George Norcross\u2019s longtime lawyer William M. Tambussi; Camden Community Partnership chief executive and former Camden Mayor Dana L. Redd; Sidney R. Brown, chief executive of trucking and logistics company NFI; and development company executive John J. O\u2019Donnell."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump&rsquo;s effort to suspend the system for resettling refugees in the U.S. is on hold after a federal judge in Seattle blocked it",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to suspend the system for resettling refugees in the U.S. is on hold after a federal judge in Seattle blocked it",
      "SEATTLE -- President Donald Trump's effort to suspend the system for resettling refugees in the U.S. is on hold after a federal judge in Seattle blocked it. U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead, a 2023 appointee of former President Joe Biden, found that while the president has broad authority over who comes into the country, he cannot nullify the law passed by Congress establishing the program.",
      "The Justice Department indicated it would consider a quick appeal, saying Trump's actions have been well within his authority.",
      "Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Trump halted the nation's refugee resettlement program as part of a series of executive orders cracking down on immigration, saying cities had been taxed by \u201crecord levels of migration\u201d and couldn't \u201cabsorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees.\u201d He barred refugees from coming to the U.S., and the administration began cutting off funding for agencies that support refugees.",
      "The refugee program, created by Congress in 1980, is a form of legal migration to the U.S. for people displaced by war, natural disaster or persecution \u2014 a process that often takes years and involves significant vetting. It is different from asylum, by which people newly arrived in the U.S. can seek permission to remain because they fear persecution in their home country.",
      "Despite long-standing support from both parties for accepting refugees, the program has become politicized in recent years. Trump also temporarily halted it during his first term, and then dramatically decreased the number of refugees who could enter the U.S. each year.",
      "There are 600,000 people being processed to come to the U.S. as refugees around the world, according to the administration.",
      "The lawsuit filed in Seattle was brought by individual refugees whose efforts to resettle in the U.S. have been halted as well as major refugee aid groups.",
      "Those organizations include International Refugee Assistance Project on behalf of Church World Service, the Jewish refugee resettlement agency HIAS and Lutheran Community Services Northwest. They say they have had to lay off staff because the administration froze funding for processing refugee applications overseas as well as support, such as short-term rental assistance for those already in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe resettled people days before the inauguration that were just cut off from benefits,\u201d said Lutheran Community Services Northwest CEO David Duea said after Tuesday's hearing. \u201cThat means rent, helping kids get into school, and case management. It was an inhumane act.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer August Flentje disputed the notion that the plaintiffs had suffered the sort of \u201cirreparable\u201d harms that would warrant granting a broad order blocking the administration\u2019s actions. Most people whose travel to the U.S. was canceled at the last minute had already been moved to a third country where they were out of danger, he said, and the cancellation of funding for refugee aid groups amounted to a contract dispute.",
      "The judge disagreed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve read the declarations,\u201d Whitehead said. \u201cI have refugees stranded in dangerous places. I have families who have sold everything they\u2019ve owned in advance of travel, which was canceled. I have spouses and children separated indefinitely from their family members in the U.S., resettlement agencies that have already laid off hundreds of staff.\"",
      "Last week, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., refused to immediately block the Trump administration\u2019s actions in a similar lawsuit brought by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. That case faces another hearing Friday.",
      "During Tuesday's arguments, Flentje cited a law that allows the president to deny entry to foreigners whose admission to the U.S. \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d",
      "But Whitehead determined the president\u2019s actions amounted to an \u201ceffective nullification of congressional will\u201d in setting up the nation\u2019s refugee admissions program. He promised to offer a fuller rationale in a written opinion in the next few days.",
      "\u201cThe president has substantial discretion ... to suspend refugee admissions,\u201d Whitehead told the parties. \u201cBut that authority is not limitless.\u201d",
      "Flentje indicated the government might file an \u201cemergency appeal\" to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a motion that would be considered on an expedited basis. He also asked the Whitehead to pause his ruling pending an appeal, but Whitehead called that request premature since he had not yet issued his written decision.",
      "Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they expected Whitehead's ruling to clear the way for money to begin flowing again to the organizations and for plaintiffs stranded overseas to be able to book new trips to the U.S., though it remained unclear whether any appeal might complicate that.",
      "Outside the courthouse Tuesday, the organizations and their supporters celebrated the ruling, describing refugees as a blessing to the country.",
      "Tshishiku Henry, an activist who works on behalf of refugees in Washington state, called his presence \u201cthe miracle of the second chance.\u201d He and his wife resettled in the U.S. in 2018 after fleeing war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he said.",
      "\u201cIt was a lifeline,\u201d Henry said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t offer us just safety, but you gave us back our future.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- New York City Mayor Eric Adams asked a federal judge to toss out the corruption case against him Wednesday, alleging prosecutorial misconduct, even as the Justice Department seeks dismissal of the charges on the Democrat's behalf.",
      "In papers filed in Manhattan federal court, his lawyers alleged that the misconduct occurred when the government publicly leaked a letter then-U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi explaining why charges should not be dropped.",
      "She wrote the letter, offering to resign as she refused to follow acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove\u2019s directive to drop the charges against the embattled mayor two weeks ago. Bove accepted the resignation.",
      "Bove had written a letter to Sassoon, saying the mayor was needed to assist President Donald Trump's law-and-order priorities, particularly the fight against illegal immigration and violent crime. He also said the charges were interfering with this year's New York City mayoral race.",
      "In their court papers Wednesday, Adams' lawyers wrote that the public release of Sassoon's \u201cunhinged resignation letter\u201d to Bondi was \u201cpart of an extraordinary flurry of leaked internal Justice Department correspondence\u201d that occurred after Bove issued his directive to Sassoon in writing.",
      "The lawyers said Sassoon notified Bondi that prosecutors were planning to add an obstruction charge against Adams in a superseding indictment and made the \u201cwildly inflammatory and false accusation\u201d that Adams and his lawyers had offered to help the Trump administration in return for the dismissal of charges.",
      "Adams was indicted in September on charges alleging he accepted over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and travel perks from a Turkish official and others seeking to buy influence while he was Brooklyn borough president.

      "Bove's request to dismiss charges had included the possibility that charges could be reinstated after the mayoral election, but lawyers for Adams said that possibility should be eliminated.",
      "\u201cMayor Adams was prosecuted in the media long before there was ever an indictment. The Court should take a moment to consider this inescapable reality. This case, which was once just a farce, has now become a cancer, and its pendency continues to cause real and irrevocable harm each and every day,\u201d they said."

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres is proposing opening a U.N. office that would provide drones, fuel, ground and air transportation and other non-lethal support to a Kenyan-led mission in Haiti struggling to fight gangs, according to a letter obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press.",
      "The letter was sent to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday night and provides the first details for a proposal that Guterres announced last week at a summit with Caribbean leaders. At the time, Guterres said he would request that the U.N. assume funding for the mission\u2019s structural and logistical expenses but did not provide further information.",
      "In the letter, Guterres assessed the situation in Haiti and warned it was running out of time.",
      "\u201cWe must act quickly,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am convinced that the phased approach of the United Nations' support\u2026 can reverse the shocking and rising trend in gang violence.\u201d",

      "The proposal comes as gangs that already control 85% of Haiti\u2019s capital seized new neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince in recent weeks. The attacks have left more than 6,000 people homeless in the past month, according to the U.N.",
      "\u201cEntire families were killed in their homes, while others, including children and babies, were shot dead as they tried to escape,\u201d the U.N. said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Guterres said in the letter that the U.N. office he proposes could help strengthen Haiti\u2019s National Police and help gather, store and share sensitive information related to operations, as well as provide a joint operations center, GIS support and surveillance via drones.",
      "In turn, Guterres said BINUH, the latest U.N. political mission in Haiti, could focus on priorities including designing programs to help children and women forced to join gangs defect from them, as well as support authorities in the arrests and prosecutions of \u201chigh-risk individuals.\u201d",
      "The Security Council previously extended the U.N.-backed mission in Haiti led by Kenyan police to October of this year even as the U.S. and other countries warn it is lacking personnel and funding.",
      "Guterres noted in his letter that while the mission has reached 1,000 personnel, the vast majority of them Kenyan police, it still only represents 40% of the 2,500 personnel envisioned.",
      "In addition, a U.N. trust fund that is helping fund the mission has only $110.8 million.",
      "\u201cMuch more is needed,\u201d Guterres wrote.",
      "He also noted that \u201cmany\u201d of the mission\u2019s armored vehicles are ill-equipped for the urban environment in Port-au-Prince and that a lack of spare parts has rendered half of all its combat vehicles inoperable.",
      "Last year, more than 5,600 people were reported killed across Haiti, 1,000 more deaths than reported the previous year. Gang violence also has left more than one million people homeless in recent years, according to the U.N.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- Latvia's foreign minister warns that Russian President Vladimir Putin will try to achieve in peace talks what he hasn\u2019t been able to accomplish in his war against Ukraine \u2014 weaken the United States and restore control over his smaller neighbor.",
      "Baiba Bra\u017ee spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday during a week of intense diplomacy between Europe and the United States following President Donald Trump\u2019s upending of U.S. policy with his decision to hold direct talks with Russia, while excluding Ukraine and its European allies from the initial discussions.",
      "Bra\u017ee notes that Russia, with a population of 140 million, has managed to gain control of less than 20% of Ukraine, population 40 million, since it seized Crimea in 2014 and launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Putin has failed to weaken the U.S. and the NATO military alliance it leads, or to oust the democratic government in Kyiv.",
      "So, when it comes to seeking peace, \u201cI think the difficulty is with the Russians, because Russians are the ones who want to weaken U.S. power, and who want to weaken the U.S. in the world overall,\u201d Bra\u017ee said.",
      "What the world is seeing, she said, is that when Putin interferes in other countries he wants to control both territory and the political choices of their governments. In Syria, for example, he supported the authoritarian regime of Bashar Assad and got military bases on the Mediterranean.",
      "But Putin hasn't gotten what he wanted during the three-year war in Ukraine and \u201che will try to get it through the peace talks,\u201d Bra\u017ee said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s important to clearly remember that perspective in whatever deal we negotiate or strike.\u201d",
      "She said although only U.S. and Russian officials took part in last week's talks in Saudi Arabia, \u201cEurope is included\u201d in the peace discussions because of constant communications with both the Ukrainians and the Americans. She has been in Washington three times since mid-December and said she was heading there later Tuesday for talks with lawmakers and administration officials.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump at the White House on Monday, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was due to meet with him on Thursday.",
      "Bra\u017ee stressed that Europe\u2019s task now is to strengthen the transatlantic alliance and build up its own militaries and defense industries.",
      "Last week, Latvia announced it will increase defense spending to 4% of GDP next year and continue to move toward 5%. NATO members have agreed to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense.",
      "\u201cWe are investing in our own capability,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wish all Europeans would do that. That\u2019s one of the issues we are discussing.\u201d",
      "As NATO members, Bra\u017ee said, Latvia and the neighboring Baltic states of Estonia and Lithuania need to make sure they are prepared for any future aggression from Russia. She said their focus is on deterrence \u2014 early warning, rapid response, military capability and political will.",
      "The three Baltic states were occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II and fell under Soviet control after the war. Like Ukraine, they became independent countries with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.",
      "Bra\u017ee stressed Monday to the U.N. Security Council that \u201conly Ukraine\u2019s victory can ensure lasting security and put an end to Russia\u2019s imperialist aggression.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe strongly believe that a rushed ceasefire will not lead to sustainable peace; instead, it will only embolden Russia, encouraging further expansion and putting global security at grave risk,\u201d she said.",
      "Macron said he had spoken to 30 European and allied leaders, with some saying they are willing to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine in a peace deal.",
      "Bra\u017ee said that while there have been preliminary discussions, there is no peace process yet.",
      "When there is, she said, \u201cWe will be guided very much by the needs of Ukraine.\"",
      "\u201cFor any security force, we need military guidance,\u201d Latvia's top diplomat said. \u201cWe need military advice. What type of force is there? Where? Are the troops withdrawn on the Russian side from the contact line? How far? What is the location of any security force?\"",
      "But Bra\u017ee said the most important thing is peace must be long-lasting, not just a ceasefire where war can restart again. \u201cNobody wants that,\u201d she said."

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- The Orlando Museum of Art and the estate of its former director, who died last month, have agreed to drop lawsuits against each other that arose from the 2022 FBI seizure of two dozen forged paintings that were falsely attributed to artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.",
      "The museum said in a statement Tuesday that the dismissal ends all litigation between it and the estate of its former director, Aaron De Groft, who died Jan. 18. The museum had accused De Groft of not fulfilling his fiduciary duty to the museum by championing the exhibit, while he claimed that his firing was unjust.",
      "\u201cIt is OMA\u2019s sincere hope that this step will allow OMA to continue forward with its mission in partnership with its valued constituencies,\u201d the museum said.",
      "De Groft negotiated to have the museum be the first institution to display more than two dozen artworks said to have been found in an old storage locker decades after Basquiat\u2019s 1988 death from a drug overdose.",
      "There were persistent questions about the authenticity of the works, culminating in the FBI's 2022 raid of the museum. In 2023, former Los Angeles auctioneer Michael Barzman agreed to plead guilty to federal charges of making false statements to the FBI, admitting that he and an accomplice had created the fake artwork and falsely attributed the paintings to Basquiat."

      "The billionaire owner of The Washington Post is directing its opinion section to defend personal liberties and the free market in a shift that prompted the editor of that page to resign",
      "The billionaire owner of The Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, narrowed the topics covered by its opinion section Wednesday to defending personal liberties and the free market, a pivot away from the traditional broad focus and prompting the news outlet\u2019s opinion editor to resign.",
      "Bezos, who also is the founder and largest individual shareholder of Amazon, said on X that \u201cviewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.\u201d",
      "The move was received by some as an indication that Bezos is making decisions for the Post with an eye toward avoiding retaliation by President Donald Trump. Bezos, though, cast the change as a modernization from the days when newspapers offered opinions on a broad range of topics. Now, he said, \u201cthe internet does that job.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,\u201d Bezos wrote in his post, adding that the new topics \u201care right for America. I also believe that these viewpoints are underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion.\" Opinions editor David Shipley resigned rather than lead the shift, Bezos said.",
      "\u201cI suggested to him that if the answer wasn\u2019t `hell yes,' then it had to be `no.' After careful consideration, David decided to step away,\u201d Bezos wrote.",
      "The pivot echoes the Wall Street Journal's editorial page banner: \u201cfree markets, free people.\u201d",
      "Bezos' move Wednesday was the latest in a series of Bezos' changes to the legacy news outlet, an award-winning organization that broke the Watergate scandal and whose motto is, \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness.\u201d",
      "Weeks before the November election, Bezos announced that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate, sparking a wave of resignations and thousands of subscription cancellations. The Post\u2019s editorial staff had been prepared to endorse Democrat Kamala Harris before publisher Will Lewis wrote instead that it would be better for readers to make up their own minds. Bezos defended the decision by saying in \u201ca note from our owner\u201d that editorial endorsements create a perception of bias at a time many Americans don\u2019t believe the media, and do nothing to tip the scales of an election.",
      "In January, cartoonist Ann Telnaes quit after an editor rejected her sketch of Bezos and other media executives bowing before Trump \u2014 after The Washington Post editor was seen with other executives at Trump\u2019s Florida club Mar-a-Lago.",
      "Bezos bought the broadsheet and other newspapers in 2013 for $250 million in a surprise move viewed as a demonstration of how the Internet has created winners and losers and transformed the media landscape.",
      "The narrowing of topics will be obvious. On the Post's homepage Wednesday afternoon, headlines linking to opinion material included \"Your showerhead is lying to you\" and \u201cWhat we learned about politics by talking about ... wolves.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court is considering whether to dismiss a massive effort to force a vote on an Atlanta-area police and firefighter training center that city officials say is nearly complete",
      "ATLANTA -- A federal appeals court is considering whether to dismiss a massive citywide effort to force a vote on an Atlanta-area police and firefighter training center that city attorneys say is now \u201csubstantially complete.\u201d",
      "The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had been silent for more than 14 months after hearing arguments in December 2023 over whether to overturn a lower court ruling that let nonresidents collect signatures as part of the \u201cStop Cop City\u201d referendum effort. The facility is on land the city of Atlanta leased to the Atlanta Police Foundation. Opponents, who collected more than 108,000 signatures in 2023, say voters should be able to revoke that lease.",
      "In the meantime, construction on the 85-acre (34-hectare), $115 million project continued apace last year. A spokesperson for Mayor Andre Dickens told The Associated Press on Wednesday that training has begun at the facility and classrooms are expected to be fully utilized by late March.",
      "The debate over the training center embroiled the city and captured national attention, especially after state troopers fatally shot an activist protesting near the project in January 2023. Opponents say the facility will worsen police militarization and harm the environment in a flood-prone, majority-Black neighborhood. They say the city\u2019s fight against the referendum is anti-democratic and dovetails with their concerns about a violent police response to protests and a prosecution on racketeering charges of dozens of opponents.",
      "In response to a recent appeals court request over whether the issue is now moot, city attorneys on Tuesday urged the court to toss the issue.",
      "The city's attorneys wrote that police officers, firefighters and first responders have begun training at the \u201cstate-of-the-art facility\u201d and \u201cany referendum on the ground lease ordinance will not remove the Center from the site or prevent its use by the City for these purposes.\u201d",
      "Even if a referendum took place, \u201cany outcome of such a referendum would be merely academic at this point \u2014 the Center has been built and will not be torn down,\u201d they added.",
      "But attorneys for four people who live outside the city and sued for the right to collect signatures say that just because the training center has been built does not negate the primary issue \u2014 whether voters can revoke the city's 50-year lease to the Atlanta Police Foundation, the nonprofit that runs the facility.",
      "\u201cThe lease does not terminate upon completion of construction of the training center,\u201d the attorneys wrote. \u201cThat alone should end the mootness inquiry.\u201d",
      "The attorneys for the facility opponents also argued that the case has an underlying First Amendment issue that must be resolved: Can nonresidents collect signatures for a referendum effort they are not eligible to vote on?",
      "Keyanna Jones, one of the plaintiffs, said she formerly lived near the training center site, which is just outside Atlanta city limits in unincorporated DeKalb County. She said collecting petitions was one of the few ways neighbors outside the city could fight the project.",
      "The debate over nonresidents' rights to collect signatures has meant the city has not begun the costly, laborious work of analyzing the approximately 108,500 signatures that activists turned in to City Hall in September 2023. If the court tosses the case, they likely never will.",
      "Even if the appeals court does not dismiss the case because of the training center's completion, the judges could still kill the petition drive by ruling it illegal under state law, or rule all of the signatures are void because none were submitted by the original 60-day deadline of Aug. 21, 2023.",
      "A ruling just narrowing which petitions are accepted could also doom the chances that opponents will have enough signatures from eligible registered Atlanta voters to force a referendum, an analysis by The Associated Press, Georgia Public Broadcasting, WABE and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found. Statistical sampling of 1,000 entries found it\u2019s possible opponents gathered the required 58,231 signatures if all entries are counted. But excluding signatures collected after Aug. 21, 2023, or by people who weren\u2019t Atlanta voters would disqualify 20% of potentially eligible sampled entries \u2014 likely defeating the effort.",

      "According to the final version of the deal obtained by The Associated Press, the United States and Ukraine will establish a co-owned and jointly managed investment fund aimed at financing the reconstruction of Ukraine and its war-damaged economy.",
      "The agreement comes after two weeks of back-and-forth between Kyiv and Washington over how the U.S. could gain access to Ukraine's natural resources. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has insisted that specific assurances for Ukrainian security must accompany a deal on those resources.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump planned to meet with Zelenskyy on Friday at the White House to sign the pact, which will closely tie the two countries together for years to come.",
      "Here's more about what the agreement says, and what it doesn't say.",
      "While the preliminary agreement references the importance of Ukraine's security, it leaves that matter to a separate agreement to be discussed between the leaders of the two countries.",
      "According to wording in the deal, the United States \u201csupports Ukraine\u2019s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace,\" and the U.S. has \u201ca long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cParticipants will seek to identify any necessary steps to protect mutual investments as defined in the Fund agreement,\u201d it states. \"The American people desire to invest alongside Ukraine in a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Speaking at a news conference Wednesday in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said his country \u201cneeds to know first where the United States stands on its continued military support.\u201d He said he expects to have a wide-ranging conversation with Trump during his visit to Washington.",
      "The economic agreement \"may be part of future security guarantees, but I want to understand the broader vision. What awaits Ukraine?\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "A senior Ukrainian official familiar with the matter told the AP on Wednesday that those discussions would take place independently from the establishment of the joint fund.",
      "The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations, said Kyiv believes the establishment of the fund would itself serve to bolster Ukraine\u2019s security since U.S. and Ukrainian investments would need to be protected amid continuing Russian attacks.",
      "Under the agreement, Ukraine will contribute 50% of future revenues to the joint fund from national assets including minerals, hydrocarbons, oil, natural gas and other extractable materials. Kyiv has hoped that access to those materials would incentivize the Trump administration to help secure a fair and lasting end to the war.",
      "The idea to involve the U.S. in Ukraine\u2019s natural resource wealth was initially proposed last fall by Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.",
      "Ukraine would also contribute half of its revenues from infrastructure relevant to the extraction, processing or transportation of its natural resources, but those contributions would not apply to assets that are already part of the Ukrainian government\u2019s budget revenue, such as state-owned oil and gas companies.",
      "Contributions to the fund will be reinvested annually in Ukraine to promote its \u201csafety, security and prosperity,\u201d the agreement says.",
      "The agreement states that revenues from its natural resources will go into the fund and be used for reconstruction of the country, not that ownership or control of those resources would be transferred to the United States.",
      "On Wednesday, a senior Ukrainian official told the AP that the U.S. will not own Ukraine's mineral and other resources. The official added that the fund would receive 50% of the revenues that come from natural resource deposits once they\u2019re developed.",
      "The deal does away with earlier Trump demands that Ukraine pay $500 billion as compensation for Washington\u2019s assistance until now. The senior Ukrainian official said that contributions to the fund do not constitute a repayment of any debt to the U.S. for its previous support during the war with Russia, but an investment in the future.",
      "The agreement states that the U.S. will maintain a long-term financial commitment to Ukraine\u2019s stability and economic prosperity, and could make further contributions outside the fund in the form of financial instruments and other assets critical for Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction.",
      "Ukrainian payments into the fund could provide a mechanism for any future U.S. assistance to be recouped in the long term, the Ukrainian official said.",
      "\u201cWe are not debtors,\u201d Zelenskyy said Wednesday, adding that, while he is grateful for previous U.S. support, Ukraine had not entered into any agreements that would require previous U.S. assistance to be repaid.",
      "\u201cThere were no such agreements in the past, so there is nothing to discuss in this regard,\u201d he said.",
      "The agreement will also seek to avoid conflict with any obligations Ukraine has to the European Union as it seeks membership in the bloc, or any potential conflicts with obligations to other financial institutions or creditors.",

      "Baltimore prosecutors have announced their decision to withdraw a motion to vacate Adnan Syed's murder conviction even as they support his recent request for a sentence reduction",
      "BALTIMORE -- Despite documented problems with the evidence against him and an earlier request from prosecutors to clear his record, Adnan Syed will remain convicted of murder, according to court papers filed Tuesday night.",
      "The decision from Baltimore prosecutors comes ahead of a scheduled hearing Wednesday morning where a judge will consider whether to reduce Syed\u2019s sentence, but this means the conviction itself is no longer in question.",
      "It\u2019s the latest wrinkle in an ongoing legal odyssey that garnered a massive following after being featured in the \u201cSerial\u201d podcast over a decade ago.",
      "Syed\u2019s attorneys recently filed the request for a sentence reduction under Maryland\u2019s Juvenile Restoration Act, a relatively new state law that provides a potential pathway to release for people serving long prison terms for crimes committed when they were minors. That request is supported by prosecutors.",
      "Meanwhile, Baltimore State\u2019s Attorney Ivan Bates announced Tuesday that his office is withdrawing a previously filed motion to vacate Syed\u2019s conviction in the 1999 killing of his high school ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, who was found strangled to death and buried in a makeshift grave.",
      "\u201cI did not make this decision lightly, but it is necessary to preserve the credibility of our office and maintain public trust in the justice system,\u201d Bates said in a statement.",
      "Syed\u2019s attorney Erica Suter issued a statement late Tuesday, criticizing the move and reasserting Syed\u2019s innocence.",
      "\u201cTonight, the state\u2019s attorney got it wrong,\u201d Suter said. \u201cHis decision to withdraw his office\u2019s motion to vacate Adnan\u2019s conviction ignores the injustices on which this conviction was founded. We will continue to fight to clear his name through all legal avenues available to him.\u201d",
      "The original motion to vacate \u2014 which was filed by Bates\u2019 predecessor Marilyn Mosby \u2014 won Syed his freedom in 2022. But his conviction was reinstated following a procedural challenge from Lee\u2019s family. The Maryland Supreme Court ordered a redo of the conviction vacatur hearing after finding that the family didn\u2019t receive adequate notice to attend in person.",
      "Since the prosecutor\u2019s office changed hands in the meantime, the decision of whether to withdraw the motion fell to Bates.",
      "Instead of asking a judge to again consider Syed\u2019s guilt or innocence, Bates chose a different path. He supported Syed\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence \u2014 without addressing the underlying conviction.",
      "Bates said that since his release in 2022, Syed has demonstrated he is a productive member of society whose continued freedom is \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d He said the case \u201cis precisely what legislators envisioned when they crafted the Juvenile Restoration Act.\u201d",
      "The legislation was passed amid growing consensus that such defendants are especially open to rehabilitation, partly because brain science shows cognitive development continues well beyond the teenage years. Syed was 17 when Lee was killed.",
      "Now 43, he has been working at Georgetown University\u2019s Prisons and Justice Initiative and caring for aging relatives since his release, according to court filings. His father died in October after a long illness.",
      "Bates was facing a Friday deadline to decide on the motion to vacate.",
      "After reviewing the motion filed by his predecessor, Bates concluded that it contained \u201cfalse and misleading statements that undermine the integrity of the judicial process,\u201d he said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Bates wrote in an executive summary released Tuesday that his decision \u201cdoes not preclude Mr. Syed from raising any new issues that he believes will support his innocence in the proper post-trial pleadings.\u201d",
      "\u201cHowever, properly shifting this burden back to Mr. Syed will re-instill the adversarial nature of proceedings that are the hallmark of the truth-seeking function of our criminal justice system,\u201d the summary says.",
      "Attorneys for the victim\u2019s family had argued that prosecutors should address the integrity of Syed\u2019s conviction before the court considered reducing his sentence. Prosecutors \u201cshould not be allowed to duck the issue by hiding behind\u201d his motion for a reduced sentence, attorneys wrote in a recent filing.",
      "Syed has maintained his innocence from the beginning, but many questions remain unanswered even after the \u201cSerial\u201d podcast combed through the evidence, reexamined legal arguments and interviewed witnesses. The series debuted in 2014 and drew millions of listeners who became armchair detectives.",
      "Rife with legal twists and turns, the case has recently pitted criminal justice reform efforts against the rights of crime victims and their families, whose voices are often at odds with a growing movement to acknowledge and correct systemic racism, police misconduct and prosecutorial missteps.",
      "When prosecutors sought to vacate Syed\u2019s conviction in 2022, they cited numerous problems with the case, including alternative suspects and unreliable evidence presented at trial. A judge agreed to vacate the conviction and free Syed. Prosecutors in Mosby\u2019s office later chose not to refile charges after they said DNA testing excluded Syed as a suspect.",
      "Even though the appellate courts reinstated his conviction, they allowed Syed to remain free while the case continued."

      "On March 21, 1977, shortly after 7:30 a.m., Honolulu police found the body of 16-year-old Dawn Momohara on the second floor of a school building. She was lying on her back, partially clothed with an orange cloth wrapped tightly around her neck and had been sexually assaulted and strangled, police said.",
      "Police used advances in DNA technology to connect Castro to the killing. They had interviewed Castro and his brother in 1977. But they were unable to conclusively link Castro to the killing until obtaining DNA samples in recent years.",

      "Attorneys for Lyle and Erik Menendez say California Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered the state parole board to investigate whether the brothers would pose a risk to the public if they are released after nearly three decades in prison for the 1989 killing ...",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Attorneys for Lyle and Erik Menendez said Wednesday that California Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered the state parole board to investigate whether the brothers would pose a risk to the public if they are released after nearly three decades in prison for the 1989 killing of their parents.",
      "The board will undertake a \u201ccomprehensive risk assessment\u201d into whether the brothers have been rehabilitated, according to Mark Geragos and Cliff Gardner. The defense attorneys said they were grateful for Newsom's decision.",
      "\u201cThe family realizes that the Governor\u2019s action does not mean he will commute the sentences. Instead, this initial step reflects the Governor\u2019s considered decision to at least obtain the information required to make a fair decision as to whether Erik and Lyle, after 35 years in prison, have done the hard work necessary to have a chance at a life outside prison,\u201d Geragos and Gardner said in a statement.",
      "No timeline was given for the board's investigation. A message seeking further details was sent Wednesday to the governor's office.",
      "The brothers are pursuing multiple avenues to win their freedom: Clemency from Newsom, a resentencing hearing, and a new trial. Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman said Friday that he opposes a new trial for the brothers, but he hasn\u2019t made up his mind on whether to support a resentencing bid that could lead to their freedom. Newsom has said he will not make a clemency decision until Hochman finishes reviewing the case.",
      "The brothers were found guilty in the murders of their entertainment executive father, Jose, and their mother, Kitty Menendez, and sentenced to life in prison without parole. They began their latest bid for freedom in recent years after their attorneys said new evidence of their father\u2019s sexual abuse emerged, and they have the support of most of their extended family.",
      "Hochman said he has filed an informal response urging the Los Angeles County Superior Court to reject a habeas petition filed by the brothers\u2019 attorneys in 2023 that seeks a reexamination of their case that centers in part the allegations that Jose Menendez sexually abused Erik Menendez.",
      "Hochman cast doubt on the evidence of abuse and said it was not pertinent to the case, disputing the claims that killings constituted self-defense. He also characterized the brothers\u2019 own testimony of sexual abuse as untrustworthy because they had told five different explanations for why they committed the murder.",
      "The Menendez family called Hochman\u2019s decision \u201cabhorrent\u201d and said he \u201cdiscredited the trauma\u201d experienced by the brothers.",
      "The family said in a statement last week that new evidence should not be needed, as the justice system failed the brothers back then and \u201ccontinues to fail them now.\u201d",
      "Lyle Menendez, who was then 21, and Erik Menendez, then 18, admitted they killed their parents with a shotgun, but they said they feared their parents were about to kill them to prevent disclosure of their father\u2019s long-term molestation of Erik.",
      "Prosecutors said at the time there was no evidence of molestation, and many details in the brothers\u2019 story of sexual abuse were not permitted in the trial that led to their conviction in 1996. Prosecutors accused the brothers of killing their parents for money.",
      "The proposed resentencing for the brothers is still set to be taken up at a March hearing and would make them immediately eligible for parole.",
      "Former Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n recommended last year the brothers be resentenced to 50 years to life. Gasc\u00f3n lost his bid for reelection in November to Hochman.",
      "The possible resentencing will take into account the brothers\u2019 rehabilitation during their time in prison. Hochman has met with the brothers\u2019 relatives as he reviews their case, which includes thousands of pages of prison records.",
      "The case has gained new traction after Netflix began streaming the true-crime drama \u201cMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story. \u201d"

      "President Donald Trump says he plans to offer a \u201cgold card\u201d visa with a path to citizenship for $5 million, replacing a 35-year-old visa for investors",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he plans to start selling a \u201cgold card\u201d visa with a potential pathway to U.S. citizenship for $5 million, seeking to have that new initiative replace a 35-year-old visa program for investors.",
      "\u201cIf we sell a million, that\u2019s $5 trillion dollars,\u201d Trump said during the first meeting of his second-term Cabinet, suggesting that the new revenue generated for federal coffers could be used to pay off the country\u2019s debt.",
      "\u201cI think we will sell a lot because I think there\u2019s really a thirst,\u201d Trump said of demand from the business community to participate.",
      "The president said of recipients that \u201cthey\u2019ll be wealthy and they\u2019ll be successful and they\u2019ll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it\u2019s going to be extremely successful.\u201d",
      "\u201cCompanies can buy gold cards and, in exchange, get those visas to hire new employees,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cNo other country can do this because people don\u2019t want to go to other countries. They want to come here,\" Trump said.",
      "\u201cEverybody wants to come here, especially since Nov. 5,\" he said of his Election Day victory last fall.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters during the same meeting that Trump's initiative would replace the EB-5 program, which offers U.S. visas to investors who spent about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people.",
      "Lutnick said that program \u201chas been around for many years for investment in projects\u201d but \u201cit was poorly overseen, poorly executed.\u201d",
      "The commerce secretary added that the gold card \u2014 which would actually work more like a green card, or permanent legal residency \u2014 would raise the price of admission for investors and do away with fraud and \u201cnonsense\u201d that he said characterize the EB-5 program. A pathway to citizenship as part of the new program also sets it apart from the EB-5 program.",
      "Trump said vetting people who might be eligible for the gold card will \u201cgo through a process\u201d that is still being worked out.",
      "Pressed on if there would be restrictions on people from China or Iran not being allowed to participate, Trump suggested it will likely not \u201cbe restricted to much in terms of countries, but maybe in terms of individuals.\"",
      "About 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics. The Congressional Research Service reported in 2021 that EB-5 visas pose risks of fraud, including verification that funds were obtained legally.",
      "Investors\u2019 visas are common around the world. Henley & Partners, an advisory firm, says more than 100 countries around the world offer \u201cgolden visas\u201d to wealthy individuals, including the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy.",
      "Trump made no mention of the requirements for job creation. And, while the number of EB-5 visas is capped, the Republican president mused that the federal government could sell 10 million \u201cgold cards\u201d to reduce the deficit. He said it \u201ccould be great, maybe it will be fantastic.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication,\" the president said. \u201cIt's a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country.\u201d",
      "Congress determines qualifications for citizenship, but Trump said \u201cgold cards\u201d would not require congressional approval."

      "Several nonprofit groups launched fundraising campaigns last week to help organizations who have lost funding because of the Trump administration\u2019s freeze on foreign assistance",
      "NEW YORK -- Though they know they can never replace all the money lost due to the Trump administration's freeze on foreign assistance, nonprofits are fundraising to help organizations struggling with the cuts.",
      "Unlock Aid, which advocates for U.S. Agency for International Development reforms, started the Foreign Aid Bridge Fund last week. It will take donations and make grants to groups around the world to try to avert some of the worst impacts of this policy change.",
      "Other groups including Founders Pledge and The Life You Can Save have also launched fundraising campaigns. The Network for Empowered Aid Response, a coalition of civil society organizations from developing countries, has opened a fund, though it\u2019s not accepting donations from individuals. GlobalGiving, a nonprofit that fundraises for grassroots international organizations, was one of the first to launch a campaign to support impacted groups.",
      "As part of a barrage of executive orders in his first days in office, President Donald Trump ordered a 90-day freeze on U.S. foreign assistance to review whether it aligned with his policies. Secretary of State Marco Rubio turned off the funding spigots essentially overnight. At the urging of billionaire advisor Elon Musk, mass layoffs of USAID staff followed.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re under any illusion that the Foreign Aid Bridge Fund is going to close the entirety of the gap,\u201d said Walter Kerr, co-executive director of the nonprofit Unlock Aid. \u201cBut I think in a moment like this, people need to do what they can.\u201d",
      "An independent group of advisors will decide on the grants and has already awarded several. While any organization can apply, it will prioritize giving to direct service providers and groups that have diversified sources of revenue.",
      "The U.S. spent $68 billion on foreign aid in 2023 and is the largest global funder of humanitarian responses. Programs funding HIV treatment, disease monitoring, child vaccinations, refugee support and malnutrition treatments have halted because of the freeze. Many in the international aid sector believe U.S. funding will never fully return.",
      "\u201cThis is not about ending foreign aid, but restructuring assistance to serve U.S. interests and ensure money spent on aid programs actually reaches people in need,\u201d said a State Department spokesperson in an emailed statement.",
      "A group of nonprofits sued over the freeze and a judge Tuesday ordered USAID and the State Department to resume payments by Thursday.",
      "Founders Pledge and The Life You Can Save said just the nonprofits they have previously supported face almost $100 million in funding shortfalls because of the freeze.",
      "Founders Pledge asks business people to promise a portion of the money they make from startups and investments to charities. They research and recommend different nonprofit programs their members can give to. Similarly, The Life You Can Save, founded by the Australian philosopher Peter Singer, recommends charities that work on reducing extreme poverty.",
      "David Goldberg, co-founder and CEO of Founders Pledge, hopes to raise tens of millions for their fund. But even \u201cfractions of that money save real lives, prevent people from dying needlessly who otherwise would live,\" he said. \"So I think everything matters and we should be aiming to have as much public support for this as possible.\u201d",
      "Their rapid response fund has already donated $100,000 and will only give to organizations they've already vetted, Goldberg said.",
      "The U.S. funding freeze has cascaded through the international development ecosystem. Many American businesses have also lost funding and thousands of American workers have lost jobs as the vast majority of U.S. foreign assistance actually went through U.S.-based organizations.",
      "\u201cI do deeply hope that philanthropy and individual donors step up in this moment. Philanthropy can never fill the gap that public funding fills,\u201d said Victoria Vrana, CEO of GlobalGiving. \u201cAnd yet, I do believe that organized philanthropy, corporate philanthropy, foundations can and should do more.\u201d",
      "When Unlock Aid began planning their bridge fund, they wanted to make it as easy as possible for donors to give. Their fund is sponsored by Panorama Global, a philanthropic consulting nonprofit, so people in the U.S. can claim a tax deduction. The donation link is hosted by Every.org, an online giving platform which can process payments from credit cards and stocks to cryptocurrencies.",
      "Amanda Arch, co-executive director of Unlock Aid, said their emergency fund has received gifts in all of those forms so far.",
      "\u201cWhen we think about the ability to do really quick and urgent mobilization, it\u2019s just amazing to see the infrastructure and how it\u2019s evolved to meet these types of moments,\u201d she said.",
      "They also reached out to people who had experience mobilizing money held in donor-advised funds (DAF), a type of investing vehicle for funds that are earmarked for nonprofits. Donors immediately get a tax benefit when they put money in a DAF, but there is no deadline when it must be given to a nonprofit.",
      "While major foundations have been listening to grantees and watching closely, few have announced major changes to their funding strategies, even in the face of so much need. People who consult with major foundations said they may be waiting to see what comes next from the administration and to see how ongoing court challenges play out.",
      "The amount of money stored in DAFs has ballooned in recent years from $148 billion in 2019 to $251 billion in 2023, according to the National Philanthropic Trust.",
      "Kerr and Arch spoke with Jennifer Risher, who started a pandemic-era campaign called #HalfMyDAF along with her husband, Lyft CEO David Risher, that asked donors to give away half the money in their DAF accounts. With the Rishers matching some donations, the campaign has tracked $70 million in gifts in four years.",
      "Risher said it was nice to take a tangible step and advise Unlock Aid.",
      "\u201cI love seeing them take action and setting a goal,\" she said. \"That\u2019s exciting to see.\u201d",

    "summary": "The energy giant has announced its strategy after rivals also rowed back on green energy plans.",
    "story": [
      "BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.",
      "The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.",
      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",
      "BP shareholders want it to make money, not climate policy",
      "BP set to scale back green investments as profits drop sharply",
      "BP to cut 4,700 jobs to reduce costs",
      "'Science hasn't changed'",
      "Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near \u00a34bn stake in the \u00a370bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.",
      "In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.",
      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",
      "Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".",
      "Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.",
      "Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work.",
      "\"I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told a committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",
      "The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",
      "But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",
      "In the five years since former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36%.",
      "In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.",
      "BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.",

      "After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels.",

      "But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.",
      "\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.",

      "That's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD.",
      "\"This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,\" adds Mr Vasques.",
      "Mr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: \"I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.",

      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",

    "story": [
      "Apple boss Tim Cook has said his company may have to change its diversity practices as the US legal landscape shifts.",
      "His comments came just minutes after a majority of shareholders rejected a proposal calling on the tech giant to consider ending its diversity policies, such as the use of race and sex in hiring decisions.",
      "Apple had urged shareholders to vote against the measure, which the company had argued was  \"inappropriately\" trying \"to micromanage\" its business.",
      "The scrutiny of the firm comes as US President Donald Trump has called for an end to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the government and private sector, including at Apple.",
      "In a social media post the day after the meeting, Trump ramped up the pressure on the company.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them,\" he wrote in a all-capital-letters post. \"DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\"",
      "Trump's DEI orders have run into legal roadblocks, but many companies in the US, including big names such as Meta, Amazon and Goldman Sachs, have already ended or rolled back their own policies, citing legal risks.",
      "Apple's decision to fight the shareholder proposal had bucked that tide.",
      "Shareholder measures opposed by companies rarely succeed, so the outcome of Tuesday's vote was expected.",
      "It marked the second high-profile defeat of shareholder proposal targeting DEI, after a similar rejection at retailer Costco.",
      "However, despite the vote, Mr Cook on Tuesday acknowledged that the firm may have to alter some of its practices.",
      "\"As the legal landscape around this issue evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply, but our north star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will never waver,\" Mr Cook said during a question-and-answer session at the company's annual shareholder meeting.",
      "He noted that Apple did not use \"quotas\" for hiring - a practice that has come in for some of the fiercest criticism - while saying the firm's strength came from a culture where \"people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives come together\".",
      "\"We'll continue to work together to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\" he added, saying the company would remain \"committed to the values that have always made us who we are\".",
      "The proposal targeting Apple's DEI policies was backed by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, which had also put forward the proposal at Costco.",
      "It argued that the existence of Apple's diversity and inclusion programmes exposed the firm to \"litigation, reputational and financial risks\", pointing to the wider corporate retreat and noting that recent lawsuits have made it easier for workers to sue over discrimination.",
      "Stefan Padfield of the organisation's Free Enterprise Project, who presented the proposal at Tuesday's meeting, said the risks to Apple had increased after the Trump administration recently ordered staff to investigate DEI in the private sector.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear,\" he said. \"DEI is out and merit is in.\"",
      "Apple's decision to push back against the shareholder proposal, while simultaneously opening the door to changing its policy is an effort to satisfy both sides of the fight, said Angela Jackson, a senior advisor to the Project on Workforce at Harvard University and author of the forthcoming book, The Win-Win Workplace.",
      "But she warned that it left Apple \"playing defence\". She said she wanted to see the company lead by making a more robust business case for the programmes.",
      "\"They've made the right moves. The one step they could go further... is to really say, 'Yes it's our values, we believe it's the right thing to do, but it's also an economic imperative.\"",
      "The fight over DEI in the US has raised questions about whether such policies in other countries will face similar challenges.",
      "Catherine Howarth, chief executive of the responsible investment charity ShareAction, said she thought that Apple - a global, consumer-facing firm - had made the bet that the benefits of pushing back against the shareholder proposal outweighed the risks.",
      "\"It's not popular with consumers and it's not popular with employees to abandon what were supposedly your principles in this area until very recently,\" she said.",
      "\"They think it would go down very badly - and it would - with their global consumer base.\"",
      "Shareholders also rejected proposals that would have required Apple to report about its AI privacy practices, charitable giving and policies to combat child sex abuse.",
      "They backed the board members supported by the company, as well as its executive compensation, including a pay package for Mr Cook worth more than $74m."

    "story": [
      "Nuclear scientists believe they have found a way to transform the supply of vital material used for scanning cancer patients.",
      "Doctors use so-called radioisotopes to pinpoint the growth of cancer in patients. But the radioactive material is all produced by ageing reactors outside the UK, and sometimes the supply is interrupted.",
      "Dr Tom Wallace-Smith, technical director of Bristol's Astral Systems, said they developed a technique that produces the material here in the UK.",
      "He said this has the potential to \"eliminate the delays that have plagued\" cancer treatments.",
      "The team in Bristol have come up with a whole new approach, using nuclear fusion rather than fission.",
      "And rather than requiring a new nuclear plant, which would cost about \u00a3400m to build, they can develop the material in small plants \"right by hospitals\" for about \u00a31m, Dr Wallace-Smith said.",
      "Every year, radiologists scan about 300,000 patients using these radioactive radioisotopes, with consultants saying they would not be able to do their work without them.",
      "In October, the world of nuclear medicine was hit by a major crisis. Outside the niche speciality, few noticed because doctors and health managers implemented a rapidly assembled rationing system for vital scans.",
      "Britain gets all of its supply from three reactors in Europe. In October two of them shut down for planned maintenance at the same time, and then the third sprung a fault.",
      "\"Something like 75% of our supply was lost,\" said Dr Stephen Harden, from the Royal College of Radiologists.",
      "All patients needing urgent diagnostic scans were seen on time, but thousands of more routine check-ups were delayed.",
      "The interruption only lasted three weeks, but it highlighted what Dr Harden called the \"ageing and fragile\" supply chain.",
      "He explained: \"It makes a really strong case for making these radioisotopes in the UK.\"",
      "In 2017 a UK Government report said six nuclear reactors made 85% of the radioisotopes used worldwide. By 2030, five of them will be retired.",
      "Many of these reactors were built in the 1960s and 1970s.  Building a new one is expensive and takes years.",
      "In North Wales, there are plans to build such a reactor, which will cost \u00a3400m.",
      "Like all nuclear fission plants, they are controversial. Their raw material is uranium, and the radioisotopes they produce are, by design, radioactive.",
      "Astral Systems has developed technology that can now make the same radioisotopes used in hospitals, on demand.",
      "Small reactors could be built for under \u00a31m, less than the price of the scanner that uses the radioactive product.",
      "Now, the team is building a new kind of fusion reactor, which will be able to produce any kind of radioisotope for research or medicine, right by the hospitals that need it.",
      "At the Bristol Royal Infirmary, I watched as a patient lay on the scanner bed, ready for his session. He was fully clothed, but the vital preparation was internal.",
      "\"Three hours before the scan, we inject patients with a tiny amount of radioactivity,\" explained consultant radiologist, Dr Randeep Kulshrestha.",
      "The radioisotope is tagged to substances that will go to whatever area doctors are interested in, for example the bones.",
      "The camera will then pick up the radioactivity in such a way that doctors can see how, for example, a cancer has spread.",
      "Dr Kulshrestha showed me pictures taken from an anonymous patient, where doctors suspected cancer had spread from his prostate to his bones.",
      "Sadly for the person involved, the images are stark. Areas on the bones are lit up orange, where the cancer has grown on their bones.",

      "This includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.",
      "It is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries.",
      "Other elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors.",
      "Deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant.",
      "Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",
      "Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.",
      "Dr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access to revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.",

      "Additionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.",
      "In December, China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.",
      "How would a deal help Kyiv exploit its minerals?",
      "Some commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\", but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.",
      "According to the World Economic Forum, Ukraine has about 20,000 mineral deposits covering 116 types, but only about 15% of sites were being actively exploited at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "For instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.",
      "Developing these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine.",
      "She argues that if Ukraine can attract US investors to help develop its natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.",
      "\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\""

    "title": "Can Canadians get the world drinking tree sap?",
    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 00:11:34 GMT",
    "summary": "The largest producer of maple syrup now wants you to drink the sap, which it calls maple water.",
    "story": [
      "While drinking tree sap does not immediately sound appealing, Canadian producers are hoping that it will be the next must-try soft drink around the world.",
      "We have all heard of maple syrup, which is made by boiling down the sap of maple trees to produce a thick, sweet, golden-to-brown coloured syrup that is typically poured over pancakes.",
      "What is far less well known is that you can drink the sap itself, which is called maple water. Clear in colour, it contains just 2% natural sugars, so it is only slightly sweet.",
      "A small but growing number of producers in Canada are now selling this maple water in bottles or cartons, after first giving it a filter and pasteurisation to kill off any microbes.",
      "\"People feel like they're drinking the wild Canadian forest,\" says Yannick Leclerc of Maple3, a producer of maple water drinks, based in Quebec City.",
      "Advocates point to the fact it is a natural drink, and makers hope that it can steal some sales from the existing similar product \u2013 coconut water. The latter is made from water that naturally forms inside coconuts.",
      "As Canada is far and away the world's largest producer of maple syrup \u2013 accounting for more than 80% of production \u2013 it is understandable that the nascent maple water sector is also Canadian. Furthermore, it is centred on the province of Quebec, which makes 90% of Canada's maple syrup.",
      "Mr Leclerc says that Maple3 is one of the pioneers of the sector. \"Nobody [previously] thought about keeping the sap for its hydration purposes verses just boiling it into syrup.\"",
      "He founded the company back in 2013 with business partner St\u00e9phane Nolet. In recent years an increasing number of other producers have entered the marketplace.",
      "Mr Leclerc claims that Maple3 has doubled its annual profits since 2021, with sales not just rising across Canada, but in 12 other countries, including France, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Some 75% of its sales now come from overseas, and it sells both still and sparkling maple water, and fizzy versions with added natural fruit flavourings.",
      "\"It's more than just a local product at this point,\" adds Mr Leclerc.",
      "For the maple water industry as a whole, one recent report predicts big growth. It estimated that global sales in 2024 totalled $506m (\u00a3409m), with that expected to jump to $2.6bn by 2033.",
      "By comparison, worldwide sales of coconut water reached $7.7bn in 2023, with that expected to grow to $22.9bn by 2029. So maple water has a long way to catch up.",
      "Meanwhile, the global value of the maple syrup market was $1.7bn last year, according to one study.",
      "Beth Czerwony, a dietician with the non-profit medical centre Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, says the growing popularity of maple water is linked to its perceived health benefits.",
      "\"When the sap itself is filtered through the tree, it ends up absorbing a bunch of antioxidants,\" she says. \"So they're gonna end up having a better performance and a faster workout recovery.\"",
      "However, one medical study from 2019 concluded that maple water was \"was not superior in rehydration\" to normal water.",
      "Jeremy Kinsella owns The Soda Pop Bros in Windsor Ontario, which sells soft drinks under its own brand name, as well as imports from around the world.",
      "His family have been in the industry for nearly a century, and in his lifetime he has seen a fair share of trends come and go.",
      "He says that if maple water is to go mainstream it needs the financial backing and promotion of one of the huge global soft drinks firms.",
      "\"It will take a larger soda manufacturer for it to really catch on,\" he says.",
      "Mr Kinsella also says that the price of maple water is currently too high. \"When it comes down to it, someone's looking at a can of Coke for a buck and they're looking at a can of maple water for three bucks, they're going to try it a couple of times and go back to Coke,\" he says.",
      "Marketing maple water more would certainly help it increase sales, says John Tomory, who helps run Pefferlaw Creek Farms in Uxbridge, Ontario. He and his brothers have been making maple syrup commercially for almost 10 years, and for the past four they have also been selling the sap to a Canada brand called Sap Sucker. This makes sparkling sap water with different added flavours, from lime to grapefruit, and lemon to orange.",
      "Mr Tomory says he agrees with this approach to make the sap more interesting. \"I know a lot of people have tried just selling the sap as it is, just basic sap from the tree and it's still, but they haven't really caught on,\" he says.",
      "\"So I think carbonating it and adding fruit flavour makes it more interesting. That's the real innovation.\"",
      "Back at Maple3 in Quebec, Mr Leclerc also thinks that the sparkling version of the drink could be the more popular: \"It has perks that a normal sparkling water doesn't have,\" he says, such as a more interesting flavour, without having all the bad stuff that [regular] soda has.\""

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:40:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Quantum computers will be able to crack existing encryption and threaten critical infrastructure.",
    "story": [
      "Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky.",
      "Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal.",
      "Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world\u2019s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated.",
      "That\u2019s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack.",
      "Quantum computing is radically different to the \u201cclassical\u201d computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states \u2013 one or zero, on or off \u2013 quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.",
      "\u201cThe reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,\u201d Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's \u201cmuch, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.\u201d",
      "This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.",
      "The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today\u2019s computer networks.",
      "Today\u2019s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.",
      "This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. \u201cAnything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,\u201d says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2.",
      "Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away.",
      "But progress is being made.",
      "In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer\".",
      "Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today\u2019s systems have a few hundred at most.",
      "But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.",
      "Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, \u201cWhat data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?\u201d",
      "That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.",
      "Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.",
      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",
      "These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment \u2013 legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example \u2013 might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.",
      "Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but \u201cIt's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.\u201d",
      "So, it is trying to help customers build \u201ccrypto agility\u201d by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. \u201cThat's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.\u201d",
      "And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites \u2013 such as the Starlink network \u2013 should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.",
      "\u201cAt any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,\u201d Prof Sastry says. \u201cSo, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.\u201d",
      "More challenging, he says, are \u201cremote sensing\u201d satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",
      "While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol.",
      "By contrast, he adds, that it is not possible to predict when current encryption will become vulnerable.",

      "\"The harm is greatest to those children who have not been able to get help at home, or whose parents can't afford to pay for extra tutoring.",
      "\"But behind this is a deeper problem. The Scottish government has never had a coherent strategy for dealing with the educational effects of poverty.\"",
      "He added that there was nothing intrinsically wrong with pupils leaving after S4 as long as they have something worthwhile to go to.",
      "Just under 56,000 young people left school last year \u2013 the highest number since 2010.",
      "More than 95% went on to positive destinations such as university, college, employment, some training and voluntary work. This was slightly lower than the previous year but one of the highest levels since 2010.",
      "More than 67% of school leavers last year were in higher or further education three months later.",
      "Gilruth told BBC Scotland News progress on closing the attainment gap was being made, but that the increase was \"disappointing\".",
      "She said: \"It is important to distinguish today's statistics on S4 leavers from overall progress made to close the attainment gap in Scotland.",
      "\"There are clearly positive signs for the future as we are seeing a record low poverty-related attainment gap in primary school literacy and in S3 literacy and numeracy.",
      "\"While it is disappointing that the attainment gap has widened slightly at SCQF Levels 4, 5 and 6, it's important to note that we have reduced the gap between the most and least deprived young people entering positive destinations by two thirds since 2009-10, the second lowest gap on record.\"",
      "Gilruth added that the number of school leavers at S4 had remained stable, and that the government was exploring reasons why teenagers chose to leave school at that time.",
      "Scottish Conservative education spokesman Miles Briggs said: \"After years of insisting that education is their priority, the SNP have been missing in action while ministers have let down pupils and teachers at every turn.",
      "\"Under John Swinney's government, it's our most deprived students who now face the narrowest options and the worst prospects.\""

    "story": [
      "The government has announced the first 750 schools to provide free daily breakfast clubs as part of a pilot scheme ahead of a planned England-wide rollout.",
      "Starting in April, 180,000 pupils in England will be offered \"healthy, varied and nutritious breakfasts\" in schools before class, Labour said - with over a third of schools in the pilot scheme in deprived areas.",
      "But some MPs and head teachers' unions have raised concerns the funding is too low.",

      "Free school meals 'would tackle child poverty'",
      "Parents will be able to drop off children 30 minutes before their usual school time, knowing they will be offered a free breakfast, the government says.",

      "Analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the funding proposed for the breakfast clubs could be enough to fund all primary school pupils under a food-only model, or 60% of pupils if it had some childcare element.",
      "O'Brien questioned how the education secretary was planning to close that funding gap.",
      "But Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told the House of Commons she was \"confident\" the funding would be adequate.",
      "One in seven schools involved in the pilot had no before-school provision already in place, Phillipson said, and the rest either have paid-for provision or have their numbers capped.",
      "\"These breakfast clubs that we are introducing will be free to every child and every parent who seeks to take them up,\" she said.",
      "Phillipson did not confirm when the national rollout of the scheme would take place, but said it would be \"as soon as possible\".",
      "'Really worried'",
      "The Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Pepe Di'Iasio  said head teachers were \"really worried\"  the basic daily rate of just 60p per pupil was far too low.",
      "\"We strongly urge the government to be more realistic about the costs involved, before it attempts to roll out this policy nationally,\" he said.",
      "The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) has welcomed the news but also voiced concern that funding could fall short.",
      "\"It will be crucial that these concerns are addressed before the programme is rolled out across the country, to ensure that it does not place further pressure on already strained school budgets,\" said NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman.",
      "Announcing the first 750 schools to join the pilot scheme, the Department for Education said breakfast clubs had \"an important role to play in the government's commitment to remove the stain of child poverty\".",

    "story": [
      "Staff at Dundee University have begun three weeks of strike action over the institution's plans to cut jobs due to a potential \u00a330m deficit.",
      "The University and College Union (UCU) Scotland said that 74% of its members had backed strike action, on a turnout of 64%.",
      "More than 450 UCU members, comprising academic and support staff, will strike each weekday for the next three weeks. It is expected lectures and classes will be cancelled.",
      "Dundee University said the action was \"premature\" and had been voted for by less than 10% of the university's staff.",
      "The university currently employs more than 3,000 people.",
      "Former principal Prof Iain Gillespie told staff in November that job losses were \"inevitable\" and blamed \"an extremely challenging period\" for the UK higher education sector.",
      "Prof Gillespie resigned a month later after the university defended a \u00a37,000 business trip he took to Hong Kong with a colleague.",
      "Amanda Millar, the university's court chairwoman, resigned with immediate effect last week.",
      "Senior lecturer and local UCU branch co-president Dr Melissa D'Ascenzio said: \"We are striking against the threat of compulsory redundancies.",
      "\"What is clear to us is that the deficit has not been caused by staff costs.",
      "\"We were told for months in 2024 that we were doing really well, that the University of Dundee was doing better than other Scottish universities.",
      "\"Then suddenly in November there was this change in the financial position and we were told we had this big deficit.",
      "\"If we don't really know what has caused this financial crisis, then cutting staff is not the answer.\"",
      "The university's interim principal Prof Shane O'Neill told BBC Scotland News that he was \"very disappointed\" at the strike action.",
      "He said: \"While we're aware we have significant financial problems to address, and we haven't hidden from the fact that inevitably that will lead to some job losses, we've not shared the detail of the plan yet.",
      "\"The issue for them (UCU) is that we can't rule out compulsory redundancies and we've acknowledged that.",
      "\"But I very much put it to them that it's really disappointing because it does seem premature, and also I'm not clear who's gaining anything from it.\"",
      "A rally and public meeting was held on Monday lunchtime in Dundee city centre, with speakers including trades union leaders and local politicians.",
      "A three-week ballot of members of the Unison trade union - which represents present professional services staff at the university - on strike action will begin on Tuesday.",
      "Dundee University's court will meet on the same day to discuss the financial situation, but any details of a recovery plan will not be announced until early next month."

      "However, only three children were charged or summoned to court, while seven received youth cautions and 12 were given youth conditional cautions.",

      "In a further 15 instances \"evidential difficulties\" resulted in cases being halted.",
      "In 27 cases, victims withdrew support for police action, while 16 cases were dealt with by partner agencies and five were not pursued due to concerns about whether prosecution was in the public interest.",

      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "The class photo, a highlight of the film calendar, is usually taken much earlier in awards season, at the nominees luncheon, but that event was cancelled this year due to the LA wildfires.",
      "Here are 12 things we spotted in this year's class photo:",
      "1. Ariana and Cynthia held space at the front",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have spent the last few months crying, holding space and stroking each other's fingers as they promoted the screen adaptation of Wicked.",
      "The two actresses have redefined the film press tour in recent weeks thanks to their absolute adoration for each other - an energy they will have to recreate later this year when they do it all again for the release of part two.",
      "Before the photo was taken, instead of saying cheese, Erivo shouted: \"Everyone say 'Oscar nominee!'\"",
      "Last week, it was confirmed the pair will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony which will last a reported 10 minutes long.",
      "Wicked is the closest thing the Oscars have this year to a box office smash in the shape of last year's Barbie, and they'll be hoping the medley will recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.",
      "2. We absolutely need this woman's jumper",
      "We're aware the weather is getting warmer and the sun is rising earlier as we hurtle towards Spring, but we are nevertheless always on the lookout for a colourful cosy jumper and we need to investigate the origin of this one as an urgent priority.",
      "The woman with the impeccable sweater selection in the class photo is Maya Gnyp - a producer of I Am Ready, Warden - which is nominated for best documentary short.",
      "The film follows Texas death row inmate John Henry Ramire in his final days.",
      "3. A-listers packed out the front row",
      "Joining Ariana and Cynthia on the front row were fellow acting nominees Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro.",
      "Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.",
      "As a result, her fellow category nominees such as Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, have had to practise their best \"I'm just happy to be nominated\" faces this year.",
      "Madison, however, is a co-frontrunner in a tight race for leading actress. The Anora star is up against Demi Moore for The Substance in a category seen as a dead heat.",
      "4. James Mangold turned up just in time",
      "James Mangold, nominated this year for A Complete Unknown, is one of Hollywood's most respected and loved directors.",
      "So why is he sitting on an aisle seat in the second-back row, away from all his pals, looking sheepish?",
      "It's probably because he only just made the class photo by the skin of his teeth, arriving late to the event to an affectionate collective groan followed by cheers from his fellow nominees.",
      "Despite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard.",
      "5. We'd like to be the fifth member of this gang",
      "In a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating.",
      "They are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari.",
      "The movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan.",
      "6. The biggest stars were in the back row",
      "Sitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race.",
      "In the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself.",
      "She is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown.",
      "7. Bernie and Brandi appeared without Elton",
      "Also hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile.",
      "The pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary.",
      "Sir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair.",
      "It's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year.",
      "Instead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley.",
      "8. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet looked a little lonely",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown.",

      "Recalling one example of comedic cross cultural confusion on episode one of the new show, he added: \"The question for all the contestants was, what is the name of the piece of least value on a chessboard?",
      "\"Bang, goes [Swedish contestant] Ida-Britt, and looked at me and said: 'the farmer'.",
      "\"'Right, I think not' [he replied]. But we checked, only to discover that in Sweden, a pawn is in the shape of a little Swedish farmer. So she was right!\"",

    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 musicians - including Annie Lennox, Damon Albarn and Kate Bush - released a silent album on Tuesday in protest at the UK government's planned changes to copyright law, which they say would make it easier for AI companies to train models using copyrighted work without a licence.",
      "Under the new proposals, AI developers will be able to use creators' content on the internet to help develop their models, unless the rights holders elect to \"opt out\".",
      "The artists hope the album, entitled Is This What We Want?, will draw attention to the potential impact on livelihoods and the UK music industry.",
      "All profits will be donated to the charity Help Musicians.",
      "\"In the music of the future, will our voices go unheard?\" Kate Bush said in a statement.",
      "A public consultation on the legal changes closes later on Tuesday.",
      "The album - also backed by the likes of Billy Ocean, Ed O'Brien of Radiohead and Bastille's Dan Smith, as well as The Clash, Mystery Jets and Jamiroquai - features sound recordings of empty studios and performance spaces, demonstrating what the artists fear is the potential impact of the proposed law change.",
      "The tracklisting for the record simply spells out the message: \"The British government must not legalise music theft to benefit AI companies.\"",
      "The government is currently consulting on proposals that would allow AI companies to use material that is available online without respecting copyright if they are using it for text or data mining.",
      "Generative AI programmes mine, or learn, from vast amounts of data like text, images, or music online to generate new content which feels like it has been made by a human.",
      "The proposals would give artists or creators a so-called \"rights reservation\" \u2013 the ability to opt out.",
      "But critics of the plan believe it is not possible for an individual writer or artist to notify thousands of different AI service providers that they do not want their content used in that way, or to monitor what has happened to their work across the whole internet.",
      "A spokesman for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said in a statement on Tuesday that the UK's \"current regime for copyright and AI is holding back the creative industries, media and AI sector from realising their full potential - and that cannot continue\".",
      "\"That's why we have been consulting on a new approach that protects the interests of both AI developers and right holders and delivers a solution which allows both to thrive.",

      "Composer Max Richter, another of the artists involved in the album, noted how the plans not only have an impact on musicians but \"impoverish creators\" across the board, from writers to visual artists and beyond.",
      "In 2023, UK music contributed a record \u00a37.6 billion to the economy.",
      "Organiser of the silent record, Ed Newton-Rex, said the proposals were not only \"disastrous for musicians\" in the UK but also \"totally unnecessary\", as the country can be \"leaders in AI without throwing our world-leading creative industries under the bus\".",
      "He said the new record showed that \"however the government tries to justify it, musicians themselves are united in their thorough condemnation of this ill-thought-through plan.\"",
      "Singer-songwriter Naomi Kimpenu added: \"We cannot be abandoned by the government and have our work stolen for the profit of big tech.\"",
      "She said the plans would \"shatter the prospects of so many emerging artists in the UK\".",
      "In January, Sir Paul McCartney told the BBC the proposed changes to copyright law could allow \"rip off\" technology that might make it impossible for musicians and artists to make a living.",

    "story": [
      "The Traitors contestant Elen Wyn has said she was laughed at by a GP and told she had a low pain threshold during her 10-year wait for an endometriosis diagnosis.",
      "Elen, from Anglesey, said she suffered with pain that felt like \"barbed wire around her stomach\" before her diagnosis, which she was told was \"just period pains\".",
      "She added GPs needed to treat women's health with greater sensitivity and called for better funding from the Welsh government.",
      "The Welsh government said it was spending \u00a33m on a women's health hub in each health board by March 2026.",
      "Women waiting 10 years for endometriosis diagnosis",
      "'Why is my endometriosis treatment not urgent?'",
      "Endometriosis cost me my job",
      "The Traitors star, originally from Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy in Anglesey - who was eliminated on episode two - said she was diagnosed just before appearing on the reality show in 2024 - 10 years after her symptoms started.",
      "Elen, now 24, said when her periods began at 14, she frequently missed school and sat out of sport, but a GP insisted she just had a low pain tolerance.",
      "She said she was offered a contraceptive pill, which is one of the treatment options available, if she was really struggling, but she did not feel comfortable with this option while not sexually active.",
      "She said she continued to suffer so badly she was unable to walk or leave the house.",
      "\"Sometimes it's like you're being repeatedly stabbed,\" she said.",
      "\"I knew it wasn't normal regardless of what I was told.\"",
      "She began to piece together that her symptoms closely aligned with endometriosis after seeing other sufferers on TikTok and, while studying in Cardiff when she was about 21, tried again to push for answers from medical professionals.",
      "\"I saw another GP but he said the same, that my pain tolerance was too low.",
      "\"I remember him laughing at me, it was awful,\" she said.",
      "Elen then requested to see a female GP, who she said \"completely validated\" her and agreed she could have endometriosis.",
      "But when both an ultrasound and an MRI scan came back clear of the condition, Elen pushed for a laparoscopy, and it was only then that her stage four endometriosis was detected.",
      "The disease had spread across Elen's bowel, bladder, fallopian tubes and kidney and, while she is currently on a four-year waiting list for surgery, she has been using her TikTok account to raise awareness about the condition.",
      "What is endometriosis?",
      "Endometriosis is a gynaecological condition associated with menstruation where tissue similar to the lining of the womb is found in other areas of the body, including the fallopian tubes, pelvis, bowel, vagina and intestines.",
      "In rare cases it has even been found in the lungs, eyes, spine and brain. It was once thought that the only place in the body where endometriosis did not occur was the spleen, but in 2020 it was found there also.",
      "Symptoms include severe to debilitating pain often in the pelvic area, fatigue, and heavy periods, and the condition is also associated with infertility.",
      "Research by charity Endometriosis UK found the average diagnosis time for endometriosis in Wales was nine years and 11 months in 2024.",
      "This was the longest diagnosis time across the UK and had increased from nine years in 2020.",
      "Elen said she was given no support from her GP while she awaited her diagnosis, adding: \"I have been offered the coil or the pill, [but] other than that I was given nothing which is so frustrating.\"",
      "She said through her own research she had made changes to her lifestyle to manage her condition, including cutting down her alcohol and caffeine intake as well as engaging in low-impact exercise and prioritising sleep.",
      "\"I don't suffer nearly as much as I used to... [but] I have done that all on my own,\" she said.",
      "She added: \"I think a narrative needs to be erased here. Because it's a condition associated with female hormones, people tend to link the symptoms with being dramatic and it's really frustrating to me.",
      "\"There is so much stigma around it and I think that stigma needs to be deleted.\"",
      "Elen has called on the Welsh government to offer more funding, better information and greater sensitivity to women's health.",
      "\"I think GPs need to spend more time exploring symptoms and offering other solutions rather than just the pill or the coil, it's ridiculous,\" she said.",
      "The Welsh government said endometriosis was one of the eight priorities outlined  in its Women's Health Plan for Wales.",
      "\"We have already funded endometriosis nurses in every health board, developed the Endometriosis Cymru website and provided \u00a350 million of additional funding to help cut the longest waiting times, which includes gynaecological conditions,\" it said.",
      "It added \u00a33m would be used to establish a Women's Health Hub in every health board by March 2026, \"to support timely diagnosis and management of menstrual conditions including endometriosis\".",

      "\"She died peacefully surrounded by her family. Roberta broke boundaries and records. She was also a proud educator.\"",
      "Flack had previously announced in 2022 that she had motor neurone disease, and could no longer sing.",
      "Born in North Carolina and raised in Arlington, Virginia, the musician started out as a classical pianist. She gained a full school scholarship to Howard University aged just 15. Her classical training led her into teaching, but at night she'd accompany opera singers on piano, singing pop standards during the breaks.",
      "\"The whole while I was studying classical music, especially in my younger years, I was also doing a lot of doo-ron-ron, shoo-doo-bee-doo, all of that stuff, with my peers, so I've been fortunate enough to be surrounded by music all of my life, the Bach and the Chopin and the Schumann on one hand, and all the rhythm and blues,\" she explained.",
      "Her recording career started after she was discovered singing in a jazz club by musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known\".",
      "But she didn't score her first hit until she was in her 30s - when her recording of Ewan MacColl's The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face was used to soundtrack an explicit love scene in Clint Eastwood's 1971 film Play Misty For Me.",
      "It was subsequently named song of the year at the Grammys. Flack won the award a second time the following year, for Killing Me Softly With His Song.",
      "After topping the charts again in 1974 with Feel Like Makin' Love, Flack took a break from performing to concentrate on recording and charitable causes.",
      "She spent much of the 1980s touring and over the course of her career, worked with artists including Donny Hathaway and Miles Davis.",
      "In 1991 she returned to the charts with a duet with Maxi Priest called Set the Night to Music (from the album of the same name).",
      "She also recorded an album of Beatles covers, called Let It Be Roberta, in 2012.",
      "'True soul'",
      "According to the Guardian, Flack once told a journalist: \"What I consider myself is a soulful singer, in that I try to sing with all the feeling that I have in my body and my mind.",
      "\"A person with true soul is one who can take anybody's song and transcend all the flaws, the technique and just make you listen.\"",

      "Reverend Jesse Jackson once described her as \"socially relevant and politically unafraid\".",
      "In 2020, a year after having a stroke, Flack was awarded a lifetime achievement award from the Grammys.",
      "\"It's a tremendous and overwhelming honour,\" she said at the time.",
      "\"I've tried my entire career to tell stories through my music. This award is a validation to me that my peers heard my thoughts and took in what I have tried to give.\"",
      "Flack's most famous song was introduced to a new generation of music fans when Lauryn Hill's hip-hop group The Fugees recorded a Grammy-winning cover of Killing Me Softly, which they would eventually perform on-stage alongside her.",

    "summary": "Covid inquiry says hearings into the firm, led by Michelle Mone's husband, must be held in closed session.",
    "story": [
      "The chair of the Covid inquiry has ruled that evidence related to PPE Medpro, the firm linked to Baroness Michelle Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman, will be heard in a closed, private session next month.",
      "On 3 March, the inquiry will begin four weeks of hearings into decisions to buy Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.",
      "Baroness Hallett said she was imposing the restriction as she was satisfied there was a risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings if \"sensitive evidence\" was heard in public.",
      "Victims' groups and media outlets, including the BBC, had argued the dangers were overstated, given the early stage of the police investigation and the material already in the public domain.",
      "Witness evidence",
      "The National Crime Agency (NCA) opened an investigation into PPE Medpro in May 2021 into suspected criminal offences committed in the procurement of PPE.",
      "The company was awarded government contracts worth more than \u00a3200m after Baroness Mone recommended the firm to ministers during the Covid pandemic.",
      "Baroness Mone, 52, and Mr Barrowman, 59, have denied wrongdoing.",
      "In June 2024, the NCA said an unnamed 46-year-old man from Barnet, north London, had been arrested as part of its investigation.",
      "To date, no criminal charges have been brought and the Crown Prosecution Service has not been formally instructed by the NCA.",
      "On 9 December 2024, the Covid inquiry said it had received an application from the NCA for a restriction order, claiming there was a risk of harm to its investigation if sensitive evidence about PPE Medpro was heard in public.",
      "The NCA originally wanted to prevent the inquiry hearing any evidence about the company, saying \"other contracts could be selected\".",
      "It then asked for 26 witness statements written by its staff to be withheld, and an order to be made preventing certain questions about the firm to be asked in the inquiry room in a public session.",
      "It argued those restrictions should include the identity of any person under investigation; evidence relating to the opinion of any government official concerning PPE Medpro's contracts; and evidence about payments to the company and who ultimately benefited.",
      "In its submission, it said there was a \"realistic possibility that criminal charges against one or more individuals will flow from the investigation\".",
      "The Department of Health later asked for the terms of any restriction order to be widened to include any \"financial material and correspondence\" relating to the purchase of PPE from the company, although that request has been rejected by the inquiry.",
      "In her final ruling, Baroness Hallett said it was both \"necessary and proportionate\" for the Covid inquiry to examine contracts between the government and PPE Medpro.",
      "But she did accept there was a risk of damage to any future criminal proceedings if she allowed all the evidence to be heard in public.",
      "As a result, any sensitive evidence about the company will be heard in a private, closed hearing, expected to be held in late March.",
      "She said the NCA's original application, which also sought to have members of the press and other organisations excluded from those closed sessions, went \"further than necessary\" and was \"too wide an approach\".",
      "Representatives of five media organisations will be invited to attend but will not be able to report on the proceedings until the conclusion of any criminal case, including possible appeals.",
      "Baroness Hallett said that decision was in line with previous public inquiries, including the investigation into the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury.",
      "A spokesman for the NCA said its investigation into PPE Medpro \"remains a priority\".",
      "\"In such cases it can take considerable time to ensure that a thorough, independent and objective investigation is conducted,\" he added."

      "He realised she had no idea who he was - despite the fact he was the surgeon who had carried out her procedure.",

      "\"I only know from what my parents have told me,\" Weronika told BBC Scotland News.",
      "\"The doctors were checking if I knew them - I remember so many faces I hadn't seen before.",

      "\"I remember looking at my clothes and thinking who would wear this?\"",
      "Weronika, from Prestonpans near Edinburgh, said she knew it was ok to be there, but said her whole personality, and her family relationships, changed.",
      "She said: \"They never lost that connection with me, but even now, I don't think my relationship is as close as they would want it \u2013 I am more isolated and have been my own person since the surgery.",

      "Back at high school, she struggled. She did not recognise any of her friends, and, starting over, she gravitated to different people.",

      "He will have to identify what is tumour and what is normal tissue then resect - or cut - around it without taking tissue that would affect brain function.",
      "Mr Liaquat said: \"Preserving cognitive function is very important - it's the essence of who we are as an individual and that can be disrupted by surgeons. We carry the complications and push the barriers of optimal resection and that does bear on you.\"",
      "He added that it was imperative to remove as much as possible.",
      "\"Evidence for tumours like Weronikas is that we need to remove at least 80-90% of the tumour to add survival advantage.\"",
      "Assisting in the operating theatre is the man who performed Weronika's original surgery when she was a teenager - consultant neurosurgeon Drahoslav Sokol.",

      "He said: \"She means everything to me - absolutely everything. If she was to lose her memory I would just have to make her fall in love with me all over again and take it from there.\"",
      "Practically, Weronika wrote down all her banking details and passwords, organised a will, and wrote a letter to her partner for the worst-case scenario.",
      "Coming round from her operation, the room held its breath.",

      "A scanner developed in Aberdeen could be potentially \"extraordinary\" for diagnosing and treating breast cancer, it has been claimed.",
      "Scientists from the University of Aberdeen used a prototype version of the new Field Cycling Imager (FCI) scanner to examine the breast tissue of patients newly-diagnosed with cancer.",
      "They said they found that the FCI scanner could distinguish tumour material from healthy tissue with more accuracy than current Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) methods.",
      "While similar to MRI - which was also developed in Aberdeen - the FCI scanner is described as being able to vary the strength of the magnetic field during the patient's scan.",
      "The university described the scanner as a \"world first\", which could identify \"previously undetectable cancer tumour invasion\".",
      "The life-saving machine developed in Aberdeen",
      "The scientists worked in collaboration with NHS Grampian on the study.",
      "The technology being able to detect tumours without having to inject dye into the body was described as a further benefit.",

      "'Potential is limitless'",
      "Dr Lionel Broche is a senior research fellow in biomedical physics and the lead researcher in the study.",
      "\"We found that images generated from FCI can characterise breast tumours more accurately,\" he said.",
      "\"This means it could improve the treatment plan for the patients by improving the accuracy of biopsy procedures by better detecting the type and location of tumours, and by reducing repeated surgery so really, the potential impact of this on patients is extraordinary.\"",
      "He added: \"My colleagues in the University of Aberdeen built the world's first clinical MRI in the 1970s so it is both fitting and exciting that we are making waves again with an entirely new type of MRI called FCI.",

      "MPs on the Health and Social Care Committee said they were disappointed and frustrated by the \"lengthy and diffuse answers\" she and other officials gave them under questioning.",
      "Last week, when challenged on the issue, she told BBC Breakfast \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings, but it's absolutely right that we are scrutinised by Parliament.\"",

This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan's previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms.",
      "Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day.",

Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence.",

Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it.",

Preston's friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told.",

      "Across Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. \"What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,\" says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. \"Sometimes the parents have no idea.\"",
      "Once ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there's evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to \"chill\" in the local parks or at home.",
      "Those who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so \"to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma\", says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University.",
      "'Everybody else is doing it'",
      "One mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps.",
      "Lexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine.",
      "\"I knew it was illegal\u2026 and it was a horse tranquiliser,\" says Lexi. \"That's all I knew. I didn't really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn't really want to be the odd one out.\"",
      "One reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. \"It were easy to get \u2013 like, really easy,\" she says.",
      "In Burnley, friends will chip in for the \u00a315 to \u00a330 it costs for a gram and share it.",
      "To feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a \u00a310 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?\"",
      "'You're doing stupid amounts'",
      "What makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity.",
      "At lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. \"The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,\" she adds. \"If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them.\"",
      "And this means users' habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16.",
      "\"Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you're doing stupid amounts,\" he says. Soon he was spending \u00a3200 month on the drug.",
      "Higher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, \"which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed\", says Mrs Wilson.",
      "Then there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable.",
      "'Extremely dangerous'",
      "Some of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine \"may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help\", warns Prof Ralphs.",
      "The government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. \"Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,\" says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. \"It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people's safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD's recommendations before making any decision.\"",
      "Families in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an \"epidemic\" of ketamine use.",
      "In response, Lancashire County Council says it is \"dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community\" and that it \"will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need\".",
      "'The urge is always there'",
      "There is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue.",
      "\"It's not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,\" says Insp Plummer. \"You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it's not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids.\" He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged.",
      "And some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people's decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification \"will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet\".",
      "In the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering.",
      "Lexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine.",
      "Getting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, \"the urge is always there for me to do it again\".",

      "Sir Keir responded: \"If you take the numbers for this financial year and then the numbers for the financial year 2027-28, that's a \u00a313.4bn increase.",
      "\"That's the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the Cold War which will put us in a position to ensure the security and defence of our country and of Europe.\"",
      "Badenoch pressed him again, saying: \"The IFS said today that the government is playing silly games with numbers. How does he find this difference in numbers?\"",
      "Repeating himself, the PM then said they had already been \"going through the same question over and over again\" at previous PMQs and said \"if you ask again I'll give the same answer again\", to loud cheers from his backbenchers.",

      "Questions have been raised about the Labour government's U-turn on its manifesto pledge to raise international development funding to 0.7% of gross national income, with unease among some Labour MPs about the move.",
      "Speaking at PMQs, Labour backbencher Diane Abbott suggested the decision could increase the risk of conflict abroad, telling the PM that \"there is also a view that taking money from aid and development to spend on armaments and tanks makes people less safe, not more safe, because the desperation and poverty that so often leads to warfare is what aid and development money is supposed to counter.\"",
      "The PM defended the decision in the chamber, and earlier Healey had said \"hard power is now more important than soft power\".",
      "Asked whether the increase announced on Tuesday is linked to Sir Keir's visit to the White House, Healey told the Today programme: \"President Trump, over the last two weeks, has been very direct in his challenge.",
      "\"He's reinforced the imperative and the importance of Britain making this commitment and helping other European countries to step up in a similar way.\"",

      "Trump's rapprochement with Russia's Vladimir Putin, and the US siding with Russia on a UN resolution on Ukraine, has sent shockwaves through European allies.",
      "Asked whether he believed the UK increasing its defence contribution would bring Trump on side, Healey said that the PM could now tell Trump: \"You are challenging Europe and the UK to step up on European security, on Ukraine, on defence spending, on reinforcing our industrial base.",

    "story": [
      "Four in five cars should be electric and half of homes should have heat pumps within 15 years, say the government's independent climate advisers.",
      "By law the UK must reach \"net zero\" - no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - by 2050.",
      "UK greenhouse gas emissions have more than halved since 1990, largely thanks to less electricity coming from fossil fuels and more from renewables. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says that to reach the 2050 target we will also need to change how we drive and heat our homes.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government would consider the advice and respond in due course.",
      "\"We owe it to current generations to seize the opportunities for energy security and lower bills, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the existential climate crisis,\" he said.",
      "Under UK law, the CCC provides independent advice on how much the UK should emit over five-year periods, known as \"carbon budgets\", and how it might get there.",
      "Each carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero by 2050. The latest advice is that by 2040, emissions should be 13% of their 1990 levels, for the UK to stay on track.",
      "The CCC advice is not policy, but the government has historically accepted it. If it does, the target will become legally binding, but government will still decide how to achieve it.",
      "Meeting these long-term goals will mean significant changes in the years ahead. One-third of emissions cuts between now and 2040 need to come from households making low-carbon choices, the CCC says.",
      "This will mainly be through switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles and from fossil fuel boilers to heat pumps, making use of growing supplies of clean electricity. Smaller contributions will come from other choices, such as eating less meat and dairy.",
      "As the graph below shows, these changes are ambitious. But they are deliverable, argues the CCC, without people having to scrap their existing boiler or car early.",
      "Other emerging technologies, like mobile phones and internet connections, have achieved similar rates of increases previously.",
      "\"For electric vehicles, the market is already pretty much at parity with internal combustion engine vehicles, so we think just naturally that will start to be a choice people make,\" Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the CCC, told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"For heat pumps, we're saying it's different, the costs are still higher than a fossil fuel boiler and the government will need to act to help people get those technologies.",
      "\"But the rollout rate that we've looked at is similar to what happened to our neighbours in Ireland but also to much colder countries in Europe.\"",
      "Emissions cuts will be needed in other areas too, such as farming and flying, two of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.",
      "The CCC no longer directly advises against net airport expansion, which it has previously. But it warns the costs of decarbonising aviation will need to be picked up by airlines, which will probably drive up ticket prices.",
      "It says we will need to eat less meat and dairy too. In the CCC's pathway, sheep and cattle numbers fall by 27% by 2040, and the area covered by woodland rises from 13% to 16%.",
      "Cost of net zero",
      "The costs of tackling climate change have become highly politicised in recent years.",
      "The CCC estimates most of the expense will be borne by the private sector and calculates the savings from moving to more efficient technologies should outweigh costs by the early 2040s.",
      "\"We are crystal clear in this analysis, in this carbon budget, for the first time we start to see the economy making savings from this investment, and they make savings over and above what we would do if we stay dependent on fossil fuels,\" Ms Pinchbeck told BBC News.",
      "This should improve energy security and filter down to lower bills in the long term, the CCC argues, provided the government acts to make electricity cheaper.",
      "It advises removing policy costs \u2013 funding for social and environmental schemes \u2013 from electricity bills. That would cut them by about 19% based on expected 2025 prices, the CCC says, making it more cost-effective for people to switch to electric vehicles or heat pumps.",
      "These costs could instead sit on gas bills or general taxation.",
      "\"Regardless of what you think about climate change, what we are laying out today is a massive industrial revolution,\" said Ms Pinchbeck.",
      "\"It will save the economy money by 2040, it saves people money on their energy bills, it saves people money on their driving costs, but all of that is underpinned by a cheaper electricity price.\"",

      "It then asked for 26 witness statements written by its staff to be withheld, and an order to be made preventing certain questions about the firm to be asked in the inquiry room in a public session.",

      "In its submission, it said there was a \"realistic possibility that criminal charges against one or more individuals will flow from the investigation\".",
      "The Department of Health later asked for the terms of any restriction order to be widened to include any \"financial material and correspondence\" relating to the purchase of PPE from the company, although that request has been rejected by the inquiry.",
      "In her final ruling, Baroness Hallett said it was both \"necessary and proportionate\" for the Covid inquiry to examine contracts between the government and PPE Medpro.",
      "But she did accept there was a risk of damage to any future criminal proceedings if she allowed all the evidence to be heard in public.",
      "As a result, any sensitive evidence about the company will be heard in a private, closed hearing, expected to be held in late March.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 12:28:24 GMT",
    "summary": "The Conservative leader says international agreements must not stop the UK acting in its national interest.",
    "story": [
      "The UK must look again at international agreements, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said.",
      "In her first major speech on foreign policy, Badenoch said if the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) continued to stop the government acting in the country's national interest, the UK would \"probably have to leave\" the treaty.",
      "Speaking during a key week for international diplomacy, she also called for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to boost defence spending by pulling funds from development aid, welfare and scrapping the Chagos deal.",
      "It comes as US President Donald Trump has been putting pressure on European leaders to increase defence spending.",
      "Trump 'encourages' Russia to attack non-paying Nato allies",
      "Trump has changed Ukraine conversation, Starmer says",
      "Trump right to engage Putin on peace talks, says minister",
      "Responding to journalists' questions after her speech at an event hosted by the Policy Exchange think tank, Badenoch said: \"I have always been very clear that the ECHR should not stop us doing what is right for the people of this country and what is in our national interest, and if it continues to do so at some point we will probably have to leave.",
      "\"What I have not agreed with is deciding we should leave without having a plan for what that looks like and how to do so in a way that makes sense.\"",
      "Setting out how rules were critical for a trading nation like the UK, she added: \"But other countries are breaking the rules and we need to get serious about that and not pretend that those things aren't happening and that's really what I want us to focus on.\"",
      "Badenoch was speaking the day after a series of international events to mark the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Trump has demanded Nato allies raise defence spending to 5% of GDP and opened talks with Russia, excluding Ukraine, on ending Putin's war.",
      "Meanwhile, there has been a deepening rift between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, with the US President falsely suggesting Ukraine started the war and branding Zelensky a \"dictator\".",
      "Badenoch urged the PM to go further than her party's previous pledge to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030, saying this was \"no longer sufficient\".",
      "She said cutting international aid could take that total to 3%, and called on the government to find further savings on the welfare bill, as well as by ditching the multi-billion pound Chagos deal.",
      "\"There will be painful decisions on government spending,\" she said.",
      "\"Any country that spends more interest on its debt than on defence, as the UK does today, is destined for weakness.\"",
      "On Thursday, Sir Keir will visit the White House and signal a shift in the government's approach to bringing about peace, including stepping up UK military support and taking a bigger role in Europe's security.",
      "Sir Keir will be making the case for Ukraine's direct involvement in any peace talks, warning that an insecure settlement without security guarantees for Kyiv could embolden Russia to attack again.",
      "Badenoch raised her concerns that the world may be seeing \"a return to the world of the strong and the weak\" with the threat from \"a new axis of authoritarian powers\" including Russia, China and Iran.",
      "On Trump's negotiations with Putin, she said: \"The danger is that aggression does not simply go unpunished but ends up being rewarded.\"",
      "She also reiterated her position that international courts are being used by charities and other organisations \"to advance an activist political agenda\".",
      "The ECHR was established in 1950 and sets out the rights and freedoms people are entitled to in the 46 signatory countries.",
      "The treaty is a central part of UK human rights law and has been used to halt attempts to deport migrants who are deemed to be in the UK illegally.",
      "The treaty was also recently cited in a case that allowed a Palestinian family the right to live in the UK, after they originally applied through a scheme designed for Ukrainians.",
      "During the Conservative leadership election, Badenoch said leaving the treaty would not be a \"silver bullet\" to tackling immigration but last week said her party would review the ECHR and Human Rights Act.",
      "Responding to the speech, a Labour spokesperson said: \"If Kemi Badenoch was really the 'realist' she says she is, she'd be apologising to the British people for the damage she and her party did to our country.",
      "\"Kemi Badenoch was part of a Conservative government which hollowed out our armed forces, made us more reliant on Putin for our energy needs and diminished Britain's standing on the world stage.\"",

      "MP Mike Amesbury has been urged to quit as it emerged he will still get paid while serving time in prison for repeatedly punching a man in his Cheshire constituency.",
      "The Runcorn and Helsby MP, who has been suspended from the Labour Party, was jailed for 10 weeks at Chester Magistrates' Court on Monday after admitting the assault, which was caught on CCTV footage.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called on him to resign or face recall so his constituents can have a new MP but said the government had no remit relating to MPs pay.",
      "The Independent Parliament Standards Authority (IPSA), which regulates MPs' pay, said the rules mean that until a member is suspended as a result of a House of Commons disciplinary procedure they must be paid their salary.",
      "Amesbury had the whip suspended by the Labour Party after video of the brawl emerged, and has been sitting as an independent MP since October.",
      "Yvette Cooper said: \"I'm making my view clear, which is that I want to see the people of Runcorn get new representation as swiftly as possible.\"",
      "The minister was being interviewed on the day the government puts its new Crime and Policing Bill to the Commons.",
      "Cooper said Amesbury's behaviour was \"completely unacceptable\", that the Labour Party had taken immediate action and that he was no longer a sitting MP.",
      "Asked on BBC Breakfast if Labour had been reluctant to call for his resignation because it feared facing Reform, Cooper said: \"No, we look forward to having that by-election.",
      "\"There is a recall process and it is right that those processes should be in place.\"",
      "Conservative co-chairman Nigel Huddleston called on Amesbury to \"do the right thing and resign\", adding that constituents \"deserve an MP who is able to stand up for them in Parliament\".",
      "'Recall process'",
      "Reform UK chairman Zia Yusuf also called on the 55-year-old MP to quit immediately, adding: \"The great people of Runcorn deserve far better than waiting six weeks for a recall petition to take place.\"",
      "At an earlier court hearing, Amesbury pleaded guilty to assaulting 45-year-old Paul Fellows.",
      "Video footage widely shared on social media showed a confrontation in the Cheshire town of Frodsham in the early hours of 26 October.",
      "Sitting at Chester Magistrates' Court, Deputy Chief Magistrate Tan Ikram said a pre-sentence report showed Amesbury's actions were the result of \"anger and loss of emotional control\".",
      "Under Parliamentary rules, a Westminster by-election can be forced if 10% of registered voters in the constituency of an MP jailed or given a suspended custodial sentence sign a petition calling for one.",
      "The recall process can only be triggered once all avenues of appeal against a custodial sentence have been exhausted.",
      "As a result he will still be drawing his \u00a391k salary even for the four weeks he is expected to serve in jail. An announcement about an appeal against his sentence is expected later this week.",
      "Amesbury won the newly formed seat of Runcorn and Helsby in July's general election, with a majority of more than 14,000 over Reform UK.",
      "He was first elected as MP for Weaver Vale in 2017 and represented the Cheshire constituency before it ceased to exist following last year's boundary changes.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 12:06:54 GMT",
    "summary": "The environment secretary is met with blaring tractor horns as he tries to win over farmers.",
    "story": [
      "Farmers protesting at government changes to agricultural inheritance tax rules have briefly disrupted a minister's speech at a national conference.",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed was met with horns from tractors parked outside and protesters who silently unfurled banners in front of him as he outlined farming reforms, which included plans to focus on food production and make the industry more resilient to disruption.",
      "Reed told the hundreds gathered at the National Farmers' Union (NFU) conference that he could not give them \"the answer many of you want on inheritance tax\" but he understood the strength of feeling in the room.",
      "NFU president Tom Bradshaw told the annual conference on Tuesday the inheritance tax changes were \"morally wrong and economically flawed\".",
      "Under the government's planned changes, from April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be liable to the tax at 20% - half the usual inheritance tax rate.",
      "Other allowances could mean a couple who are married or in a civil partnership could pass on a farm worth as much as \u00a33m.",
      "The government has previously said that the changes will only impact the wealthiest 500 farms each year, a number disputed by farmers unions which estimate up to 70,000 farms could be affected overall.",
      "Mr Bradshaw, whose speech was also briefly interrupted by two protesters who appeared to be urging people to be vegan, said the government had broken promises made before the election and had increased the mental health pressures on farmers, calling for it to correct the tax policy \"urgently'.",
      "\"We will fight this family farm tax until ministers do the right thing,\" he said.",
      "\"Frankly, this government needs a reset moment with farming, where they face up to the reality of how much the industry is struggling.\"",
      "Many farmers argue that while they are asset rich, for example in terms of their land or livestock, they are cash poor and the proposed changes would mean they would have to sell up in order to pay the tax.",
      "What is inheritance tax, who pays it and what's changing for farmers?",
      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
      "In his speech, Reed had also outlined plans for a 25-year farming roadmap and food strategy, which would put food production at its core and make farm businesses more resilient to challenges such as severe flooding, drought and animal disease.",
      "He said it would ensure farming is a \"sector which recognises restoring nature is not in competition with sustainable food production, but is essential to it\".",
      "As farmers outside the conference centre sounded their tractor horns, he announced measures including extending the seasonal worker visa scheme for five years, support for precision breeding and new technology.",
      "He also announced new requirements for government catering contracts to favour \"high quality, high welfare products that British producers are well placed to meet\".",
      "Earlier in the day, a multi-generational farming family - Martin Towler, his daughter and son-in-law, Hazel and Tom Church, and their five-year-old son Bertie - went to the Treasury to handover a collection of pre-loved farming toys donated by farmers who might be hit by the government's proposed changes to agricultural inheritance tax.",
      "The family have been farming Scald End Farm, a mixed beef and sheep farm in north Bedfordshire, since the 1940s but they all now also have to work off farm to supplement their income.",
      "They say the impact of the proposed inheritance tax changes will leave them facing a \u00a3400,000 bill and the prospect of selling off so much of the 210-acre farm that it would become unviable as a business.",
      "Mr Church said he hoped the government would listen to farmers' concerns and try to find a compromise on its inheritance tax policy.",
      "He told the BBC the changes, as currently proposed, would have a \"detrimental\" impact on the family's ability to run a profitable business.",
      "\"We are struggling at the moment as it is. There's no two ways about that,\" he said.",
      "\"Farming is incredibly low return on investment when you look at the asset values of the land and the income generated.",
      "\"If we are saddled with further debt through death - is it viable? Selling land is going to make it even less viable.\"",
      "Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins has said the Conservatives would reverse the inheritance tax on farmers \"straight away\".",
      "During Tuesday's conference in Westminster - the first time it has been held outside Birmingham for years - Reed, took questions from the audience.",
      "There was clear anger among those questioning him on the tax changes and he was told many older farmers \"were wishing their lives away\" and now felt they would benefit their families by dying before the 2026 tax change.",

      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC the bill would address an \"epidemic of street theft\", including a rise in phone and bag snatching and shoplifting, and introduce new \"Respect Orders\" with restrictions similar to Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (Asbos).",

      "The bill, unveiled in Parliament on Tuesday, pulls together many measures set out in Labour's general election manifesto.",
      "But they come amid questions over whether police have the funding to make the government's plan work.",
      "Under the bill, police would gain the power to enter and search a property without a court warrant for a stolen mobile phone or other items that have been electronically tracked, such as laptops or Bluetooth-tagged bikes.",
      "The power would mean that victims of mobile phone thefts who track their device while it is in the hands of a criminal could call on police to recover it quickly.",
      "Cooper told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she understood the \"incredible frustration\" of phone theft victims who say \"I can track it, I can see where it is - it's in this particular house, it's in this particular location\".",
      "\"And yet the police can't act fast enough to be able to track it down,\" she added.",
      "Cooper said \"we have to have the stronger powers and action [and] the police say they welcome this\".",
      "Asked about the reliability of locator apps, where people can use another device to help track down the location of their missing or stolen phone, being used in police searches, Cooper told BBC Breakfast: \"Police will have to make decisions [and] it will need to be signed off by a police inspector, and [they will] need to make decisions about where the evidence is good enough for them to be able to act.\"",
      "She added that the bill would include scrapping a \"ludicrous\" \u00a3200 threshold for shoplifting, which meant lower value thefts were not currently prioritised by police.",
      "Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins told Sky News she was \"deeply concerned\" that no longer treating shoplifting below \u00a3200 as a summary-only offence would have significant long-term effects on crown courts, saying \"victims of rape will find it even harder and longer to get their day in court\".",
      "But Cooper said addressing lower value thefts which were not likely to lead to prison would stop criminal behaviour escalating to the stage where such sentences would apply.",
      "The bill also includes the government's proposed \"Respect Orders\" - court-imposed restrictions that will be similar to the Asbo developed in the Tony Blair era, then scrapped by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats coalition a decade ago.",
      "While Asbos were popular with voters, critics say the restrictions often became unworkable or poorly enforced.",
      "The proposed Respect Orders allow courts to impose restrictions on an individual's behaviour, just like an Asbo.",
      "But they would also be able to compel them to attend programmes such as addiction treatment or anger management courses to change their ways.",
      "Other measures previously announced in the bill include:",
      "An offence of assaulting a shop worker - also a Conservative commitment before the 2024 General Election.A new police power to seize without warning off-road bikes or e-scooters.A new offence of spiking drinks, separate to current assault laws.Giving judges the power to issue a Stalking Prevention Order against a suspect, even if they are not convicted of a crime.",

      "Restaurant and retail bosses have written to Cooper to warn the bill \"stops short\" of protecting delivery riders under the plans. They want the new offence of threatening or assaulting a shop worker in their place of work to include couriers on journeys to and from customers.",
      "Cooper refused to be drawn on whether introducing new criminal offences would add unwelcome extra pressure on police, prisons, and the court system.",
      "Several police forces across England and Wales have previously warned they will have to make cuts to existing officers this year despite receiving extra funding, and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said in December that prisons were at risk of running out of space.",
      "Cooper told the Today programme that a boost in police spending and increasing \"early prevention action\" would help prevent crimes escalating and prison sentences needing to be imposed, while community measures like tagging and curfews would also be strengthened.",
      "The Home Office says the bill's aims will be delivered by recruiting 13,000 additional neighbourhood officers by 2029 - and the department has pledged \u00a3200m specifically towards that.",
      "The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC ) said last year that forces faced a \u00a31.3bn funding gap, and the available cash was not being shared evenly between forces due to outdated rules.",
      "The Home Office has since confirmed it is putting \u00a31.1bn extra into policing up to April 2026.",
      "But the NPCC has warned that if it is to deliver the \"Safer Streets\" plan, forces would need a pay settlement that would help them to attract and retain the best possible officers.",

      "Her departure comes less than a month after two influential House of Commons committees discussed her suitability to lead the NHS through a period of what Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said will be the biggest overhaul of the service.",
      "As to the timing of her resignation, some words in her letter are significant.",
      "She noted that there is due to be radical reform of the size and functions of NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care to \"drive the government's reform priorities\" and that the \"step change required\" would be best served by new leadership.",
      "Sources have indicated that the government wants to bind NHS England closer to the Department of Health to push ahead with changes, including shifting the focus from hospitals to community care.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting may well have felt the need to find a new leader, and Amanda Pritchard possibly felt that after several years at NHS England she did not want to be on a tighter rein.",
      "Amanda Pritchard joined NHS England in 2019 as number two to the then chief executive Sir Simon, now Lord Stevens. Senior health sources have indicated that the organisation had a degree of autonomy at the time, and the top job she then took on in 2021 was different to what was now envisaged by the Labour Government.",

      "NHS England said Amanda Pritchard had decided it was the right time to stand down, now that the NHS has turned a corner on recovery from the pandemic and the foundations are in place to make further changes to support the NHS.",
      "Ms Pritchard said in a statement: \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.\"",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting thanked her for her integrity and unwavering commitment.",
      "He said: \"Amanda can be enormously proud of the leadership she has given in the face of the biggest health emergency for our country in modern history, as well as steering NHS England during turbulent political waters and six secretaries of state in her time as chief executive.\"",
      "Richard Meddings, chairman of NHS England, described it as \"a huge loss\" for the NHS.",
      "\"Under her leadership, the NHS has delivered a huge amount for patients - in the face of pandemic recovery, unprecedented strikes and consecutive even busier winter periods, the NHS has continued to improve performance, reform and innovate\", he said.",
      "Ms Pritchard has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks.",
      "The public accounts committee said that she, her deputy, Julian Kelly, and two senior civil servants at the Department of Health and Social Care were \"complacent\" and lacked dynamism.",

      "The countries have held more than a dozen rounds of negotiations since 2022, but an agreement has remained out of reach.",
      "Sticking points include high tariffs in India on Scotch whisky and relaxing fees and visa rules for Indian students and professionals going to the UK.",
      "Talks are being held for the first time after the Labour Party came to power in the UK and Reynolds says securing a deal is a \"top priority\" for his government.",
      "\"Growth will be the guiding principle in our trade negotiations with India and I'm excited about the opportunities on offer in this vibrant market,\" he said in a statement ahead of the meeting.",
      "India is forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years.",
      "The ministers held a joint press conference after the meeting, but neither side offered a deadline for talks to conclude. Deadlines set by former ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss had passed without an agreement being finalised.",
      "For Delhi, the trade talks have assumed renewed significance on the back of US President Donald Trump's decision to impose reciprocal or tit-for-tat tariffs on imported goods from countries, including India.",
      "The UK is also a high-priority trading partner for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1 trillion by FY30.",
      "The UK had announced in November last year - soon after Sir Keir Starmer met PM Modi at the G20 summit in Brazil - that talks would restart in the new year.",
      "The two countries share a trade relationship worth \u00a341bn ($52bn) currently, according to a UK government statement, and a trade deal could unlock new opportunities for both countries.",
      "London has identified sectors that could benefit, which include advanced manufacturing, clean energy and professional and trade services. An agreement could also potentially unlock a valuable market for British cars, Scotch whisky and financial services worth billions of dollars.",
      "India is seeking greater mobility for its working professionals and students to the UK, while pushing for faster visa processing times.",
      "It may also seek concessions for its residents working temporarily in the UK on business visas, who are required to pay national insurance but are still ineligible for social benefits.",
      "Speaking at the joint conference, Goyal said that immigration was not a part of the discussions.",
      "\"India has never ever discussed immigration in any free trade negotiations,\" he said. Reynolds added that business mobility was a \"separate issue\" from immigration.",
      "During Reynolds' visit, he and Goyal will also visit the BT office in the northern Indian city of Gurugram.",
      "UK Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson is also in India and will be participating in events in India's two big business hubs - Mumbai and Bengaluru.",
      "After years of scepticism over free trade deals, India has been signing agreements or is in talks with several countries or blocs. Last year, it signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union - after almost 16 years of negotiations.",
      "It is also set to resume negotiations with the European Union this year.",

    "story": [
      "The former leader of Reform UK in Wales has appeared in court accused of accepting bribes to make statements in the European Parliament that would benefit Russia.",
      "Nathan Gill, 51, from Llangefni on Anglesey, is facing eight counts of bribery and one count of conspiracy to commit bribery.",
      "The court heard Mr Gill, who was a UKIP and later a Brexit Party MEP between 2014 and 2020, was alleged to have received money from his co-defendant and former Ukrainian politician Oleg Voloshyn.",
      "He appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court by video link on Monday, speaking to confirm his name, date of birth and address.",
      "The defendant is alleged to have been tasked by Mr Voloshyn on at least eight occasions to make specific statements in return for money.",
      "The court heard the statements, made in the European Parliament and in opinion pieces to news outlets such as 112 Ukraine, were \"supportive of a particular narrative\" which would \"benefit Russia regarding events in Ukraine\".",
      "A spokesperson for Reform Wales said Mr Gill \"is not a member of Reform UK\".",
      "A lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) told the court Mr Gill was stopped at Manchester Airport on 13 September 2021 under anti-terror legislation.",
      "His mobile phone was seized and evidence was found he was in a professional relationship with Mr Voloshyn and had agreed to \"receive or accept monies in return for him performing activities as an MEP\", the court heard.",
      "Barrister Richard Link for the CPS told the court  Mr Gill agreed to make statements in the European Parliament for money, that would \"tend to benefit Russia in relation to events in Ukraine at that time\".",
      "The Crown said the alleged offences were carried out during Mr Gill's time as an MEP and before the UK left the European Parliament, on 31 January 2020.",
      "He was an MEP for almost six years and briefly represented north Wales in the Welsh Parliament.",
      "Mr Gill was first elected as a UKIP MEP in 2014 and joined the National Assembly, as it was then called, in 2016.",
      "He was an Assembly Member for just over a year, before he was replaced by Mandy Jones in December 2017.",
      "He served as UKIP's leader for Wales and was briefly an independent before joining Reform's predecessor organisation, the Brexit Party, in 2019.",
      "The north Wales politician led Reform's 2021 Welsh Parliament election campaign.",
      "It is not clear precisely when Gill ceased being leader of Reform UK Wales, but the job has not existed for some time.",
      "The Crown said charges were authorised against Mr Voloshyn, but he was not in the jurisdiction.",
      "Mr Gill, of Anglesey, was granted bail on the condition that he surrender his passport, is not to obtain international travel documents and not to contact Mr Voloshyn.",
      "He is due to appear at the Old Bailey on 14 March."

    "summary": "From April, a pilot scheme will offer free breakfasts for 180,000 pupils before class.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced the first 750 schools to provide free daily breakfast clubs as part of a pilot scheme ahead of a planned England-wide rollout.",
      "Starting in April, 180,000 pupils in England will be offered \"healthy, varied and nutritious breakfasts\" in schools before class, Labour said - with over a third of schools in the pilot scheme in deprived areas.",
      "But some MPs and head teachers' unions have raised concerns the funding is too low.",
      "Labour campaigned on a promise of free breakfast clubs in every English primary school and later tripled funding to \u00a330m.",
      "Cautious welcome for free school breakfast clubs",
      "Free school meals 'would tackle child poverty'",
      "Parents will be able to drop off children 30 minutes before their usual school time, knowing they will be offered a free breakfast, the government says.",
      "Shadow Education Minister Neil O'Brien told the House of Commons there were \"a number of questions\" about the plans, including \"the difference in the planned spend and the much larger benefits ministers are claiming\".",
      "Analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the funding proposed for the breakfast clubs could be enough to fund all primary school pupils under a food-only model, or 60% of pupils if it had some childcare element.",
      "O'Brien questioned how the education secretary was planning to close that funding gap.",
      "But Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told the House of Commons she was \"confident\" the funding would be adequate.",
      "One in seven schools involved in the pilot had no before-school provision already in place, Phillipson said, and the rest either have paid-for provision or have their numbers capped.",
      "\"These breakfast clubs that we are introducing will be free to every child and every parent who seeks to take them up,\" she said.",
      "Phillipson did not confirm when the national rollout of the scheme would take place, but said it would be \"as soon as possible\".",
      "'Really worried'",
      "The Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Pepe Di'Iasio  said head teachers were \"really worried\"  the basic daily rate of just 60p per pupil was far too low.",
      "\"We strongly urge the government to be more realistic about the costs involved, before it attempts to roll out this policy nationally,\" he said.",
      "The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) has welcomed the news but also voiced concern that funding could fall short.",
      "\"It will be crucial that these concerns are addressed before the programme is rolled out across the country, to ensure that it does not place further pressure on already strained school budgets,\" said NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman.",
      "Announcing the first 750 schools to join the pilot scheme, the Department for Education said breakfast clubs had \"an important role to play in the government's commitment to remove the stain of child poverty\".",
      "Devon tops the list with 25 schools in the programme, followed by England's largest local authority, Birmingham, with 24.",
      "Both Wales and Scotland have programmes to provide free breakfasts to children in primary schools.",
      "Guidance sent to schools taking part in the pilot scheme says they will receive a set-up payment to cover equipment and material.",
      "Under the scheme, schools will then be reimbursed by the government based on attendance at the clubs - a school with 50% participation in the pilot scheme could get \u00a323,000 a year, the government said.",

      "US President Donald Trump was right to re-establish links with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to set up peace talks to end the war in Ukraine, a senior Labour minister has said.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said there could be \"no negotiated peace without Russia\" and that Trump's approach had brought \"Russians to the table\".",
      "The US president has faced a backlash for excluding Ukraine from talks after his aides met Russian officials in Saudi Arabia. Trump has also suggested Ukraine may be a bystander, saying it has \"no cards\" in the deal.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will meet Trump in Washington this week and press for Ukraine to be \"at the heart\" of any peace talks.",
      "Ukraine hit by largest single Russian drone attack of war on eve of third anniversary",
      "Rosenberg: How Putin and Trump shook up the world in a week",
      "I'll back Ukraine in talks with Trump, Starmer says",
      "Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Phillipson said that Trump thawing diplomatic ties with Russia and Putin was \"the right approach\".",
      "\"President Trump has brought the Russians to the table,\" she added.",
      "When asked by Kuenssberg if welcoming Putin back was the right move, Phillipson said, \"absolutely\".",
      "\"There can be no settlement, no negotiated peace, without Russia,\" she said.",
      "She added \"any lasting settlement where it comes to peace does require Ukrainian voices, President Zelensky's voice to be a central part of that.",
      "\"There can be no settlement unless we have a negotiation involving both Russia and Ukraine.",
      "\"We are however, also clear of the risk that Russian President Putin poses to our interest.\"",
      "Shortly after coming to office, Trump held a phone call with Putin in which the leaders agreed to begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. It was the first phone-call to Putin by a US president since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "It was a significant thawing of the US relationship with Russia. Trump's predecessor Joe Biden previously called Putin a \"murderous dictator\" and a \"pure thug\".",
      "Since the call Trump has claimed Putin wants to reach a deal to end the war in Ukraine - arguing Russia did not necessarily have to negotiate a ceasefire, because it could take \"the whole country\" by force.",
      "Trump has instead turned on Zelensky in recent days, calling him a \"dictator without elections,\" claiming he was doing a \"terrible job\" and falsely suggesting he was the one who started the war with Russia.",
      "Trump's short-term goal is to stop the fighting in Ukraine. Longer term, he appears to want less US involvement, given that the country has sent tens of billions of dollars' worth of weapons to Kyiv.",
      "The White House is pushing Ukraine to sign a $500bn (\u00a3395bn) minerals deal, which would give the US control over half of Ukraine's mineral resources - which the Trump administration describes this as \"payback\" for earlier US military assistance.",
      "The Ukrainian president had rejected the initial US proposal made several days ago, saying he \"cannot sell our state\".",
      "In a video address late on Friday, Zelensky said Ukrainian and US teams were working on a draft agreement, which \"can add value to our relations\". But he stressed that \"what matters most is getting the details right\".",
      "Sir Keir is seeking to balance support for Ukraine with keeping his working relationship with Trump.",
      "This weekend, Sir Keir assured Zelensky of the UK's \"ironclad support\" for Kyiv. The comments came in the second telephone conversation in four days between the two leaders.",
      "It comes ahead of a big week of diplomacy, as Sir Keir heads to the White House on Thursday shortly after French President Emmanuel Macron visits Washington on Monday.",
      "While making his pitch to Trump this week, Sir Keir is expected to set out a path for the UK to increase spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2030 - in line with Labour's election manifesto commitment.",
      "European countries raising defence spending and becoming less reliant on the US for has been a key demand from Trump.",
      "In his push for Nato allies to shoulder more of the security burden, Trump has suggested European nations to commit at least 5% of GDP to defence.",
      "In a speech to the Scottish Labour Conference in Glasgow on Sunday, Sir Keir said \"the US is right\" that \"we Europeans - including the United Kingdom - have to do more for our defence and security\".",
      "The UK also must stand \"ready to play our role if a force is required in Ukraine once a peace agreement is reached\", he said.",
      "Shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge has called on the government to \"go further and faster\" on increasing defence spending.",
      "Earlier this week, the Liberal Democrats said there should be a national conversation on how to get to a target of 3% of GDP spent on defence.",
      "But Cartlidge refused to say how much the Tories would invest until they see the details of this year's strategic defence review.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Cartlidge said the UK was going to have to \"invest much more in hard power\" and boost spending on \"the military\".",
      "The Conservatives have argued welfare budgets and foreign aid could be cut to pay for increases in defence.",
      "Cartlidge said his party backed Labour's efforts to ensure Ukraine is involved in any peace talks to ensure lasting peace.",
      "\"Because if Russia is seen to in any way 'win' from any settlement, should there be one, I think that would send a terrible signal to other adversaries like China,\" he said.",
      "His comments were echoed by former Conservative leader and foreign secretary Lord William Hague said he was \"very worried\" about Trump's approach.",
      "Lord Hague, who is now Chancellor of Oxford University, said: \"The only way to end this war in a way that does not encourage future wars is to give as much support as we possibly can to Ukraine \u2013 to show Putin that a war of aggression will never succeed.",
      "\"Then there is the great danger that in ending this war they would be creating the scene for a wider war in the future, so I think there could be a historic mistake being made here from Washington.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 08:04:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Last week the Isle of Man came very close to axing a policy no UK politician dares touch.",
    "story": [
      "A pensions timebomb is ticking on the Isle of Man and the self-governing island off the UK's west coast came very close to defusing it last week.",
      "Like the UK, the island protects state pensions with the triple lock, which automatically increases the state pension each year by the maximum of three measures: price inflation, average earnings or 2.5%.",
      "The Isle of Man's government wanted to scrap the triple lock for some pensioners in its budget last week.",
      "But ministers were forced to back down following a backlash from members of the island's parliament, who argued the change was \"unfair\" on pensioners and was being rushed through without a proper debate.",
      "The U-turn is a cautionary tale for critics of the triple lock in the UK.",
      "It underlines the political difficulty of watering down the income of pensioners who tend to vote in greater numbers than younger age groups at elections.",
      "One former UK Treasury adviser told the BBC: \"It's politically too difficult to come up with a pension policy that does not involve committing to the triple lock. It's such a vulnerability in an election campaign.\"",
      "'A lose, lose, lose scenario'",
      "The triple lock was introduced by David Cameron's 2010 coalition government and has proved a reliable way of wooing the grey vote for every administration since.",
      "But it has also become steadily more expensive, as the population ages.",
      "Between 2022 and 2032, the number of pensioners in the UK is projected to increase by 13.8%, according to the ONS.",
      "Meanwhile the fertility rate is declining, suggesting there could be fewer UK-born people entering the workforce and paying taxes to cover welfare costs, including pensions.",
      "The government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said spending on pensioners is forecast to rise from \u00a3141bn this year to \u00a3182bn by 2030.",
      "In the Irish Sea, the cost pressures of keeping the triple lock are similarly intimidating politicians on the Isle of Man.",
      "With a population of about 84,000, and a declining birth rate, the Isle of Man has a higher proportion of over 65s than the UK as a whole - 22.5% compared with 19% - and forecasts show the number of retirees on the island is expected to grow.",
      "A report last year suggested, without reform, the fund that pays out the state pension could run out by 2047.",
      "In the UK, the population trends are only going in the same direction, and they look daunting for whichever party wins the next general election, due in 2029 at the latest.",
      "\"The politics here are a nightmare,\" said David Sinclair, chief executive of the International Longevity Centre - UK. \"The problem is that none of the alternatives to removing the triple lock are going to be popular.\"",
      "A return to some model of earnings link is favoured by many economists.",
      "Mr Sinclair said to keep the triple lock, government may have to take on more debt, increase the pension age, raise taxes, or potentially all of the above.",
      "\"For government it's a lose, lose, lose scenario,\" Mr Sinclair said.",
      "He said the Labour government \"will be terrified about even suggesting a cut to the triple lock\" after the outcry over its decision to withdraw the winter fuel allowance from all but poor pensioners.",
      "The government is raising the state pension by 4.1% this April, on a par with average earnings.",
      "A government spokesperson said its commitment to the triple lock was \"unwavering\" and meant \"millions will see their state pension rise by up to \u00a31,900 over this parliament\".",
      "In the Conservative camp, there have been hints of a shift in attitude to pensions.",
      "Speaking on LBC, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the Conservatives were \"going to look at means-testing\" benefits, in response to a question about the state pension. Her party later insisted she was not referring to the triple lock specifically.",
      "Also, the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, has said the triple lock was unsustainable in \"the very, very long term\".",
      "A Conservative source said Stride's comments had been taken out of context and the party was committed to the triple lock.",
      "Politically sensitive",
      "Neither Reform UK nor the Greens mentioned the triple lock in their election manifestos last year, while the Liberal Democrats supported its continuation.",
      "That was no surprise given they mooted the idea in their 2010 manifesto, albeit without the triple lock tag.",
      "Two sources close to the 2010 coalition talks said what became the triple lock was a minor detail in the Tory-Lib Dem agreement, with one saying the Treasury estimated it would cost \u00a350m over a five-year period.",
      "\"Clearly the triple lock will stop at some point,\" Steve Webb, the former Liberal Democrat MP and pensions minister who implemented the policy, told the BBC. \"It was never intended to be permanent.\"",
      "Webb said it was a tool used to \"undo 30 years of damage\" to pensioner living standards, but added \"there will come a point when it's done its job\".",
      "Such is the sensitivity of the issue, few current MPs or anyone actively involved in Westminster politics are willing to talk openly about when that time might come.",
      "One MP, who did not wish to be named, said the triple lock would not be dropped anytime soon, even though there were convincing arguments for doing so.",
      "For now, there's a stubborn silence and talk of tossing out the triple lock remains taboo among this generation of political leaders.",
      "Given the backlash against the watering down of the triple lock on the Isle of Man, the MPs of the future may view what's happening on the island with some trepidation.",

    "title": "Will Starmer's defence hike win over Trump?",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 20:53:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The prime minister has set out plans to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer's promise to increase defence spending will have several consequences.  It may one day actually strengthen the UK's ability to defend itself. More immediately it will mean billions less spent on foreign aid.",
      "But what will it buy the prime minister diplomatically in Washington?",
      "In times past visiting dignitaries would give emperors gifts and tributes. Starmer  will now turn up at the White House on Thursday with a large goodie bag marked \"more defence spending\".",
      "Donald Trump is just the latest in a long line of US presidents urging European powers to spend more on their own defence.",
      "The prime minister will be able to say to the president that he has heard the call and acted. He might not want Trump to ask too many detailed questions: What does an added 0.2% of GDP mean in real money? When will the UK actually spend 3% on defence?",
      "But Starmer will want to land the idea that the UK is responding to Trump's agenda.",
      "Early signs are positive. Peter Hegseth, the US Secretary of Defence, said he had spoken to his UK counterpart, John Healey, and described the increase as \"a strong step from an enduring partner\".",
      "So Starmer's announcement may well get his foot in the door at the White House and a hearing from the president.",
      "But will it help him make the case for the security of Ukraine and Europe? Will Trump now be more amenable to allowing both a seat at the negotiating table? Will Trump be more open to the idea that the United States should play a role guaranteeing post-war Ukraine's security, giving air, logistics and intelligence cover to European forces helping to keep the peace on the ground?",
      "The answer to those questions is not clear cut. The prime minister may suggest the UK is showing leadership, pointing the way for other European allies to follow suit.",
      "He may also argue that the defence hike shows the UK will not have to make what he calls the \"historic mistake\" of having to choose between Europe and the US, something made much harder by the US decision to vote with Russia against Ukraine and Europe at the United Nations on Monday.",
      "Starmer cuts aid to fund hike in defence spending",
      "What is Nato and why isn't Ukraine a member?",
      "How much do Nato members spend on defence?",
      "The problem is that Trump and his administration have made it clear that their security priority is China and Europe will just have to do more to look after itself.",
      "Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute, told the BBC: \"The reality is that whatever we do on defence, the US is going to pivot elsewhere, it is not going to take the lead role in European security that it has done for more than half a century.\"",
      "In that context, the government's promised increase in defence spending may be seen as a short-term tactical move ahead of Starmer's visit to Washington, rather than an historic response to the existential geopolitical changes posed by Trump's election.",
      "European diplomats told me they were underwhelmed by the UK defence offer, saying it was not enough to have a real impact. They said the UK would have to spend at least 3% of national wealth soon to give itself a chance to develop the capability it would need.",
      "To do that, the government would have to do more than raid the development budget. Aid charities noted that their spending was a soft target compared to those of massive spending departments such as welfare, health and education.",
      "But few politicians of any political colour appear prepared to start making an argument for a transformation of the post-war European welfare model and prepare voters for a massive change in defence spending.",
      "For now, the government is cutting foreign aid and international charities are furious.",
      "The reduction from 0.5% of national income to 0.3% means \u00a36bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year. Given that billions of this budget still pays for asylum seekers' hotels here in the UK, the actual amount spent on aid overseas will be about 0.15%.",
      "The prime minister said the UK would use this remaining aid money to help Sudan, Ukraine and Gaza, tackle climate change, and support multinational efforts on global health.",
      "Aid charities were stunned. Save the Children said it was betrayal of the world's most vulnerable children. The One campaign said it would create huge problems for the delivery of vital humanitarian assistance. The aid network BOND said there would be devastating consequences for millions of marginalised people.",
      "All this after Donald Trump froze America's development spending arm, USAID.",
      "By cutting foreign aid, the government has broken a manifesto commitment to protect the budget. It has also damaged its policy of using aid to engage more closely with countries in the global south.",
      "David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee and former Labour foreign secretary, said the cut was \"a blow to Britain's proud reputation as a global humanitarian and development leader\".",

    "title": "'Gruesome sell-out or a chance to lead': What will happen when Starmer visits Trump?",
    "published": "Sat, 22 Feb 2025 16:29:37 GMT",
    "summary": "What could happen when Sir Keir Starmer visits the White House next Thursday?",
    "story": [
      "The next seven days really matter.",
      "\"The most negative thing would be a gruesome sell-out of Ukraine and we get slapped with tariffs,\" says a source involved in working out the best moves for No 10 as Sir Keir Starmer prepares to head to the White House to meet President Donald Trump.",
      "\"The better version is Trump returns to a bit more robust behaviour with the Russians, Britain gets patted on the back for making a move on defence spending and we avoid all the tariffs \u2013 a Trumpportunity.\"",
      "With Whitehall-style understatement, a different official predicts the PM \"has a really big decision to make about what to say to Trump in private\" \u2013 remember, just this week the president accused Sir Keir of \"doing nothing\" to try and stop the Ukraine conflict.",
      "So what options does Sir Keir have?",
      "A decision on defence spending is the big focus. The drumbeat of demands for the UK to boost spending was getting louder even before Trump moved into the White House.",
      "The government hasn't yet committed to when it will hit its target of spending 2.5% of the size of the economy, let alone if it will go a lot further as military leaders, Nato, Trump, and now even the Liberal Democrats are calling for.",
      "A senior government source says the PM is \"pushing the system\" to get to a stronger position on spending, but in recent days it's suggested the Treasury's still asking about the spending consequences. The dilemma is obvious: public money is tight as a drum, and Downing Street doesn't want to take cash from the NHS or other priorities at home.",
      "But a Treasury source acknowledged \"the world is changing\", and sources describe a \"phenomenal\" opportunity to take the European lead and please Trump with cash promises.",
      "A Trump backer warns against anything lukewarm: \"a proper commitment, not just a road map, or a path \u2013 be more specific, say 'Yes we'll hit it by this date,' and throw in some more\".",
      "\"He's going to have to do 3% [or more],\" one Whitehall insider suggests, \"so the choice is, does it do it now, for the right reasons, make a virtue of it, or does he end up getting browbeaten into it by Trump?\"",
      "I'm told that there is no final decision on what to say \u2013 and crucial meetings are planned between ministers, officials and military advisers at the start of next week to decide.",
      "What next for Ukraine?",
      "Ukraine is, clearly, central to the talks, and the question looms over what happens if Trump gets the ceasefire he wants.",
      "In the last week UK and French military planners have been working on options, all of which are at an early stage. One idea is  that a \"reassurance\" force of perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 UK and French troops could be deployed after a ceasefire around Ukrainian infrastructure, ports, nuclear power stations, even in some of the key cities.",
      "The model of a joint UK-French force already exists \u2013 the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force, a deal signed by the two countries several years ago. Another source suggests the best option for a monitoring force would be under the badge of the UN, if the Russians could be persuaded to accept that, with Ukraine's allies stepping up training and support for Ukraine inside the country.",
      "These options in broad terms, given a public airing by Sir Keir Starmer this week, aren't new, one adviser says, and have been suggested in private for a long time. Another source in government says the plan for 30,000 troops is \"not yet an actual thing\" \u2013 there's no detailed blueprint.",
      "But European leaders know they have to prove to Trump they are serious about contributing to a lasting peace, rather than leaving it to the United States.",
      "I'm told when French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump and Zelensky met in the margins of the fanciest international get together of recent times, the reopening of Notre Dame, Trump said that he'd get Russia to the table, Zelensky said that he would go to the negotiating table, and Macron promised he'd make sure Europe played a real part.",
      "It's worth noting that Trump said \"that's great, I'm all for that\", when asked earlier this week about the idea of European troops being deployed was mentioned.",
      "'We know who the goodies are'",
      "But as the talks approach, uncertainty about the US' true view is the fundamental, and some in government are nervous. Does Trump really believe that Zelensky is a \"dictator\" \u2013 or, as Trump's Ukraine envoy suggested yesterday, a \"courageous leader\"? Does Trump want the \"sugar rush\" of a quick deal that might favour Russia asks one former defence minister, more than achieving something long-term?",
      "A Trump backer said it is \"obscene\" to suggest that the president is a Putin sympathiser, pointing to his previous decisions to approve the sale of Javelin missiles to Ukraine.",
      "In No 10, \"we don't think there is a cut and run\", a senior source says. In private, US figures have reassured the UK that the United States is not about to turn its back on Ukraine.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "In Brussels last week the US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth made headlines when he signalled the US would reduce its support for Ukraine \u2013  but a source in the room during the private talks after his controversial public remarks told me Hegseth said \"we know who the goodies are and who the baddies are\".",
      "There is though anxiety in government that Trump might be tempted to just force a deal to end the conflict, then Russia could \"just reload then go again\", according to another source.",
      "But there is a shaky faith \u2013 perhaps more accurately a fervent hope \u2013 that whatever the president's public remarks, that the US will try to involve Ukraine in the talks and does think the peace has to be a deal that lasts, with a force that looks credible, potentially with some form of American support.",
      "Emmanuel Macron, and then Sir Keir, will try to persuade Trump that a deal with security guarantees for Ukraine is the only true victory for the White House.",
      "Remember why all this matters so much back home. What Trump decides to do about the conflict has an effect not just on the security of our continent but our prosperity too: the Ukraine war has shaken our economy through the effect it's had on energy bills.",
      "There is also, of course, the simple and awful human cost of lives lost \u2013 Ukrainians and Russians \u2013 hundreds of thousands of casualties, with terrible suffering on the edge of Europe. Thousands of families in the UK opened their homes to Ukrainian refugees at the start of the war.",
      "The former defence minister notes: \"Sometimes when there is all this noise, we have to still find a way to keep supporting them. Who knows when it is going to end, the only thing we know is they are still being attacked.\"",
      "As the war's three-year anniversary approaches you can expect to hear this message from government too.",
      "And of course what happens matters enormously to the fortunes of this government. Sir Keir might have a huge majority, but he has battled to retain political momentum and his popularity has plunged since taking office.",
      "He may even want to bring other things to the famous Resolute desk beyond defence and Ukraine: Trump is, a senior government source says, notoriously unpredictable and may swerve off topic.",
      "A source familiar with Trump's thinking suggests the PM could turn Trump's freewheeling style to his advantage by putting other issues on the table \u2013 an offer to buy more American Liquid Natural Gas perhaps, revising the deal on the Chagos Islands, a tougher position on China, or a discussion about tech regulation perhaps, with Apple in a huff with the UK government.",
      "Starmer might not have chosen \u2013 few prime ministers do \u2013 to have to confront complicated foreign policy tangles early in office. But one Whitehall observer notes \"kudos to No 10 for handling Trump\" so far, not reacting to his every outburst.",
      "And Brexit, ironically, helps Sir Keir the Remainer carve out a separate role to the rest of Europe.",
      "Working with Trump might be like handling a live firework. But the international jeopardy does present opportunities for the PM, as one former senior official suggests.",
      "If \"you don't have much of a compelling agenda, your social policy is looking hard, your economic policy is looking hard, you can see why he might think,  do you know, the air miles are starting to look pretty attractive\".",
      "This week presents Sir Keir with all sorts of dangers, but also, a chance to lead.",

      "At the start of the month, Trump put forward a drastic shift in American policy towards the Middle East saying the US will take over the Gaza Strip and turn it into the Riviera of the region.",

    "summary": "The energy giant has announced its strategy after rivals also rowed back on green energy plans.",
    "story": [
      "BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.",
      "The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.",
      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",
      "BP shareholders want it to make money, not climate policy",
      "BP set to scale back green investments as profits drop sharply",
      "BP to cut 4,700 jobs to reduce costs",
      "'Science hasn't changed'",
      "Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near \u00a34bn stake in the \u00a370bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.",
      "In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.",
      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",
      "Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".",
      "Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.",
      "Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work.",

      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told a committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",
      "The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",
      "But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",

      "In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.",

    "title": "The asteroid hits and near-misses you never hear about",
    "published": "Sat, 22 Feb 2025 21:33:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Since a potentially hazardous asteroid was detected in December, tens of others objects have come close to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "A large asteroid known as 2024 YR4 has grabbed headlines this week as scientists first raised its chances of hitting earth, then lowered them.",
      "The latest estimate says the object has a 0.28% chance of hitting Earth in 2032, significantly lower than the 3.1% chance earlier in the week.",
      "Scientists say it is now more likely to smash into the Moon, with Nasa estimating the probability of that happening at 1%.",
      "But in the time since 2024 YR4 was first spotted through a telescope in the desert in Chile two months ago, tens of other objects have passed closer to Earth than the Moon, which in astronomical terms sounds like a near miss.",
      "It is likely that others, albeit much smaller, have hit us or burned up in the atmosphere but gone unnoticed.",
      "This is the story of the asteroids that you never hear about \u2013 the fly-bys, the near-misses and the direct hits.",
      "The vast majority are harmless. But some carry the most valuable clues for unlocking mysteries in our universe, information we are desperate to get our hands on.",
      "Asteroids, also sometimes called minor planets, are rocky pieces left over from the formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.",
      "Rocks routinely orbit close to Earth, pushed by the gravity of other planets.",
      "For most of human history, it has been impossible to know how close we have come to being struck by a large asteroid.",
      "Serious monitoring of objects near Earth only started in the late 20th century, explains Professor Mark Boslough from the University of New Mexico. \"Before that we were blissfully oblivious to them,\" he says.",
      "We now know that quite large objects - 40m across or more - pass between Earth and the Moon several times a year. That's the same size of asteroid that exploded over Siberia in 1908 injuring people and damaging buildings over 200 square miles.",
      "The most serious near-miss, and the closest comparison with YR4, was an asteroid called Apophis which was first spotted in 2004 and measured 375 meters across, or around the size of a cruise ship.",
      "Professor Patrick Michel from French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) tracked Apophis and recalls it was considered the most hazardous asteroid ever detected.",
      "It took until 2013 to get enough observations to understand that it was not going to hit Earth.",
      "But he says there was one big difference with YR4. \"We didn't know what to do. We discovered something, we determined an impact probability, and then thought, who do we call?\" he says. Scientists and governments had no idea how to respond, he says.",
      "A large asteroid strike could be catastrophic if it hits an area where humans live.",
      "We don't know exactly how big YR4 is yet, but if it is at the top end of estimates, about 90m across, it would likely remain substantially intact rather than break up as it enters the Earth's atmosphere.",
      "\"The surviving asteroid mass could create a crater. Structures in the immediate vicinity would likely be destroyed and people within the local region (dozens of kilometers) would be at risk of serious injury,\" explains Professor Kathryn Kunamoto from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Some people could die.",
      "But since Apophis, there have been huge advances in what is called planetary defence.",
      "Prof Michel is part of the international Space Mission Planning Advisory Group.",
      "Its delegates advise governments on how to respond to an asteroid threat and run rehearsal exercise for direct hits. There is one going on right now.",
      "If the asteroid was on course for a town or city, Dr Boslough compares the response to preparations made for a major hurricane, including evacuations and measures to protect infrastructure.",
      "The Space Mission Planning Advisory Group will meet again in April to decide what to do about YR4.",
      "By then most scientists expect the risk to have almost entirely gone, as their calculations of its trajectory become more precise.",
      "We do have options beyond \"taking a hit\", as Dr Kumamoto puts it.",
      "Nasa and the European Space Agency have developed technologies to nudge dangerous asteroids off course.",
      "Nasa's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) successfully slammed a spacecraft into the asteroid Dimorphos to change its path.",
      "However scientists are sceptical if that would work in the case of YR4 due to uncertainty about what it is made of and the short window of time to successfully deflect it.",
      "And what about the asteroids that do hit Earth? An awkward truth for scientists is that a direct strike on land far from humans is the ideal scenario for asteroids.",
      "That gives them actual pieces from distant objects within of our solar system, as well as insights into Earth's impact history.",
      "Nearly 50,000 asteroids have been found in Antarctica. The most famous, called ALH 84001, is believed to have originated on Mars and contains minerals with vital evidence about the planet's history, suggesting it was warm and had water on its surface billions of years ago.",
      "In 2023 scientists detected an asteroid called 33 Polyhymnia which could have an element denser than anything found on Earth.",
      "This superheavy element would be something entirely new to our planet. 33 Polyhymnia is at least 170 million kilometers away, but it's an indication of the incredible potential of asteroids for our understanding of science.",
      "Now that the chances are higher that YR4 will hit the Moon, some scientists are getting excited about that.",
      "An impact could give real-world answers to questions they have only been able to simulate using computers.",
      "\"To have even one data point of a real example would be incredibly powerful,\" says Prof Gareth Collins from Imperial College London.",
      "\"How much material comes out when the asteroid hits? How fast does it go? How far does that travel?\" he asks.",
      "It would help them test the scenarios they have modelled about asteroid impacts on Earth, helping create better predictions.",
      "YR4 has reminded us that we live on a planet vulnerable to collisions with something the solar system is full of \u2013 rocks.",
      "Scientists warn against complacency, saying it is a matter of when, not if, a large asteroid will threaten human life on Earth, although most expect that to be in the coming centuries rather than decades.",
      "In the meantime, our ability to monitor space keeps improving. Later this year the largest digital camera ever built will begin working at the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, able to capture the night sky in incredible detail.",
      "And the closer and longer we look, the more asteroids spinning close to Earth we are likely to spot.",

      "Its construction is predicted to require a workforce of 7,900 people, with about two thirds moving from outside the area, and some people in nearby Leiston have claimed \"landlords are cashing in\" by raising rents.",
      "Linda Druce, director and founder of Druce Estate & Letting Agents, said: \"I have been in the area for 21 years now and this is the first time we have seen such a significant jump, particularly in rental prices.\"",
      "Leiston, located between the more affluent coastal towns of Aldeburgh and Southwold, had traditionally been viewed as a more affordable place to live.",
      "But one sales negotiator, who did not want to be named, said family homes in the area that were normally rented for \u00a31,500 a month were now costing as much as \u00a33,000.",
      "It is a claim which was corroborated by Ms Druce.",
      "\"It is mainly because of Sizewell C contractors and those looking to be working here over the next year or two who are looking to rent,\" she said.",
      "\"The core of our clients are not likely to jump into wanting to get higher rents but we are seeing more people from out of the area who are buying buy-to-let properties.",
      "\"And quite frankly the local people who own them are more than happy to sell to the highest and best bidder.\"",
      "One of the family homes with a rent of \u00a33,000 a month - a fee which includes bills and cleaning costs - is a three bedroom semi-detached property in Carr Avenue.",
      "The home, which is being let by Hamilton Smith estate agents, has two bathrooms and is described as being fully furnished and \"beautifully presented\".",
      "Luke Vale, who owns Hamilton Smith, described the situation in the town as a \"housing concern\".",
      "\"Although that property is being marketed through us and to a particular set of clientele, we are still actively trying to look after our current clients,\" he said.",
      "\"We look after hundreds of properties in Leiston. I am having to deal with tenants who are terrified that their landlords are going to kick them out just so they can go down this route to make more money.",
      "\"But that doesn't factor in the number of landlords we have who do not want to increase their rent and are actually really good.",
      "\"The problem is a lot of landlords see pound signs and then the floodgates open and so, at the moment, if I put a house up for sale in Leiston, nine times out of 10 the viewing will be with someone who wants to buy it and rent it out per room.\"",
      "Elsewhere in the town, another three-bedroom home is being advertised at a cost of \u00a33,100 a month including bills, while a two-bedroom apartment is being let at a rate of \u00a33,045 a month, including utility bills.",
      "The current cost of renting in the area has raised eyebrows, not least given the average rent in Leiston is \u00a3773, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "Sizewell C said 2,400 of the workers at the new power station will be based on site, while 500 others will live at Pontins Pakefield, near Lowestoft.",
      "The remaining contractors, however, will have to move into local properties.",
      "Alison Downes, from the campaign group Stop Sizewell C, said: \"If Sizewell C goes ahead thousands more workers from outside the area will need accommodation and if those numbers increase, like at Hinkley Point C, where they are going up to a staggering 15,000, the people of Leiston will face many years more pain.\"",
      "It is not just landlords who could capitalise on the influx of workers heading into the area.",
      "Residents in Leiston who have spare rooms or spaces can apply to East Suffolk Council for a Sizewell C Housing Grant, which range from \u00a33,000 to \u00a37,000, as the authority looks to provide an additional 1,200 bed spaces during the construction.",
      "\"[These] provide funding to help local people bring latent accommodation back into use or upgrade their spare rooms to rent for extra income at a time when the cost of living is still a real challenge for a lot of people,\" said a Sizewell C spokesperson.",
      "Despite this, the suggestion Sizewell C could be driving up prices does not sit well with tenants who currently live in the area.",
      "'Money talks'",
      "Louise Smith, 54, said it was \"unfair\" local people might no longer be able to afford to live in Leiston \"because of Sizewell\".",
      "She added: \"The rents will go up and up and up because everyone is jumping on the bandwagon and the landlords are cashing in on it.",
      "\"They can just pick a figure out of the air and demand what they like because Mr Bloggs over there can pay that and Mr Smith over there can't.",
      "\"It's a shame but money talks.\"",
      "According to the ONS, 79.1% of people in East Suffolk are in paid work or have a job, with the average weekly wage being \u00a3604, which equates to a \u00a329,596 salary for someone who works 49 weeks in a year.",
      "Wenge Yuan, 58, has lived in Leiston for over three years and is one of those who is concerned about the rent increases.",

      "\"There are a lot more workers coming here and the market is going up and getting hot.",

      "\"When I moved here my rent was \u00a3625 a month but now that same flat is being rented out with bills for at least \u00a31,500, and I believe that is because of Sizewell,\" he said.",
      "\"I know of a lady on her own who wants to find somewhere in Leiston but it is just impossible and the rates are going right up.",
      "\"It's not fair on the people who live here and if anyone wanted to come to Leiston it would be impossible to make a life here - I couldn't afford what they are charging.",
      "\"Those who don't work for Sizewell are being farmed out of the area. If my landlord decided to sell, I haven't got a clue where I would go.\"",

    "story": [
      "Capturing water from fog - on a large scale - could provide some of the driest cities in the world with drinking water.",
      "This is what researchers in Chile have concluded after studying the potential of fog harvesting in the desert city of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country.",
      "Average rainfall in the region is less than 0.19in (5mm) per year.",
      "\"Like a lot of cities, Alto Hospicio has its social problems,\" said lead researcher Dr Virginia Carter Gamberini, from Universidad Mayor. \"There is a lot of poverty\", she explained, and many people there have no direct access to the networks that supply clean water.",
      "Many who live in the city's poorest communities rely on drinking water that is delivered by truck.",
      "However, clouds of fog that regularly gather over the mountain city are an untapped source, researchers say.",
      "How do you harvest fog?",
      "Capturing fog water is remarkably simple - a mesh is hung between poles, and when the moisture-laden clouds pass through that fine mesh, droplets form. The water is then channelled into pipes and storage tanks.",
      "It has been used at a small scale for several decades, mainly in rural South and Central America - in places with the right foggy conditions. One of the biggest fog water harvesting systems is in Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara Desert.",
      "However, Dr Carter says a \"new era\" of much larger-scale fog harvesting could provide a more  secure and sustainable supply of water in urban environments where it is most needed.",
      "She and her colleagues carried out assessments of how much water can be produced by fog harvesting, and combined that information with studies of cloud formation in satellite images and with weather forecasts.",
      "From this, they concluded that the clouds that regularly form over the Pacific - and are blown across the coastal mountain city - could provide the people of Alto Hospicio's slums with a sustainable source of drinking water.

    "title": "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 09:49:28 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK's greenhouse gas emissions should fall to 13% of 1990 levels by 2040, government advisors say.",
    "story": [
      "Four in five cars should be electric and half of homes should have heat pumps within 15 years, say the government's independent climate advisers.",
      "By law the UK must reach \"net zero\" - no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - by 2050.",
      "UK greenhouse gas emissions have more than halved since 1990, largely thanks to less electricity coming from fossil fuels and more from renewables. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says that to reach the 2050 target we will also need to change how we drive and heat our homes.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government would consider the advice and respond in due course.",
      "\"We owe it to current generations to seize the opportunities for energy security and lower bills, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the existential climate crisis,\" he said.",
      "Under UK law, the CCC provides independent advice on how much the UK should emit over five-year periods, known as \"carbon budgets\", and how it might get there.",
      "Each carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero by 2050. The latest advice is that by 2040, emissions should be 13% of their 1990 levels, for the UK to stay on track.",
      "The CCC advice is not policy, but the government has historically accepted it. If it does, the target will become legally binding, but government will still decide how to achieve it.",
      "Meeting these long-term goals will mean significant changes in the years ahead. One-third of emissions cuts between now and 2040 need to come from households making low-carbon choices, the CCC says.",
      "This will mainly be through switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles and from fossil fuel boilers to heat pumps, making use of growing supplies of clean electricity. Smaller contributions will come from other choices, such as eating less meat and dairy.",
      "As the graph below shows, these changes are ambitious. But they are deliverable, argues the CCC, without people having to scrap their existing boiler or car early.",
      "Other emerging technologies, like mobile phones and internet connections, have achieved similar rates of increases previously.",
      "\"For electric vehicles, the market is already pretty much at parity with internal combustion engine vehicles, so we think just naturally that will start to be a choice people make,\" Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the CCC, told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"For heat pumps, we're saying it's different, the costs are still higher than a fossil fuel boiler and the government will need to act to help people get those technologies.",
      "\"But the rollout rate that we've looked at is similar to what happened to our neighbours in Ireland but also to much colder countries in Europe.\"",
      "Emissions cuts will be needed in other areas too, such as farming and flying, two of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.",
      "The CCC no longer directly advises against net airport expansion, which it has previously. But it warns the costs of decarbonising aviation will need to be picked up by airlines, which will probably drive up ticket prices.",
      "It says we will need to eat less meat and dairy too. In the CCC's pathway, sheep and cattle numbers fall by 27% by 2040, and the area covered by woodland rises from 13% to 16%.",
      "Cost of net zero",
      "The costs of tackling climate change have become highly politicised in recent years.",
      "The CCC estimates most of the expense will be borne by the private sector and calculates the savings from moving to more efficient technologies should outweigh costs by the early 2040s.",
      "\"We are crystal clear in this analysis, in this carbon budget, for the first time we start to see the economy making savings from this investment, and they make savings over and above what we would do if we stay dependent on fossil fuels,\" Ms Pinchbeck told BBC News.",
      "This should improve energy security and filter down to lower bills in the long term, the CCC argues, provided the government acts to make electricity cheaper.",
      "It advises removing policy costs \u2013 funding for social and environmental schemes \u2013 from electricity bills. That would cut them by about 19% based on expected 2025 prices, the CCC says, making it more cost-effective for people to switch to electric vehicles or heat pumps.",
      "These costs could instead sit on gas bills or general taxation.",
      "\"Regardless of what you think about climate change, what we are laying out today is a massive industrial revolution,\" said Ms Pinchbeck.",
      "\"It will save the economy money by 2040, it saves people money on their energy bills, it saves people money on their driving costs, but all of that is underpinned by a cheaper electricity price.\"",

    "summary": "The energy giant has announced its strategy after rivals also rowed back on green energy plans.",
    "story": [
      "BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.",
      "The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.",
      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",
      "BP shareholders want it to make money, not climate policy",
      "BP set to scale back green investments as profits drop sharply",
      "BP to cut 4,700 jobs to reduce costs",
      "'Science hasn't changed'",
      "Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near \u00a34bn stake in the \u00a370bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.",
      "In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.",
      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",
      "Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".",
      "Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.",
      "Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work.",
      "\"I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told a committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",
      "The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",
      "But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",
      "In the five years since former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36%.",
      "In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.",
      "BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 03:54:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The Liberal Party of Canada will soon choose a leader that will replace Justin Trudeau and become Canada's next prime minister.",
    "story": [
      "After back-to-back debates in both English and French, the candidates to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in Canada have made their case to voters.",
      "Card-holding Liberals will now choose between former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, House government leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis.",
      "Whoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year.",
      "A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\"",
      "Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates.",
      "The Trump Factor",
      "How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates.",
      "Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population.",
      "Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs.",
      "But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"",
      "Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US.",
      "Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems.",
      "How Canada can fix its economy",
      "Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation.",
      "Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living.",
      "Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money.",
      "But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care.",
      "As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth.",
      "Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity.",
      "Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling.",
      "\"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said.",
      "Defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre",
      "The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.",
      "Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.",
      "Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.",
      "Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.",
      "His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.",
      "Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.",
      "Supporting Ukraine and Nato",
      "Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.",
      "All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.",
      "Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.",
      "Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.",
      "Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.",
      "A rethink of the consumer tax on carbon",
      "A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.",
      "But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.",
      "Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada.",
      "Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax.",
      "\"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said.",
      "Gould and Baylis, on the other hand, said they would keep some version of the consumer tax on carbon in place, saying that fighting climate change comes with a price.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 11:04:33 GMT",
    "summary": "Experts have questioned the company's explanation that it is due to the two words being similar.",
    "story": [
      "Apple says it is working to fix its speech-to-text tool after some social media users found that when they spoke the word \"racist\" into their iPhones it typed it out as \"Trump.\"",
      "The tech giant has suggested the issue with its Dictation service has been caused by a problem it has distinguishing between words with an \"r\" in them.",
      "\"We are aware of an issue with the speech recognition model that powers Dictation and we are rolling out a fix today,\" an Apple spokesperson said.",
      "However an expert in speech recognition told the BBC this explanation was \"just not plausible.\"",
      "Peter Bell, professor of speech technology at the University of Edinburgh, said it was more likely that someone had altered the underlying software that the tool used.",
      "Videos shared online show people speaking the word \"racist\" into the Dictation tool.",
      "Sometimes it is transcribed correctly - but on other occasions it is turned into \"Trump\", before being quickly restored to the correct word.",
      "The BBC has not been able to replicate the mistake, suggesting Apple's fix is already taking effect.",
      "Prof Bell said Apple's explanation of phonetic overlap did not make sense because the two words were not similar enough to confuse an artificial intelligence (AI) system.",
      "Speech-to-text recognition models are trained by inputting clips of real people speaking alongside an accurate transcript of what they say.",
      "They are also taught to understand words in context - for example, they could distinguish the word \"cup\" from \"cut\" if it was within the phrase \"a cup of tea\".",
      "Prof Bell says the situation with Apple is unlikely to be a genuine mistake with its data because its English language model would be trained on hundreds of thousands of hours of speech, which should give it a high level of accuracy.",
      "For \"less well-resourced languages\" he said it could be an AI training issue.",
      "But he said in this case: \"it probably points to somebody that's got access to the process.\"",

    "summary": "Shares in the US electric carmaker dropped after European sales halved in January.",
    "story": [
      "Shares in electric car maker Tesla have slumped more than 9% after EU and UK sales fell by almost half in January.",
      "The drop in Tesla shares took the company's valuation back below $1trn for the first time since November 2024.",
      "Tesla has been facing stiff competition in the European market from Chinese and other manufacturers.",
      "In addition, Tesla owner Elon Musk has been making controversial political waves on both sides of the Atlantic, an analyst said.",
      "Tesla sales in January bucked European electric car sale trends, which grew by more than a third in the month, according to trade body Acea.",
      "Instead, Tesla sales across the EU, EFTA and the UK fell more than 45%, and more than 50% in the EU alone.",
      "It comes after Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.",
      "The main factor in the January sales slump was likely to be increasing competition, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.",
      "Chinese manufacturer BYD has been making big strides, in part because it includes as standard some features which cost extra from other makers, Mould said.",
      "However, some car buyers may also be taking a \"principled stand\" on Musk's political interventions, he said.",
      "Musk has made waves in the US with his involvement in slashing US development funds and efforts to drastically reduce US federal funding.",
      "In the UK he supports jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, and repeatedly criticised Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.",
      "Musk also supports the far-right AfD party in Germany, and congratulated its leader after the party's record second-place result in elections.",
      "Too toxic?",
      "Asked if the reason for Tesla's share price slump was down to Musk being too toxic, a former senior director of the car maker's Europe, Middle East and Asia division said it was \"definitely one of the reasons for the decline\", but added there was a \"cumulative number of things that are piling up a domino effect\".",
      "\"There's no doubt his flirting with the right in politics, running around on TV with a chainsaw is not exactly helping his image,\" Peter Bardenfleth-Hansen told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"He may be getting a bigger fanbase within a specific type of clientele, but they're not the ones that are buying the Teslas. They're not the ones putting money in to his company. So he has a problem.\"",
      "Tesla shares got a big boost after the US election due to Musk's closeness to Donald Trump - Musk has described himself as \"first buddy\" to the US president.",
      "Investors thought this would stand his businesses in good stead.",
      "However, Trump is not a supporter of electric vehicles, and has said he will cancel efforts to boost their ownership.",
      "\"How anybody thought this was going to be good for Tesla, I don't know,\" Mould said.",
      "There is also general market skittishness about the path of interest rate cuts and concerns about Trump tariff plans that could be contributing to the fall, he added."

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 06:11:15 GMT",
    "summary": "The tech giant's decision has prompted questions and concerns about reduced protections for UK iCloud users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has made headlines by pulling its most advanced data security tool for UK customers.",
      "It is removing Advanced Data Protection (ADP) after the Home Office asked for the right to be able to access data which it is applied to - something even Apple itself cannot currently do.",
      "Rather than comply with that request, on Friday the tech giant said it would halt new UK sign-ups to the tool and remove existing user access at a later date.",
      "The move has prompted criticism of the UK government's actions - but also confusion about what protections remain for UK Apple customers.",
      "What is Apple's Advanced Data Protection?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data stored in their iCloud accounts.",
      "Items including back-ups, photos, notes and voice memos are given standard encryption by default.",
      "The company can be ordered to hand over this data by law enforcement.",
      "ADP, meanwhile, applies an extra level of protection through what's known as end to end encryption, which means Apple cannot see or access the data - only the user can.",
      "Because Apple does not have a key, losing access to your account can mean losing your data altogether.",
      "It also means law enforcement agencies have no way of accessing such data either.",
      "The tool is independent of the protections for blue messages sent with iMessage, passwords stored in iCloud keychain, Health app data and Facetime, which are end to end encrypted by default.",
      "What does this mean for my iCloud data?",
      "If you are in the UK and have not turned on ADP, you will not see a change to the way your data is protected as a result of Apple disabling it.",
      "Your iCloud data will remain protected by standard encryption and, as before, can still be accessed by Apple.",
      "But it does mean you now cannot apply to protect iCloud storage with end to end encryption, even if you want to.",
      "Meanwhile, people in the UK who had ADP enabled prior to Friday's change will lose access to it a later date.",
      "Apple has not said when, nor how many UK users will be affected.",
      "Some experts have raised alarm over its removal, saying it will leave users less protected and also have wider, global consequences.",
      "Graeme Stewart of cybersecurity firm Check Point said it would not mean \"a complete free-for-all\" as law enforcement must have a warrant to request iCloud data.",
      "But he said other governments may look to replicate the UK's demand of Apple for a so-called \"backdoor\" to encrypted cloud data.",
      "Cybersecurity experts have likened the idea of creating a backdoor to someone leaving their house keys under their doormat - essentially creating a vulnerability which anyone, including bad actors, can exploit.",
      "Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation said that if Apple had complied with the request, it would have created a backdoor not just for UK users \"but for people around the world, regardless of where they were or what citizenship they had\".",
      "Apple told the BBC in a statement that it had \"never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products, and we never will\".",
      "What protections do Google and Android offer?",
      "Like Apple, Google says it uses standard encryption across a range of its services to protect data as it moves between users' devices, its services and data centres.",
      "The search giant, which owns Android, has provided further protections for Android phone system back-ups since 2018.",
      "It uses a mechanism that generates a random security key on a device, which is encrypted by a user's lock-screen passcode, pattern or pin.",
      "Google says it cannot see this security key and that the passcode-protected information is sent securely to high security chips in its data centres.",
      "But the same protections do not extend to Google Photos or content stored in Google Drive - which are not end to end encrypted.",
      "It also has an Advanced Protection Program for people who want further security for their account.",
      "This relies on using passkeys to verify the account holder.",
      "Some Samsung Galaxy smartphones also have \"enhanced data protection\" which encrypts back-ups of messages, call logs, apps and settings and more end to end.",

      "Technicolor, the visual effects (VFX) group which has worked on films ranging from Disney's 1940 classic Pinocchio to 2024 blockbuster Mufasa The Lion King, has collapsed into administration in the UK.",

      "As well as purely animated films and TV, many live action releases are in large part the work of the employees of VFX studios.",
      "Many staff work film-to-film on fixed-term contracts, so redundancies may not reflect the total impact of the business' troubles on jobs.",
      "According to animation news publisher Cartoon Brew an email sent over the weekend by chief executive Caroline Parot said \"external headwinds\" had exacerbated problems caused by factors including post-covid recovery.",
      "She also said the US writers' strike which led to a slow-down in demand for VFX work causing \"severe\" pressure on cashflow.",

      "A meeting between Chinese president Xi Jinping and some of the country's foremost business leaders this week has fuelled excitement and speculation, after Alibaba founder Jack Ma was pictured at the event.",
      "The charismatic and colourful Mr Ma, who was one of China's most prominent businessmen, had withdrawn from public life after criticising China's financial sector in 2020.",
      "His reappearance at Monday's event has sparked a wave of discussion, with experts and analysts wondering what it means for him, China's tech sector and the economy in general.",
      "The response has been overwhelmingly positive - tech stocks, including those of Alibaba, rallied soon after the event.",
      "On Thursday, the e-commerce giant reported financial results that beat expectations, with shares ending the trading day in New York more than 8% higher. The company's shares are up 60% since the beginning of the year.",
      "So what are analysts reading into Mr Ma's appearance at the event alongside other high-profile guests - including DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng?",
      "Is Jack Ma 'rehabilitated'?",
      "Analysts began looking for clues about the significance of the meeting as soon as Chinese state media started releasing pictures of the event.",
      "\"Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,\" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote.",
      "Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight.",
      "\"Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,\" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "\"The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,\" said another.",

      "Before his disappearance from public life in 2020 - following comments at a financial conference that China's state-owned banks had a \"pawn-shop mentality\" - Mr Ma was the poster boy for China's tech industry.",

      "Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.",
      "Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.",

      "He also said it was the \"right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents\".",
      "This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces.",
      "Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.",
      "Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets.",
      "Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the \"common prosperity\" campaign.",
      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",
      "As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",
      "Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors.",

      "Those present at the meeting seemed to share that sentiment. Lei Jun, the chief executive of consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, told state media that he senses the president's \"care and support\" for businesses.",
      "Is it because of US sanctions?",
      "The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a \"Sputnik moment\": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month.",
      "Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",

      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",
      "\"Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,\" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.",
      "\"While the private sector remains a critical pillar of China's economic ambitions, it must align with national priorities - including self-reliance in key technologies and strategic industries.\""

      "In its responses to the study, TikTok and Meta - the parent company of Facebook and Instagram -  took the opportunity to criticise the Australian authorities over its stance on YouTube. \"This report again shines a spotlight on the government's decision to give an exclusive carve out to the most popular social media platform for young Australians from the under 16 ban,\" said a TikTok spokesperson.",

      "'84% use social media'",
      "Researchers questioned over 1,500 children across Australia aged between eight and 15 about their usage of social media and messaging platforms.",

      "\"These findings indicate there is inconsistency across industry regarding the steps taken to assess the age of end-users at various points in the user experience,\" the report's authors said.",
      "\"However, there is one thing they have in common: a lack of robust interventions at the point of account sign-up to a service to prevent someone under 13 from providing a false age or birthdate to set up an account.\"",
      "The regulator's report also surveyed the platforms themselves, which were asked how they verify the ages of younger users.",

      "\"Proactive tools and technologies may rely on a user actively engaging with a service (such as connecting with others, communicating with others, sharing and creating content) to detect relevant signals,\" the report said.",

      "Even though he misses the Portuguese laid-back approach to life, and the family-like team spirit of the work environments there, he does not regret, not for one second, his choice of pursuing an international career.",
      "Mr Dias's decision was made easier by all the financial impact of moving.",
      "The verdict of the spreadsheet was clear: staying in Portugal would be financially ruinous.",
      "\"I did simulations of how much money I would save a year in Portugal, and I quickly realised that I wouldn't be able to have a comfortable life financially, even if I got one of the most well-paying jobs available in engineering for my experience level,\" says.",
      "A two-year job experience in Portugal while Mr Dias was concluding his masters at Lisbon's Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico cemented his conviction: his yearly income amounted to \u20ac35,000 ($36,000; \u00a329,000).",
      "But his take home salary was much, much less.",
      "His income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40% of this gross salary went to the state.",
      "\"Financially it was bad. It would be very hard to save money if I didn't live with my parents,\" he recalls.",
      "Moving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to \u20ac60,000.",
      "The money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of $160,000 before a 20% income tax rate, much lower than at home.",
      "Mr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years' time with \"with many more savings\".",
      "Keeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments.",
      "In 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education.",
      "In 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data.",
      "After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels.",
      "The proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance.",
      "But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.",
      "\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.",
      "He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations.",
      "Known as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal.",
      "That's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD.",
      "\"This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,\" adds Mr Vasques.",
      "Mr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: \"I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.",
      "\"Not even a low-skilled worker will make a decision based on that. Portuguese food works probably better as an incentive to move here than that tax regime\".",
      "Rita de La Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, reminds that the exodus of young people isn't just a Portuguese problem, and that Europe is grappling with the challenges of young emigration.",
      "According to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages.",
      "\"The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,\" she said.",

      "Antonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree. He would change the German capital for Brussels two years later. All his work experience was done abroad.",
      "\"Back in 2020, we were offered monthly salaries of \u20ac1,300, gross, in Lisbon. Berlin offered me \u20ac4,200 for a junior role.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:40:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Quantum computers will be able to crack existing encryption and threaten critical infrastructure.",
    "story": [
      "Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky.",
      "Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal.",
      "Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world\u2019s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated.",
      "That\u2019s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack.",
      "Quantum computing is radically different to the \u201cclassical\u201d computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states \u2013 one or zero, on or off \u2013 quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.",
      "\u201cThe reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,\u201d Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's \u201cmuch, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.\u201d",
      "This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.",
      "The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today\u2019s computer networks.",
      "Today\u2019s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.",
      "This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. \u201cAnything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,\u201d says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2.",
      "Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away.",
      "But progress is being made.",
      "In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer\".",
      "Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today\u2019s systems have a few hundred at most.",
      "But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.",
      "Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, \u201cWhat data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?\u201d",
      "That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.",
      "Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.",
      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",
      "These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment \u2013 legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example \u2013 might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.",
      "Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but \u201cIt's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.\u201d",
      "So, it is trying to help customers build \u201ccrypto agility\u201d by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. \u201cThat's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.\u201d",
      "And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites \u2013 such as the Starlink network \u2013 should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.",
      "\u201cAt any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,\u201d Prof Sastry says. \u201cSo, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.\u201d",
      "More challenging, he says, are \u201cremote sensing\u201d satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",
      "While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol.",
      "By contrast, he adds, that it is not possible to predict when current encryption will become vulnerable.",
      "\"With cryptography,\" says Mr Dupressoir \"If somebody breaks your system, you will only know once they've got your data.\"",

      "US President Donald Trump said a deal would help American taxpayers \"get their money back\" for aid sent to Ukraine throughout the war and give Kyiv  \"the right to fight on\" against Russia.",
      "What are the terms of the deal?",
      "Key details have not yet been made public, but on Wednesday Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine and the US had finalised a version of the agreement.",
      "Speaking to Ukrainian TV, Shmyhal said the preliminary agreement envisages that an \"investment fund\" would be set up for Ukraine's reconstruction.",
      "Kyiv and Washington would manage the fund on \"equal terms\", the prime minister added.",

      "Zelensky has acknowledged the fund but told the BBC on Wednesday it was \"too early to talk about money\".",
      "The New York Times reported, citing a draft document, that the US would own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under US law, but not necessarily all of it.",
      "Disagreement over the terms of a minerals deal formed part of what was seen as a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky in recent weeks.",

      "Israeli TV channels carried a live feed of the scenes and - after a private burial - the public eulogies by relatives, with crowds gathering to watch on large screens in Tel Aviv's Hostages' Square.",
      "\"This trio settled in my heart, and I believe in all of our hearts,\" a woman called Neta told Channel 12. She said she had come from the north to pay her final respects to the Bibas family at the procession.",
      "\"I set out this morning at 04:30. I saw that I couldn't fall asleep, so I headed south. I wanted to come here to be as close as possible to the Gaza border communities, to be part of this farewell.\"",
      "Kfir, aged nine months, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was the youngest of the 251 hostages snatched in the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attacks. His brother, Ariel, was just four.",
      "Images of the two boys became among the most recognisable symbols of the struggle to return the hostages.",
      "There was deep anguish in Israel at the sight of Yarden Bibas, Shiri's husband, being released by Hamas at the start of this month without his immediate family.",
      "On Wednesday, Yarden Bibas paid tribute to Shiri, who was 32, as \"the most amazing wife and mother\", saying he would always love her.",
      "\"I want to tell you everything that's happening in the world and here in Israel,\" he went on. \"Shiri, everyone knows us and loves us. You have no idea how surreal this madness is.\"",
      "Wearing an orange kippah, or skullcap, he shared touching memories of his children and spoke of how he and his wife had been happily surprised on giving birth to their second red-headed boy.",
      "The Israeli president's residence was lit up in orange - the colour that has come to represent the family.",
      "At the procession's start, the Bibas family thanked Israelis for their show of support and expressed longing for days \"when we can once again gather in moments of joy, not sorrow\".",
      "Wrapped in an orange flag to watch the convoy of cars passing en route to the cemetery, Shontal expressed sympathy with the bereaved.",
      "\"I wanted to come and be close to them, to offer my condolences to Yarden and the family. I hope he manages to recover - not only from the captivity he endured but also from grasping and understanding this terrible tragedy,\" she told Channel 12. \"His tragedy is all of ours.\"",
      "A haunting video of Shiri Bibas was filmed during the Hamas assault in southern Israel over 16 months ago.",
      "She appears terrified as she clutches onto her children surrounded by armed men before they are taken away from their home. Hours later, surveillance camera footage showed them in Khan Younis.",
      "In November 2023, Hamas said that an Israeli air strike in Gaza had killed Shiri and her sons. However, that was never verified by the Israeli military, which only expressed \"serious concern\" for them.",
      "As recently as last week, the Bibas family continued to hold out hope that the mother and her sons could be returned to Israel alive. They asked the public to \"refrain from eulogising our loved ones\" until a government post-mortem examination was completed.",
      "Then, last Friday, after the first handover of the remains of dead hostages by Hamas since its deadly 2023 attack, under the terms of the Gaza ceasefire deal, news came through that devastated many Israelis.",
      "The Bibas boys were dead, their identities confirmed by DNA tests. The Israeli military spokesman said pathological exams and intelligence showed they had been murdered by their captors \"with their bare hands\".",
      "In addition, the remains of Shiri Bibas were not found in the coffin labelled with her name that had been handed to the International Committee of the Red Cross.",
      "This was said to contain the remains of a Palestinian woman from Gaza instead.  Hamas suggested that there may have been a mix up in the aftermath of the Israeli bombardment.",
      "Two days later, the Bibas family announced that Shiri's body had been returned to Israel and that she too had been murdered in captivity.",
      "The upsetting confusion over the bodies, along with the grim handover ceremony for the dead hostages staged by Hamas, were among what Israel said were truce violations, leading it to postpone the agreed release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners last Saturday.",
      "Hamas responded that this was a \"serious violation\" by Israel which threw the ceasefire process into a new crisis.",
      "Hours before the funeral, Israeli and Hamas officials said the crisis had been resolved by mediators, with the bodies of another four Israeli hostages now expected to be returned later on Wednesday or on Thursday at the same time as the Palestinian prisoners are freed.",
      "However, the fallout triggered fresh anxiety for the relatives of some 60 remaining hostages who remain unsure if their loved ones - or their bodies - will ever be returned from Gaza.",
      "A pledge by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to avenge the Bibas family's deaths only increased their relatives' worries.",
      "The family have criticised the Israeli media and Netanyahu for ignoring their wishes not to release more details of the circumstances of their loved ones' deaths.",
      "In a Facebook post on the eve of the funeral, Ofri Bibas Levy, the sister of Yarden Bibas, told the prime minister to \"shut up\" after he repeatedly described the murders. She said publication of the information was \"outright abuse of a family that has gone through 16 months of hell and still has the worst ahead\".",
      "The Bibas funeral came a day after that of Oded Lifshitz, who was also from Nir Oz and was 83 when he was abducted. His body was also returned last week. Netanyahu has said he was murdered in captivity by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.",
      "Shiri Bibas and her children were buried in a single casket next to the final resting place of her parents, Yossi and Margit Silberman, who lived in the same kibbutz and were killed there on 7 October.",
      "In total, some 1,200 people were killed on Israel's deadliest ever day. It ignited the deadliest ever war in Gaza, in which more than 48,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "At the funeral, Ofri Bibas Levy called on Israeli officials seeking forgiveness for their failure to protect Shiri, Ariel and Kfir that day to instead hold themselves accountable.",

      "Apple boss Tim Cook has said his company may have to change its diversity practices as the US legal landscape shifts.",
      "His comments came just minutes after a majority of shareholders rejected a proposal calling on the tech giant to consider ending its diversity policies, such as the use of race and sex in hiring decisions.",
      "Apple had urged shareholders to vote against the measure, which the company had argued was  \"inappropriately\" trying \"to micromanage\" its business.",

      "\"We'll continue to work together to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\" he added, saying the company would remain \"committed to the values that have always made us who we are\".",
      "The proposal targeting Apple's DEI policies was backed by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, which had also put forward the proposal at Costco.",

      "\"The vibe shift is clear,\" he said. \"DEI is out and merit is in.\"",

      "\"They've made the right moves. The one step they could go further... is to really say, 'Yes it's our values, we believe it's the right thing to do, but it's also an economic imperative.\"",
      "The fight over DEI in the US has raised questions about whether such policies in other countries will face similar challenges.",
      "Catherine Howarth, chief executive of the responsible investment charity ShareAction, said she thought that Apple - a global, consumer-facing firm - had made the bet that the benefits of pushing back against the shareholder proposal outweighed the risks.",

      "The latest consumption slump, however, has deepened amid not just a destruction in purchasing power, but also a precipitous drop in financial savings and surging indebtedness among the masses.",
      "The country's central bank has also cracked down on easy unsecured lending that propped up demand after the Covid pandemic.",
      "Much of the consumption spending of the \"emerging\" or \"aspirant\" class of Indians was led by such borrowing and \"turning off that tap will definitely have some impact on consumption\", says Pai.",
      "In the short run, two things are expected to help boost spending - a pick-up in rural demand on the back of a record harvest and a $12 billion tax give-away in the recently concluded budget. It will not be \"dramatic\" but could boost India's GDP - largely driven by consumption - by over half a percent, says Pai.",
      "But major longer-term headwinds remain.",
      "India's middle class - which has been a major engine for consumer demand - is being squeezed out, with wages pretty much staying flat, according to data compiled by Marcellus Investment Managers.",
      "\"The middle 50% of India's tax-paying population has seen its income stagnate in absolute terms over the past decade. This implies a halving of income in real terms [adjusted for inflation],\" says the report, published in January.",
      "\"This financial hammering has decimated the middle class's savings - the RBI [Reserve Bank of India] has repeatedly highlighted that net financial savings of Indian households are approaching a 50-year low. This pounding suggests that products and services associated with middle-class household spending are likely to face a rough time in the years ahead,\" it adds.",
      "The Marcellus report also points out that white-collar urban jobs are becoming harder to come by as artificial intelligence automates clerical, secretarial and other routine work. \"The number of supervisors employed in manufacturing units [as a percentage of all employed] in India has gone down significantly,\" it adds.",
      "The government's recent economic survey has flagged these concerns as well.",
      "It says labour displacement as a result of these technological advancements is of particular concern for a mainly services-driven economy like India, where a significant share of the IT workforce is employed in low value-added services sectors that are most prone to disruption.",
      "\"India is also a consumption-based economy, thus the fall in consumption that can result from the displacement of its workforce is bound to have macroeconomic implications. If the worst-case projections materialise, this could have the potential to set the country's economic growth trajectory off course,\" the survey says.",

      "Long queues formed at bus stops, where passengers grew increasingly angry when packed buses did not stop.",
      "Their numbers soon swelled with workers sent home early because most offices were paralysed by the lack of electricity.",

      "One of them, Sharon Ortiz, a 28-year-old waitress, told AFP news agency that the public transport system had \"collapsed\".",

      "\"We're going to celebrate tonight, and we'll roll up our sleeves and get right back in the morning.\"",
      "Democrats lined up to criticise the budget as a tax cut mostly for the wealthy, which they said would hurt low-income families who rely on the government-funded health care programme Medicaid.",
      "The party worked to get as many members in the chamber for the crucial vote, with Representative Brittany Petterson arriving with her son while on maternity leave.",

    "summary": "Cabin crew placed the body of a passenger who died mid-flight in an empty seat beside the pair.",
    "story": [
      "An Australian couple have spoken of the \"traumatic\" moment the body of a dead passenger was placed next to them on a Qatar Airways flight.",
      "Mitchell Ring and Jennifer Colin, who were travelling to Venice for a dream holiday, told Australia's Channel 9 a woman had died in the aisle beside them during the flight from Melbourne to Doha.",
      "The couple say cabin crew placed her corpse, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the remaining four hours of the flight without offering to move him, despite there being empty seats.",
      "Qatar Airways said it apologised for \"any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused\".",
      "The couple said they had not been contacted or offered support by Qatar Airways or Qantas, the airline through which they booked the flight.",
      "In a later statement on Wednesday, Qatar Airways said it had now spoken with the affected passengers to address their concerns, as well as the family of the woman who died.",
      "'Duty of care'",
      "Mr Ring told Channel Nine's Current Affair programme that staff had responded \"in no time\" when the woman collapsed, but that \"unfortunately the lady couldn't be saved, which was pretty heart-breaking to watch\".",
      "He said the cabin crew had tried to move her body towards business class \"but she was quite a large lady and they couldn't get her through the aisle\".",
      "Mr Ring said the crew had seen seats were available beside him.",
      "\"They said, 'Can you move over please?' and I just said, 'Yes no problem'.",
      "\"Then they placed the lady in the chair I was in.\"",
      "While Ms Colin was able to move to an empty seat nearby, Mr Ring said he had not been given the option to do so by cabin crew - even though there were vacant seats.",
      "When the plane landed four hours later, he said passengers were asked to stay put while medical staff and police came on board.",
      "He said ambulance officers had then started pulling blankets off the woman and he had seen her face.",
      "The couple said there needed to be a \"duty of care\" for customers and staff.",
      "\"We should be contacted to make sure, do you need some support, do you need some counselling?\"",
      "Ms Colin called the experience \"traumatic\" and said: \"We totally understand that we can't hold the airline responsible for the poor lady's death, but there has to be a protocol to look after the customers on board.\"",
      "In its latest statement, Qatar Airways said: \"We have been in contact with the family of the passenger who passed away to express our condolences on their loss. We have also directly spoken with the affected passengers to address their concerns.",
      "\"The safety and comfort of all our passengers is of paramount importance to us.\"",
      "A Qantas spokesperson said: \"The process for handling incidents onboard an aircraft like this is managed by the operating airline, which in this case is Qatar Airways.\"",
      "Barry Eustance, a former Virgin Atlantic captain, said deaths in the air \"occur more frequently than people would think\" but said as a far as he was aware there was no specific protocol in place for such situations.",
      "\"On a long haul flight it tends to depend largely on when it occurs and where it occurs and what the crew have in terms of facilities to place the body somewhere because on an aeroplane, there's no access to the hold, there's a crew rest area but that's for the crew so it can be problematical.\"",
      "A toilet area or galley area could be blocked off, he said, but the crew are required to keep a certain number of toilets available.",
      "Mr Eustance said that, while he was not being judgemental as he did not know the full situation, he was surprised that the crew did not move Mr Ring if there had been spare seats.",
      "\"I would expect the crew would do all they could to avoid that. You are creating potential future liabilities in terms of the trauma of the people next to whom the body was placed,\" he said.",
      "\"In my experience the crew would normally try to isolate the body, so there is no passenger exposure to the body and vice versa, for respect and privacy but also for medical reasons. You have a dead body that is uncontained and all that goes with it.\"",
      "Are planes crashing more often?"

      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "The class photo, a highlight of the film calendar, is usually taken much earlier in awards season, at the nominees luncheon, but that event was cancelled this year due to the LA wildfires.",
      "Here are 12 things we spotted in this year's class photo:",
      "1. Ariana and Cynthia held space at the front",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have spent the last few months crying, holding space and stroking each other's fingers as they promoted the screen adaptation of Wicked.",
      "The two actresses have redefined the film press tour in recent weeks thanks to their absolute adoration for each other - an energy they will have to recreate later this year when they do it all again for the release of part two.",
      "Before the photo was taken, instead of saying cheese, Erivo shouted: \"Everyone say 'Oscar nominee!'\"",
      "Last week, it was confirmed the pair will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony which will last a reported 10 minutes long.",
      "Wicked is the closest thing the Oscars have this year to a box office smash in the shape of last year's Barbie, and they'll be hoping the medley will recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.",
      "2. We absolutely need this woman's jumper",
      "We're aware the weather is getting warmer and the sun is rising earlier as we hurtle towards Spring, but we are nevertheless always on the lookout for a colourful cosy jumper and we need to investigate the origin of this one as an urgent priority.",
      "The woman with the impeccable sweater selection in the class photo is Maya Gnyp - a producer of I Am Ready, Warden - which is nominated for best documentary short.",
      "The film follows Texas death row inmate John Henry Ramire in his final days.",
      "3. A-listers packed out the front row",

      "Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.",
      "As a result, her fellow category nominees such as Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, have had to practise their best \"I'm just happy to be nominated\" faces this year.",
      "Madison, however, is a co-frontrunner in a tight race for leading actress. The Anora star is up against Demi Moore for The Substance in a category seen as a dead heat.",
      "4. James Mangold turned up just in time",
      "James Mangold, nominated this year for A Complete Unknown, is one of Hollywood's most respected and loved directors.",
      "So why is he sitting on an aisle seat in the second-back row, away from all his pals, looking sheepish?",
      "It's probably because he only just made the class photo by the skin of his teeth, arriving late to the event to an affectionate collective groan followed by cheers from his fellow nominees.",
      "Despite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard.",
      "5. We'd like to be the fifth member of this gang",
      "In a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating.",
      "They are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari.",
      "The movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan.",
      "6. The biggest stars were in the back row",
      "Sitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race.",
      "In the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself.",
      "She is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown.",
      "7. Bernie and Brandi appeared without Elton",
      "Also hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile.",
      "The pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary.",
      "Sir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair.",
      "It's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year.",
      "Instead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley.",
      "8. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet looked a little lonely",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown.",
      "In his speech, the actor talked about his desire to be \"one of the greats\" of Hollywood.",
      "However, the actor has not been campaigning as aggressively as frontrunner Adrien Brody, and for the class photo, Chalamet took an aisle seat, leaned out and put his fist to his chest.",
      "Seated just in front of him are Anora's director Sean Baker and his producer wife Samantha Quan.",
      "9. The leading actors led from behind",
      "Adding further star power to the blurry back row were best actor contenders Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan.",
      "Brody is the frontrunner to win, for his role in the Brutalist as a Hungarian architect who moves to the US after World War Two and is taken under the wing of a wealthy businessman.",
      "Sing Sing star Domingo plays a prison inmate who joins a performing arts programme, while Stan is nominated for portraying a young Donald Trump.",
      "10. Ralph represented for the Brits",
      "The Brits nominated in the acting categories this year are The Brutalist's Felicity Jones, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes.",
      "The actor was on Fiennes form, sitting in the back row alongside Sing Sing's John \"Divine G\" Whitfield.",
      "Fiennes is unlikely to win best actor, but if Conclave wins the top Oscar, he'll become the first actor ever to have appeared in four best picture winners.",
      "11. Some nominees were conspicuous by their absence",
      "Understandably, not every nominee was available to attend the dinner - best supporting actor frontrunner Kieran Culkin was among the stars missing from the class photo.",
      "But others were conspicuous by their absence, most notably Emilia P\u00e9rez star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n.",
      "The actress is persona non grata in Hollywood at the moment, after some historic tweets she posted resurfaced in recent weeks, severely damaging the film's awards chances in many categories.",
      "However, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself on Sunday - although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.",
      "12. Clarence Maclin knows what time it is",
      "Sing Sing star Clarence Maclin was widely considered the most notable absence in the best supporting actor category this year.",
      "But he is still nominated at the Oscars thanks to his story credit on the film, which means he is recognised in the best adapted screenplay category.",
      "Maclin was one of the real-life inmates at the Sing Sing jail, after being sentenced to 17 years in jail for robbery, aged 29, and was a member of the prison's Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA) programme.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:59:59 GMT",
    "summary": "As Syria's interim leader plans its future, Kurds in the north-east are battling Turkish-backed forces.",
    "story": [
      "To reach north-east Syria, we cross a rickety floating bridge over the River Tigris. Our minibus rattles as it takes us from Iraqi Kurdistan through Syrian oil fields, where jacks pumping crude oil line the roads.",
      "This part of Syria is controlled by Kurds, who call it Rojava - meaning western Kurdistan. Since 2012, after the outbreak of civil war, they have run it as a self-declared autonomous region, protected by Kurdish-led armed forces.",
      "But Bashar al-Assad's regime never recognised it and, despite his fall from power, its future remains uncertain.",
      "As well as more than a decade of civil war, the Syrian Kurds have faced years of conflict with its northern neighbour, Turkey - a battle they are still fighting.",
      "The fight against IS",
      "A decade ago, the Islamic State group (IS) swept through this region, capturing cities and villages with little resistance - until it reached the city of Kobane, next to the Turkish border, in September 2014.",
      "IS militants didn't manage to enter the city, but they imposed a brutal siege that lasted for months.",
      "Kurdish-led factions, supported by the US-led military coalition, broke the siege in early 2015. This January, I join the city's residents as they mark the 10-year anniversary.",
      "At the entrance to Kobane, women in their 50s, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, guard the checkpoints. Women played a crucial role in the fight against IS - many volunteered in the all-female Women's Protection Units (YPJ).",
      "As we drive around the city, the scars of war are still visible, along with posters of young men and women who lost their lives.",
      "But in the main square, the mood is festive. Young girls and boys, dressed in colourful Kurdish outfits dance hand in hand, singing as they celebrate.",
      "For the older generation, though, it is a bittersweet moment. \"Last night I lit candles for my martyred brother and others killed in Kobane,\" says Newrouz Ahmad, a 45-year-old mother of four. \"It is a joyful day, but also a painful one. I wish he was here to see it.\"",
      "Conflict with Turkey",
      "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in north-east Syria in 2019. But freedom from IS hasn't brought lasting peace.",
      "Turkey and a coalition of Turkish-backed rebel groups known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) have launched several military operations against SDF-controlled territories since 2016, and captured a swathe of territory running along hundreds of kilometres of the border.",
      "Turkey considers the largest component in the SDF - the People's Protection Units (YPG) - an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish rights in Turkey for decades and is listed by Ankara as a terrorist organisation. The country wants to push the SDF back from its border.",
      "As the Assad regime collapsed in late 2024, the Turkish-backed SNA launched a new offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates from the SDF.",
      "Now battles have reached areas near Kobane. A Kurdish commander in the city quietly tells me: \"Don't film here, we have built tunnels beneath the city to prepare for another siege.\"",
      "In the city, the smell of gasoline fills the air, and the deafening sound of generators can be heard everywhere. Locals tell me that most of the power stations, refineries, and even telecommunications antennas have been destroyed by Turkish air strikes over the past two years.",
      "Newrouz Ahmad says that having \"defeated IS in Kobane\u2026 we won't allow Turkey and its proxies to occupy our city, we will defeat them too\".",
      "At a restaurant, the moment people realise we are not locals, they surround us. I ask an old man with grey hair and a stick in his hands how old he is. I guess he is about 80, but the answer he gives embarrasses me. \"I am 60,\" he says.",
      "It's clear that people here have been exhausted by war, having witnessed so much death and bloodshed.",
      "And now the threat of another battle is looming.",
      "Reported attacks on civilians",
      "Turkish-made drones and Turkish jets have targeted SDF positions and supply routes around the city. Even civilians protesting have been hit.",
      "In a regional hospital, I find one of the wounded - Lea Bunse, a 28-year-old German peace activist who has been volunteering at a women's shelter in Rojava for over two years.",
      "She shows me a video of an attack on a demonstration she says she was part of in January. The footage shows two projectiles dropping from the sky and hitting a crowd of people dancing.",
      "The protest was held near the strategic Tishreen Dam, where fighting has been ongoing.  The SDF says six civilians were killed, and dozens more injured.",
      "\"An old man next to me was also injured,\" she tells me from her bed.",
      "\"I lost some blood\u2026 but when we got into the ambulance, another drone attack was carried out next to our ambulance,\" she adds.",
      "Human Rights Watch has condemned an attack that hit a Kurdish Red Crescent ambulance as an \"apparent war crime\" by the Turkish-SNA coalition.",
      "The Turkish foreign ministry told the BBC that \"reports claiming Turkey is involved in the attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure do not reflect the truth\" adding that the SDF sends civilians to a \"conflict-ridden area on purpose\" to use them as \"human shields\u2026 in order to not to lose control on the said dam\".",
      "It accused the SDF of using \"violence and terror\" to pursue \"its own separatist agenda\", violating a ceasefire and stopping technical teams from getting access to the dam for repairs.",
      "The Damascus dilemma",
      "Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is stuck between a rock and a hard place.",
      "The interim president - whose Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad - has been promising to form an inclusive government in Damascus, and he has asked all armed factions to lay down their weapons. Negotiations are reportedly being held with the SDF to find a solution for the north-east.",
      "But the inclusion of the Kurdish factions puts Sharaa in a difficult position with one of his main allies \u2013 Turkey.",
      "And when Sharaa opened a conference for national dialogue on Syria's future on Tuesday, the Kurdish autonomous administration was absent - it said it had not been invited.",
      "Speaking to me from a discreet location near an American base in Hassakeh province in the north-east of Syria, SDF commander Gen Mazloum Abdi tells me he has met Sharaa in Damascus before.",
      "But the two sides have still not reached an agreement.",
      "\"In reality, we are still at war with Turkey and its proxies. Turkish jets and drones continue to bomb us,\" he says, adding: \"In Damascus, it remains unclear what steps the new government will take. Their statements are positive, but they are under pressure from Turkey to act against the areas under our control.",
      "\"But the US, France, and some Arab nations are pushing them to recognize Kurdish rights,\" he says.",
      "For the US, SDF fighters have been the most reliable allies in the fight against IS.",
      "Today, hundreds of US troops remain in Kurdish-controlled areas, to counter IS sleeper cells.",
      "But the Kurds now fear President Donald Trump might withdraw these troops, leaving the region vulnerable to any Turkish military operation, and a possible IS resurgence.",
      "It's estimated that there are still about 40,000 IS family members and up to 10,000 jihadist fighters held in SDF-controlled camps and prisons in the north-east, says Gen Abdi.",
      "\"If Turkey attacks, we will have no choice but to redirect our forces,\" he warns. \"That would give IS an opportunity to attack prisons and free its fighters.\"",
      "Uncertain future",
      "There is further uncertainty for the women who fought against IS in the all-female YPJ ranks.",
      "The walls in the office of 29-year-old YPJ spokesperson Roksana Mohamed are covered with pictures of fellow female commanders killed in battle.",
      "\"So far, we haven't seen any roles given to women in Damascus' new leadership,\" she says. \"Why shouldn't a woman be defence minister?\"",
      "Ms Mohamed says women fought for their rights in this region. They have been actively involved in every aspect of political, social, and military life.",
      "\"If our rights are not respected, how can we be expected to lay down our arms?\" she asks.",
      "So while some believe stability in Syria is on the horizon, for the Kurds, the future remains unclear. Will they be recognised as partners in a new Syria, or face another existential battle?"

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 03:54:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The Liberal Party of Canada will soon choose a leader that will replace Justin Trudeau and become Canada's next prime minister.",
    "story": [
      "After back-to-back debates in both English and French, the candidates to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in Canada have made their case to voters.",
      "Card-holding Liberals will now choose between former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, House government leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis.",
      "Whoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year.",
      "A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\"",
      "Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates.",
      "The Trump Factor",
      "How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates.",
      "Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population.",
      "Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs.",
      "But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"",
      "Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US.",
      "Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems.",
      "How Canada can fix its economy",
      "Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation.",
      "Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living.",
      "Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money.",
      "But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care.",
      "As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth.",
      "Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity.",
      "Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling.",
      "\"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said.",
      "Defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre",
      "The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.",
      "Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.",
      "Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.",
      "Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.",
      "His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.",
      "Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.",
      "Supporting Ukraine and Nato",
      "Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.",
      "All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.",
      "Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.",
      "Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.",
      "Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.",
      "A rethink of the consumer tax on carbon",
      "A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.",
      "But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.",
      "Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada.",
      "Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax.",
      "\"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said.",
      "Gould and Baylis, on the other hand, said they would keep some version of the consumer tax on carbon in place, saying that fighting climate change comes with a price.",

      "Most of the prison guards and the city authorities had already fled. Shooting could be heard outside the jail.",
      "Hours later, inside the compound, there was a fire - apparently set by male prisoners as they tried to escape.",

      "\"I don't think that justice can exist in Congo,\" she says. \"I condemn the way the government is running things.\"",
      "The DR Congo government - more than 1,500km (1,000 miles) away in the capital Kinshasa - is no longer running anything in Goma. The rebels are in full control and are continuing to advance in the east.",

      "Women prisoners were allowed to keep one of their children in the jail with them.  Only two children out of 28 survived the blaze in the prison, according to a source. Child prisoners - held in a separate block - were released earlier in the day.",

      "She says \"children started to die\" when tear gas was fired into the women's section.",
      "\"The prison was surrounded by soldiers and police who, instead of coming to put out the fire, were firing bullets and throwing tear gas at us,\" Florence says.",

      "Some of the prisoners who broke into the women's section were looking for a safer escape route, she says.",

      "Her two-year-old daughter Esther died in the prison.",

    "summary": "As the first European leader to visit Trump since his inauguration, Macron navigated potentially testing talks.",
    "story": [
      "Relations between Europe and the US are unquestionably in crisis, so merely keeping things together as French President Emmanuel Macron did at the White House on Monday stands as an achievement.",
      "He did that by praising, flattering and gently cajoling the US president as they took questions in the Oval Office and held a joint news conference. This is a playbook that many leaders around the world now see as more productive than outright plain speaking or criticism of Trump.",
      "Macron managed to navigate what could have been a tricky day in Washington without conceding or revealing too much.",
      "He spoke of both countries wanting peace, and while he gently corrected one of Trump's claims on Europe's support for Ukraine, he also agreed that Europe needed to take more responsibility for its own security.",
      "But Macron did make one important concession \u2013 that Trump was right to re-establish some kind of relationship with Russia's Vladimir Putin.",
      "That is in sharp contrast to the view up until now in London, Paris and Berlin, which have all pursued a policy of isolating Putin and slapping sanctions on Russian industries and individuals.",

      "Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",

      "But at the same time, he stressed the importance of having an American backstop.",
      "Macron, however, did not get a commitment of US back-up from his meeting in the Oval Office. And if he was looking for a scintilla of criticism of the Russian president from Trump, then he did not get that either.",
      "What he did get was, at least to some extent, Europe's voice back at the table and he, along with other European leaders, will take some heart from that.",
      "It is clear however, that the ambitions for re-establishing the kind of close relationship that Europe and the US have had since the end of World War Two are not on anyone's roadmap.",
      "That is why Macron himself has been working on the idea of a more strategically autonomous Europe for some time, toying with ideas of combined European defence forces.",
      "His sense that Europe needs to adapt given the dramatic shift in the US position is shared by Friedrich Merz, who will be Germany's next chancellor.",
      "Merz has already said that he believes the US under Donald Trump is indifferent to Europe's fate, and that the continent needs to be independent of the US in terms of security.",
      "\"My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,\" Merz said.",

    "story": [
      "Nigeria's former military ruler Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, known as IBB, has released a new autobiography including several revelations about the turbulent times while he was in charge of the country from 1985 to 1993.",
      "A Journey In Service has got Nigerians talking and reflecting on what might have been if things had turned out differently - especially the controversial decision to annul the 1993 elections, and the execution of a childhood friend.",
      "Babangida has a mixed record. While some praise him for the infrastructural development Nigeria he oversaw, others say there was massive corruption during his time.",
      "Here are four takeaways from the book:",
      "The 1993 elections annulment",
      "This is the biggest talking-point as it touches on a topic which many believed altered Nigeria's history. Some say the country still has not really recovered from the annulment of the 1993 presidential elections.",
      "In the book, Babangida, now 83, for the first time expressed deep regret for cancelling that election.",
      "The poll was supposed to bring an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil.",
      "The date of the vote - 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day.",
      "Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated.",
      "Gen Babangida acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, had won the vote.",
      "However, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis.",
      "\"That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret,\" Babangida writes.",
      "At the time, he cited the issue of vote-buying, as well as the need to protect the country\u2019s judiciary as reasons for the annulment.",
      "Gen Babangida was forced to resign several months later.",
      "Nigeria's current President, Bola Tinubu, said at the book launch that Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place.",
      "Abiola\u2019s son Jamiu said the acknowledgment by Gen Babangida that his father had won the election came as a welcome surprise to him and some of his family members.",
      "\"Perhaps General Babangida was looking for peace,\u201d he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Civilian rule was eventually restored in 1999, 11 months after the death of another military ruler Gen Sani Abacha. He had seized power towards the end of 1993 in the wake of the annulled elections.",
      "Execution of a childhood friend",
      "General Mamman Vatsa and Babangida grew up together, were in the same class in school and rose alongside each other in the military. His execution in 1986 after he was convicted of a coup plot is another major talking-point of Babangida's presidency.",
      "\"We were very close friends,\" Babangida recalls.",
      "\"We had grown up together in Minna and had been classmates in Bida. We did several things together as peers. My wife recalled that we used to share a room as bachelors. We would reach out for whatever shirt was available, irrespective of whose it was, and just wear it and head out! We were that close.\"",
      "However, he says now realises that Vatsa had been jealous since when they were teenagers.",
      "\"With the benefit of hindsight now, I recall that a constant part of our relationship as teenagers and young men was a continuous and recurrent peer jealousy on his part towards me. He was always envious of my achievements, especially when he thought I was progressing better than him, either in school or our military career path.\"",
      "Vatsa and nine others were executed in March 1986. They were said to have planned a coup, which according to Babangida would have plunged the country into darkness.",
      "\"I had to choose between saving a friend's life and the nation's future,\" he writes.",
      "Nigeria's first coup",
      "Another contentious issue has been the 1966 coup which overthrew Nigeria's first government following independence from the UK. Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was killed, along with other high-ranking national and regional leaders.",
      "The fact most of the coup plotters were from south-eastern Nigeria meant the coup became known as an \"Igbo coup\" - a label Babangida rejects.",
      "He highlighted the role of Major John Obienu, an ethnic Igbo officer, who played a key role in quelling the coup, revealing that many senior Igbo officers were also killed in the mutiny.",
      "The book also sheds light on the involvement of members of other ethnic groups, notably Yorubas, many of whom he said had participated in the military takeover.",
      "The former leader confirmed that the original intention of the coup plotters was to release politician Obafemi Awolowo from detention and install him as president.",
      "Babangida writes: \"It was a terrible time for the Nigerian military. As I have said elsewhere, as a young officer who saw all of this from a distance, probably, ethnic sentiments did not drive the original objective of the coup plotters.",
      "\"For instance, the head of the plotters, Major Kaduna Nzeogwu, was only 'Igbo' in name.

We were very compatible; indeed, I can only recall two occasions on which we quarrelled, and neither of us was afraid to apologise to the other. In all our years of marriage, it was never necessary for anyone to mediate between us over a misunderstanding because of that original meeting of minds.",

      "One in five German voters put an X in the box for Alternative for Germany (AfD) on Sunday: a record result that has made them the second biggest force in German politics.",
      "Riding on the back of that success, the party is now calling for an end to the consensus in German politics not to work with the far right.",
      "That \"firewall\" - Brandmauer in German - has worked since the end of World War Two, but AfD joint leader Tino Chrupalla says: \"Anyone who erects firewalls will get grilled behind them.\"",
      "There is a determination among all of Germany's main parties to keep that block in place - and the German public backs them up: 69% see the AfD as a threat to democracy, according to voters surveyed on Sunday.",
      "Friedrich Merz, who won the election for the conservatives, believes the only reason the AfD exists is because of problems such as migration and security that need to be addressed: \"We need to resolve these problems... then that party, the AfD, will disappear.\"",
      "The AfD won 20.8% of the vote nationally, and as the light blue areas of the map show, it was dominant in the five states in the east, securing 34%.",
      "\"East Germans have made it very clear they no longer want a firewall,\" said Tino Chrupalla.",
      "Friedrich Merz will now go into talks on forming a government with the Social Democrats, who came third.",
      "Even though his party won 28.6% of the vote, it was still their second-worst result since World War Two.",
      "Support for the AfD doubled, and a million of their voters deserted Merz's conservatives for them, according to a survey by research institute Infratest dimap.",
      "Voters have not been put off by the fact that Germany's domestic intelligence classifies parts of the AfD as right-wing extremist - or that the party has now embraced a policy called \"remigration\".",
      "The AfD argues that remigration means deporting immigrants convicted of crime, but the term has been used by the extreme right to mean mass deportations.",
      "One of the big issues for the Christian Democrats is how to get their voters back and stop losing more.",
      "Merz has already flirted with the AfD in parliament, relying on their votes to push through a motion on migration.",
      "But he was clearly stung by a public outcry and the mass protests that followed in many German cities.",
      "Germany's chancellor-in-waiting is unlikely to try that again, especially if he forms a government with the centre-left.",
      "But now the AfD has more than 150 seats in parliament, its supporters in particular believe it is time for the firewall to go.",
      "\"I just hope that the firewall will fall. But we all know that it won't be like that,\" says pro-AfD TikTok influencer Celina Brychcy, 26.",
      "\"I think it will fall at the latest when new elections are held. Then they'll have to realise at some point they can't get through with what they're doing right now.\"",

      "Most of the voices you hear challenging the firewall come from the east, which may not be surprising considering the deep reach of the AfD, especially in the five eastern states out of a total of 16 across Germany.",
      "They won 38.6% of the vote in Thuringia and 37.% in both Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, far ahead of the CDU. It makes them increasingly difficult to keep at arm's length.",
      "On one of the big talkshows on German TV on Monday night, Harsh but Fair, one local mayor from Saxony, Mirko Geissler, believed the AfD should be put on the \"playing field\", so they could show what they could do. If not, they would end up surging to 40-50% in the polls, he warned.",
      "Liane Bach, an independent mayor from a village in Thuringia said that in her region, \"AfD voters aren't right-wing extremists\".",

      "That is the main issue the big national parties will have to address. How to avoid ostracising AfD voters who clearly have no problem with the firewall being breached.",
      "One mayor pointed out that one of her fellow residents who was also an AfD councillor was fixing the local fountain. It made no sense not to work with him.",
      "Prof Conrad Ziller from the University of Duisburg-Essen believes the greatest threat to the firewall could come at state level, rather than nationally.",
      "\"If you have trouble building a coalition in a state, then at some point, there could be a minority government that relies on the AfD, or gets votes from the AfD from time to time.\"",
      "On a national level, the worst-case scenario would be for a breakdown in a Merz-led coalition: \"Merz could make mistakes. If he gets really tough on immigration, it might become problematic with the SPD.\"",
      "Germany has already seen one early election because of a coalition collapse, and the AfD's Alice Weidel has made clear she is looking for early elections.",
      "Her repeated appearances on TV election debates have made her a prominent figure in Germany and helped raise her party's profile.",
      "But it was the constant focus on migration and security that became the number one issue for AfD voters, partly fuelled by three deadly attacks, all allegedly carried out by immigrants.",
      "Tackling insecurity, and the perception of it, will be an immediate task for the next government, when it eventually takes shape.",
      "Underlying the urgency, Bavaria's centre-right leader Markus S\u00f6der said the need to tackle immigration, along with Germany's faltering economy, was \"in fact, the last bullet of democracy\".",
      "There is no question of breaching the long-standing firewall for the moment.",
      "And the general secretary of Merz's party, Tom Unger, was adamant that there should be no collaboration with a party that opposed Germany's ties with the West, its membership of Nato and \"the European idea\".",

      "Adrien Brody, \"The Brutalist\"",
      "In 2003 Adrien Brody became the youngest best actor Oscar-winner in history for his performance in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist,\" as Wladyslaw Szpilman, a musician struggling to survive in the Jewish ghetto during the Nazi occupation of Poland. It was a role for which he virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning the piano so that he could play Chopin.",
      "Twenty-two years later, Brody is back with his second Oscar nomination for \"The Brutalist,\" Brady Corbet's lacerating tale of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, a Hungarian Jewish architect who emigrates to the United States, and his efforts both to resume his career and to assimilate in a society where antisemitism and classism are rife.",
      "T\u00f3th  is hired by a wealthy Pennsylvania industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete. In this scene, T\u00f3th  \u2013 who is working a construction site in Pennsylvania \u2013 is discovered by Harrison Lee Van Buren (best supporting actor nominee Guy Pearce), who sees in T\u00f3th a talent for which he wants to be the patron.",
      "T\u00f3th  accepts a commission. But once his wife Erzs\u00e9bet (best supporting actress nominee Felicity Jones) arrives from Europe, T\u00f3th\u00a0 feels caught between his artistic impulses and the realities of working in an America that, in many cases, is closed to the foreign born:",
      "Brody, whose mother and grandparents fled Hungary during the 1956 revolution, said their sacrifices informed his performance. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"",
      "He also heard the voice of his Hungarian grandfather in T\u00f3th. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said. \"I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"",
      "In this extended interview with \"Sunday Morning,\" Brody believes that empathy helped shape his own choices as an actor, \"trying to find films that have social relevance, or to represent people who don't have a voice and to give them that through me in some respect.\"",
      "Brody won the New York Film Critics Circle Award, the Golden Globe for best motion picture actor (drama), and the BAFTA for \"The Brutalist.\" The film received 10 Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director (Brady Corbet).",

      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet earned his first best actor Oscar nomination at age 22 for \"Call Me By Your Name,\" as a teenage boy who becomes the target of an older man. In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Chalamet plays the iconic singer-songwriter Bob Dylan during the years when he made a name for himself as a folk artist and as a rock star who, to a segment of his fans, left the roots of folk music behind.",
      "In this scene Dylan is introduced by Pete Seeger (best supporting actor nominee Edward Norton) for his first appearance at New York's Folk City, where he performs \"I Was Young When I Left Home\":",
      "Prior to shooting, Chalamet travelled to Minnesota to research Dylan's roots and his formative days. He returned to the state for a screening of the finished film in Minneapolis. In December\u00a0Chalamet told CBS Minnesota station WCCO, \"I think he's very proud of his Minnesota heritage, and I think, in some ways, the way I relate to him is, I think the iron ore in his songs and the iron ore in his voice \u2014 as a New Yorker, as a 28-year-old New Yorker, I don't think my path would have really brought me out here, ever.",
      "\"So, the first time I got here I thought, 'Wow, what a gift, Bob Dylan, being in this guy's worldview.'\"",
      "The actor was first attached to the project in 2019, but shooting was repeatedly delayed due to COVID and then the actors' strike. In the intervening years, Chalamet learned how to play the guitar. \"I don't know if I'll ever get this much time to work on something in advance,\"\u00a0he told The Hollywood Reporter. He also gained 20 pounds prior to shooting, to better match the folk singer's physique.",
      "He said the role marked the furthest that he'd stretched himself. \"And it became so biblical to me in terms of this man's life and his work that I felt if I let my focus err for a second, that I'd be self-loathing about it for years to come. I had three months to play Bob Dylan, and the rest of my life I don't get to be about that, so why not give it my all?\"",
      "To connect with what the reclusive Dylan represented, the actor told \"60 Minutes\" he disconnected from his own life for the two-and-a-half months of filming. He did not use his cellphone, or have visitors on set. \"I've never approached a character so intensely as Bob, 'cause I have such respect for the material,\" Chalamet said. \"And I knew I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I remembered that I was lazy on a day when something went wrong.\"",
      "In addition to learning how to play the guitar and the harmonica, the actor told \"60 Minutes\" he learned to perform about 40 Bob Dylan songs \u2014 far more than were originally called for in the script. But while Chalamet pre-recorded all the Dylan songs he'd sing in the movie (to be played back on set during filming), he said they sounded \"too clean,\" and so he tried performing live on set, doing so the first time in a scene in which Dylan visits his terminally ill hero, folk artist Woody Guthrie, in a New Jersey hospital.",
      "Director James Mangold said he knew Chalamet nailed \"Song to Woody\" on his first take: \"There's a moment in that scene right at the last stanza where he holds a note \u2013 that would never have happened if we'd used the playback track,\" Mangold said.",
      "Chalamet also examined video of the singer, including footage taken of a Dylan performing a duet of \"It Ain't Me Babe\" with Joan Baez, which he played at a reduced speed. \"That was when I really slowed down, 'cause it's fascinating the way Bob observes her,\" he said. \"And how he refuses eye contact in that video.\"",
      "In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Chalamet and Barbaro perform \"It Ain't Me Babe\":",
      "Speaking of the finished film, Chalamet said, \"I was honored and counting my lucky stars that we got to bring this to life. Because nothing's a given. No opportunity is a given. No career is a given. I talked a lot about this with Edward Norton: the gift to work on something where every day \u2014 whether listening to the musicians we were playing, or the musicians that inspired them, or reading the authors that inspired them \u2014 you learn more about yourself.\"",
      "Chalamet told \"60 Minutes\" he's not sure what he'd say to Dylan if he ever did meet him \u2013 but maybe not even mention the movie, and only talk about the weather: \"What his favorite sandwich is, or something like that ... I would play it super cool, you know? 'Cause I feel like he's probably used to so much hyperbole and praise.\"",
      "Chalamet won the Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance.",

      "At New York's Sing Sing prison, the organization Rehabilitation Through the Arts, or RTA, was formed to produce plays featuring incarcerated men performing classics by Shakespeare, as well as original plays that spoke to the lived experiences of men. \u00a0The value of theater as a tool of reform was made palpable by RTA's success; compared to the prison's typical recidivism rate of 60%, only 3% of former inmates who had taken part in RTA were back in prison three years or less after their release.",
      "Directed by Greg Kwedar, the film \"Sing Sing\" was built on the experiences of real-life former inmates (two of whom, Clarence Maclin and John Divine G Whitfield, share an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay). Colman Domingo was nominated for playing Divine G, a founding member of Sing Sing's theater program and an award-winning author.",
      "In this scene, Divine G attends a clemency hearing and describes to the commissioners how the prison program grew into something he calls \"wonderful\":",
      "Domingo was a journeyman actor whose work in recent years has exploded, from \"Fear the Walking Dead\" and \"Euphoria,\" to \"The Color Purple\" and \"The Madness.\" He received two Tony Award nominations (for acting in the musical \"The Scottsboro Boys\" and producing the play \"Fat Ham\"). He earned his first Oscar nomination last year for playing civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in \"Rustin.\"",
      "He talked about his recent success on \"CBS Mornings\"\u00a0last November: \"I feel that it's been a long time in my journey, where suddenly the roles are sort of meeting my skill set and what I'm curious about and what I can do. So, it just feels like I'm a journeyman actor. I've been working for 34 years, and it just feels like, I never knew what this time would be like.\"",
      "Last March, on the day of the Oscars, Domingo posted a picture of himself on Instagram as a child, writing, \"His dream came true. Not easily. With dedication, hard work, hardships, triumphs, pitfalls, detours, reroutes and love and faith. Today is a good day for this kid. He already won. And as you can tell he always loved a pop of color. Got it from his parents.\"",
      "That \"pop of color\" led to Domingo being asked by Anna Wintour to co-chair the 2025 Met Gala. \"She actually said, 'I'm not sure if you'd be interested in something like this or if you have time,'\" Domingo laughed. \"I said, 'I think I have time!'\"",

Cohn's dictum:\u00a0 Attack, attack, attack. Deny, deny, deny. Never admit defeat \u2026 lessons that Trump would carry through in his business career, social media projections and, later, political branding.",

      "In an appearance last October on \"CBS Mornings,\" Stan (whose credits include \"Gossip Girl,\" \"I, Tonya,\" \"Pam & Tommy,\" and playing Bucky Barnes in Marvel's Captain America franchise), admitted that he'd been warned by some to stay away from the project, specifically because it could be seen as a political third rail.",
      "\"Yeah, it's usually when I hear 'Don't do it,' I end up doing it!\" he laughed. \"But generally speaking, I think fear should motivate us to go into the storm, not run away from it.",
      "\"People are going to come into the film with a lot of baggage, a lot of projections [about Trump],\" he said. \"But I think trying to strip away all the noise and getting down to the basics \u2014 what is the emotional need? What is the drive? What was the potential of the man, and where did it end up? How did it all get to this today? And I think there's still value in understanding that.",
      "\"I think the film's about trust,\" said Stan. \"I think we have an opportunity to look at these people and genuinely ask ourselves, do we trust them? Can we use our human instinct rather than what we're being told to think, feel, and understand? Can we use our instinct to trust these people as we're going forward into the future?\"",

    "summary": "Lisa Jeanine Findley pleaded guilty to a charge of mail fraud in a plot to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland mansion and property.",
    "story": [
      "A Missouri woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to a federal charge accusing her of concocting a brazen plot to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland mansion and property before a judge halted the mysterious foreclosure sale.",
      "During a hearing in front of a Memphis federal judge, Lisa Jeanine Findley pleaded guilty to a charge of mail fraud related to the scheme. She previously pleaded not guilty to the two-count indictment, which also includes a count of aggravated identity theft that will now be dropped.",
      "When asked by the judge if Findley was admitting guilt and accepting responsibility, she said \"Yes.\" Findley will be sentenced on June 19. She would have faced up to 20 years if convicted, but she is expected to receive less than that under the plea deal.",
      "\"We are grateful for the hard work of the federal investigators and prosecutors who secured this conviction,\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in a statement. \"Graceland matters so much to so many people around the world \u2013 just go to Memphis during Elvis Week and listen to all the different accents and languages of fans who make the pilgrimage. All of Tennessee is glad that Graceland remains safely in the possession of Elvis's heir and that it will remain a celebrated Memphis landmark for generations to come.\"",
      "Findley, of Kimberling City, falsely claimed Presley's daughter Lisa Marie Presley borrowed $3.8 million from a bogus private lender and had pledged Graceland as collateral for the loan\u00a0before her death in January 2023, prosecutors alleged when she was\u00a0charged in August 2024. She then threatened to sell Graceland to the highest bidder if Presley's family didn't pay a $2.85 million settlement, according to authorities.",
      "Findley posed as three different people allegedly involved with the fake lender, fabricated loan documents, and published a fraudulent foreclosure notice in a Memphis newspaper announcing the auction of Graceland in May 2024, prosecutors said. A judge stopped the sale after Presley's granddaughter Riley Keough sued.",
      "Experts were baffled by the attempt to sell off one of the most storied pieces of real estate in the country using names, emails and documents that were quickly suspected to be phony.",
      "In May, a public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre estate said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owes $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Keough inherited the trust and ownership of the home after the death of her mother, Lisa Marie Presley.",
      "Keough filed a lawsuit claiming fraud, and a judge halted the proposed auction with an injunction. Naussany Investments and Private Lending \u2014 the bogus lender authorities say Findley created \u2014 said Lisa Marie Presley had used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Keough's lawsuit alleged that Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and that Lisa Marie Presley never borrowed money from Naussany.",
      "Kimberly Philbrick, the notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents, indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley nor notarized any documents for her, according to the estate's lawsuit. The judge said the notary's affidavit brings into question \"the authenticity of the signature.\"",
      "The judge halted the foreclosure sale of the beloved Memphis tourist attraction, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing that a company's attempt to auction Graceland was fraudulent.",
      "Elvis bought Graceland in 1957 and died there in 1977, and about five years later, the mansion was opened to the public as a museum and tourist attraction. Hundreds of thousands of tourists visit the 17,552-square-foot mansion each year, which was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Visitors can then stop at the large Presley-themed entertainment complex across the street.",
      "Elvis and other members of the Presley family, including Lisa Marie Presley and her son, Benjamin Keough, who died by suicide in 2020, are buried on the mansion's grounds.",
      "Keough, who starred in the television series hit \"Daisy Jones and The Six,\" said in a 2024 interview\u00a0with CBS News that she plans to continue running the beloved property and keep the mansion in the family. Keough and her husband Ben Smith-Peterson have a\u00a0daughter, Tupelo,\u00a0who is Elvis' first great-grandchild.",
      "\"I think, like, my instinct with everything is always to do what my mother would have wanted. Which is to keep it a home,\" Keough told CBS News last year. \"It was our family's home.\"",

      "Probst, who also serves as an executive producer of the show, said \"Survivor\" is like a study of human behavior where contestants must navigate complex social dynamics while completely relying on each other.",
      "\"It is truly unscripted. There is not a single hint or suggestion of anything,\" Probst explained. \"Survivor is unlike any other show because you are actually living in the jungle. The cameras don't go off and I give you a toothbrush or a burger.\"",

    "summary": "Roberta Flack's intimate vocal and musical style on \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\" and other hits made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after.",
    "story": [
      "Roberta Flack, the Grammy-winning singer and pianist whose intimate vocal and musical style on \"Killing Me Softly with His Song,\" \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" and other hits made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after, died Monday, her publicist confirmed to CBS News. She was 88.",
      "She died at home surrounded by her family, publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and could no longer sing.",
      "Little known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star after Clint Eastwood used \"The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\" as the soundtrack for one of cinema's more memorable and explicit love scenes, between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \"Play Misty for Me.\" The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack's graceful soprano afloat on a bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year.",
      "\"The record label wanted to have it re-recorded with a faster tempo, but he said he wanted it exactly as it was,\" Flack told The Associated Press in 2018. \"With the song as a theme song for his movie, it gained a lot of popularity and then took off.\"",
      "In 1973, she matched both achievements with \"Killing Me Softly With His Song,\" becoming the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record.",
      "She was a classically trained pianist discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known.\" Versatile enough to summon the up-tempo gospel passion of Aretha Franklin, Flack often favored a more reflective and measured approach.",
      "For Flack's many admirers, she was a sophisticated and bold new presence in the music world and in the social and civil rights movements of the time, her friends including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis, whom Flack visited in prison while Davis faced charges \u2014 for which she was acquitted \u2014 for murder and kidnapping. Flack sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, Major League Baseball's first Black player, and was among the many guest performers on the feminist children's entertainment project created by Marlo Thomas, \"Free to Be ... You and Me.\"",
      "Roberta Cleopatra Flack, the daughter of musicians, was born in Black Mountain, North Carolina, and raised in Arlington, Virginia. A gospel fan as a child, she was so talented a piano player that at age 15 she received a full scholarship to Howard, the historically Black university.",
      "Flack's other hits from the 1970s included the cozy \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" and two duets with her close friend and former Howard University classmate Donny Hathaway, \"Where Is the Love\" and \"The Closer I Get to You\" \u2014 a partnership that ended in tragedy. In 1979, she and Hathaway were working on an album of duets when he suffered a breakdown during recording and later that night fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan.",
      "\"We were deeply connected creatively,\" Flack told Vibe in 2022, upon the 50th anniversary of the million-selling \"Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway\" album. \"He could play anything, sing anything. Our musical synergy was unlike (anything) I'd had before or since.\"",
      "She never matched her first run of success, although she did have a hit in the 1980s with the Peabo Bryson duet \"Tonight, I Celebrate My Love\" and in the 1990s with the Maxi Priest duet \"Set the Night to Music.\" In the mid-90s, Flack received new attention after the Fugees recorded a Grammy-winning cover of \"Killing Me Softly,\" which she eventually performed on stage with the hip-hop group.",
      "Overall, she won five Grammys (three for \"Killing Me Softly\"), was nominated eight other times and was given a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2020, with John Legend and Ariana Grande among those praising her.",
      "\"I love that connection to other artists because we understand music, we live music, it's our language,\" Flack told songwriteruniverse.com in 2020. \"Through music we understand what we are thinking and feeling. No matter what challenge life presents, I am at home with my piano, on a stage, with my band, in the studio, listening to music. I can find my way when I hear music.\"",
      "In 2022, Beyonc\u00e9 placed Flack, Franklin and Diana Ross among others in a special pantheon of heroines name-checked in the Grammy-nominated \"Queens Remix\" of \"Break My Soul.\"",
      "Flack was briefly married to Stephen Novosel, an interracial relationship that led to tension with each of their families, and earlier had a son, the singer and keyboardist Bernard Wright. For years, she lived in Manhattan's Dakota apartment building, on the same floor as John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who became a close friend and provided liner notes for a Flack album of Beatles covers, \"Let It Be Roberta.\" She also devoted extensive time to the Roberta Flack School of Music, based in New York and attended mostly by students between ages 6 to 14.",
      "Flack had taught music in D.C.-area junior high schools for several years in her 20s, while performing after hours in clubs. She sometimes backed other singers, but her own shows at Washington's renowned Mr. Henry's attracted such celebrity patrons as Burt Bacharach, Ramsey Lewis and Johnny Mathis. The club's owner, Henry Yaffe, converted an apartment directly above into a private studio, the Roberta Flack Room.",
      "\"I wanted to be successful, a serious all-round musician,\" she told The Telegraph in 2015. \"I listened to a lot of Aretha, the Drifters, trying to do some of that myself, playing, teaching.\"",
      "Flack was signed to Atlantic Records and her debut album, \"First Take,\" a blend of gospel, soul, flamenco and jazz, came out in 1969. One track was a love song by the English folk artist Ewan MacColl: \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" written in 1957 for his future wife, singer Peggy Seeger. Flack not only knew of the ballad, but used it while working with a glee club during her years as an educator.",
      "\"I was teaching at Banneker Junior High in Washington, D.C. It was part of the city where kids weren't that privileged, but they were privileged enough to have music education. I really wanted them to read music. First, I'd get their attention. (Flack starts singing a Supremes hit) 'Stop, in the name of love.' Then I could teach them!\" she told the Tampa Bay Times in 2012.",
      "\"You have to do all sorts of things when you're dealing with kids in the inner-city,\" she said. \"I knew they'd like the part where ('The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face') goes 'The first time ever I kissed your mouth.' Ooh, 'Kissed your mouth!' Once the kids got past the giggles, we were good.\"",

      "McFarland, who was convicted of defrauding investors of more than $27 million, in 2018 was sentenced to six years in prison. He served four years and was released in 2022.

      "Since his death, his gift took on a new meaning for her. She told AP in 2017, 20 years after his death, \"I remembered my son said, 'Don't listen to my music.'

    "title": "Behind the scenes of \"Survivor\" Season 48",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 10:09:04 -0500",
    "summary": "The game is simple: can one player outwit, outplay and outlast 17 others isolated on a South Pacific island to win the $1 million prize? \"Sunday Morning\" travels to Fiji to go behind-the-scenes of a pioneer of reality TV with host Jeff Probst.",
    "story": [
      "Divide 18 strangers into three \"tribes\"; drop them on remote islands with little food and no shelter, and have them outwit and outplay one another until the last competitor standing is crowned the winner of a $1 million prize. When the adventure reality game show \"Survivor\" debuted on CBS in May 2000, nothing like it had been seen on American television before.",
      "Asked to describe the series, \"Survivor\" host and showrunner Jeff Probst said, \"It is a social experiment, in that it takes a group of people who don't know each other, and forces them to rely on each other, while playing this game where you vote each other out.\"",
      "Probst invited \"Sunday Morning\" to watch this experiment for ourselves, in Fiji, as he began taping Season 48, which premieres on CBS and Paramount+ this Wednesday.",
      "Asked if he still gets nervous hosting the series for the 48th time, Probst replied, \"I don't get nervous on 'Survivor.' It's weird. I've never gotten nervous. I lean into it. I love the uncertainty.\"",
      "And it's this uncertainty that's made \"Survivor\" one of the most popular shows on television for a quarter of a century. The show averages around 6 million viewers an episode. In the past 24 years, fans have collectively watched ten-and-a-half billion hours.",
      "\"When I knew 'Survivor' was going to be interesting was the first day of the first season,\" said Probst, \"when we abandoned everybody on the beach, and Richard Hatch \u2013 who ended up winning the first season \u2013 got up in a power position in a tree. And he was looking down on everyone, and he said, 'I think we should all talk!'\u00a0 And Sue Hawk, a truck driver from Wisconsin, looked up and said, 'Where I'm from, we work while we talk.'\"",
      "While Probst had no doubt, \"Survivor\" almost didn't happen. Mark Burnett, the British TV producer behind hits like \"The Apprentice\" and \"Shark Tank\" (and now President Trump's newly-appointed special envoy to the United Kingdom), re-imagined a Swedish reality series (\"Expedition: Robinson\") and took his idea to just about every U.S. TV network.",
      "\"And every network said, 'No. That's a crazy idea. We don't wanna do it,'\" said Probst. \"But Mark is not easily deterred. So, he went out and got sponsors for the entire show.\"",
      "At the time, Probst hosted music shows on cable TV (including VH1's \"Rock & Roll Jeopardy!\"). \"I was literally the last person hired,\" he said. \"I heard Mark talking about 'Survivor' on a radio interview. And he described the show. I knew when I heard it; I told all my friends, 'This is my show, this is what I've been waiting for.'\"",
      "Today, Probst (now also the showrunner) has his hands in every aspect of production, including combing through more than 15,000 audition tapes that arrive each year. \"I know within 30 seconds, honestly, within 30 seconds, I'm pretty sure you're gonna be on the show or not,\" he said. \"Some people are compelling immediately.\"",
      "People like Stephanie Berger, a technical product manager from New York City, and one of this season's chosen ones. Asked in Fiji what her strategy for the game will be, Berger replied, \"In my, like, day-to-day life, everyone will tell you that I get to be the alpha, like, I like to be in charge. I like control. And I know that I cannot come out here and do that.\"",
      "Kyle Fraser is a contestant from Roanoke, Virginia. \"When I first started watching 'Survivor,' I knew that this game was for me,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"Are you willing to lie? Like, where do you draw the line in your game?\"",
      "\"Listen, I am gonna have to lie,\" Fraser said. \"You know, I'm not gonna tell people I'm a lawyer.\"",
      "Contestants not only need to build trust through any means possible; they have to win mental and physical challenges from the moment they arrive, or risk getting voted off.",
      "Probst says what we see is never staged or scripted, including tribal councils, where he grills contestants off-the-cuff, a skill he's developed over time.",
      "I said, \"You're a student of psychology and anthropology.\"",
      "\"Without the degrees!\" Probst laughed. \"I've always loved all of that. I just never formally applied it. I didn't want to be a psychologist; I wanted to be a storyteller.\"",
      "What does make it on television is carefully selected from thousands of hours worth of video shot around the clock for 26 days, in what is one of the largest television productions on Earth. \"It's a great trick, because when you're watching 'Survivor' it does feel intimate, and it is,\" Probst said. \"When the tribes are on the beaches, there's just a small handful of crew there and producers. But when you get to a challenge or tribal council, you know, there's cameras everywhere. We have roughly 400 people that are our international crew. Then we have another 400 Fijians who work with us as well. So, we're close to 1,000 people.\"",
      "Each season films in the summer, with crews arriving months in advance, turning a resort into a production village.",
      "Roberta Limjap, who works in the art department, said, \"It's not only work, it's family.\"",
      "All of the materials, equipment and props are produced here. \"Everything is made from scratch,\" she said. \"You can't buy this.\"",
      "Dozens of young production assistants test every detail of the challenges while crews plot camera angles.",
      "I had my chance. And yes, it's much harder than it looks. And tribal members often compete exhausted and hungry. They are not fed when the cameras are off.",
      "I tried my hand at survival. Opening up a coconut is not easy. \"You know what I'm afraid of? Taking off my thumb,\" I laughed.",
      "Co-executive producer Jimmy Quigley coached me through starting a fire, while on my first try with a spear gun, I caught a fish. Beginner's luck!",
      "What isn't luck is \"Survivor\"'s staying power. \"That freedom to play is what keeps us out here in the middle of Fiji,\" said Probst, who \u2013 after 47 seasons \u2013 is the ultimate survivor.",
      "\"It sounds like you're in this until the end?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm in it now,\" Probst replied. \"I don't have any thoughts of not being in it. But I mean, yeah, if you're saying at 86, I mean, maybe I'm too old then! But I never really look at it that way. I feel like I'm a part of a team. And I've said to the people I work with, 'As long as you all keep showing up, I'll keep showin' up.'\"",

    "title": "Gallery owner Larry Gagosian on the art world's \"blood sport\"",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 09:26:10 -0500",
    "summary": "With 18 galleries around the globe, he's been called \"the biggest art dealer in the history of the world.\" Larry Gagosian talks about his estimated billion-dollar-a-year business and why, at age 79, he's still energized by the hustle.",
    "story": [
      "On any night, he can have art openings in Paris, in London, or at his flagship gallery in New York. With 18 galleries around the globe, Larry Gagosian has more exhibition space than most museums. His annual revenues are estimated at over a billion dollars, which (as The New Yorker put it) may make Gagosian \"the biggest art dealer in the history of the world.\"",
      "In 2022, when Andy Warhol's \"Shot Sage Blue Marilyn\" set an auction record for a 20th century artist at Christie's, the winning bidder was Larry Gagosian. The final price, with fees: $195 million.",
      "I asked, \"That must have been a crazy moment?\"",
      "\"When you're bidding at that level,\" Gagosian said, \"your adrenaline is \u2026 it's very exciting.\"",
      "\"It's a brutal business.\"",
      "\"It's a blood sport.\"",
      "\"What do you love about this most?\" I asked.",
      "\"I love the challenge,\" Gagosian smiled. \"I love winning.\"",
      "Gagosian represents more than 100 artists, and shows the works of Picasso, Warhol, and de Kooning. His clients include billionaire mega-collectors like New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, music mogul David Geffen, and cosmetics heir Leonard Lauder. Gagosian said, \"That's why New York is such a great city for an art dealer, because you have all these super-competitive rich guys trying to (you know, in a certain way) outdo each other \u2013 'I got one.' 'Oh, I got one better.'\"",
      "Gagosian, who grew up in an Armenian family in Los Angeles, never had any formal art training. In the 1970s, he was working as a parking attendant. Then he saw somebody selling posters on the street. \"I saw that and I said, 'Jeez, I could do that.' And so, I bought basically the same posters, I literally paid a dollar apiece, and then put a little aluminum frame on them and put 'em on a peg board and tried to get as close to twenty bucks as I could, which is a pretty good profit margin.\"",
      "He built it into a business, and started having shows. In 1981, a young New York artist caught his eye: Jean-Michel Basquiat. Gagosian bought three of his paintings on the spot. \"And sadly, I sold them all. Wish I still owned them!\"",
      "He'd give Basquiat his first West Coast exhibition, which put Gagosian's gallery on the map. \"It was a big deal in L.A.,\" he said. \"We did the show and it was, like, mobbed. The buzz was \u2013 I'd never experienced anything like that in my gallery.\"",
      "But Gagosian knew that New York was the center of the art world, and in 1985, he relocated.",
      "How was he received in the New York art world? \"They didn't like me,\" he said. \"I guess they thought I was gonna, you know, cause some trouble.\"",
      "\"Well, you kinda did!\" I said.",
      "\"I'd rather not go into that litany, but I was roughed up quite a bit by competitors, I think very unfairly.\"",
      "He earned a nickname, \"Gogo,\" which he says actually started when he was young. \"When I was kid, my friends had a hard time pronouncing my name, Gagosian. And that's really where it started. But then it became, people associate it with something else.\"",
      "But Gagosian made an important ally, the esteemed dealer Leo Castelli. On a walk together one day, Castelli stopped a non-descript man in the street: \"And so I said, 'Well, who was that?' 'Oh, that's Si Newhouse.' And I'll never forget his very words: 'He can buy anything.'\"",
      "Newhouse, who owned the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, would become Gagosian's first big client. At Sotheby's 1988 auction of Jasper Johns' painting \"False Start,\" they sat side-by-side: \"He didn't want to be seen bidding,\" said Gagosian. \"So, he would literally nudge me when he wanted to bid. And I bid, I think it was $17 million. And he got the painting.\"",
      "It was a record for a living artist at the time. \"It was, you know, like, jaw-dropping,\" Gagosian said.",
      "But that price seems almost quaint today.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think there's a billion-dollar painting out there?\"",
      "\"Maybe; I don't see why not,\" Gagosian replied. \"A young artist, if he's really talented, can sell for a million dollars.\"",
      "I asked Gagosian about the comments of one of his former rivals, Arne Glimcher of Pace Gallery, who said five years ago, \"This market has nothing to do with art. It's all about how fast one can make money.\"",
      "\"You know, there's a certain truth to what he's saying,\" Gagosian said, \"but I don't think it's just about money at all. I don't think, if people didn't love art, you know, I think they wouldn't buy it at that level. I don't think it's just an asset class. And it's not just about money. It's just gotten more expensive to buy really great art.\"",
      "\"Do you think in any way it distances ordinary people from loving art?\"",
      "\"No. I think it actually makes art seem more interesting. Wow! Somebody spent X amount of money for a painting? Wow, that's fascinating!\"",
      "Gagosian \u2013 who's had some high-profile romances, is single, and has no children \u2013 is still energized by the hustle. \"I guess to a degree I thrive on it,\" he said. \"It gives you something to go for.\"",
      "\"Why do you thrive on it?\"",
      "\"Cause I'm tenacious. And because I like to win.\"",
      "\"What's the win for you?\"",
      "\"The win is to keep it going. The win is to survive at the top. There's no real finish line.\"",
      "But there is, of course. Gagosian turns 80 in April. And the man who GQ magazine called \"The closest thing the art world has to a Caesar,\" still has no plans of succession for his empire.",
      "So, can there be a Gagosian without Gagosian? \"I don't know; that's the question,\" he said. \"I don't want to think it's an impossibility. I think it's a serious challenge. But I'm not ready to pass the reins. I enjoy it too much.\"",
      "I asked, \"Are you ever gonna be, do you think?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Well, it kind of means you're, like, never at rest.\"",
      "\"Well, there's no time to rest, really. It's overrated!\" he laughed.",

    "story": [
      "As the year 2000 ushered in the new millennium, boy bands and pop stars dominated the music charts, and the International Space Station welcomed its first crew, while back on Earth, reality TV was forever changed by an inaugural group of castaways on the CBS show \"Survivor\" \u2014 all when more than 70% of Americans didn't own a cellphone and only half of U.S. households had a computer.",
      "Phil Salvador, library director for the Video Game History Foundation, reflected on this era of rapid technological growth.",
      "\"If you were playing especially computer games back then, you were probably playing on the family computer,\" Salvador  said.",
      "It was a time when gaming hardware was evolving, and titles like Halo and first-person shooters were on the rise. But one game development company, Maxis, was trying something different: simulation games, designed to replicate real-life activities.",
      "At the helm was legendary game designer Will Wright, who had a personal reason for exploring the genre.",
      "\"Will Wright actually lost his home in the Oakland Hills Fire in 1991, and he had to start rebuilding his life, and that became the inspiration for his idea of Dollhouse,\" Salvador said.",
      "Initially a virtual construction game, Dollhouse failed to draw much interest. But when Maxis was acquired by Electronic Arts in 1997, EA recognized the quirky potential of the game.",
      "Salvador noted that EA realized that people liked telling stories and interacting with the simulated people more than the game's original objective: to construct homes. It was around this time when EA changed the concept from Dollhouse to The Sims.",
      "The Sims spent nearly a decade in development, ultimately creating a digital space where players could control virtual beings, environments and life choices. When the game debuted in February 2000, it was unlike anything seen before.",
      "\"It is a game where you're helping people do chores around the house and use the toilet and things like that, and it's not the most immediately compelling game idea, but once people started seeing it hands-on, I think they realized there was something special happening there,\" Salvador said.",
      "Despite the competition from PlayStation 2 and Xbox, The Sims quickly became a cultural phenomenon. By 2002, it had become the best-selling PC game in history.",
      "\"It is \u2026 humbling to look back on all of the people that we've impacted,\" said Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment, Technology and Central Development. \"Multiple generations of people grew up with The Sims.\"",
      "The franchise has redefined what it means to be a gamer, with women making up around 60% of the most recent game's player base. With over 500 million players, The Sims remains the largest brand in life-simulation games.",
      "Miele credits the game's successful longevity to it being an open canvas for creators to express themselves no matter their age.",
      "\"A player, whether you're 12 or 82, you can always be connected at the culture that you love through The Sims,\" Miele  said.",
      "The Sims continues to resonate with culture-makers too. This year, Grammy award winner Doja Cat joined The Sims' celebratory 25-hour livestream, as did Chappell Roan, the newly crowned best new artist who expressed interest in being Simmified, aiming to join the likes of the Black Eyed Peas and Glass Animals' Dave Bayley, who have recorded their songs in Simlish, the fictional language created for the game.",
      "\"Simlish was a brilliant, brilliant concept for The Sims, I have to say,\" said Rachel Franklin, EA's senior vice president and group general manager of lifestyle entertainment. \"What it does is it allows the player to be able to say, 'Hmm, I think they're saying this,' and allowing for choice and creativity and meaning that's directly connected to the player.\"",
      "Under Franklin's direction, The Sims 4 has become the most widely played title in the franchise, offering players unparalleled control over the customization of their Sims and their environments.",
      "\"We get stories all the time about how people, for example, they want to be an architect, and so they go and they play with building in The Sims, and that translates into, 'Hey, I was able to get my dream job as an architect because of all of that time I spent playing,'\" Franklin  said.",
      "\"There's also a lot of people that experiment with their own lives in The Sims, where some people will build a family, find what makes them happy through this cause and effect with these little people,\" she said. \"It's a safe space, and it's an optimistic universe. It's a place where, in the end, it all works out.\"",
      "As The Sims celebrates its 25th anniversary, its legacy is undeniable.",
      "\"In terms of importance, it is very close to the top of the list,\" said Salvador. \"When you think about games that really broke ground for what video games could be, you see, you know, Doom, which is the game, one of the first games that was a first-person shooter that really clicked on. You see something like Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong, obviously. The Sims deserves to be in that same conversation.\"",
      "And as to why the game is still relevant, Salvador said, \"Everybody brings a little of themselves into the game. Everyone gets something a little bit different out of it, far more than what the developers ever intended. How many games can say that?\"",

    "summary": "His current roster of performers includes Bowdie, who starred as Nana in \"Peter Pan Live,\" and Myrtle, who plays Charlotte York's dog in \"And Just Like That ...\"",
    "story": [
      "On a sprawling farm in Connecticut, Bill Berloni has spent nearly five decades turning rescue dogs into stars of stage and screen. The Tony Award-winning animal trainer has worked with between 200-300 dogs since 1976, all of them rescued from shelters.",
      "\"Someone told me they had cheap dogs at the animal shelter and I went looking one day,\" Berloni recalls of his first theatrical dog training experience. \"I found this little dog who was gonna be put to sleep the next day, adopted him and that was the original production of \"Annie\" and that was the original Sandy.\"",
      "That chance beginning launched a remarkable career. Berloni became the first trainer to feature a dog in a major role on Broadway, and remains the only animal trainer to receive a Tony Award for Excellence in Theater.",
      "His current roster of performers includes Bowdie, who starred as Nana in \"Peter Pan Live,\" and Myrtle, who plays Charlotte York's dog in \"And Just Like That ...\" One of his newest stars, Tana June, was rescued just four months before landing a role alongside six-time Tony winner Audra McDonald in Broadway's \"Gypsy.\"",
      "\"These are the original method actors because you're on stage and they're in the moment,\" Berloni said.",
      "The trainer and his team prepare the dogs extensively for live theater's unpredictable environment.",
      "\"We prepare them by taking them to shows ahead of time. We desensitize them to the things they're gonna be in touch with,\" he explains.",
      "For Berloni, working exclusively with rescue animals is a moral imperative.",
      "\"My answer is why not? And as a result, two to 300 animals have lived wonderful lives who might not have been alive,\" he says.",
      "When their performing days are over, all of Berloni's dogs retire to his farm.",
      "\"The thought of adopting a dog, exploiting it for money and then getting rid of it just didn't make any sense to me,\" he explains.",
      "Looking back on his unexpected career path, Berloni said, \"I think I'm the luckiest guy in the world.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 09:51:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Amazon MGM Studios and longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights.",
    "story": [
      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry,\u00a0Amazon MGM\u00a0announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren't disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\"With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\"",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.1 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007\u00a0concluded with 2021's \"No Time to Die,\"\u00a0Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in more than half a century of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting the next 007 film, or picking who inherits his tux. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\"We are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theaters around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\" said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \"We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\"",
      "Bond had been a family business since Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli secured the rights to adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels and kicked off a run of 25 Bond films produced by Eon Productions, beginning with 1962's \"Dr. No.\" Those movies have accrued $7.6 billion in the box office.",
      "In 1995, the elder Broccoli handed over control of Eon to his daughter, Broccoli, and stepson, Wilson. In recent years, the 64-year-old Broccoli has largely taken the lead as Wilson, 83, has aged into retirement.",
      "\"My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli,\" Broccoli said in a statement. \"I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of 'No Time to Die' and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.\"",
      "Broccoli and Wilson's previous standoff with Amazon MGM had essentially frozen development on the next Bond movie. No script, director or star has yet been announced for the next installment, an unusually long break for a franchise that has typically spaced films two or three years apart. Broccoli also produced the\u00a02022 film \"Till\"\u00a0and the musical \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" opening next month on Broadway.",
      "A key point for the producers in the Amazon acquisition of MGM was a commitment to theatrically release James Bond films. That Bond's future is now in the hands of an e-commerce giant with one of the leading streaming services will immediately prompt doubts from some fans about Bond's new corporate overloads. Other billion-dollar movie franchises, such as the Disney-owned \"Star Wars\" and Marvel brands, have struggled with over-saturation in recent years.",
      "Even Joe Russo, co-director of four Marvel Cinematic Universe films including \"Avengers: Endgame,\" pleaded to Amazon MGM: \"DON'T cinematic universe James Bond.\"",
      "\"It is one of our last, great theatrical events,\" Russo said on X. \"Don't dilute that with a plethora of streaming spin-offs.\"",
      "In an interview last fall ahead of receiving an honorary Oscar alongside her brother, Broccoli told The Associated Press that, in an era of upheaval in the movie industry, boldness was necessary.",
      "\"People are playing it very safe,\" Broccoli said. \"I think in times of crisis like this, you've got to be brave.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 11:33:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Arline Geronimus' research shows how societal pressures like institutional racism, classism, financial stressors or the environmental can impact not just the length of life, but also the quality of life for marginalized communities suffering chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Forty years ago, the public was outraged.\u00a0 It seemed there was a wave of teenage girls, particularly Black teenage girls, getting pregnant. \"This was a new idea, this new deviant class of people, and it was portrayed in these terms that were really not accurate: babies having babies,\" said Arline Geronimus.",
      "Geronimus was at the time a graduate student.\u00a0 The prevailing wisdom was that high rates of infant mortality in the Black community were because women were having children when they were too young. \"I had worked in a school for pregnant teens. And none of what I was hearing, and had taken as common sense myself, was what I was seeing,\" she said.",
      "Geronimus looked at the numbers and found that, actually, younger mothers were having more successful pregnancies. She said, \"For the Black women, the lowest risk ages were in the teens and the late teens. And then they went straight up, so that by the 20s, and certainly by the mid-to-late 20s, there was substantially more risk of infant mortality if you had a baby, compared to if you were 18 or 19. And by 35, things were off the charts.\"",
      "How did people react to what she found? \"Not very well!\" Geronimus said. \"People thought I was promoting teen childbearing. The papers wrote columns where they called it things like, 'Research Queen Says Let Them Have Babies.'\u00a0 I got death threats.\"",
      "Geronimus became a professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, where she teaches to this day. She lowered her profile, but also widened her perspective, examining indicators like the lower life expectancy of Black Americans (72.8 years) compared to white Americans (77.5).",
      "She developed a theory: that stress caused by racism and other societal pressures contributes to poor health. She named it \"Weathering.\"",
      "\"The idea of weathering was connoting sort of how a rock, for example, would be weathered by hundreds of years of rain and wind,\" she said. \"It's gonna affect it [and] absolutely wear it down. I like the word weathering in particular, because it also has another meaning, which is that you weather the storm.\"",
      "The weathering theory deals with not just length of life, but quality of life. For example, while on average Black women outlive white men (76.5 years versus 75.1), Geronimus found that Black women faced shorter active life expectancies (59 years) than white men (64) \u2013 that is, Black women become disabled at earlier ages.",
      "After decades of working on the theory, she pulled it all together in a book called, \"Weathering: The Extraordinary Stress of Ordinary Life in an Unjust Society\" (Little, Brown Spark).\u00a0 She defines weathering as the way that structural racism makes life very hard. But there are a lot of different factors. \"This is not something that just affects people of color; it can be a class issue as well?\" I asked.",
      "Geronimus said, \"It can be a class issue, it can be a stigmatized group issue; anybody who's human is capable of becoming weathered, and will become weathered to some degree, if they're also oppressed or marginalized or suffering endless stressors, whether it's environmental or material hardships or hunger, or whether it's the fact that you're not affirmed or valued, and you have to question where you belong, and what it's safe to do or say in different situations.\"",
      "Dr. Kimberlydawn Wisdom has spent much of her career putting Geronimus' theories into practice, trying to overcome the impacts of weathering: \"She endured a lot for this work. And we just have to applaud her. Her courage is remarkable.\"",
      "Wisdom is the senior vice president of community health and equity at Henry Ford Health in Detroit. She also served as Michigan's first surgeon general.",
      "She notes how day-to-day stress actually changes the body down to the cellular level, leading to premature aging. \"The body keeps score,\" she said. \"So, take diabetes, take hypertension, take cardiovascular disease, infant mortality, maternal mortality \u2013 just multiply the poor outcome by two or by three, and that's what you see in the populations of color. So, it's like the Caucasian population can catch a cold, but populations of color actually develop pneumonia.\"",
      "For example, the latest studies show infant mortality rates for Black Americans that are more than double those of white Americans (10.9 versus 4.52).",
      "To take on the challenge, Dr. Wisdom founded the WIN Network, which stands for the Women-Inspired Neighborhood Network. Expectant mothers are given health care, guidance and support through pregnancy and beyond, which has led to maternal and infant deaths falling, and birthweights rising.",
      "Courtney Anderson said the experience of having her third child, Kalani, through WIN was great. \"She's a happy baby. Most happiest baby I got,\" Anderson said.",
      "Anderson had her first child, Kamrine, before she was in the WIN Network. He was followed a year later by his brother, Kristian. \"With my first child \u2026 I had my hands full, kind of stressed. Kind of bummed out. Post-partum depression.\" But she says the support she received through WIN was a major improvement, increasing her happiness, which in turn has impacted her children positively. \"It's going to affect them really well to know that their mom's happy,\" Anderson said. \"When mom is happy, they get it, and they have a lot more.\"",
      "I asked Wisdom, \"What would you say to people who would kind of maybe blow this off and say, 'Everybody has stress, everybody has things to deal with, what's the big deal? Take care of it yourself. Be responsible for your own health'?\"",
      "\"Yes, people should eat healthy, have healthy behaviors, but yet we see the weathering, when we look through the lens of what's really happening in a society,\" Wisdom replied. \"You can do all those things and have a poor outcome. See, the typical narrative is you eat healthy, you go to school, you get a college degree, you have a good life and you live to 80 or 90.\u00a0 That happens with one population. When you find another population that eats healthy, goes to college, gets an education, gets her Ph.D., and dies of maternal mortality, something is wrong.\"",
      "When asked if the concept of \"weathering\" could be seen as another way of making Black people into victims, or building in another stereotype, Geronimus said, \"That couldn't be farther from the truth. Even if you go back to slavery, no one was working harder, or doing more.

      "More than 10% of the staff working for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration were fired this month as part of the government-wide cuts to recently hired federal workers ordered by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, task force.",
      "The cuts amounted to around 100 probationary workers, multiple current and former federal health officials told CBS News, and affected multiple teams around the department, ranging from recently hired directors of SAMHSA's regional offices to staff working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises, which the agency oversees.",
      "At the agency's communications team, whose work is aimed at raising awareness about the 988 hotline, a SAMHSA employee said a quarter of their team had been lost over the last month.",

      "Palosky declined a request for an interview, referring comment to SAMHSA and the Department of Health and Human Services. A spokesperson for the department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Officials predicted the impact of the cuts, like at many other health agencies that administer large swaths of grants and external contracts, would likely not be immediately felt. Instead, they said the cuts would translate to a long-term erosion of SAMHSA's ability to conduct oversight, a slowdown in grant approvals and bogging down updates to guidance.",
      "Much of the work in some parts of the agency is made up of awarding and tracking taxpayer dollars awarded to drug addiction and mental health treatment programs.",
      "That includes funding for the call centers that make up the 988 hotline, run largely by state and local governments around the country, as well as the nonprofit that administers it.",
      "Federal health officials said they also feared the cuts at the agency would herald a return of the plummeting morale under the first Trump administration, which followed a steep reduction in the agency's size.",

      "Employee satisfaction scores began to recover in 2020, reaching a record high of 81.5 by 2023, above the average. The size of the SAMHSA workforce also grew to 633 by 2023.",
      "Most federal health agencies have also faced firings in recent weeks, largely handed down by either termination letters this past weekend from HHSor as a result of severed contracts.",
      "Agencies losing contractors and recently-hired workers include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, and the Administration for Children and Families.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 14:47:31 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump is floating the idea of a new \"gold card\" visa that would be sold to wealthy foreigners for $5 million.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday unveiled a new pathway to residency: a \"gold card\" aimed at wealthy foreigners willing to pay millions for the right to live in the U.S.",
      "That term is a play on the green card, more officially known as a permanent residency card, which allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the U.S. Green cards are most frequently awarded to foreigners who marry U.S. citizens or to those who receive one through their employer, with the latter process taking an average of three years to complete, according to the Cato Institute.",
      "The new program comes as the Trump administration moves to change the country's rules for who can legally live, work and gain citizenship in the U.S. That includes tightening restrictions on many types of immigration in the U.S. and pushing to\u00a0end birthright citizenship, the constitutionally protected right to citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.",
      "The U.S. already opens the door to wealthy non-U.S. citizens who want residency through what is known as an EB-5 visa. But that program, launched in 1990, has long been cited for potential\u00a0abuses, including one prominent case from almost a decade ago that involved owners of a Vermont ski resort embezzling millions from foreign investors who hoped to score visas through the program.",
      "Yet both the new gold card and the EB-5 program have a common goal: Attracting foreign capital by allowing rich non-citizens to ante up in exchange for a U.S. residency visa.",
      "\"It's going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card, they'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Here's what to know about the gold card plan.",
      "What is Trump's gold card?",
      "The gold card will offer a new route for rich non-U.S. citizens to gain a valid visa to live and work in the U.S., according to Mr. Trump, who spoke Tuesday about the new visa with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick from the Oval Office.",
      "The cost of each new visa will be $5 million, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges, plus,\" the president added.",
      "Green cards allow recipients to live permanently in the U.S. and work for whomever they choose. By comparison, some immigrants, such as those on H-1B visas, are locked into working for the employer that sponsored their visa.",
      "Green card holders can also travel in and out of the U.S. without restriction, and are able to start the process to become a U.S. citizen.",
      "When will the gold card be available?",
      "Lutnick said the gold cards would be available starting in about two weeks.",
      "Will the gold card replace the EB-5 visa?",
      "Yes, with Lutnick on Tuesday describing the EB-5 program as \"full of nonsense, make believe and fraud.\"",
      "\"So the President said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program,\" Lutnick said in joining Mr. Trump to outline the gold card program from the Oval Office. \"We're going to replace it with the Trump Gold Card, which is really a Green Card Gold.\"",
      "One major difference between the gold card and the EB-5 visa \u2014 the cost, with the latter requiring applicants to invest about $1 million in the U.S., typically by putting the money into a business. But the EB-5 visa also comes with a host of other requirements, such as documenting that the investment will create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers.",
      "How much money could the gold card raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump suggested that the the U.S. could \"sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that.\"",
      "At $5 million each, selling 1 million gold cards could raise $5 trillion, he said.",
      "\"And if you sell 10 million of the cards, that's a total of $50 trillion,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We have $35 trillion in debt. That'll be nice, so we'll see.\"",
      "Typically, the number of annual applicants for EB-5 visas is far lower than what Mr. Trump projects for the gold card. About 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.",
      "If roughly 8,000 people received gold cards each year, the U.S. would raise about $40 billion annually through the program.",
      "The U.S. is a top immigration destination for rich investors, according to Henley & Partners, a company that provides immigration advisory services.

    "summary": "Social Security Administration says it is immediately starting to pay retroactive benefits due to more than 3.2 million retirees.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of retired teachers, firefighters, police officers and others with public pensions will be reaping the benefits of the recently passed Social Security Fairness Act sooner than first projected, federal officials announced on Tuesday.",
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it was immediately beginning to pay retroactive benefits and will increase monthly payments starting in April to the more than 3.2 million people affected by a law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, who said it would mean an average monthly increase of $360 for more than 2.5 million Social Security recipients.",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act expanded benefits for millions by eliminating two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "How much will Social Security payments increase?",
      "Depending on the type of benefit and pension, the change in payment amount will vary from person to person. \"Some people's benefits will increase very little, while others may be eligible for over $1,000 more each month,\" the Social Security Administration stated.",
      "As Social Security benefits are paid a month behind, most of the affected beneficiaries will start receiving their updated payments in April for their March benefit, the agency noted.",
      "The benefits hike under the law would be retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "\"Social Security's aggressive schedule to start issuing retroactive payments in February and increase monthly benefit payments beginning in April supports President Trump's priority to implement the Social Security Fairness Act as quickly as possible,\" Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of Social Security, said in a statement.",
      "SSA in late January cautioned that those impacted might have to wait up to a year or longer to reap the benefits of the Social Security Fairness Act of 2023, which\u00a0became law on January 5, 2025. At the time, the agency noted that the legislation had not provided additional financing or staff to help implement the law or deal with the increased workload.",
      "\"The agency's original estimate of taking a year or more now will only apply to complex cases that cannot be processed by automation,\" Dudek added.",
      "Most eligible Social Security recipients will get their one-time retroactive payment by the end of March, which will be deposited into their bank account on record with the Social Security Administration.",
      "The agency is asking beneficiaries to wait until April to ask about the status of their retroactive payment.",
      "To learn more about the expanded Social Security benefits, including who is eligible and when recipients will see an increase in their payments, visit the Social Security Fairness Act website.",
      "The push to enhance Social Security payments for public pension recipients has been in the works for decades, with the Senate holding its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The new law had bipartisan support but faced last-minute objections from some Republicans due to its cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the law would add an estimated\u00a0$195 billion\u00a0to the federal deficit over a decade.",

      "The drink cuts, along with some food changes, reflect about a 30% reduction of menu items, according to Starbucks.",
      "The brand said it's responding to customer trends and preferences in making the changes.",
      "\"As part of our plan to get back to Starbucks, we're simplifying our menu to focus on fewer, more popular items, executed with excellence,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"This will make way for innovation, help reduce wait times, improve quality and consistency, and align with our core identity as a coffee company. \"",
      "When will the Starbucks drink menu change?",
      "The Starbucks menu changes will go into effect on March 4.",
      "The company offers recommendations for fans of the soon-to-be eliminated drinks to try instead. For example, a spokesperson encouraged Iced Matcha Lemonade fans to try the Green Tea Lemonade, which will remain on the menu.",
      "For fans of the Royal English Breakfast Latte, the London Fog Latte shares similar sweet floral notes, a spokesperson said.",
      "Peter Cohan, associate professor of management practice at Babson College, lauded the coming menu changes as a step in the right direction for the coffee company, but said this move alone won't be enough to turn the brand around.",
      "\"I think about Starbucks and the amount of frustration people have when they're ordering and want to pick something up and it's not ready; there's a lot of confusion,\" he said. \"And Brian Niccol is good at figuring out how to uncomplicate things and speed up operations by getting rid of things that are not working.\"",
      "As far as the menu changes go, while a small share of customers might miss the beverages that are being eliminated, Starbucks probably \"did the math and figured the cost of keeping them on the menu was greater than the benefits,\" Cohan said.",
      "\"The dissatisfaction of those few customers is a small price to pay and hopefully they will get better service and other products those customers want to buy instead,\" he added.",

      "London \u2014\u00a0Sales data show many Europeans, seemingly angry with Elon Musk as he navigates his close relationship with President Trump to influence U.S. policy, may be choosing to steer clear of Tesla vehicles. A sharp decline in sales comes as anti-Musk ads appear in the U.K. and other countries alluding a comparison to Adolf Hitler.",
      "Tesla new vehicle sales fell across the continent by nearly half in January, plunging by 45% year-on-year, according to data compiled by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). In hard numbers, Tesla sold just under 9,950 vehicles in Europe in January. For the same month in 2024, the company sold just over 18,100 new vehicles.",
      "The drop in sales has hurt Tesla's share price, which had nearly doubled in the first month after Mr. Trump's election victory to a record high. Most of those gains have since been lost, and Tesla's market cap has plunged below the $1 trillion mark. The stock, which as of early Wednesday traded for roughly $305 in the U.S., remains up 54% over the last 12 months, buoyed by the company's ambitious plans for self-driving cars and humanoid robots.",
      "In Germany, Tesla sales fell nearly 60% in January year-on-year as would-be buyers voted with their wallets \u2014 possibly angered by Musk's purported meddling in the country's federal elections last weekend, which saw the far-right AfD party he backed become the country's second most popular.",
      "In France, Tesla's sales in January fell 63%. The plunge came after Musk backed far-right parties in that country and attacked left-leaning ones, although the impact of his political activities on Tesla's financial performance is hard to gauge and could reflect other factors, such as mounting competition from other EV makers.",
      "Tesla sales in the U.S. have also been declining, falling 1% in 2024 compared to the prior year \u2014 the automaker's first annual sales decline in 12 years despite global EV sales rising 7.3%. As CBS News' MoneyWatch reported this week, Wall Street analysts have said Musk's political activities could alienate consumers previously loyal to the brand, and protests have erupted at a number of Tesla dealerships in the U.S.",
      "\"Musk's DOGE related actions and more powerful alliance with Trump clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand,\" analysts for the U.S. financial services firm Wedbush wrote in a Tuesday company report on the automaker. \"There is some momentum around this effort in Europe and pockets of the U.S. as well since November. That said, we view this as containable brand issues for Tesla for now that are not a major cause for concern.\"",
      "A similar trend has been seen in Europe. While Tesla's European sales numbers plunged in January, ACEA data show sales of electric vehicles overall surged by 34%, with buyers increasingly eyeing options from China and the continent's own automakers.",
      "In the U.K., after Musk attacked Prime Minister Keir Starmer and called for the release of a jailed far-right activist, January sales fell a comparatively gentler 12% year-on-year, but anger at Musk has been visible on British roadsides after an activist group called \"Everybody Hates Elon\" pasted over bus stop ads with posters showing Musk making a hand gesture that strongly resembled a Nazi salute at one of Mr. Trump's inauguration events.",
      "Musk has neither admitted nor denied his intent with the gesture, but he mocked the criticism of it, saying in a message on his social media platform X that, \"the 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\"",
      "On the protest group's posters, the words \"0 to 1939 in three seconds\" appear above the image of Musk, alluding to the start of World War II.",

      "Apple shareholders on Tuesday rejected a proposal to end the iPhone maker's diversity, equity and inclusion program.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, had called on Apple to follow other major companies in backing off from DEI, which has come under fire from Republicans and from President Donald Trump.",
      "\"DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\" according to the\u00a0proposal offered by the group. It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",
      "In responding to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple defended its diversity program as an integral part of its corporate culture, crediting the policies in part for making the technology giant the most valuable company in the world.",
      "\"We've never had quotas or targets for Apple. Our strength has always come from hiring the very best people and then providing a culture of collaboration,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a question-and-answer period at the meeting, while conceding the company may need to revise aspects of its diversity policies \"as the legal landscape\" around DEI evolves.",
      "\"But our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone, and our work to that end, will never waver,\" he said.",
      "Apple disclosed in 2022 that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees; early two-thirds of its employees were men.",

      "But that trend has reversed of late, with Ford,\u00a0Google, McDonald's, Meta,\u00a0Target, Walmart and other large corporations scaling back their diversity initiatives under pressure from conservative activists emboldened by court rulings and by President Trump, who has banned DEI programs across the federal government.",
      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some companies' response to the current legal and political climate is a matter of rebranding, Glasgow said. Businesses may ditch the terms diversity, equity and inclusion, while substituting references to \"welcoming\" and \"belonging.\"",
      "\"[I]t's more about getting anti-DEI activists off their back,\" Glasgow said.",
      "Critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. By contrast, advocates of these policies say that supporting inclusivity doesn't inhibit companies from rewarding top-performing employees, while also helping organizations create a respectful workplace culture.",
      "Despite the pushback on diversity, roughly half of corporate leaders who were surveyed after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration said they weren't considering rolling back their DEI programs, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0of 350 C-suite executives from Littler, a law firm focused on labor and employment issues.

      "Tesla's \"net favorability rating,\" which measures consumers' perception of the brand based on survey responses, is at all-time lows, according to Stephen Gengaro, an analyst for investment advisory firm Stifel, who believes that Musk could be hurting the brand's score. Researchers asked consumers if they had a \"favorable\" or \"unfavorable\" impression of Tesla, ranging from \"very favorable\" to \"very unfavorable,\" to determine the rating. Respondents could also reply that they'd never heard of the brand, or that they had no opinion.",

      "Could Musk's ties to Trump actually help Tesla?",
      "At the same time, some on Wall Street say there are potential upsides to Musk's alliance with Mr. Trump. Perhaps most important, the Trump administration may seek to weaken or eliminate federal rules governing Tesla's self-driving vehicle technology, a major initiative for Tesla.",
      "Musk has long had ambitions to launch full self-driving vehicles powered by AI. The company plans to launch autonomous ride hailing in Austin in June, Musk\u00a0confirmed. Yet such efforts have been slowed by federal investigations into vehicle crashes involving Tesla's\u00a0\"Full Self-Driving\" system and by existing safety regulations.",
      "\"Trump's election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that's been stifling Tesla,\" Ives told the Associated Press.",
      "If the Trump administration eases regulations for self-driving cars, it would be \"a significant tailwind for Tesla's autonomous and AI vision heading into 2025,\" he added.",
      "Meanwhile, the dip in consumer perceptions of Tesla's brand could simply be a short-term headwind, Gengaro said. And long-term, the company's development of robotaxis and self-driving vehicles could provide much more of Tesla's growth than vehicle sales to consumers, he added.",
      "Tesla's sales struggles also could be based on other issues besides Musk, including mounting competition for EVs from other automakers.

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 20:19:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Sharp drop in closely watched consumer sentiment gauge marks the biggest monthly decline in confidence in more than four years.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. consumer confidence plummeted in February, the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a business research group said Tuesday, with inflation seemingly stuck and a trade war under President Donald Trump seen by a growing number of Americans as inevitable.",
      "The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index sank this month to 98.3 from 105.3 in January. That's far below the expectations of economists, who projected a reading of 103, according to a survey by FactSet.",
      "\"The Conference Board survey is the 3rd data point in less than a week (after Fri's flash PMIs and Michigan sentiment report) making it abundantly clear that Trump-linked policy uncertainty is eroding confidence and tipping the economy (at least) into a slowdown (if not something worse),\" Adam Crisafulli, president of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said in a note.",
      "The seven-point drop was the biggest month-to-month decline since August of 2021.",
      "Markets on Wall Street immediately dropped. The S&P 500 fell 0.8% in morning trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.7%. The Nasdaq declined 1.6%.",
      "Tariff concerns",
      "Respondents to the board's survey expressed concern over inflation with a significant increase in mentions of trade and tariffs, the board said.",
      "Since taking office in January, President Trump has threatened sweeping tariffs which he says will bolster the U.S. economy over the long term. While it's not clear that Mr. Trump will enact all the tariffs he's outlined \u2014 he recently gave a 30-day reprieve to Mexico and Canada in his plan to enact 25% import duties on those countries \u2014 the president is also signaling plans to move forward with additional tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to lean on new tariffs to enact his trade and other policy objectives has prompted some economists to forecast higher inflation in 2025.",
      "\"The Conference Board's survey mirrors the Michigan survey in showing that consumers' confidence has deteriorated sharply in the face of threats to impose large tariffs and to slash federal spending and employment,\" Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "\"The weakness of confidence strongly suggests that recent rapid growth in spending on durable goods mostly reflects households pre-empting tariffs,\" he added.",
      "The Conference Board's report Tuesday said that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.3 points to 72.9. The Conference Board says a reading under 80 can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of consumers expecting a recession over the next year jumped to a nine-month high, the board said.",
      "\"This index says that consumers are rattled. Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" analysts with High-Frequency Economics said in report. \"The decline in consumer sentiment since the November election might not be a coincidence,\" they added.",
      "Growing pessimism",
      "Consumers' view of current conditions tumbled 3.4 points to a reading of 136.5 this month and views on current labor market conditions fell again.",
      "\"Views of current labor market conditions weakened,\" the group said Tuesday. \"Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a ten-month high.\"",
      "Consumers appeared increasingly confident heading into the end of 2024 and spent generously during the holiday season. However, U.S. retail sales dropped sharply in January, with cold weather taking some of the blame for a dent in vehicle sales and at retail stores.",
      "Retail sales fell 0.9% last month from December, the Commerce Department reported last week. The decline, the biggest in a year, came after two months of healthy gains.",
      "Inflation has also remained sticky. So much so that the Federal Reserve has taken a more cautious approach to interest rates, leaving its benchmark borrowing rate alone at its last meeting after cutting it at the previous three. Fed officials have also expressed uncertainty over the new administration's policies.",
      "The most recent economic data and a pessimistic turn among American households does not bode well for the U.S. economy, experts say.",
      "In a note to clients, Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote: \"Based on all the indicators showing declining consumer and business confidence and sentiment, we are expecting a slowing economy.\"",
      "The consumer confidence index measures both Americans' assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is apparently nearing a deal with Ukraine that could grant the U.S. access to mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees.",
    "story": [
      "Exactly three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and under pressure from President Trump, a senior Ukrainian official said negotiations over a deal that would give Washington access to Ukraine's vast mineral reserves were \"in the final stages.\"",
      "Ukraine's leaders have voiced hope that such an agreement might serve as the foundation of a long-term security guarantee for the country against any future Russian aggression, but the Trump administration has thus far remained non-committal, framing access to the resources as a way for Ukraine to pay the U.S. back for its support over the last three years.",
      "\"The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,\" Olga Stefanishka, Ukraine's Vice President for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said in a Monday\u00a0social media post, written in English. \"We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature. We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.\"",
      "Often called Europe's \"breadbasket\" thanks to its massive agriculture sector, Ukraine is also one of the continent's most resource-rich nations. Much of Ukraine's mineral reserves remain untapped, however, due to difficult access, old and undeveloped infrastructure and a lack of investment \u2014 all exacerbated by Russia's ongoing offensive military campaign, which initially started in 2014 with its invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.",

The occupied territory includes a significant portion of Ukraine's mineral reserves, including highly sought-after rare earth elements used in defense, aerospace, technology and energy production.",
      "The ground beneath Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's total reserves of rare earth elements. The U.S., which covers about 12 times as much ground, is estimated to have only 1-2% of the world's rare earths, by comparison.",

      "Ukraine also has one of Europe's biggest reserves of titanium. The strong, lightweight metal is a vital component in modern aircraft, missiles and countless other civilian and military hardware, from satellites to bicycles. Ukraine's reserves are largely found in the northwest and central regions of the country, which have remained firmly under Kyiv's control.",

I think we've made a lot of progress,\" Mr. Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House on Monday with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "\"I think this discussion (a potential mineral deal) is a very important one,\" said Macron. \"First, because it's important for the U.S. and it will be a good occasion for a first very important meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Second, I think it's \u2014 there is a lot of economic upside on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals as a way for the country to pay back Washington for the military assistance provided over the past three years.",
      "U.S. industry currently relies largely on China, which is the world's biggest source of rare earths and other minerals, for its raw materials. An increase in the supply of those materials from Ukraine could eventually mean a decrease in minerals purchased from China \u2014 and less concern from a national security standpoint.",
      "While the details of the deal said to be taking shape have not been shared, Zelenskyy earlier refused to sign an agreement that reportedly would have given the U.S. access to about $500 billion worth of his nation's mineral wealth \u2014 about half of its estimated future value.",
      "\"I won't sign a document that 10 generations of Ukrainians will pay for,\" Zelenskyy said over the weekend. He has stressed that any agreement to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals must come with security guarantees\u2014\u00a0 including, he suggested Tuesday, the possibility of American forces deploying to protect American investments.",
      "Zelenkyy's chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, said Monday that Kyiv was considering investment opportunities with both the U.S and European countries, \"which includes minerals, their development and extraction,\" calling his country's natural resources \"a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees \u2014 military guarantees and others.\"",

    "story": [
      "Egg prices jumped more than 15% in January from a year ago, with a carton of eggs costing Americans roughly $4.95. Producers blame it on the bird flu that has forced them to euthanize millions of chickens.",
      "With relief not expected anytime soon, some egg consumers are now looking for alternatives, including going to the source itself: Chickens.",
      "Egg consumers search for alternatives",
      "Across the country, several hatcheries who spoke with CBS News said they're seeing significantly more interest in buying chickens.",
      "\"Sales have gone up dramatically for all the people I know that sell chickens,\" Ron Goldsmith said.",

      "Renting hens has also taken off, with one company, Rent The Chicken, telling CBS News they lend out their chickens for six months at a time.",
      "\"There are a lot of considerations that go into making the commitment to keep chickens,\" said author Kathy Shea Mormino. \"If you travel a lot or have a job that keeps you away from home, most of the day, chickens are not a good pet for you.\"",
      "Known as \"The Chicken Chick,\" Mormino has been raising chickens in her Connecticut backyard for 20 years. She shares her experience on social media and wants people to do their research before committing to raising chickens.",
      "She said not all municipalities may allow you to keep chickens, explaining there could be restrictions on the location of the coop, number of birds and more.",
      "\"The best thing to do is to contact the code enforcement officer in your town to request information about any limitations that may exist with respect to the legalities on your property,\" Mormino said.",
      "Tips for saving on soaring costs",
      "Experts say the costs of raising chickens can quickly add up. A backyard hen in her prime can lay up to five eggs per week, but consumers need to consider the initial cost of the coop, chicks and feed, which could cost thousands of dollars. Meanwhile if you bought a dozen eggs per week at the grocery store, it would be about $300 per year.",
      "\"I always say that they're not just PEZ dispensers,\" Mormino said. \"So how many eggs they lay a week is going to depend on how healthy they are, how young they are, what the seasonal influences are.\"",
      "But there are some tips to save on eggs as prices continue to soar. Experts at Good Housekeeping suggest substituting a fourth cup of Greek yogurt in place of an egg while baking. Liquid left over from a can of chickpeas can also be added to recipes, or whipped into an aioli-like spread in place of mayonnaise.",

      "The H5N1 strain of the bird flu has been spreading since 2022. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it's impacted more than 162 million birds across the country.",
      "Mormino said bird flu is a big concern for flocks at home.",
      "\"Bird flu is distributed primarily by migratory waterfowl so they're droppings and other secretions are infected by the virus,\" Mormino explained. \"All you have to do is walk through duck poop at a pond in the local park and now you're carrying bird flu on your shoes, wherever you're going.\"",
      "She added the concern is true for wildlife as well.",
      "\"So all it takes is a mouse to walk through infected droppings from waterfowl that is a carrier and bring it into your backyard. ... But there are certain biosecurity measures that you can take and should be taking as a backyard 'chickeneer' with the prevalence of bird flu.\"",
      "At least 70 people have been affected by the bird flu, and one fatality has been reported. Human cases have been spread through dairy cattle, poultry farms and other animals, CDC data shows.",

    "story": [
      "Tax filing season is upon us, and some people are worried it may take longer to get their refunds as President Trump says he intends to make\u00a0significant cuts\u00a0to the IRS during its busy period.",
      "Tax experts say these concerns are valid and that it's more important than ever to file early this year, as Americans could encounter tax refund delays, particularly as they get closer to the filing deadline. The Internal Revenue Service began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15, unless a taxpayer asks for an extension.",
      "Mr. Trump is\u00a0expected to fire more than 6,000\u00a0IRS employees by the end of this week, as he doubles down on efforts to cut the size of the federal workforce.",
      "Tax accountant Terrance Hutchins, of Logos Financial Group, said taxpayers should expect longer hold times over the phone and slower customer service in general. He still expends refunds on relatively straightforward returns that are filed early and electronically, though, to appear in a timely manner.",
      "But many taxpayers could experience processing delays as a result of the anticipated cuts.",
      "\"Your refund can be very fast indeed if you receive it by direct deposit, but those promises were made a few weeks ago before the agency knew of the cuts, so it's very hard to say what the impact will be,\" Vanessa Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Will the IRS cuts affect how long it takes to get my refund?",
      "Tax accountants say the advice they always give taxpayers \u2014 which is to file their returns early \u2014 is even more important this year, in light of the anticipated workforce reduction. If the IRS' headcount is reduced, any errors on one's tax return will take longer to remedy.",
      "If taxpayers file close to the deadline or make mistakes in their returns, Hutchins expects a reduced workforce at the agency would lead to one's refund being delayed.",
      "Williams of the Tax Policy Center, said filers in need of assistance should expect slower refunds as a result of long wait times and worse customer service.\u00a0 \"You spend a lot of time on hold, and there are real consequences,\" she said, recalling the 2010s when the IRS was understaffed.",
      "Democratic Senators warned in a letter to the Trump administration Tuesday that potential staff cuts could lead to delayed tax refunds for Americans in 2025.",
      "\"Staffing reductions at the IRS resulting from Trump's hiring freeze and potential layoffs would likely delay tax refunds, harm taxpayer service and undermine law enforcement effort,\" the senators wrote. It's essential that the agency responsible for processing refunds be fully staffed to support Americans through tax season and \"answer their questions, process their returns, send them refunds and keep IRS systems online and functional.\"",
      "\"I always advise people to do their taxes as early as they can, partly because hackers can get their social security numbers and file false tax returns,\" Katie Brewer, a Texas-based financial adviser told CBS MoneyWatch. Brewer also expects cuts to lead to longer wait times to have tax-related questions answered by phone, a particularly burdensome for older filers, who aren't as tech savvy and might not be inclined to turn to the IRS' website for advice, she added.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "The IRS says that most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days, if you file your taxes electronically. It can take longer to get a refund on paper returns.",
      "Taxpayers filing electronically can view the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund? tool.",
      "Returns that require corrections or extra review could result in a delayed refund, the IRS notes. That's why Brewer says it's extra important to ensure that there are no errors on your return.",
      "\"Sometimes people don't double check things until after they hit send. But I really encourage to make sure not to mix up any numbers or accidentally add a zero because those are the kinds of things that hinder refunds or make it hard to deal with the IRS to correct them,\" Brewer said.",
      "Who counts on timely refunds?",
      "Millions of Americans count on receiving their refunds in a timely manner, so that they can repay debt, put money into savings, or make a big purchase.",
      "\"Particularly for working families who receive a child tax credit, or the earned income tax credit, these are often essential supports for Americans,\" Williams said. \"Low-income people use their tax refunds to pay off their winter heating bills, or to put money aside to cover spring clothes for their kids.\"",
      "She added that working-class Americans rely on their tax credits for financial stability. \"That's the purpose. To give people stability when they are working and have kids,\" she said. \"It's not a spare $20 someone might be excited to receive as gift or surprise. It's real money that underwrites the economic security of a very large number of Americans.\"",
      "The IRS last year piloted a new, free electronic service called Direct File, that provides public tax preparation services. It's currently available to 30 million Americans in 25 states, and pulls one's personal tax filing information directly from the IRS. Using such a service is one way to increase one's chances of receiving a refund in a timely manner, according to Williams.",
      "Why haven't I received my tax refund yet?",
      "The IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool will tell electronic filers what the status of their 2025 tax refund is 24 hours after they file a return, according to the agency's website. Those filing by mail can view the status of their refund four weeks after they mail in their return.",
      "To use the tool, taxpayers need to enter their Social Security number, or ITIN, their filing status and exact dollar amount of their refund rounded to the nearest whole number.",

      "A preliminary report from S&P Global found U.S. business activity is nearing stall-speed, with growth decelerating to a 17-month low. Activity for U.S. services businesses unexpectedly shrank, and many businesses in the survey reported slumping optimism because of worries about policies from the Trump administration, including the potential for new tariffs and domestic spending cuts.",

      "Inflation worries also weighed on the stock market, with a University of Michigan survey finding that consumers are preparing for higher inflation due to potential tariffs. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers, such as retailers such as Walmart, the costs are often passed onto consumers, raising prices.",

      "Akamai Technologies had the sharpest drop in the S&P 500, even though the cybersecurity and cloud computing company reported stronger profit than analysts expected. It lost a fifth of its value and fell 20.6% as investors focused instead on its forecasts for revenue and other financial measures this upcoming year, which fell short of analysts' expectations.",
      "Even within the big companies of the S&P 500 index, roughly 4 out of every 5 stocks fell. Everything from Big Tech stocks that have been bid up amid the artificial-intelligence frenzy to airlines to metals companies fell. Nvidia sank 2.5%. United Airlines lost 5.5%, and Newmont Mining fell 4.4%.",
      "To be sure, the U.S. stock market is still up for the young year so far and is not far from its all-time high set earlier this week. Virtually no one on Wall Street is forecasting a recession anytime soon. But Friday's reports together raise concerns about what's been a remarkably resilient economy, and the ensuing losses on Wall Street were widespread.",
      "Before Friday's sharp drop, the S&P 500 had been heading for a week of almost zero movement. Helping to lift stocks had been a steady parade of better-than-expected profit reports. That worked against worries about stubbornly high inflation, which could prevent the Federal Reserve from delivering more relief for the economy and financial markets through lower interest rates.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 12:33:22 -0500",
    "summary": "A grassroots effort is asking American consumers to refrain from making purchases at major retailers for one day in February.",
    "story": [
      "Over the past few weeks, information has been spreading on social media about a nationwide economic protest called the \"Feb 28 Economic Blackout.\"",
      "The call to action \u2014 or rather inaction \u2014 is asking that American consumers refrain from making any purchases at major retailers on Friday, February 28. The protest comes as people continue to endure\u00a0rising prices on everything from food and gas to housing and utilities, epitomized by the soaring cost of eggs which in January\u00a0averaged $4.95 a dozen.",
      "Behind the boycott is a group called The People's Union USA, a self-described grassroots organization founded by John Schwarz, a 57-year-old dad originally from Queens, New York, who has been promoting the consumer blackout for weeks on social media. The People's Union says it has no political affiliation, but focuses on \"fairness, economic justice and real systemic change.\"",
      "Some postings for the event created by online supporters have suggested a targeted boycott of retailers like\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's, Meta, Target and\u00a0Walmart\u00a0that have ended their DEI programs to comply with an\u00a0executive order\u00a0signed by President Trump in January. However, official messaging from The People's Union suggests a boycott of all major retailers, with the goal of enacting broader economic change.",
      "\"For our entire lives, they have told us we have no choice ... that we have to accept these insane prices, the corporate greed, the billionaire tax breaks, all while we struggle to just to get by,\" Schwarz said in a video posted to his Instagram account. \"February 28, the 24-hour economic blackout: no Amazon, no Walmart, no fast food, no gas, not a single unnecessary dollar spent ... for one day, we are going to finally turn the tables.\"",
      "The boycott has received support from celebrities including John Leguizamo, Stephen King and Bette Midler, each of whom has posted information on the Economic Blackout on their social media accounts.",
      "Schwarz did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "Why February 28?",
      "Schwarz explains on Instagram that he originally picked the Feb. 28 date to provide \"time to get amped up, to push this out there and really spread the word.\"",
      "What is the 24-hour economic blackout?",
      "According to an email circulating for the 24-hour Economic Blackout, The People's Union is urging consumers to halt all purchases, both online and in stores, from starting at 12 a.m. on Friday, Feb. 28 through 11:59 p.m. that same day.",
      "The idea is to halt spending at big corporations, Schwarz said.",
      "\"If you have automatic payments linked up to your bank account of course, we're not talking about disrupting your life,\" he said in a video. \"But do not go out and shop at any big, major store \u2014 if you have to, go to the local pizza place, the small local boutique.\"",
      "Will the Feb. 28 blackout make an impact?",
      "Consumer spending is the bedrock of the U.S. economy, contributing almost 70% of GDP, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But some critics say that halting spending for a single day isn't likely to make much impact on major retailers.",
      "\"A lot of people dismiss the idea, arguing that a one-day spending freeze won't move the needle for major corporations or the broader financial system. And I agree \u2014 it'll likely have a minimal direct impact,\" Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek.",
      "But, he added, the economic blackout could become bigger, snowballing into more events across the U.S. The People's Union is planning additional blackouts aimed at specific retailers, such as an event from March 7-14 to halt spending at Amazon.",
      "Schwarz expresses optimism in his videos that the economic blackout could make an impact. \"If a million people on the 28th do not spend a dime, you might not think out of 360 million people in this country that's a lot, but a million people all on one day not spending their money, that is a hit,\" he said.",

Along with protecting gold reserves, Fort Knox is currently also used as the Army's human resources command center, and it hosts the Army's largest annual training event each summer.",

It was made a permanent installation in 1932 and has been known since then as Fort Knox. The first gold arrived at Fort Knox in 1937 with the 1st Cavalry Regiment called on to guard the shipment.",
      "With the outbreak of World War II in Europe, the Army created the Armored Force at Fort Knox, and thousands of soldiers were ordered there and introduced to the tank. For nearly 80 years, the post was known as the \"Home of Cavalry and Armor.\"",
      "In 2005, the Army decided to move the Armor Center and School to Fort Benning, Georgia, and the Human Resource Command Center of Excellence was established at Fort Knox. In 2013, ROTC Cadet Summer Training was consolidated at Fort Knox. The post hosts the Army's largest annual training event each summer.",

      "Heavily guarded vaults seen by few",
      "Has the gold ever been removed? The Mint says only very small quantities have been removed to test the purity of the gold during regularly scheduled audits. Except for these samples, no gold has been transferred to or from the depository for many years. The gold's book value is $42.22 per ounce.",
      "The depository is very secure. The actual structure and content of the facility is known by only a few, and no one person knows all the procedures to open the vault.",
      "What is known publicly is that the facility was built in 1936 using 16,000 cubic feet of granite, 4,200 cubic yards of concrete, 750 tons of reinforcing steel and 670 tons of structural steel. The facility is heavily guarded and has broken its strict policy of not allowing visitors only three times.",
      "In 1974, the US Mint opened the vaults to a group of journalists and a congressional delegation so they could see the gold reserves. The Treasury secretary allowed the visit after persistent rumors that the gold had been removed. Until then, the only person other than authorized personnel to access the vaults was President Franklin D. Roosevelt.",
      "Since then, the vaults have been opened one other time: In 2017, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin visited with Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin and congressional representatives. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he would happily arrange an inspection for any senator who is interested in seeing the vaults.",
      "The gold depository at Fort Knox has a reputation for being impenetrable, which has gained it a place in popular culture. As early as 1952, a Looney Tunes cartoon featured Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam digging for gold in Fort Knox. Fort Knox has also been featured in the plot of movies such as the 1964 James Bond spy thriller \"Goldfinger\" and the 1981 comedy \"Stripes,\" which was partially filmed at the post.",

    "summary": "Amazon MGM Studios and longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights.",
    "story": [
      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry,\u00a0Amazon MGM\u00a0announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren't disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\"With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\"",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.1 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007\u00a0concluded with 2021's \"No Time to Die,\"\u00a0Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in more than half a century of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting the next 007 film, or picking who inherits his tux. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\"We are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theaters around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\" said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \"We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\"",
      "Bond had been a family business since Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli secured the rights to adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels and kicked off a run of 25 Bond films produced by Eon Productions, beginning with 1962's \"Dr. No.\" Those movies have accrued $7.6 billion in the box office.",
      "In 1995, the elder Broccoli handed over control of Eon to his daughter, Broccoli, and stepson, Wilson. In recent years, the 64-year-old Broccoli has largely taken the lead as Wilson, 83, has aged into retirement.",
      "\"My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli,\" Broccoli said in a statement. \"I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of 'No Time to Die' and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.\"",
      "Broccoli and Wilson's previous standoff with Amazon MGM had essentially frozen development on the next Bond movie. No script, director or star has yet been announced for the next installment, an unusually long break for a franchise that has typically spaced films two or three years apart. Broccoli also produced the\u00a02022 film \"Till\"\u00a0and the musical \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" opening next month on Broadway.",
      "A key point for the producers in the Amazon acquisition of MGM was a commitment to theatrically release James Bond films. That Bond's future is now in the hands of an e-commerce giant with one of the leading streaming services will immediately prompt doubts from some fans about Bond's new corporate overloads. Other billion-dollar movie franchises, such as the Disney-owned \"Star Wars\" and Marvel brands, have struggled with over-saturation in recent years.",
      "Even Joe Russo, co-director of four Marvel Cinematic Universe films including \"Avengers: Endgame,\" pleaded to Amazon MGM: \"DON'T cinematic universe James Bond.\"",
      "\"It is one of our last, great theatrical events,\" Russo said on X. \"Don't dilute that with a plethora of streaming spin-offs.\"",
      "In an interview last fall ahead of receiving an honorary Oscar alongside her brother, Broccoli told The Associated Press that, in an era of upheaval in the movie industry, boldness was necessary.",
      "\"People are playing it very safe,\" Broccoli said. \"I think in times of crisis like this, you've got to be brave.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 05:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA is already limited in policing claims of health benefits by makers of supplements and herbal remedies \u2014 a $70 billion industry. Get ready for even less regulation.",
    "story": [
      "Last fall, before being named the senior U.S. health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the Trump administration would liberate Americans from the FDA's \"aggressive suppression\" of vitamins, dietary supplements, and other substances \u2014 ending the federal agency's \"war on public health,\" as he put it.",
      "In fact, the FDA can't even require that supplements be effective before they are sold. When Congress, at the agency's urging, last considered legislation to require makers of vitamins, herbal remedies, and other pills and potions to show proof of their safety and worth before marketing the products, it got more negative mail, phone calls, and telegrams than at any time since the Vietnam War, by some accounts. The backlash resulted in a 1994 law that enabled the dietary supplement industry to put its products on the market without testing and to tout unproven benefits, as long as the touting doesn't include claims to treat or cure a disease. Annual industry revenues have grown from $4 billion to $70 billion since.",
      "With Kennedy now in the driver's seat, the industry will likely expect more: It aims to make bolder health claims for its products and even get the government, private insurers, and flexible spending accounts to pay for supplements, essentially putting them on an equal footing with FDA-approved pharmaceuticals.",
      "On Feb. 13, the day Kennedy was sworn in as secretary of Health and Human Services, President Donald Trump issued a \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda targeting alleged corruption in health regulatory agencies and instructing them to \"ensure the availability of expanded treatment options and the flexibility for health insurance coverage to provide benefits that support beneficial lifestyle changes and disease prevention.\"",
      "Kennedy has said exercise, dietary supplements, and nutrition, rather than pharmaceutical products, are key to good health. Supplement makers want consumers to be able to use programs like health savings accounts, Medicare, and even benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to pay for such items as vitamins, fish oil, protein powders, and probiotics.",
      "\"Essentially they're seeking a government subsidy,\" said Pieter Cohen, a Harvard University physician who studies supplements.",
      "As the Senate Finance Committee questioned Kennedy during his Jan. 29 confirmation hearing, supporters in the Alliance for Natural Health lunched on quinoa salad in a U.S. Capitol Visitor Center and crowed that the moment had finally arrived for their health freedom movement, which has combined libertarian capitalism and mistrust of the medical establishment to champion unregulated compounds since the 19th century.",
      "\"The greatest opportunity of our lifetimes is before us,\" said Jonathan Emord, the group's general counsel, who has brought many successful lawsuits against the FDA's restrictions on unproven health claims. \"RFK has dedicated his whole life to opposing the undue influence\" of the pharmaceutical industry and \"assuring that our interests triumph,\" Emord said.",
      "In speeches and in a pamphlet called \"The MAHA Mandate,\" Emord and alliance founder Robert Verkerk said Kennedy would free companies to make greater claims for their products' alleged benefits. Emord said his group was preparing to sue the FDA to prevent it from restricting non-pharmaceutical production of substances like biopeptides \u2014 complex molecules related to drugs like Ozempic.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not respond to a request for comment on the agency's plans vis-\u00e0-vis dietary supplements.",
      "While the basic law governing the FDA establishes that a substance alleged to have treatment or curative effects is by definition a \"drug,\" and therefore comes under the agency's requirements for high standards of scientific evidence, the new administration could reallocate money away from enforcement, said Mitch Zeller, former head of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "As a Senate aide early in his career, Zeller investigated a tainted L-tryptophan supplement that killed at least 30 people and sickened thousands in the U.S. in 1989. The scandal led the FDA to seek heavier regulation of supplements, but a powerful backlash resulted in the relatively weak supplements law of 1994.",
      "Even that law's enforcement could be undercut with a stroke of the pen that would keep FDA inspectors out of the field, Zeller said.",
      "Sweeping changes couldn't come too soon for Nathan Jones, founder and CEO of Xlear, a company that makes products containing xylitol, an artificial sweetener. The Federal Trade Commission sued Xlear in 2021 for making what it called false claims that its nasal spray could prevent and treat COVID.",
      "Jones points to a handful of studies evaluating whether xylitol prevents cavities and infections, saying the FDA would require overly expensive studies to get xylitol approved as a drug. Meanwhile, he said, dentists have been bought out by \"Big Toothpaste.\"",
      "One can hardly find any products \"without fluoride for oral health,\" he said. \"Crest and Colgate don't want it to happen,\" he said.",
      "Kennedy's desire to rid water supplies of fluoride because of its alleged impact on children's IQ is welcome news, he said, and not only because it could highlight the value of his products. Jones stresses, as do many health freedom advocates, that clean air and water and unadulterated food do more to prevent and cure disease than vaccines and drugs. For example, he and other advocates claim, wrongly, that the United States eliminated the crippling disease polio through better sanitation, not vaccination.",
      "The Alliance for Natural Health hopes that in lieu of strict FDA standards, Kennedy will enable companies to make expanded marketing claims based on evidence from non-FDA sources, Verkerk said, such as the National Institutes of Health's nutritional information site, which describes the pros and cons of different supplements.",
      "Kennedy has also called for relaxing the strictures on psychedelic drugs, which interest some veterans as potential remedies for such conditions as post-traumatic stress disorder. VETS, a San Diego-based organization, has paid for 1,000 veterans to get treatment with the powerful hallucinogen ibogaine at clinics in Mexico and other countries, said the group's co-founder, Amber Capone.",
      "She got involved after her husband, a retired Navy SEAL, pulled out of a suicidal spiral after spending a week at an ibogaine clinic near Tijuana, Mexico, in 2017. She wants NIH, the Defense Department, and the Department of Veterans Affairs to fund research on the illegal substance \u2014 which can cause cardiac complications and is listed as a Schedule I drug, on par with heroin and LSD \u2014 so it can be made legally available when appropriate.",
      "Coincidentally, the push for less onerous standards on supplements and psychedelics would come while Kennedy is demanding \"gold-standard science\" to review preservatives and other food additives that he has said could play a role in the country's high rate of chronic diseases.",
      "\"Put aside the fact that there's precious little evidence to support\" that idea, said Stuart Pape, a former FDA food center attorney. \"There's been no indication they want the same rigor for supplements and nutraceuticals.\"",
      "Although most of these products don't have major safety concerns, \"we have no idea which products work, so in the best case people are throwing away a ton of money,\" Zeller said. \"The worst-case scenario is they are relying on unproven products to treat underlying conditions, and time is going by when they could have been using more effective FDA-authorized products for diseases.\"",
      "Supplement makers aren't entirely unified. Groups such as the Consumer Healthcare Products Association and the Council for Responsible Nutrition have advocated for the FDA to crack down on products that are unsafe or falsely represented. The Alliance for Natural Health and the Natural Products Association, meanwhile, largely want the government to get out of the way.",
      "\"The time has come to embrace a radical shift \u2014 from reactive disease management to proactive health cultivation, from top-down public health diktats to personalized, individual-centric care,\" Emord and Verkerk state in their \"MAHA Mandate.\"",

      "Over the weekend, Musk posted on his social media site X that all federal employees had received an email with the subject line \"What did you do last week?\" and directed recipients to list five bullet points by 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday or be fired. Although several high-profile members of the administration posted on social media that they had answered \u2014 including White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt \u2014 other agency heads said they had directed their employees not to respond.",
      "The White House later said each agency could decide if employees had to reply. But Mr. Trump suggested at the start of a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday that they would be taking another look at the 1 million who did not respond, although he conceded that some could not respond due to the classified nature of their work.",
      "Those who didn't respond \"are on the bubble,\" he said, adding, \"maybe they're gonna be gone.\"",
      "Musk's role at the helm of the agency has been in question, with the administration denying he was is the DOGE administrator \u2014 a role specified in Mr. Trump's executive order creating the agency. On Tuesday, the White House said Amy Gleason is the administrator of DOGE, although Justice Department attorneys had said in court papers that they did not know who the administrator is.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 14:47:31 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump is floating the idea of a new \"gold card\" visa that would be sold to wealthy foreigners for $5 million.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday unveiled a new pathway to residency: a \"gold card\" aimed at wealthy foreigners willing to pay millions for the right to live in the U.S.",
      "That term is a play on the green card, more officially known as a permanent residency card, which allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the U.S. Green cards are most frequently awarded to foreigners who marry U.S. citizens or to those who receive one through their employer, with the latter process taking an average of three years to complete, according to the Cato Institute.",
      "The new program comes as the Trump administration moves to change the country's rules for who can legally live, work and gain citizenship in the U.S. That includes tightening restrictions on many types of immigration in the U.S. and pushing to\u00a0end birthright citizenship, the constitutionally protected right to citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.",
      "The U.S. already opens the door to wealthy non-U.S. citizens who want residency through what is known as an EB-5 visa. But that program, launched in 1990, has long been cited for potential\u00a0abuses, including one prominent case from almost a decade ago that involved owners of a Vermont ski resort embezzling millions from foreign investors who hoped to score visas through the program.",
      "Yet both the new gold card and the EB-5 program have a common goal: Attracting foreign capital by allowing rich non-citizens to ante up in exchange for a U.S. residency visa.",
      "\"It's going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card, they'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Here's what to know about the gold card plan.",
      "What is Trump's gold card?",
      "The gold card will offer a new route for rich non-U.S. citizens to gain a valid visa to live and work in the U.S., according to Mr. Trump, who spoke Tuesday about the new visa with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick from the Oval Office.",
      "The cost of each new visa will be $5 million, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges, plus,\" the president added.",
      "Green cards allow recipients to live permanently in the U.S. and work for whomever they choose. By comparison, some immigrants, such as those on H-1B visas, are locked into working for the employer that sponsored their visa.",
      "Green card holders can also travel in and out of the U.S. without restriction, and are able to start the process to become a U.S. citizen.",
      "When will the gold card be available?",
      "Lutnick said the gold cards would be available starting in about two weeks.",
      "Will the gold card replace the EB-5 visa?",
      "Yes, with Lutnick on Tuesday describing the EB-5 program as \"full of nonsense, make believe and fraud.\"",
      "\"So the President said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program,\" Lutnick said in joining Mr. Trump to outline the gold card program from the Oval Office. \"We're going to replace it with the Trump Gold Card, which is really a Green Card Gold.\"",
      "One major difference between the gold card and the EB-5 visa \u2014 the cost, with the latter requiring applicants to invest about $1 million in the U.S., typically by putting the money into a business. But the EB-5 visa also comes with a host of other requirements, such as documenting that the investment will create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers.",
      "How much money could the gold card raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump suggested that the the U.S. could \"sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that.\"",
      "At $5 million each, selling 1 million gold cards could raise $5 trillion, he said.",
      "\"And if you sell 10 million of the cards, that's a total of $50 trillion,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We have $35 trillion in debt. That'll be nice, so we'll see.\"",
      "Typically, the number of annual applicants for EB-5 visas is far lower than what Mr. Trump projects for the gold card. About 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.",
      "If roughly 8,000 people received gold cards each year, the U.S. would raise about $40 billion annually through the program.",
      "The U.S. is a top immigration destination for rich investors, according to Henley & Partners, a company that provides immigration advisory services. The group estimated\u00a0that the U.S. had the second-biggest net influx of millionaires in 2024, following the United Arab Emirates, at about 3,800 foreign millionaires moving stateside last year.",
      "Who could qualify for a gold card?",
      "Aside from having $5 million to pay the U.S. government, gold card applicants would also have to meet other criteria, Lutnick said.",
      "\"They'll have to go through vetting, of course, we're going to make sure they're wonderful world class global citizens,\" he said, without providing details.",
      "Asked by reporters if Russian oligarchs could qualify for the visa, Mr. Trump responded, \"Possibly.\"",
      "He added, \"Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people. It's possible. They're not as wealthy as they used to be. I think they could afford \u2014 I think they could afford $5 million.\"",
      "Do other nations offer gold cards?",
      "Yes, investor visas are common around the world. More than 100 countries offer \"golden visas\" to wealthy individuals, including the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy, according to Henley & Partners.",
      "Does the gold card need congressional approval?",
      "Congress determines qualifications for citizenship, but Mr. Trump said gold cards would not require congressional approval.",
      "\"We have it all worked out from the legal standpoint. It's totally legal to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication \u2014 it's a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump held his first Cabinet meeting at the White House on Wednesday and weighed in on a wide range of topics.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump publicly backed efforts by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to slash government spending and cut the federal workforce on Wednesday, with the president downplaying potential conflicts between Musk and members of his Cabinet.",
      "Mr. Trump opened his first Cabinet meeting shortly before noon at the White House, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seated beside him. For more than an hour, Mr. Trump weighed in a wide range of topics, fielding questions from reporters on Ukraine, Russia, Taiwan, the House Republicans' budget plan and more.",
      "But first, the president allowed Musk, who is not a member of the Cabinet, to address the group and discuss his work to cancel contracts and fire workers across the executive branch. Musk is not formally leading the DOGE task force, but has been tasked with overseeing its work by the president.",
      "\"They have a lot of respect for Elon and that he's doing this, and some disagree a little bit, but I will tell you for the most part I think everyone's not only happy, they're thrilled,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Over the weekend, Musk\u00a0sent an email to the entire federal workforce asking them to document five things they accomplished over the past week. On X, he said those who failed to respond would risk losing their jobs. The message sparked confusion from workers and multiple Senate-confirmed Cabinet members told their employees that they could ignore the demand, the first public sign of a split between Musk and other top officials.",
      "Musk said Wednesday that the email was meant to identify employees who may be getting paid without showing up to work, and that Mr. Trump signed off on sending the message. As of Tuesday, the White House said more than 1 million federal employees had responded. The president claimed that the assembled Cabinet members were \"very much behind\" the effort.",
      "\"And if they aren't, I want them to speak up,\" Mr. Trump said during the Cabinet meeting, adding that, \"in many cases, we haven't gotten responses.\"",
      "When a reporter asked Musk if he's heard of any Cabinet members who are unhappy with him, the president asked if those in the room had anything to say. None spoke up.",
      "Wearing a shirt that said \"tech support,\" Musk said DOGE's main goal is to help federal agencies address wasteful spending.",
      "\"DOGE is a support function for the president and for the agencies and departments, to help achieve those savings and to effectively find 15% in reduction in fraud and waste,\" Musk said. While he said that DOGE has tried to be transparent by posting all of its savings online, a CBS News analysis found many discrepancies in its so-called \"wall of receipts.\"",
      "Musk also admitted DOGE will make mistakes, revealing that it briefly canceled funding for Ebola prevention efforts distributed by the U.S. Agency for International Development before reinstating them. On Feb. 11, Musk made a similar claim that the administration had \"turned on funding for Ebola prevention and for HIV prevention,\" an apparent reference to waivers that the government approved, but the New York Times reported the next day that the aid remained frozen. On Feb. 13, a federal judge ordered the administration to reinstate foreign aid contracts and other assistance that had been paused.",
      "During the Cabinet meeting, a journalist asked Mr. Trump if it's his view of his executive authority that he has the power to call up any Cabinet official at the table and issues orders that the official is required to follow.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, they'll follow the orders, yes,\" the president said, adding, \"of course, no exceptions.\"",
      "Later in the meeting, Mr. Trump revealed that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, told him that he believes he can cut 65% of the EPA's workforce.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his plans to begin selling citizenship \"gold cards,\" which would allow foreigners to immigrate to the U.S. in exchange for $5 million, in about two weeks. Mr. Trump said prospective immigrants will be vetted, but he doesn't expect to restrict immigration from specific countries. The president suggested the $5 million payments would go toward paying down the national debt.",
      "On the foreign policy front, Mr. Trump said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is coming to the White House\u00a0on Friday to sign a critical minerals deal framework reached between the U.S. and Ukraine. The two countries reached an agreement on a framework for a broad economic deal that entails access to Ukraine's\u00a0mineral resources.",
      "Most, but not all, of Mr. Trump's top nominees have now been confirmed by the Senate. A full Senate vote has yet to be scheduled for Rep. Elise Stefanik, his pick to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, as House Republicans cannot afford to lose a vote given their razor-thin majority. Linda McMahon, Mr. Trump's pick to run the Department of Education, also has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Trump has pledged to overhaul that department.",
      "The president's nomination of Lori Chavez-DeRemer for secretary of labor is still in limbo, with no vote scheduled yet. And the Senate has yet to confirm Jamieson Greer as U.S. trade representative, although the Senate advanced his nomination this week, as the president imposes hefty new tariffs\u00a0on allies and adversaries alike.",

      "Ukraine and the U.S. have reached an agreement on a framework for a broad economic deal that would include access to Ukraine's mineral resources, three senior Ukrainian officials said Tuesday. The officials, who were familiar with the matter, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. One of them said that Kyiv hoped that signing the agreement would ensure the continued flow of U.S. military support that Ukraine urgently needs.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy is going to be coming on Friday, that is now confirmed,\" President Trump said Wednesday at the White House, at the start of his first full Cabinet meeting. He did not confirm that the terms of the agreement with Ukraine had been finalized, but one of the Ukrainian officials said the previous night that the deal could be signed as early as Friday and that plans were being drawn up for Zelenskyy to travel to Washington.",
      "Another official said the agreement would provide an opportunity for Zelenskyy and Mr. Trump to discuss continued military aid\u00a0to Ukraine, which is why Kyiv is eager to finalize the deal.",
      "Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters earlier Wednesday in the Oval Office, said he'd heard that Zelenskyy was coming and added that \"it's okay with me, if he'd like to, and he would like to sign it together with me.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called it \"a very big deal,\" adding that it could be worth a trillion dollars.",
      "What do we know about the deal?",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday that the \"critical minerals deal and the rare earths deal, as President Trump has said, is absolutely pivotal. We're very close to the finish line in getting that done.\"",
      "One of the Ukrainian officials said some technical details were still being worked out. However, the official said the draft does not include a contentious Trump administration proposal to give the U.S. $500 billion worth of profits from Ukraine's mineral resources as compensation for its wartime assistance to Kyiv. Zelenskyy had rejected that proposal, saying he would not sign off on any deal that \"ten generations\" of Ukrainians would be stuck paying for.",
      "Instead, the U.S. and Ukraine would have joint ownership of a fund, and Ukraine would contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned resources, including minerals, oil, and gas to that fund. One official said the deal had better terms of investments and another one said that Kyiv had secured favorable amendments and viewed the outcome as \"positive.\"",
      "The deal does not, however, include security guarantees. One official said that this would be something the two presidents would discuss when they meet.",
      "\"The main thing for me was that we are not a debtor,\" Zelenskyy told journalists Wednesday, adding that it was \"too early to talk about money,\" as the final terms were still being hashed out.",
      "It remained unclear Wednesday what share of the joint fund the U.S. would own or control.",
      "Agreement after acrimony?",
      "The progress in negotiating the deal comes after Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy traded sharp rhetoric last week about their differences over the matter.",
      "Zelenskyy said he balked at signing off on a deal that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed during a visit to Kyiv earlier this month, and the Ukrainian leader objected again days later during a\u00a0meeting in Munich with Vice President JD Vance because the American proposal did not include security guarantees.",
      "Mr. Trump then called Zelenskyy \"a dictator without elections\" and claimed, incorrectly, that his support among voters was near rock-bottom.",

      "The photo was instantly legendary: former President Trump with his fist in the air, blood seeping from his right ear and an American flag flying overhead.",
      "Sean Curran was a mostly anonymous U.S. Secret Service agent that July day in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a bullet clipped Mr. Trump's ear, coming within inches of his skull. In the photo, Curran is the agent on the right, sunglassed and unsmiling, after he and his team sprang to the former president's side to protect him.",
      "\"Part of me probably still hasn't processed it. I haven't \u2014 from that day to now \u2014 I haven't stopped,\" Curran told CBS News in his first news interview. \"I felt like I couldn't let him out of my sight. Not to the point where I'd be overworked, but to a point where I felt like I needed to be with him to ensure that things were done the way I needed them to be done. I didn't want to leave his side. I think he probably didn't want me to leave his side, either.\"",
      "His relationship with the president was forged over seven years of near daily contact, including two assassination attempts and court hearings that numbered \"too many to count.\" \"I mean we \u2014 it's life-changing,\" Curran said. Just after his second inauguration, Mr. Trump named him director of the Secret Service.",
      "Curran declined to reveal what Mr. Trump said on the way to and from the courthouse or during his arraignments \u2014 or on any occasion \u2014 other than to say Mr. Trump remained calm \"every single day, and that's on and off camera.\"",
      "The Secret Service made some preliminary plans for how to accommodate Mr. Trump if he were convicted in his four criminal trials and ultimately sentenced to prison time.",
      "\"We had serious conversations about it, and I at one point told him, he and I might be \u2014 getting a lot closer,\" Curran said, which drew a chuckle from a couple staffers in his office with him on the 8th floor of Secret Service headquarters.",
      "But Curran was serious. \"Look, if it came to it, I'd be sitting right next to him,\" he said. \"That's how much I care for him. That's how much I felt that he deserved the level of protection that any of our protectees should get. There's nothing I would have not done for him.\"",
      "Two federal cases against Mr. Trump were dropped during the post-election transition. A conviction in New York resulted in no jail time. Decisions about Mr. Trump's security would have been made by then-Acting Secret Service Director Ron Rowe.",
      "\"I think we would have treated [prison] probably like a site, and we would have had to probably own a certain portion of that facility,\" Curran said. \"It's still a law, you know, whether someone is in prison or not. The law still dictates that we have to protect them.\"",
      "Curran, who grew up in New Jersey, joined the Secret Service in 2001. He was assigned to then-Sen. Barack Obama as part of the Secret Service's dignitary protection division, then to Obama's presidential protection detail. Curran was recognized as special agent of the year in 2007. After a stint working for the assistant director of investigations, he was promoted to run the Secret Service coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign, and later, the protective intelligence squad. During Mr. Trump's first term, Curran became deputy supervisor on Mr. Trump's detail, then, in 2021, one of the youngest special agents ever to be named agent in charge.",
      "When his first term ended, Mr. Trump was persona non grata politically, and the Secret Service senior leadership team was focused on protecting then-President Joe Biden. According to other agents familiar with the situation, headquarters essentially told Curran to build a post-presidential protective detail on his own.",
      "As the controversial former president geared up for his third White House campaign, Curran and his deputy, Matt Piant, tried to warn headquarters that they couldn't treat Mr. Trump like a regular former president. They believed a typical protective footprint, like the bands of security provided to former presidents Obama or Clinton, wouldn't be enough to accommodate Mr. Trump's schedule as he dashed between campaign rallies and court hearings.",
      "Curran wouldn't talk about the failures at Butler, or what happened in the minutes after the shooting. But he suggested that too many leaders have lost touch with officers and agents out in the field.",
      "\"Good ideas, big ideas, have been hampered by people with probably less experience,\" Curran said, adding that leaders in a higher position don't always understand the reality of teams in the field. \"I understand what people on the ground need.\"",
      "One recent change within the agency's ranks has been to embed a team of six lawyers within Secret Service field operations \u2014 not for oversight of the officers, but for support in dealing with protesters or other circumstances.",
      "At a time when DOGE is cutting agencies it considers bloated, Curran is seeking a larger congressional appropriation. He said it is unclear whether Elon Musk will try to cut staff from the Secret Service. So far, there's no indication of that.",
      "Curran disagrees with a goal set by former director Kimberly Cheatle to make the Secret Service a 30% female workforce by 2030 \u2013 part of a nationwide campaign to diversify the ranks of law enforcement. \"When you highlight a specific group or person, you are not going to get the best qualified candidates,\" he said, echoing Mr. Trump's move away from diversity, equity and inclusion or \"DEI\" initiatives. \"My only goal is to put the right people on the field and get the best qualified applicants for this job, no matter what the position is and no matter what they look like.\"",
      "Richard Giuditta, a New Jersey lawyer brought in by Curran as a legal adviser, said one of Curran's first actions, within hours of being appointed director, was to go to the uniformed division's midnight-shift roll call at the White House. \"Quietly, by himself,\" Giuditta said.",
      "In a break with agency precedent, Giuditta is the first political appointee to serve as senior adviser to the Secret Service.",
      "Not everyone inside the agency is certain Curran is the right guy for the job \u2014 field agents aren't typically chosen to lead the Secret Service and its more than 8,000-member workforce.",
      "\"I think overall, people see who I am,\" Curran said. \"They see that I'm out there. They see that I just had a vest on a month ago, and I'm now up here. If you look around historically, that is not what you've seen up here. I've taken a different path. People know that. People are probably scared of that, because I'm the unknown.\"",
      "Curran, who has been at Mr. Trump's side on the golf course, on and off planes, in and out of meetings, recognizes that his relationship with Mr. Trump may be fodder for critics.",
      "\"He has always shown respect to not only me, but the division that protected him,\" Curran said. \"We have a bond, probably for life.\"",
      "Any president chafes at restrictions on their freedom of movement, although Curran declined to name any specific incidents. \"If I could broadly speak on this, he and I have had a lot of those tough conversations,\" he said. \"He was always very respectful of my opinion and what we needed to do, and he never once pushed back.\"",
      "The moment in Butler, Pennsylvania \u2014 and the photos \u2014 made Curran a public figure overnight. His face is now plastered on book covers, billboards, t-shirts, tattoos.",
      "Curran would prefer to not be recognized. \"I'm a private guy,\" he said. \"This position by nature \u2014 our role is to kind of be in the shadows. We are not to be part of the picture. Pun intended, I guess.\"",
      "Last week, Curran got a phone call from a former Secret Service agent who, perhaps more than anyone, understood that unwanted spotlight. Clint Hill, 93, was best known for leaping onto the back of President John F. Kennedy's limousine after the president was shot. Hill died on Friday, just one day after reaching out to Curran.",
      "\"I guess he feels like we had a connection,\" Curran said. \"So he wanted to talk to me. That was that.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared poised to side with an Ohio woman in her bid to revive a lawsuit alleging \"reverse discrimination\" after she said she was denied a promotion and demoted because she is straight.",
      "The case, known as Ames v. Ohio Dept. of Youth Services, centers on what a plaintiff alleging a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act must show to make an initial case of employment discrimination.",
      "Marlean Ames, the woman who brought the case, argues that a \"background circumstances\" requirement adopted by some lower courts unfairly imposes a higher burden on her as a heterosexual woman. The standard requires plaintiffs who are members of a majority group to put forth more evidence than those in a minority group in order for their case to proceed.",
      "Ames seems likely to prevail in her effort to have her case restored, with most \u2014 if not all \u2014 of the justices appearing to agree with her argument that federal employment law does not require her to meet a higher bar just because she is a member of a majority group as a heterosexual woman. The Supreme Court could send the case back to the lower courts for additional proceedings.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett said that regardless of whether Ames is gay or straight, \"she would have the exact same burden\" and be treated the same under Title VII. Justice Brett Kavanaugh told Xiao Wang, who argued on behalf of Ames, that they want the court to write an opinion that says \"the rules are the same.\"",
      "The questions posed by the justices to Gaiser prompted acknowledgement that there is agreement among all parties \u2014 lawyers for Ames, the Justice Department and the Ohio Department of Youth Services, Ames' employer \u2014 that all plaintiffs should be treated the same, regardless of whether they are in a majority group or minority group.",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, is reviewing the case as President Trump has taken sweeping actions to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs and policies throughout the federal government and fired workers overseeing the initiatives.",
      "In the private sector, large companies like McDonald's, Ford and Walmart have walked back their DEI initiatives in recent months in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2023 decision ending affirmative action in college admissions. That landmark ruling prompted more lawsuits from conservative groups targeting diversity initiatives at corporations.",

      "Ames started working at the Ohio Department of Youth Services, the state's juvenile corrections system, in 2004 as an executive secretary and became a program administrator in 2014. During her time in that role, she received positive performance reviews, according to court filings.",
      "Ames applied for a promotion to bureau chief of quality assurance and improvement in 2019, but didn't get the job. Her supervisor, Ginine Trim, who is gay, said Ames and two others who applied failed to lay out their vision for the role, according to court filings from Ames' legal team.",
      "The position remained unfilled for months and eventually was offered to a gay woman who had been with the department for less time than Ames, her lawyers said in court papers. The woman didn't interview or apply for the job, and was less qualified than Ames, according to the attorneys.",
      "After Ames was denied the promotion, she was removed from her position as program administrator and told she could either return to her job as executive secretary or be fired. Accepting the demotion, though, would mean a significant pay cut \u2014 from $47.22 an hour to $28.40, according to court filings.",
      "Still, Ames chose to go back to her role as executive secretary and was replaced as program administrator by a gay man, her lawyers said.",
      "Ames sued the Department of Youth Services and alleged violations of Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, religion, national origin and sex, which includes sexual orientation. Ames argued the department discriminated against her on the basis of sexual orientation.",
      "A federal district court ruled for the Ohio Department of Youth Services, finding that the department offered \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons\" for passing Ames over for the promotion. The court also concluded that she failed to satisfy the \"background circumstances\" requirement.",
      "Imposed by some courts, the standard requires a plaintiff who is a member of a majority group to show \"background circumstances\" that \"support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority,\" or engages in reverse discrimination.",
      "Plaintiffs can make that showing by presenting evidence that a member of the relevant minority group \u2014 gay people, in Ames' case \u2014 made the employment decision at issue, or by presenting statistical evidence demonstrating a pattern of discrimination by the employer against members of a majority group.",
      "Ames asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit to review the district court's decision. The appeals court also found that she failed to satisfy the \"background circumstances\" requirement and threw out her case.",
      "The three-judge panel first said that the decisions about Ames' positions were made by the department's director and assistant director, who are heterosexual. The 6th Circuit also found that Ames' only evidence of a pattern of discrimination was her own experience.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed in October to take up Ames' case. In filings, her lawyers argued that the \"background circumstances\" test infringes on the text of Title VII, Supreme Court precedent and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's own practices.",
      "During arguments before the high court, Wang said he and his client are asking for \"equal justice under the law.\"",
      "But lawyers for the Ohio Department of Youth Services reiterated in a filing that the officials who made decisions about Ames' employment are straight and provided a nondiscriminatory reason for replacing her as program administrator: concerns about her vision for the department.",
      "None of the decision-makers knew Ames' sexual orientation when she was denied the promotion and demoted, Gaiser told the justices.",
      "Additionally, the state wrote in filings that the background circumstances rule is just another way of determining whether the circumstances surrounding an employment decision suggest that decision was because of a protected characteristic.",
      "Ohio officials said the background circumstances standard protects against \"meritless\" Title VII claims, which can \"impose ruinous costs, especially on smaller businesses, that ultimately reduce employment, incent automation, and inflate prices for consumers \u2014 or consume Ohioans' tax dollars.\"",
      "Barrett questioned whether a decision in favor of Ames would \"throw the door open\" to more suits. Wang noted that only half the federal appeals courts apply the background circumstances rule.",
      "During the arguments, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the circumstances surrounding the employment decisions about Ames, such as her years working at the Department of Youth Services and positive performance reviews, suggest \"there's something suspicious\" about her getting passed over for the promotion. That could give rise to an inference of discrimination, she said.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, meanwhile, said that the argument pressed by the Ohio Department of Youth Services indicates that a plaintiff who is a member of a majority group has to put forth all of their evidence at an initial stage in the proceedings.",
      "In a friend-of-the-court brief filed in December, the Biden administration argued the 6th Circuit was wrong to apply a heightened requirement that it said would foreclose some claims that would satisfy Title VII's standard for liability. The previous administration urged the Supreme Court to toss out the lower court's decision and send the case back for more proceedings.",
      "The Trump administration also urged the justices to toss out the 6th Circuit's ruling. Ashley Robertson, assistant to the solicitor general, told the court that Title VII \"draws no distinction\" based on whether an employee alleging discrimination is a member of a majority or minority group.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 11:15:12 -0500",
    "summary": "The bill's adoption appeared in doubt leading up to the final vote.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House adopted a budget proposal on Tuesday that paves the way for implementing President Trump's legislative agenda, handing a major victory to House Speaker Mike Johnson who had been trying to sway a small number of holdouts in the final hours before the vote.",
      "Republicans narrowly adopted the resolution in a 217-215 vote with no Democratic support and only one GOP defection \u2014 Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky. With one Democrat absent, Johnson could afford to lose just one GOP vote. Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio, Victoria Spartz of Indiana and Tim Burchett of Tennessee, who had said they would not vote for the resolution, ultimately caved.",
      "\"We got it done,\" Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after the resolution's adoption. \"We have a lot of hard work ahead of us. We are going to deliver the American first agenda. We're going to deliver all of it, not just parts of it, and this is the first step in that process.\"",
      "House GOP leadership stalled bringing up the resolution for more than an hour then appeared to pull the vote, before bringing the bill back up minutes later. The House Democratic Whip's Office said Republicans had assured Democrats there would be no further votes before it was brought back up.",
      "Johnson worked the phones with Mr. Trump to persuade holdouts to vote for the package that would enact Mr. Trump's massive defense, border security, energy and tax agenda. At one point before the vote, the House leader huddled in the back of the chamber with Spartz, Burchett and Massie, before leaving the floor with Spartz, who had had a phone to her ear.",
      "The president was a \"big help,\" Johnson said. He added that he didn't make any commitments to holdouts to get them to flip to yes, saying \"we just got everybody to yes.\"",
      "Johnson has been racing to move forward with the resolution, a crucial step in the budget reconciliation process, after House Republican infighting spurred the Senate to forge ahead with a competing plan earlier this month. Johnson won a key victory last week when Mr. Trump endorsed his chamber's budget outline.",
      "The House GOP budget plan instructs committees to craft legislation that would cut $4.5 trillion in taxes and at least $1.5 trillion in spending, while raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. If House committees don't achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts, then tax cuts would be scaled back, according to an amendment to the resolution that was added to appease conservatives.",
      "House Democrats widely oppose the measure, and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, wrote a letter to his caucus on Monday telling them \"it's imperative that we are present with maximum attendance.\"",
      "Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado, who gave birth a month ago in her home state, flew to Washington with her newborn son to vote against the resolution. Rep. Kevin Mullin of California, who has been battling a blood clot and infection after recent knee surgery, also made the vote.",
      "\"We had Kevin Mullin literally leave a hospital bed in California, travel here with an IV on the airplane, because he knows how important this vote is,\" said Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the minority whip.",
      "\"Brittany Pettersen is on maternity leave, but she understood on behalf of her constituents and the American people how important it was to be there,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, was the sole absence. The Arizona Democrat has been battling cancer.",
      "Democrats have warned of potential cuts to Medicaid, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits that could be pursued in the budget reconciliation process. The resolution tasks relevant committees with finding billions of dollars in cuts, some of which could target Medicaid, which has prompted concern among some Republicans, especially in battleground districts.",
      "\"This is the very beginning of the process, and they struggled until the very end, Democrats were unified, and we will remain unified throughout this process, because this reckless Republican budget will bring nothing but destruction to the American people,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York was among the Republicans worried about Medicaid cuts, but she met with Johnson on Monday and said he assured her that Medicaid recipients would not be removed from the rolls \"unless they are not fulfilling the work requirements, and they're not citizens.\"",
      "House Republican leadership pushed back on the Medicaid concerns on Tuesday, calling it a Democratic talking point. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota said the budget resolution \"merely unlocks the opportunity for committees to begin drafting legislation,\" calling it a \"blueprint to save America.\" And House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution, noting that the vote is simply one to begin the reconciliation process.",
      "Still, Johnson wouldn't commit to preserving Medicaid in its entirety as the reconciliation process continues, and the budget resolution instructs the committee overseeing Medicaid to find $800 billion in cuts. Johnson said cuts to the program would target \"fraud.\"",
      "\"Medicaid is hugely problematic because it has a lot of fraud, waste and abuse,\" Johnson said, when asked whether there could be cuts to the program down the line. \"What we're talking about is rooting out the fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "The House vote came after the Senate adopted its budget late last week, while the House was away on recess. Since Mr. Trump's endorsement of the House resolution, Senate Republicans have billed their own budget plan as a backup. The Senate plan would divide the reconciliation process into two bills, with the first aimed at quickly delivering resources for border security and defense, while a later bill would tackle the tax priorities. Senate Republicans also want to make the tax cuts permanent, which the House version does not do.",

      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans narrowly adopted a budget proposal late Tuesday that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda, a dramatic turn of events after a group of holdouts threatened the razor-thin Republican majority's plan.",
      "In a 217-215 vote, the House adopted the resolution, with just one Republican joining all Democrats to oppose it. The resolution now goes to the Senate, which has been pursuing its own budget proposal.",
      "But the two chambers must adopt the same budget plan to move forward with the budget reconciliation process \u2014 a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate.",
      "Here's what to know about the budget resolution:",
      "What's in the House GOP budget plan?",
      "The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview. Republicans want to cut trillions of dollars in spending to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas.",
      "Though Senate Republicans have pushed for two bills to address Mr. Trump's priorities, House Republicans are pursuing one major bill to address border security, defense and energy priorities, along with $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "Their plan calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over a 10-year period and instructs a number of committees to find ways to reduce their budget impact, while increasing spending for several other issue areas. The House Ways and Means Committee is tasked with implementing the $4.5 trillion in tax cuts over a decade. The resolution would also raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",

      "At least $1 billion by the Financial Services Committee",
      "At least $1 billion by the Natural Resources Committee",
      "The final product must be deficit-neutral to comply with reconciliation rules, and Republicans are relying on economic projections that show the tax cuts would spur economic growth that would increase tax revenues. Those projections have been questioned by outside experts and Democrats who describe them as overly optimistic. One analysis found that the budget proposal would allow for a deficit increase of $2.8 trillion through 2034.",
      "Opposition to the proposed cuts",
      "Opponents of the resolution have pointed to the proposed cuts, arguing that they implicate key programs that Americans rely on. Medicaid in particular has come under the microscope \u2014 the Energy and Commerce Committee oversees Medicaid, and the $880 billion it is tasked with saving would almost certainly require cuts to the entitlement program.",
      "House Republican leadership has stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution, noting that Tuesday's vote was one simply to begin the reconciliation process. But House Speaker Mike wouldn't commit to preserving Medicaid in its entirety as the reconciliation process continues. Johnson said cuts to the program would target \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program. Other Republicans have said that benefits would not be cut.",
      "Under an amendment to the House budget resolution aimed at placating conservatives, House committees must achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts in order to secure the proposed $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. But if they slash more than $2 trillion, tax cuts would be increased.",
      "The budget reconciliation process",
      "The budget reconciliation process is a tool used sparingly to work around the 60-vote threshold needed to pass most legislation in the Senate, allowing the party in the majority to approve legislation without support from the minority. But the maneuver is a complicated one, requiring lawmakers to first approve a budget resolution before directing committees to craft bills reconciling spending with the new budget goals.",
      "The final product of the reconciliation process can only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit, and any new spending must be paid for. The Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package, confirming that the provisions have direct budgetary consequences, if an item is challenged.",
      "Democrats in the majority approved two major packages under budget reconciliation during the Biden administration \u2014 a pandemic aid package and the Inflation Reduction Act. In 2017, Republicans in the majority approved tax cuts under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the first Trump administration. Also during Mr. Trump's first term, Republicans tried and failed to use the reconciliation process to repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A White House official said Tuesday that Amy Gleason is the acting administrator of the Department of Government Efficiency, after the White House struggled to answer who is technically at the top of the organizational chart.",
      "Gleason declined to comment on her appointment as acting DOGE administrator. Gleason's LinkedIn lists her as a U.S. Digital Services senior adviser, and she has a background in consulting and the medical field.",
      "When CBS News spoke to Gleason on Tuesday morning ahead of her announcement as DOGE acting administrator, she said she was in Mexico and declined to comment further.",
      "Gleason's role as acting administrator came as a surprise to USDS employees who, like Gleason, were folded into DOGE, CBS News learned Tuesday evening. Those employees learned of her new position \"in the past few hours\" even though they had been asking for weeks who was going to fill the job, CBS News was told.",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed that Gleason had been in the job for \"quite some time, at least several weeks, maybe a month.\" When asked why DOGE employees only learned of her role yesterday, Leavitt said \"you would have to ask them\" and \"they're clearly unaware, I don't know.\"",
      "In various court cases concerning DOGE's activities, Justice Department lawyers have been asked multiple times to identify who is leading DOGE, including just last week. The government lawyers have said they did not know.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, 21 staff members of DOGE who were part of USDS prior to Musk's arrival said in a letter sent to the White House that they were resigning.",
      "Last week, the White House said in a court filing that Elon Musk isn't an employee of DOGE, and \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,\" after President Trump previously announced Musk would run the cost-cutting project. The White House hasn't had a clear answer since who is in charge of DOGE.",
      "During Tuesday's White House briefing, Leavitt said she wouldn't provide the name of the acting administrator from the podium, but would follow up.",
      "\"President tasked Elon Musk to oversee the DOGE effort,\" Leavitt said. \"There are career officials and there are political appointees who are helping run DOGE on a day-to-day basis. There are also individuals who have onboarded as political appointees at every agency across the board to work alongside President Trump's cabinet to find and identify waste fraud and abuse, and they are working on that effort every day.\"",
      "Musk, a special government employee, will attend Mr. Trump's first Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Leavitt confirmed earlier this week.",
      "Over the weekend, federal workers received an email instructing them to list five things they accomplished in the week prior, and Musk said those who didn't reply would lose their jobs.

      "For the second time in two weeks, DOGE's \"receipts\" don't match its claims.",
      "On Monday, the Department of Government Efficiency released another round of so-called \"receipts\" \u2014 or canceled contracts to show its cost cutting \u2014 and posted them on its \"wall of receipts.\" As was the case with the first round, this set, too, contained inaccuracies.",
      "Despite doubling the number of listed contracts, the updated itemized savings now total $9.6 billion, a sharp drop from the original $16.6 billion in savings DOGE itemized last week. At the same time, DOGE is now claiming total savings of $65 billion \u2014 far higher than the amount itemized, and an increase from its earlier claim of $55 billion, much of which has previously been called into question.",
      "$65 billion is approximately 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget of $6.75 trillion.",
      "DOGE's website claims this higher figure includes savings from contract and lease terminations, renegotiations, grant cancellations, layoffs and other miscellaneous reductions, but DOGE has not supplied documentation for the vast majority of the savings it claims.",
      "In addition, $144.6 million is attributed to real estate savings, but DOGE has provided no supporting details beyond the dollar figure, agency and city, making independent verification difficult.",
      "DOGE has not explained why it reduced the itemized total, but this is likely due to errors in the original reporting \u2014 many of which were first identified by news organizations including CBS News.",
      "Initially, DOGE listed 1,127 receipts. That number has now grown to 2,299, though 34% of them report zero savings. The newly added receipts also contain apparent errors and instances of double, triple and even quadruple counting.",
      "Many of the contracts included in the \"wall of receipts\" were unlikely to reach the amount of savings that DOGE is claiming. According to Michael LeJeune, a private consultant with an expertise in government contracts, many of these are specific types of agreements with \"unfunded requirements and they rarely get used\" to the full amount. He also says it appears that some of these unfunded or partly-funded contracts are being counted multiple times.",
      "For example, there is a quadruple listing for a contract for DEI training and assessment services for the Department of Agriculture. The overall contract was $25 million, and four companies that provided these services drew funding from that single contract. DOGE, however, mistakenly listed each company as having a separate $25 million contract \u2014 wrongly claiming a total of $100 million in savings.",
      "Other listings also raise questions, including:",
      "Three separate items list savings of $15 million each, but each item references the same contract, a blanket purchase agreement, under different contractors. A blanket purchase agreement is a standard government agreement that is often used for simple repetitive purchases. In this case, the Environmental Protection Agency contract was for \"human resources consulting services.\" The Trump administration terminated the agreement on Jan. 25, referring to the contract as \"Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Enterprise Services Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).\" It is unclear how much of the contract's funding had already been spent.",

While the poorest of the poor, including hundreds of thousands of people trapped in war zones, are facing famine, soup kitchens have even sprung up on street corners in the center of cities like Omdurman, which is home to two million people.",
      "Well-heeled professionals have been lining up for food handouts. There has been a complete erosion of the middle class.",
      "CBS News met Mohammed Hamad in one of the lines. He's an electrical engineer and once had a lucrative business. But like so many others in Sudan, he's found that the raging civil war has meant there's no work, and no income.",
      "The country's economy has collapsed, and Hamad said he cannot provide for his family.",
      "\"We rely on God and aid,\" he told us.",
      "Right now, it's being left largely up to God.",
      "The soup kitchen provides one small meal per day for Hamad and his wife and four children. His reliance on charity is a source of deep pain for him.",
      "\"It breaks my heart. I can't provide food or even medicine if they are sick. Sometimes we make our own medicine from ingredients we have at home,\" he said.",
      "Hamad's wife had a lung infection when we met, and he said he couldn't even afford transportation to get her to a hospital.",
      "Many of the soup kitchens dotted across Sudan's urban areas have been funded by the U.S. Nearly 80% of them shut down quickly following President Trump's suspension of U.S. foreign aid.",
      "The soup kitchens also served the few hospitals still standing in Omdurman, including Al Noa, which is the largest hospital in Omdurman that has continued functioning during the war. It's about 12 miles from the front lines in the capital Khartoum.",
      "The facility has no funds to provide meals itself. When we visited the hospital, a soup kitchen run by the Emergency Response Room charity was busy serving patients some rice and lentils. It was the only food they would eat that day.",
      "The hospital is overwhelmed and under-resourced. It's been hit by rockets several times during the nearly two-year war. Makeshift tents have been set up outside to cope with the overflow. CBS News saw patients being treated on the floor because of a lack of beds.",
      "In the midst of it all, medical staff under the leadership of Dr. Jamal Mohammad have been struggling to save the lives of those left wounded and starving by the war.",
      "Despite the financial support from the U.S. and other donors, they were already running out of everything from painkillers and bandages to life-saving equipment before Mr. Trump put the brakes on all U.S. foreign aid.",
      "\"I don't know what's behind that decision of President Trump, but I think it's going to increase and deepen the suffering of our people,\" he told us. \"We are the forgotten war.\"",
      "Former U.S. Ambassador to the African Union Jesseye Lapenn told CBS News that, in many ways, U.S. support in countries like Sudan, which has long come primarily through USAID, has been \"the face of American values. It is the ground game of our foreign policy.\"",

      "\"What we're seeing now is, I fear, going to mean a lack of respect for the United States, an undermining of U.S. interests, and certainly real negative impacts on the ground for African partners,\" she said.",
      "Lapenn argued that there had been a misrepresentation of USAID's work by officials in Washington.",
      "\"I think the debate now sort of frames USAID as if it was charity, and as if it was charity that we can't afford. And I don't think that's true on either point,\" she said. \"We know it's maybe 1% of the federal budget, so we can afford it. But at the same time, it wasn't charity. It was much more a strategic investment in U.S. relationships globally.\"",
      "Without partnerships with the U.S. some countries may have little choice but to turn elsewhere to try to fill the financial void. Some may have to resort to trading or selling off their natural resources to meet those needs.",

      "Cindy McCain, who heads the U.N.'s World Food Program, said over the weekend that the agency was working to provide support to some 25 million people facing hunger in Sudan, but warning that \"humanitarian services are at the brink.\"",
      "\"The global community must act now \u2014 lives depend on it,\" she said in a social media post, days after saying Sudan was \"now the epicenter of the world's largest and most severe hunger crisis ever.\"",
      "It's unclear who or what might help fill the gap left by the suspension of USAID's work, but certainly at the hospital CBS News visited, the Sudanese staff were determined to carry on as best they can.",
      "As we followed Mohammad, the head doctor at the Al Noa hospital, he stopped in one of the overcrowded wards to console 10-year-old Akram Atlan, whose leg had been shattered by shrapnel. He was playing with friends by a river when it happened. The little boy was tearful, terrified he would lose his leg and, with it, his dream of being a soccer player.",
      "But he was in good hands. Mohammad was a leading orthopedic surgeon before the war started. He lost everything when the conflict began - his home, his lucrative private practice in Khartoum, his car and his life savings. His family fled to safety in Egypt, but he stayed behind and, for nearly two years, has been running the hospital without any pay.\u00a0 He performs three to four operations on most days.",
      "As young Akram was prepped for surgery later in the day, Mohammad told us he never imagined he would be operating on the war wounded. His previous job was focused on healing broken bones and changing people's lives for the better, not grappling to keep them alive.",
      "But despite the limited resources, he still brings hope. He operated for over four hours on the little boy, repairing the broken bones and removing a large piece of shrapnel from his leg. The operation was a success, and Akram will once again be able to play soccer.",
      "\"It's my oath,\" said Mohammad when asked why he'd decided to stay behind in his war-torn nation, without his family, to keep the beleaguered hospital running. \"That's it. To save lives.\"",

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Tuesday that the White House press office will choose which outlets get to cover the president in close quarters, replacing the decision-making authority that has long rested with the 100-year-old White House Correspondents Association.",
      "This development followed the White House announcement last week that it was removing the Associated Press wire service from pool coverage and close access to the president. Soon after, the AP sued Leavitt and two other top White House officials in response.",
      "Leavitt said the five networks that make up the current daily television rotation \u2014 ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and NBC News \u2014 would continue to be a part of the pool, but yet-to-be-announced \"streaming\" services would be added to the rotation, which requires one network to provide video of an event for all the participants in the pool. Leavitt also said other new outlets would also be added to the print pool rotation.",
      "\"We want more outlets and new outlets to have a chance to take part in the press pool to cover this administration's unprecedented achievements up close, front and center,\" Leavitt said during Tuesday's White House press briefing. \"As you all know, for decades, a group of D.C.-based journalists, the White House Correspondents Association, has long dictated which journalists get to ask questions of the president of the United States in these most intimate spaces.

      "Leavitt did not disclose which new outlets the White House would add to the daily press pool rotation. The daily press pool, which is a rotation, covers the president's movements in the Oval Office and elsewhere on the grounds. It travels with him whenever he leaves the White House, whether that's across town to a federal agency or across the globe, at the expense of the news outlets. News organizations pay for seats aboard Air Force One and for other coverage-related costs. It's unclear when the new rotation will be implemented.",
      "Eugene Daniels, president of the White House Correspondents Association, said in a statement that the White House's decision \"tears at the independence of a free press in the United States.\"",
      "\"It suggests the government will choose the journalists who cover the president,\" Daniels said. \"In a free country, leaders must not be able to choose their own press corps.\"",
      "Daniels said the White House didn't give the WHCA board advance notice of its decision.",
      "\"For generations, the working journalists elected to lead the White House Correspondents' Association board have consistently expanded the WHCA's membership and its pool rotations to facilitate the inclusion of new and emerging outlets,\" Daniels added.",
      "The announcement comes four days after the AP sued Leavitt, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich over the White House's decision to restrict its access to the president. The White House restricted the AP's access after the news outlet's stylebook declined to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as \"The Gulf of America,\" a new name announced by President Trump by executive order. The WHCA filed an amicus brief in support of the AP.",
      "On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Trevor N. McFadden, who was appointed by President Trump, said the AP's circumstances were \"not the type of dire situation\" that requires emergency intervention, but he did order an expedited hearing to consider an injunction against the Trump administration. The case is still being litigated.",
      "\"Asking the president of the United States questions in limited spaces such as the Oval Office and Air Force One is a privilege that unfortunately has only been granted to a few,\" Leavitt said Tuesday. \"It is not a legal right for all.\"",

      "In their letter, the staffers noted that the day after Inauguration Day, they did 15-minute interviews with individuals wearing White House visitor badges.",
      "\"Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,\" the letter said. \"This process created significant security risks and was designed to intimidate government employees.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Loren Alikhan sided with a group of nonprofit organizations, saying that a freeze on federal assistance \"may be crossing a constitutional line.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday continued to block the Office of Management and Budget from freezing federal assistance, delivering another blow to the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to shrink federal spending.",
      "Judge Loren AliKhan from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\u00a0ruled in favor of a group of nonprofit organizations in finding that they are likely to succeed in their challenge to the pause on all federal grants, loans and other federal assistance programs. The judge found that the nonprofits proved that the \"funding freeze would be economically catastrophic \u2014 and in some circumstances, fatal \u2014 to their members\" and agreed to grant their request for a preliminary injunction while the case plays out.",
      "AliKhan had previously issued a temporary restraining order that prevented the Trump administration from freezing federal assistance while she considered the nonprofits' request for injunctive relief. The judge held a hearing on their motion last week.",
      "The nonprofit groups had argued that the Trump administration exceeded its authority by ordering the nationwide funding freeze and said it was threatening the federal aid based on their exercise of their First Amendment rights of speech and association. AliKhan agreed in her decision that the government \"may be crossing a constitutional line.\"",
      "\"The scope of power OMB seeks to claim is 'breathtaking,' and its ramifications are massive,\" wrote the judge, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden. \"Because there is no clear statutory hook for this broad assertion of power, plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of this claim.\"",
      "AliKhan said that the nonprofits showed a \"mountain of evidence\" that \"even the threat of a funding freeze was enough to send countless organizations into complete disarray.\"",
      "\"While turning off funding streams appears to have been alarmingly easy, turning them back on has proven much more difficult,\" she wrote.",
      "OMB issued its memo directing federal agencies to temporarily pause all activities related to federal financial assistance on Jan. 27. The directive swiftly prompted two lawsuits \u2014 one by the group of nonprofits, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C.; and the second from a group of Democratic-led states, brought in Rhode Island.",
      "But two days after the OMB issued its memo, it was rescinded. Shortly after the memo was walked back, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on social media that the new directive was not a rescission of the federal funding freeze, but solely an unwinding of OMB's Jan. 27 memo.",
      "While the government argued that the White House memo to pause grants and other assistance was rescinded and should not be considered broadly, \"agencies still implemented the original memorandum as written,\" AliKhan wrote in her decision, which resulted in funds for programs like the \"Head Start\" program and funds for small businesses being frozen.",
      "\"Defendants still cannot provide a reasonable explanation for why they needed to freeze all federal financial assistance in less than a day to 'safeguard valuable taxpayer resources,'\" AliKhan added.",
      "The White House budget office's pause on federal assistance is part of President Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal government. The president also took executive action to order a 90-pause on foreign assistance funding, also the subject of legal challenges, and has fired thousands of federal workers who were considered probationary. Another 75,000 government employees accepted an offer from the new administration to resign their positions but continue receiving full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The Trump administration has hit roadblocks in the courts, as dozens of lawsuits have been filed that challenge Mr. Trump's policies and initiatives aimed at shrinking the size of the federal government.",
      "In the Rhode Island case involving the funding freeze, brought by a group of 22 states and the District of Columbia, a federal judge found that the Trump administration had not complied with an earlier order requiring agencies to restore any paused or withheld federal funds. The states had argued that they continued to be denied access to assistance.",
      "The judge in that case, U.S. District Judge John McConnell, demanded the Trump administration reinstate any frozen funds and said the pause on federal assistance is likely unconstitutional.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to comply with a temporary order preventing it from pausing foreign assistance funding issued earlier this month, and gave the State Department until Wednesday night to pay all bills for work completed before Feb. 13.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali granted a motion to enforce his temporary restraining order from Feb. 13. It required the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, to restore foreign-assistance funds for contracts and other awards while proceedings continue in a case brought by a group of businesses, nonprofits and organizations that do foreign aid work.",
      "The contractors had argued that they have been cut off from federal dollars or forced to stop their work because of Mr. Trump's executive action \u2014 and a subsequent directive from Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 that froze foreign development aid for 90 days.",
      "Under Ali's ruling, the State Department and USAID must pay any invoices and drawdown requests owed before Feb. 13 by midnight Wednesday. Ali also ordered the government to turn over any internal directives from the State Department or USAID leadership telling employees to comply with the court's restraining order.",
      "At an emergency hearing Tuesday, a Justice Department lawyer was unable to provide specifics on what steps the Trump administration was taking to restore funding for foreign aid programs.",
      "\"Twelve days into the TRO, you can't give me any facts about funds being unfrozen under the TRO?\" Ali asked government attorneys, referencing the temporary restraining order.",
      "\"The government has done nothing to make these payments happen,\" an attorney for the plaintiffs later argued.",
      "The lawyer for the nonprofits and businesses said there have been \"zero directives\" from the agency with respect to the unfreezing of foreign assistance funds. He added that the government still has to make payments that are owed, even on contracts that have been canceled or suspended in the past few days.",
      "Pointing to the terms of Ali's order, which temporarily lifted the pause on foreign assistance funds, the companies' lawyer said the Trump administration has \"done absolutely nothing to give meaning to that provision.\"",
      "The nonprofit groups and companies asked Ali on Monday to order the \"immediate payment of all funds owed and due to plaintiffs and other USAID and State Department implementing partners.\" The contractors said that despite Ali's temporary restraining order, they were still owed \"millions of dollars on due and overdue invoices and reimbursement requests\" that had been paused, but then ordered to be restored.",
      "A declaration from Zan Northrip, an executive at the international development company DAI Global, said that since Feb. 13, it has not received any payments on $115 million in outstanding bills to USAID. More than $70 million of that is over 30 days late.",
      "The invoices are for work done before a cable Rubio sent on Jan. 24 that announced a 90-day pause on new spending for foreign assistance programs funded through the State Department and USAID, according to DAI Global. The company said it is providing \"up-front financing to the U.S. government of more than $150 million.\"",
      "Northrip wrote that while some stop-work orders have been lifted, none of the 28 project terminations that USAID previously put into effect has been rescinded. DAI Global has furloughed 124 U.S.-based employees as a result, according to the declaration.",
      "USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations in 2023, according to the Congressional Research Service, with a large portion of the funding awarded to U.S. organizations that grant funds to local partners worldwide.",
      "While Ali's order provides temporary relief to foreign aid programs and companies, the Trump administration's dismantling of USAID has continued.",
      "An estimated 4,200 USAID staffers were placed on administrative leave Sunday night after a federal judge last week denied a motion by unions representing USAID workers to pause the move.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered a new trial for Richard Glossip\u200b, an Oklahoma death row inmate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered a new trial for Richard Glossip, an Oklahoma death row inmate who was joined in his bid to have his conviction thrown out by the state's Republican attorney general.",
      "The high court ruled\u00a05-3 in favor of Glossip and reversed a decision of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals that upheld his conviction and death sentence. Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered the opinion for the court and was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in the court's consideration of the case.",
      "After first finding that the high court has jurisdiction to review the Oklahoma court's decision, Sotomayor wrote that the prosecution's failure to correct testimony of their key witness during the trial violated Glossip's right to due process, entitling him to a new trial.",
      "\"Turning to the merits, we conclude that the prosecution violated its constitutional obligation to correct false testimony,\" she wrote.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett agreed with the majority's finding as to the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, but said she would not order the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to set aside Glossip's conviction. Instead, she said would have sent the case back for more proceedings.",
      "In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the Supreme Court lacks the power to override the decisions of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals and the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, which declined to grant Glossip clemency in 2023.",
      "\"The court's decision distorts our jurisdiction, imagines a constitutional violation where none occurred, and abandons basic principles governing the disposition of state-court appeals,\" Thomas wrote in a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Samuel Alito.",
      "Gentner Drummond, Oklahoma's attorney general, said his office will review the decision and determine the appropriate course of action.",
      "\"Our justice system is greatly diminished when an individual is convicted without a fair trial, but today we can celebrate that a great injustice has been swept away,\" Drummond said in a statement. \"I am pleased the high court has validated my grave concerns with how this prosecution was handled, and I am thankful we now have a fresh opportunity to see that justice is done.\"",
      "He continued: \"I am grateful the justices understood the gravity of the situation. I have long maintained that I do not believe Mr. Glossip is innocent, but it is now an undeniable fact that he did not receive a fair trial.\"",
      "The Glossip case",
      "Glossip was convicted in the 1997 murder of the owner of the Oklahoma City motel where he worked and was sentenced to death more than two decades ago. Since then, he has seen nine execution dates come and go, and eaten his \"last meal\" three times.",
      "Glossip had also been before the Supreme Court once before, in 2015, when he unsuccessfully challenged Oklahoma's method of execution on Eighth Amendment grounds.",
      "In the latest challenge, his bid to toss out his conviction and grant him a new trial was backed by Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Drummond, because of errors committed during his earlier trial.",
      "A central issue in the court fight involved the testimony of Glossip's co-defendant, Justin Sneed, who claimed Glossip paid him $10,000 to kill Barry Van Treese, the motel owner.",
      "Sneed admitted to robbing and bludgeoning Van Treese and is serving a sentence of life in prison. Glossip, meanwhile, has said he was not involved in the murder and repeatedly maintained his innocence over his roughly 25 years on death row.",
      "Glossip's first conviction was overturned because of ineffective assistance of counsel. During his second trial, Sneed told prosecutors that he had never seen a psychiatrist, but was given lithium after he was arrested. But in 2022, the state found prosecutors' handwritten notes in a banker's box, which Drummond said called into question Sneed's credibility as a witness.",
      "Lawyers for Glossip and Drummond argued the notes showed that Sneed told prosecutors he was given lithium after seeing a jailhouse psychiatrist and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. But neither his diagnosis nor his treatment by the psychiatrist were disclosed to Glossip's defense team, which Drummond said indicated prosecutors elicited false testimony on the matter.",
      "Following the revelations, Oklahoma's attorney general disclosed the box's materials to Glossip and had an independent counsel review the case. That examination, conducted by former district attorney Rex Duncan, ended in April 2023 and concluded that Glossip was deprived of a fair trial.",
      "The state asked the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to toss out Glossip's conviction and sentence, arguing that the errors committed during the trial rendered both flaws. But the court denied relief and ordered the state to move forward with executing Glossip. A request for clemency to the Oklahoma Parole and Pardon Board, which Drummond supported, was also unsuccessful after it deadlocked 2-2.",
      "Glossip and Drummond then urged the Supreme Court to step in. The court in May 2023 agreed to pause his execution and months later agreed to hear his case. Gorsuch did not participate in the proceedings, likely because of earlier involvement when he was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which covers Oklahoma.",
      "Arguments in the case took place in early October at the start of the Supreme Court's new term. Many of the questions focused on the interpretation of prosecutors' notes, as well as how the jury's view of the case would have been impacted had they known Sneed was prescribed lithium by a psychiatrist after his arrest.",
      "Writing for the majority, Sotomayor said the jury's assessment of Sneed's credibility was determinative.",
      "\"Had the prosecution corrected Sneed on the stand, his credibility plainly would have suffered,\" she wrote. \"That correction would have revealed to the jury not just that Sneed was untrustworthy ... but also that Sneed was willing to lie to them under oath. Such a revelation would be significant in any case, and was especially so here where Sneed was already 'nobody's idea of a strong witness.'\"",
      "The court found that even though Sneed's bipolar disorder was irrelevant, \"his willingness to lie about it to the jury was not.\"",
      "But writing in dissent, Thomas accused the majority of \"having bent the law at every turn to grant relief\" to Glossip, and said the court had no authority to order a new trial.",
      "As to Sneed's credibility, Thomas wrote that \"there is no reason to think\" that disclosing his bipolar disorder would have affected the outcome of the trial.",
      "\"The court stretches the law at every turn to rule in [Glossip's] favor,\" Thomas wrote. \"At the threshold, it concocts federal jurisdiction by misreading the decision below. On the merits, it finds a due process violation based on patently immaterial testimony about a witness's medical condition. And, for the remedy, it orders a new trial in violation of black-letter law on this Court's power to review state-court judgments.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is apparently nearing a deal with Ukraine that could grant the U.S. access to mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees.",
    "story": [
      "Exactly three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and under pressure from President Trump, a senior Ukrainian official said negotiations over a deal that would give Washington access to Ukraine's vast mineral reserves were \"in the final stages.\"",
      "Ukraine's leaders have voiced hope that such an agreement might serve as the foundation of a long-term security guarantee for the country against any future Russian aggression, but the Trump administration has thus far remained non-committal, framing access to the resources as a way for Ukraine to pay the U.S. back for its support over the last three years.",
      "\"The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,\" Olga Stefanishka, Ukraine's Vice President for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said in a Monday\u00a0social media post, written in English. \"We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature. We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.\"",
      "Often called Europe's \"breadbasket\" thanks to its massive agriculture sector, Ukraine is also one of the continent's most resource-rich nations. Much of Ukraine's mineral reserves remain untapped, however, due to difficult access, old and undeveloped infrastructure and a lack of investment \u2014 all exacerbated by Russia's ongoing offensive military campaign, which initially started in 2014 with its invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.",
      "Zelenskyy says he'd give up presidency in exchange for peace, NATO membership",

      "Roughly 20% of Ukrainian land \u2014 a vast swath of the eastern Donbas region plus Crimea \u2014 is now under Russian control. The occupied territory includes a significant portion of Ukraine's mineral reserves, including highly sought-after rare earth elements used in defense, aerospace, technology and energy production.",
      "The ground beneath Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's total reserves of rare earth elements. The U.S., which covers about 12 times as much ground, is estimated to have only 1-2% of the world's rare earths, by comparison.",
      "According to the Institute for the Study of War, about half of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves lie in territory currently occupied by Russia.",
      "Ukraine also has one of Europe's biggest reserves of titanium. The strong, lightweight metal is a vital component in modern aircraft, missiles and countless other civilian and military hardware, from satellites to bicycles. Ukraine's reserves are largely found in the northwest and central regions of the country, which have remained firmly under Kyiv's control.",

I think we've made a lot of progress,\" Mr. Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House on Monday with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "\"I think this discussion (a potential mineral deal) is a very important one,\" said Macron. \"First, because it's important for the U.S. and it will be a good occasion for a first very important meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Second, I think it's \u2014 there is a lot of economic upside on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals as a way for the country to pay back Washington for the military assistance provided over the past three years.",
      "U.S. industry currently relies largely on China, which is the world's biggest source of rare earths and other minerals, for its raw materials. An increase in the supply of those materials from Ukraine could eventually mean a decrease in minerals purchased from China \u2014 and less concern from a national security standpoint.",
      "While the details of the deal said to be taking shape have not been shared, Zelenskyy earlier refused to sign an agreement that reportedly would have given the U.S. access to about $500 billion worth of his nation's mineral wealth \u2014 about half of its estimated future value.",

      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn't allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral.",
      "A bill sponsor and an organization opposed to fluoridating water said Utah's proposal would set a precedent in the U.S. \u2014 and it would come as new federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, which is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Kennedy said in\u00a0a post\u00a0on X in November that \"Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease.\"",
      "Dental experts largely disagree.",
      "Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0in\u00a0November there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years, showing that fluoride is both safe and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",
      "Utah's bill cleared its final hurdle in the legislature Friday and heads to Gov. Spencer Cox for his approval. A spokesperson for Cox didn't immediately respond to a question about whether he'd sign it.",
      "Already, some cities across the country have tossed fluoride from their water and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids' intellectual development.",
      "Utah ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data published in 2022 by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "Lawmakers who backed the bill, which was sponsored by state Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius and state Sen. Kirk Cullimore, said putting fluoride in the water is too expensive.",
      "\"I don't dispute that there can be positive benefits from fluoride, which is why the bill also includes a deregulation of the prescription,\" Gricius said in a text message to The Associated Press, referencing a fluoride pill. \"This isn't anti-fluoride legislation, it is pro-informed consent and individual choice.\"",
      "Fluoridation is the the most cost effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "\"I think the anti-fluoride people, they're latching onto Kennedy's opportunity with his beliefs and using that now as a way to kind of get in the door to stop water fluoridation,\" Koci said.",
      "She added that fluoridated public water is often the only form of preventive dental care for some people, and the impact may be most visible in low-income Utah residents.",
      "Fluoride strengthens the teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. And nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population drinks fluoridated water.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state's biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "In 2023, voters in Brigham City, north of Salt Lake City, struck down a measure that would have removed fluoride from its public water supplies. The proposal was defeated by more than a two-to-one margin.",

    "story": [
      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Thursday lowered the chances to about 0.28%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's peak probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",

      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 0.28%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

      "Seven planets are aligning in the night sky this week, creating a brief chance to see a \"planetary parade.\"",
      "Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus could all be visible with clear skies, but not all can be seen by the naked eye, according to Space.com and other sites that track celestial events.",
      "For the best chances, spectators should look at the sky as soon as the sun sets. That's when the planets will make a brief appearance.",
      "Which day is best will depend on the location. Tokyo started seeing the parade first, on Feb. 22, according to Star Walk, a sky-gazing app. New York will have the best view of the event on Feb. 25, Star Walk said. In other parts of the world, the phenomenon will be best visible in early March. Worldwide, the best day to see the alignment will be Feb. 28.",
      "How to watch the planetary parade",
      "Five planets are visible to the naked eye, according to NASA: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.",
      "Mars will appear reddish and high in the sky, near the Gemini constellation, Star Walk said. Jupiter will be a bit lower in the sky, near Taurus. Venus will appear as the brightest planet in the sky, near the Pisces constellation.",
      "Mercury will be in the constellation Aquarius, near the sun and just above the western horizon. Saturn will also be near the sun and low in the horizon, making it harder to spot, Star Walk said.",
      "To see Uranus and Neptune, you'll need a telescope, NASA said. Uranus will appear in the Aries constellation, and Neptune will be in Pisces, Star Walk said.",
      "The display will only be visible for a few minutes after sunset, because the planets near the horizon \u2014 Saturn and Mercury \u2014 will be setting. Once they drop below the horizon, they will no longer be visible, but the other planets will linger in the night sky.",
      "For the best view, head to a location with minimal light pollution and a clear view of the horizon. Clear skies will also be necessary to see all the planets.",
      "How do planetary alignments work?",
      "The planets in the solar system orbit the sun, just as Earth does. Every planet orbits at a different speed and distance.",
      "During these alignments, the planets appear to be lined up from Earth's perspective, creating the visual display, NASA said. In reality, the planets are extremely far from each other.",
      "The planets also move very slowly, causing the multi-day timeline of the planetary parades.",
      "When will the next planetary alignment be?",
      "Lineups of four or five planets occur every few years, according to NASA. In late August 2025, four planets will be visible before sunrise, and in late October 2028, five planets will be visible at once before sunrise. Another five-planet alignment will occur in late February 2034, with the planets visible after sunset.",
      "\"In summary, while they aren't once-in-a-lifetime events, planetary parades afford an uncommon opportunity to look up and appreciate our place in our solar system, with diverse worlds arrayed across the sky before our very eyes,\" NASA says on its website.",
      "Outside of the planetary alignments, it's possible to spot other planets individually. Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are frequently seen in the night sky, according to NASA.",

      "\"We can calculate the energy ... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",

    "story": [
      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Thursday lowered the chances to about 0.28%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's peak probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",

      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 0.28%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

    "summary": "Apple credits its DEI program as helping make the iPhone maker the most valuable company in the world.",
    "story": [
      "Apple shareholders on Tuesday rejected a proposal to end the iPhone maker's diversity, equity and inclusion program.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, had called on Apple to follow other major companies in backing off from DEI, which has come under fire from Republicans and from President Donald Trump.",
      "\"DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\" according to the\u00a0proposal offered by the group. It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",
      "In responding to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple defended its diversity program as an integral part of its corporate culture, crediting the policies in part for making the technology giant the most valuable company in the world.",
      "\"We've never had quotas or targets for Apple. Our strength has always come from hiring the very best people and then providing a culture of collaboration,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a question-and-answer period at the meeting, while conceding the company may need to revise aspects of its diversity policies \"as the legal landscape\" around DEI evolves.",
      "\"But our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone, and our work to that end, will never waver,\" he said.",
      "Apple disclosed in 2022 that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees; early two-thirds of its employees were men.",
      "Mr. Trump slammed the decision by Apple shareholders to reject the proposal to end the company's DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them. DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\" he wrote in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "DEI, aimed at promoting fairness in the workplace and opening career paths for people of color, women and other protected classes,\u00a0gained momentum\u00a0after the 2020 murder of George Floyd.",
      "But that trend has reversed of late, with Ford,\u00a0Google, McDonald's, Meta,\u00a0Target, Walmart and other large corporations scaling back their diversity initiatives under pressure from conservative activists emboldened by court rulings and by President Trump, who has banned DEI programs across the federal government.",
      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some companies' response to the current legal and political climate is a matter of rebranding, Glasgow said. Businesses may ditch the terms diversity, equity and inclusion, while substituting references to \"welcoming\" and \"belonging.\"",
      "\"[I]t's more about getting anti-DEI activists off their back,\" Glasgow said.",
      "Critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. By contrast, advocates of these policies say that supporting inclusivity doesn't inhibit companies from rewarding top-performing employees, while also helping organizations create a respectful workplace culture.",
      "Despite the pushback on diversity, roughly half of corporate leaders who were surveyed after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration said they weren't considering rolling back their DEI programs, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0of 350 C-suite executives from Littler, a law firm focused on labor and employment issues. Roughly 22% of executives are considering reducing or phasing out jobs focused on DEI, the survey found.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 15:42:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Cuts to the U.S. cybersecurity agency and FBI affected the federal workers tasked with stopping foreign interference in elections.",
    "story": [
      "Over the last month, the U.S. government has worked quickly to pause, disband and dismantle the U.S. effort to fight foreign meddling in elections, raising concern among federal lawmakers and election officials across the country who rely on the federal cybersecurity agency and its counterparts to warn them about attacks on election systems.",
      "First came a flurry of notices forcing out Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency personnel who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections \u2014 at least a dozen have been put on leave or fired over the past month. Then, on Attorney General Pam Bondi's first day in office on Feb. 5, she disbanded the FBI task force targeting foreign influence operations originating from places like Russia, China and Iran.",
      "The focus on election security has been turned toward the past, rather than the future. In an internal memo earlier this month, CISA's acting director announced an internal investigation to assess every position and program that touches election security \u2014 including election misinformation and disinformation \u2014 dating back to President Trump's first term in office, with findings to be delivered in a final report on March 6.",
      "The message, penned by Acting Director Bridget Bean and first reported by Wired, also revealed the defunding of a nationwide program to train state and local government officials and offer threat monitoring services through a center known as the \"Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center.\"",
      "\"It is necessary to rescope the agency's election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission,\" Bean wrote in the message, echoing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's assertion during her confirmation hearing that the agency had strayed \"far off mission.\"",
      "The memo landed in the mailboxes of CISA's roughly 3,400 personnel on Valentine's Day, hours before more than 130 probationary workers \u2013 roughly 4% of the nation's cyberdefense agency \u2014 were summarily fired with form-letter terminations.",
      "Top Democrats on the Senate and House committees overseeing election legislation expressed \"grave concern\" over the changes in a letter to CISA's top leaders, noting the agency's \"establishing legislation clearly directs it to work on elections.\"",
      "\"We're here because in 2016 a foreign government \u2014 Russia \u2014 tried to tamper with our stuff,\" Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon told CBS News. \"They tried to physically hack into election systems,\" he added, noting Minnesota was just one of 21 states targeted, setting into motion a January 2017 designation of elections as critical infrastructure.",
      "In a letter to President Trump, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes likened the cuts to shutting down the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ahead of hurricane season. \"This decision undermines Arizona's election security at a time when our enemies around the world are using online tools to push their agendas and ideologies into our very homes,\" he wrote.",
      "The moves come months after CISA and the FBI aided states responding to a slew of Election Day bomb threats and white powder mailings. Officials debunked phony Russian-linked videos\u00a0purporting to depict election workers destroying ballots during nationwide voting, and an FBI investigation outed a hack-and-leak operation that stole documents from Mr. Trump's campaign, leading to the indictment of three Iranian cyber operatives.",
      "CISA and the FBI possess a broader view of the threat landscape that election officials find to be helpful in sizing up the threats facing them. \"You know it would be difficult to comprehend 50 states doing this on their own,\" Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt told CBS News. \"Each state runs elections in accordance with federal and state law\u2026 but no state has a national or global perspective on the nature of threats and the capabilities of bad faith actors seeking to disrupt our electoral process.\"",
      "While state and local governments run elections nationwide, federal agencies like CISA and the FBI coordinate with election offices to help safeguard against rising cyber and physical threats, while uncovering foreign influence campaigns designed to sow division among Americans and uproot voter confidence.",
      "\"States can often see only the effects of the attacks \u2014 disinformation directed at them and their voters and threats, but they have no insight into where those attacks are coming from, and therefore, have a limited ability to respond,\" said David Becker, CBS News election law expert and political contributor. \"CISA, the FBI Foreign Influence Task Force, and others, have that 'birds-eye view' insight, both detecting the source of the attacks \u2014 domestic or foreign, nations or criminal actors \u2014 as well as how they all fit into the big picture.\"",
      "In a letter to the DHS secretary on Friday, nearly 40 chief election officials wrote to try to persuade Noem to maintain cybersecurity and physical security services provided to states. \"Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,\" leaders of the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote. \"CISA's prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that \"CISA needs to refocus on its mission\" and is \"undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and malinformation.\"",
      "But the cuts across CISA and the FBI targeted teams may not only affect their ability to identify false content online but could also affect safeguards protecting election infrastructure from being undermined, according to multiple current and former U.S. officials. The teams have rooted out covert operations from Russia, China and Iran in the last year alone. Among the cyber agency employees targeted are members of CISA's Election Security Resilience Team, the Cybersecurity Advisory Committee and Regional Election Security Advisors, multiple current and former federal and state officials told CBS News.",
      "The new administration has not yet nominated a new CISA director, with the agency's highest-ranking political appointee, Karen Evans, now serving as a senior adviser.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump\u00a0attempted to fire the chair of the Federal Election Commission, a move that coincides with the adjudication of campaign finance complaints from the 2024 election, including those against tech billionaire and presidential ally Elon Musk.",
      "Mr. Trump and some conservatives on Capitol Hill have accused CISA of policing speech by coordinating with social media companies to identify online misinformation and disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. They accused the agency of \"censorship,\" which CISA officials have repeatedly denied. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit over the government's work, but the blowback prompted CISA to curb those conversations with tech platforms in 2021, according to three former U.S. officials.",
      "\"That is not our role, that's not what we do,\" former CISA Director Jen Easterly told reporters last year, ahead of the 2024 election. \"We're looking to work with our partners on overall threats to election infrastructure.\"",
      "CISA's ongoing internal probe appears to follow a Jan. 20-related directive instructing the attorney general and agency leaders to investigate Biden administration activities that are \"inconsistent\" with Trump's vow to end \"online censorship.\"",
      "DHS and CISA did not immediately respond to CBS News' questions about who directed the audit and would not say whether the report would be publicly released. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about whether the attorney general would be consulted on the investigation.",
      "\"I'm concerned and alarmed at what looks like a retreat from the anti-disinformation mission,\" Simon said. \"If a foreign adversary is spinning up a false narrative about our election system that could impact physical security, all it takes is one person who believes this disinformation to act out in a violent or threatening, harassing or intimidating way. All it takes is one.\"",

    "story": [
      "Remi Bateman was born without her left forearm and hand but she doesn't let it slow her down.",
      "Now 9 years old, Bateman is busy riding her bike and scooter around her neighborhood in Utah \u2014 and she's got her sights set on doing even more daily tasks, like cutting her own food and doing her own hair.",
      "Remi has been using a silicone prosthesis, covered by her health insurance, since she was 6 months old. While the prosthetic is helpful, it's heavy and doesn't give her the ability to move fingers.",
      "\"Her current prosthetic is pretty stationary and doesn't do a lot,\" her mother, Jami, told \"CBS Mornings.\" The hand on Remi's prosthesis was molded into a plastic fist.",
      "A \"life changing\" mission",
      "Last year, Jami came across a social media post for\u00a0Open Bionics\u00a0and its 3D-printed multi-grip \"Hero Arm.\" Each finger has its own motor, making it possible to grip everyday items with precision. Within 48 hours, Jami and her husband, Josh, scheduled a video consultation with Open Bionics and drove to their clinic in Denver, Colorado for an initial fitting.",
      "\"It was life changing,\" Jami said. \"This bionic arm is like 95% of having a real hand.\"",
      "The Batemans hoped insurance would help pay for the Hero Arm but their provider denied coverage, saying it wasn't \"medically necessary,\" according to Jami. Without insurance, the bionic arm cost $24,000.",
      "\"I do understand that you can live just fine without [a hand], but imagine what you could do with two hands. I feel like the whole world is built around having two hands,\" Jami said.",
      "Like many Americans with medical needs not covered by insurance, the Batemans turned to crowdsourcing.",
      "On Dec. 10, 2024, Remi's fight for her Hero Arm made the local news. Within four days, the Batemans raised over $24,000. Andy Schoonover, CEO of\u00a0CrowdHealth, a subscriber-based crowdfunding platform for medical bills, also contacted the Batemans after seeing their plea for help online.",
      "\"He told me he would pay for Remi's hand in cash,\" said Jami.",
      "And that's where the story takes a turn.",
      "Paying it forward",

      "\"Help more kids,\" Remi enthusiastically replied. \"So people can actually have a life-changing arm like me.\"",
      "Across the country in Maryland, 9-year-old Tyraun \"Taj\" Johnson was also trying to raise money for a Hero Arm. He was born with a partial left hand. His family worked hand specialists at Johns Hopkins Medicine to look at surgery and different prosthesis options to give him some usage of his left hand. They were hopeful the Hero Arm could be the solution they were searching for.",
      "But like Remi, Taj's health insurance company denied the coverage of the Hero Arm. His family was devastated.",
      "\"You're telling me that a kid able to function with daily tasks \u2013 something as small as feeding themselves, getting dressed...You're telling me that that's not medically necessary?\" his mother, Kaitlin Skinner, asked.",
      "\"I would give Taj my left hand if I could,\" Kaitlin added.",
      "The family started lemonade stands to raise the money for the bionic arm. In four months, they had only made $1,500.",
      "Then they got a life-changing call from Remi's mom. The Bateman's offered to use the donations they received for Remi's arm for Taj's Hero Arm.",
      "Open Bionics helped connect the families. Samantha Payne, co-founder of Open Bionics, told CBS News clinicians spend a lot of time assisting families in appealing insurance denials.\u00a0 \"The technology is 20 years old and has been tested,\" added Payne.",
      "A dream come true",
      "Kaitlin was brought to tears by the Batemans' generous offer and thanked them for making Taj's dream come true.",
      "\"Taj got teary eyed when he saw a video of Remi holding a fork with the Hero Arm,\" Kaitlin said. One of the things Taj is most looking forward to is playing sports.",
      "Kaitlin recently drove to New York City with Taj to meet Daniel Green, upper limb prosthetist at Open Bionics, who will make the mold that will become Taj's Hero Arm. While in New York, Taj had a surprise visitor: Remi and her mom. They arrived at our invitation.",
      "A new friendship forged through the kindness of strangers. Remi and Taj plan to meet again during the summer.",
      "\"If we have a playdate with our [Hero] robot arms, we could be like Ironman,\" Remi said.",
      "Donations for Remi continued to pour in. So she's continued to pay it forward, using the fund to help two more 11 year olds fund their Hero Arms after insurance denied their claims.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 14:47:31 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump is floating the idea of a new \"gold card\" visa that would be sold to wealthy foreigners for $5 million.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday unveiled a new pathway to residency: a \"gold card\" aimed at wealthy foreigners willing to pay millions for the right to live in the U.S.",
      "That term is a play on the green card, more officially known as a permanent residency card, which allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the U.S. Green cards are most frequently awarded to foreigners who marry U.S. citizens or to those who receive one through their employer, with the latter process taking an average of three years to complete, according to the Cato Institute.",
      "The new program comes as the Trump administration moves to change the country's rules for who can legally live, work and gain citizenship in the U.S. That includes tightening restrictions on many types of immigration in the U.S. and pushing to\u00a0end birthright citizenship, the constitutionally protected right to citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.",
      "The U.S. already opens the door to wealthy non-U.S. citizens who want residency through what is known as an EB-5 visa. But that program, launched in 1990, has long been cited for potential\u00a0abuses, including one prominent case from almost a decade ago that involved owners of a Vermont ski resort embezzling millions from foreign investors who hoped to score visas through the program.",
      "Yet both the new gold card and the EB-5 program have a common goal: Attracting foreign capital by allowing rich non-citizens to ante up in exchange for a U.S. residency visa.",
      "\"It's going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card, they'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Here's what to know about the gold card plan.",
      "What is Trump's gold card?",
      "The gold card will offer a new route for rich non-U.S. citizens to gain a valid visa to live and work in the U.S., according to Mr. Trump, who spoke Tuesday about the new visa with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick from the Oval Office.",
      "The cost of each new visa will be $5 million, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges, plus,\" the president added.",
      "Green cards allow recipients to live permanently in the U.S. and work for whomever they choose. By comparison, some immigrants, such as those on H-1B visas, are locked into working for the employer that sponsored their visa.",
      "Green card holders can also travel in and out of the U.S. without restriction, and are able to start the process to become a U.S. citizen.",
      "When will the gold card be available?",
      "Lutnick said the gold cards would be available starting in about two weeks.",
      "Will the gold card replace the EB-5 visa?",
      "Yes, with Lutnick on Tuesday describing the EB-5 program as \"full of nonsense, make believe and fraud.\"",
      "\"So the President said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program,\" Lutnick said in joining Mr. Trump to outline the gold card program from the Oval Office. \"We're going to replace it with the Trump Gold Card, which is really a Green Card Gold.\"",
      "One major difference between the gold card and the EB-5 visa \u2014 the cost, with the latter requiring applicants to invest about $1 million in the U.S., typically by putting the money into a business. But the EB-5 visa also comes with a host of other requirements, such as documenting that the investment will create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers.",
      "How much money could the gold card raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump suggested that the the U.S. could \"sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that.\"",
      "At $5 million each, selling 1 million gold cards could raise $5 trillion, he said.",
      "\"And if you sell 10 million of the cards, that's a total of $50 trillion,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We have $35 trillion in debt. That'll be nice, so we'll see.\"",
      "Typically, the number of annual applicants for EB-5 visas is far lower than what Mr. Trump projects for the gold card. About 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.",
      "If roughly 8,000 people received gold cards each year, the U.S. would raise about $40 billion annually through the program.",
      "The U.S. is a top immigration destination for rich investors, according to Henley & Partners, a company that provides immigration advisory services. The group estimated\u00a0that the U.S. had the second-biggest net influx of millionaires in 2024, following the United Arab Emirates, at about 3,800 foreign millionaires moving stateside last year.",
      "Who could qualify for a gold card?",
      "Aside from having $5 million to pay the U.S. government, gold card applicants would also have to meet other criteria, Lutnick said.",
      "\"They'll have to go through vetting, of course, we're going to make sure they're wonderful world class global citizens,\" he said, without providing details.",
      "Asked by reporters if Russian oligarchs could qualify for the visa, Mr. Trump responded, \"Possibly.\"",
      "He added, \"Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people. It's possible. They're not as wealthy as they used to be. I think they could afford \u2014 I think they could afford $5 million.\"",
      "Do other nations offer gold cards?",
      "Yes, investor visas are common around the world. More than 100 countries offer \"golden visas\" to wealthy individuals, including the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy, according to Henley & Partners.",
      "Does the gold card need congressional approval?",
      "Congress determines qualifications for citizenship, but Mr. Trump said gold cards would not require congressional approval.",
      "\"We have it all worked out from the legal standpoint. It's totally legal to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication \u2014 it's a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump held his first Cabinet meeting at the White House on Wednesday and weighed in on a wide range of topics.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump publicly backed efforts by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to slash government spending and cut the federal workforce on Wednesday, with the president downplaying potential conflicts between Musk and members of his Cabinet.",
      "Mr. Trump opened his first Cabinet meeting shortly before noon at the White House, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seated beside him. For more than an hour, Mr. Trump weighed in a wide range of topics, fielding questions from reporters on Ukraine, Russia, Taiwan, the House Republicans' budget plan and more.",
      "But first, the president allowed Musk, who is not a member of the Cabinet, to address the group and discuss his work to cancel contracts and fire workers across the executive branch. Musk is not formally leading the DOGE task force, but has been tasked with overseeing its work by the president.",
      "\"They have a lot of respect for Elon and that he's doing this, and some disagree a little bit, but I will tell you for the most part I think everyone's not only happy, they're thrilled,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Over the weekend, Musk\u00a0sent an email to the entire federal workforce asking them to document five things they accomplished over the past week. On X, he said those who failed to respond would risk losing their jobs. The message sparked confusion from workers and multiple Senate-confirmed Cabinet members told their employees that they could ignore the demand, the first public sign of a split between Musk and other top officials.",
      "Musk said Wednesday that the email was meant to identify employees who may be getting paid without showing up to work, and that Mr. Trump signed off on sending the message. As of Tuesday, the White House said more than 1 million federal employees had responded. The president claimed that the assembled Cabinet members were \"very much behind\" the effort.",
      "\"And if they aren't, I want them to speak up,\" Mr. Trump said during the Cabinet meeting, adding that, \"in many cases, we haven't gotten responses.\"",
      "When a reporter asked Musk if he's heard of any Cabinet members who are unhappy with him, the president asked if those in the room had anything to say. None spoke up.",
      "Wearing a shirt that said \"tech support,\" Musk said DOGE's main goal is to help federal agencies address wasteful spending.",
      "\"DOGE is a support function for the president and for the agencies and departments, to help achieve those savings and to effectively find 15% in reduction in fraud and waste,\" Musk said. While he said that DOGE has tried to be transparent by posting all of its savings online, a CBS News analysis found many discrepancies in its so-called \"wall of receipts.\"",
      "Musk also admitted DOGE will make mistakes, revealing that it briefly canceled funding for Ebola prevention efforts distributed by the U.S. Agency for International Development before reinstating them. On Feb. 11, Musk made a similar claim that the administration had \"turned on funding for Ebola prevention and for HIV prevention,\" an apparent reference to waivers that the government approved, but the New York Times reported the next day that the aid remained frozen. On Feb. 13, a federal judge ordered the administration to reinstate foreign aid contracts and other assistance that had been paused.",
      "During the Cabinet meeting, a journalist asked Mr. Trump if it's his view of his executive authority that he has the power to call up any Cabinet official at the table and issues orders that the official is required to follow.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, they'll follow the orders, yes,\" the president said, adding, \"of course, no exceptions.\"",
      "Later in the meeting, Mr. Trump revealed that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, told him that he believes he can cut 65% of the EPA's workforce.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his plans to begin selling citizenship \"gold cards,\" which would allow foreigners to immigrate to the U.S. in exchange for $5 million, in about two weeks. Mr. Trump said prospective immigrants will be vetted, but he doesn't expect to restrict immigration from specific countries. The president suggested the $5 million payments would go toward paying down the national debt.",
      "On the foreign policy front, Mr. Trump said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is coming to the White House\u00a0on Friday to sign a critical minerals deal framework reached between the U.S. and Ukraine. The two countries reached an agreement on a framework for a broad economic deal that entails access to Ukraine's\u00a0mineral resources.",
      "Most, but not all, of Mr. Trump's top nominees have now been confirmed by the Senate. A full Senate vote has yet to be scheduled for Rep. Elise Stefanik, his pick to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, as House Republicans cannot afford to lose a vote given their razor-thin majority. Linda McMahon, Mr. Trump's pick to run the Department of Education, also has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Trump has pledged to overhaul that department.",
      "The president's nomination of Lori Chavez-DeRemer for secretary of labor is still in limbo, with no vote scheduled yet. And the Senate has yet to confirm Jamieson Greer as U.S. trade representative, although the Senate advanced his nomination this week, as the president imposes hefty new tariffs\u00a0on allies and adversaries alike.",

      "The night before he was found dead, Edenfield had gone out twice, sheriff's office cold case investigator Dan Bendig\u00a0said on \"Unfinished Business,\" a podcast run by the agency. First, he had gone out to dinner with his brother and sister, Bendig said. Before midnight, he left the complex again, then returned around 12:50 a.m. on Feb. 1.",
      "Edenfield briefly spoke to a security guard because he had forgotten his remote to enter the complex gate, Bendig said. Edenfield told the security guard that the driver of the car behind him was also with him. The security guard let both cars into the complex, but did not get a good look at the driver of the second car, Bendig said.",
      "Bendig said that neighbors started hearing \"violence in the house\" and \"calls for help\" within an hour of Edenfield returning home. Three neighbors told police they had heard \"some sort of disturbance.\" Around 2 in the morning, the security guard was conducting rounds at the complex. He saw a \"dark shadow\" near Edenfield's apartment, Bendig said, and realized it was a person, but did not get a good look at the person's face.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans narrowly adopted a budget proposal late Tuesday that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda, a dramatic turn of events after a group of holdouts threatened the razor-thin Republican majority's plan.",
      "In a 217-215 vote, the House adopted the resolution, with just one Republican joining all Democrats to oppose it. The resolution now goes to the Senate, which has been pursuing its own budget proposal.",
      "But the two chambers must adopt the same budget plan to move forward with the budget reconciliation process \u2014 a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate.",
      "Here's what to know about the budget resolution:",
      "What's in the House GOP budget plan?",
      "The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview. Republicans want to cut trillions of dollars in spending to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas.",
      "Though Senate Republicans have pushed for two bills to address Mr. Trump's priorities, House Republicans are pursuing one major bill to address border security, defense and energy priorities, along with $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "Their plan calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over a 10-year period and instructs a number of committees to find ways to reduce their budget impact, while increasing spending for several other issue areas. The House Ways and Means Committee is tasked with implementing the $4.5 trillion in tax cuts over a decade. The resolution would also raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",

      "The final product must be deficit-neutral to comply with reconciliation rules, and Republicans are relying on economic projections that show the tax cuts would spur economic growth that would increase tax revenues. Those projections have been questioned by outside experts and Democrats who describe them as overly optimistic. One analysis found that the budget proposal would allow for a deficit increase of $2.8 trillion through 2034.",
      "Opposition to the proposed cuts",
      "Opponents of the resolution have pointed to the proposed cuts, arguing that they implicate key programs that Americans rely on. Medicaid in particular has come under the microscope \u2014 the Energy and Commerce Committee oversees Medicaid, and the $880 billion it is tasked with saving would almost certainly require cuts to the entitlement program.",
      "House Republican leadership has stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution, noting that Tuesday's vote was one simply to begin the reconciliation process. But House Speaker Mike wouldn't commit to preserving Medicaid in its entirety as the reconciliation process continues. Johnson said cuts to the program would target \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program. Other Republicans have said that benefits would not be cut.",
      "Under an amendment to the House budget resolution aimed at placating conservatives, House committees must achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts in order to secure the proposed $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. But if they slash more than $2 trillion, tax cuts would be increased.",
      "The budget reconciliation process",
      "The budget reconciliation process is a tool used sparingly to work around the 60-vote threshold needed to pass most legislation in the Senate, allowing the party in the majority to approve legislation without support from the minority. But the maneuver is a complicated one, requiring lawmakers to first approve a budget resolution before directing committees to craft bills reconciling spending with the new budget goals.",
      "The final product of the reconciliation process can only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit, and any new spending must be paid for. The Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package, confirming that the provisions have direct budgetary consequences, if an item is challenged.",
      "Democrats in the majority approved two major packages under budget reconciliation during the Biden administration \u2014 a pandemic aid package and the Inflation Reduction Act. In 2017, Republicans in the majority approved tax cuts under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the first Trump administration. Also during Mr. Trump's first term, Republicans tried and failed to use the reconciliation process to repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act.",

The officials, who were familiar with the matter, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. One of them said that Kyiv hoped that signing the agreement would ensure the continued flow of U.S. military support that Ukraine urgently needs.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy is going to be coming on Friday, that is now confirmed,\" President Trump said Wednesday at the White House, at the start of his first full Cabinet meeting.

However, the official said the draft does not include a contentious Trump administration proposal to give the U.S. $500 billion worth of profits from Ukraine's mineral resources as compensation for its wartime assistance to Kyiv. Zelenskyy had rejected that proposal, saying he would not sign off on any deal that \"ten generations\" of Ukrainians would be stuck paying for.",
      "Instead, the U.S. and Ukraine would have joint ownership of a fund, and Ukraine would contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned resources, including minerals, oil, and gas to that fund. One official said the deal had better terms of investments and another one said that Kyiv had secured favorable amendments and viewed the outcome as \"positive.\"",
      "The deal does not, however, include security guarantees. One official said that this would be something the two presidents would discuss when they meet.",
      "\"The main thing for me was that we are not a debtor,\" Zelenskyy told journalists Wednesday, adding that it was \"too early to talk about money,\" as the final terms were still being hashed out.",
      "It remained unclear Wednesday what share of the joint fund the U.S. would own or control.",
      "Agreement after acrimony?",
      "The progress in negotiating the deal comes after Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy traded sharp rhetoric last week about their differences over the matter.",
      "Zelenskyy said he balked at signing off on a deal that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed during a visit to Kyiv earlier this month, and the Ukrainian leader objected again days later during a\u00a0meeting in Munich with Vice President JD Vance because the American proposal did not include security guarantees.",

In hard numbers, Tesla sold just under 9,950 vehicles in Europe in January. For the same month in 2024, the company sold just over 18,100 new vehicles.",

Most of those gains have since been lost, and Tesla's market cap has plunged below the $1 trillion mark. The stock, which as of early Wednesday traded for roughly $305 in the U.S., remains up 54% over the last 12 months, buoyed by the company's ambitious plans for self-driving cars and humanoid robots.",
      "In Germany, Tesla sales fell nearly 60% in January year-on-year as would-be buyers voted with their wallets \u2014 possibly angered by Musk's purported meddling in the country's federal elections last weekend, which saw the far-right AfD party he backed become the country's second most popular.",

      "Tesla sales in the U.S. have also been declining, falling 1% in 2024 compared to the prior year \u2014 the automaker's first annual sales decline in 12 years despite global EV sales rising 7.3%.

That said, we view this as containable brand issues for Tesla for now that are not a major cause for concern.\"",

      "The deadlock had threatened to collapse the ceasefire when the current six-week first phase of the deal expires on Saturday. But late Tuesday, Hamas said an agreement had been reached to resolve the dispute during meetings in Cairo.",
      "In a brief statement on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed that an agreement had been reached by the mediators, adding that \"our four fallen hostages will be returned tonight as part of Phase A, under an agreed procedure and without Hamas ceremonies.\"",
      "The breakthrough appeared to clear the way for the return of the bodies of four more dead hostages and hundreds of additional Israeli-held prisoners scheduled to be released under the ceasefire.",
      "The prisoners previously slated for release \"will be released simultaneously with the bodies of the Israeli prisoners who were agreed to be handed over,\" along with the release of a new set of Palestinian prisoners, Hamas said in a statement.",
      "So far Hamas has released living Israeli hostages and the bodies of dead captives in large public ceremonies during which the Israelis were paraded and forced to wave to large crowds. Israel, along with the Red Cross and U.N. officials, have said the ceremonies were humiliating to the hostages, and Israel last weekend delayed the scheduled prisoner release in protest.",
      "The latest agreement would complete both sides' obligations of the first phase of the ceasefire \u2014 during which Hamas is mean to return 33 hostages \u2014 including eight bodies \u2014 in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "It also could clear the way for a likely return visit to the region by the White House's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "He said at a Tuesday event in Washington for the American Jewish Committee that Israeli representatives were already on their way to engage in talks on the next phase of the ceasefire deal, and he repeated that he was also ready to head back to the region, according to the French news agency AFP.",
      "\"We're making a lot of progress. Israel is sending a team right now as we speak,\" Witkoff said, adding that talks could resume in Cairo or Doha, the capital of Qatar.",
      "Witkoff has said he wants the sides to move into negotiations on the second phase, during which all remaining hostages held by Hamas are to be released and an end to the war is to be negotiated. The phase-two talks were supposed to begin weeks ago but never did.",
      "The ceasefire, brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, ended 15 months of heavy fighting sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, which saw militants kill some 1,200 people in Israel and take 251 others as hostages.",
      "Israel's military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, displaced an estimated 90% of the enclave's population and decimated the territory's infrastructure and health system. The health mninistry does not differentiate between civilian and militant casualties, but it says over half the dead have been women and children.",

      "New Delhi\u00a0\u2014 Rescuers in India were still racing Wednesday to save eight workers four days after they were trapped underground by a collapse in a tunnel under construction in the southern state of Telangana. Rescue crews had not managed to established contact with the trapped men for more than 100 hours, and the efforts to reach the men have come up against a series of challenges.",
      "A portion of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal tunnel collapsed Saturday morning, causing water and mud to rush into the huge tunnel, which has a diameter of about 33 feet. Officials have said that about 50 workers were inside the tunnel when part of its ceiling caved in. Forty-three of them managed to escape, but eight were left trapped.",
      "There has been no confirmation on the condition of the trapped men as no contact has been made with them by rescuers. Personnel with several agencies, including the Indian Army and the National Disaster Response Force, have been involved in the rescue efforts.",
      "They have faced repeated setbacks due to loose soil and mud inside the tunnel.",
      "Work on the 27-mile-long tunnel, which would be one of the world's longest irrigation tunnels if it is completed, has been delayed several times since construction began in 2005.",
      "On Tuesday, the rescuers worked to clear a train track inside the tunnel so it can be used to transport equipment to pump water out from around the site of the collapse. A path was also being cleared to take earthmoving machines into the tunnel.",
      "\"As of now we are dewatering and going forward. But for the last 40 or 50 meters (yards) we are not able to go,\" B Santhosh, administrative head of the Nagarkurnool district, where the tunnel is being constructed, told India's PTI news agency.",
      "A team of \"rat miners\" who successfully rescued 41 workers\u00a0who were trapped in a Himalayan highway tunnel for 17 days in 2023 joined the rescue operations Monday.",
      "About 20 miles of the new tunnel has been excavated so far, with\u00a0about seven miles left to go, officials said Tuesday.",
      "On Monday, a state minister overseeing the rescue work told journalists near the site that the chances of the eight men being found alive were slim.",
      "\"To be honest, the chances of their survival are very, very, very, very remote,\" Jupally Krishna Rao, a senior official in the Telangana state administration, said Tuesday. \"I went up to the end, almost just 50 meters short [of the collapse site]\u2026 When we shouted their names, there was no response.\"",

But it provided no details of what the scan showed, suggesting the results weren't back yet. Doctors said he hadn't had any further respiratory crises, and that his prognosis remained guarded.",
      "\"In the morning, after receiving the Eucharist, he resumed work activities,\" the Vatican statement said.",

A consistory, which is a formal meeting of cardinals, to set the dates for the canonizations is a necessary ceremonial step in that saint-making process, but the announcement of it was also forward-looking, given his illness.",
      "No date was set for the meeting. But it was also at a banal consistory to set dates for canonizations on Feb. 11, 2013, that Pope Benedict XVI announced, in Latin, that he would resign because he couldn't keep up with the rigors of the papacy. Francis has said he, too, would consider resigning after Benedict \"opened the door\" and became the first pope in 600 years to retire.",
      "In addition to the audience with Parolin, the Vatican released Francis' message for Lent, the period leading up to Easter, in yet another forward-looking sign. In a subsequent bulletin, Francis named a handful of new bishops for Brazil, a new archbishop for Vancouver and modified the law for the Vatican City State to create a new hierarchy.",
      "Many if not all of these decisions were likely in the works for some time. But the Vatican has said that Francis has been doing some work in the hospital, including signing documents.",

      "After night fell, thousands of faithful gathered in a rain-soaked, chilly St. Peter's Square for the first of a nightly recitation of the Rosary. The prayer evoked the 2005 vigils when St. John Paul II was dying in the Apostolic Palace, but those on hand said they were praying for Francis' recovery.",
      "Standing on the same stage where Francis usually presides, the Vatican secretary of state said that ever since Francis had been hospitalized, a chorus of prayers for his recovery had swelled up from around the world.",
      "\"Starting this evening, we want to unite ourselves publicly to this prayer here, in his house,\" Parolin said, praying that Francis \"in this moment of illness and trial\" would recover quickly.",
      "The Argentine pope had part of one lung removed as a young man, and doctors have said his condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease.",
      "But in Monday's update, they said he hadn't had any more respiratory crises since Saturday and the flow and concentration of supplemental oxygen has been slightly reduced. The\u00a0slight kidney insufficiency detected Sunday wasn't causing alarm at the moment, doctors said, while saying his prognosis remained guarded.",
      "Still, the mood was mostly grim in the monumental square, with many of the roughly 4,000 assembled understanding they may be in Rome for Francis' final days. Crowds sat under umbrellas on folding chairs or stood by the vast colonnades as they reflected fondly on the pontiff's legacy.",
      "\"To see him suffer hurts,\" said Robert Pietro, a Romanian seminarian who stood at the prayer holding a small, fragrant candle in tribute. \"But we also pray in thanksgiving for what he has done for the Church.\"",
      "Roberto Allison, a priest from the Mexican state of Guadalajara, said members of his community had come together to show appreciation for \"all that we have learned from him.\"",
      "Stopping to deliver personal blessings to some at the end of the ceremony, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco said the crowd's diversity \u2014 many world languages could be heard spoken \u2014 was \"a big sign of comfort\" for the Catholic Church.",
      "A couple of Catholic tourists from Chicago, who arrived holding umbrellas well before the service started, said they prayed for the pope at daily Mass earlier at St. Peter's Basilica, and decided to come back. Like many, they found it \"hard to process\" they may be in Rome for Francis' final days.",
      "\"No one knows the day and time, but it's a historic moment nonetheless,\" said Edward Burjek.",
      "It felt the same for Hatzumi Villanueva of Peru. She was particularly fond of former pope St. John Paul II but said Francis, as the first Latin American pope, \"draws a bit closer.\"",
      "\"We came to pray for the pope, that he may recover soon, for the great mission he's sharing with his message of peace,\" said Villanueva, who praised his empathy for migrants.",
      "Francis' papacy has also emphasized the defense of the environment and partial openness to LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "Outside the Vatican, Romans, pilgrims and even non-Catholics said they were offering special prayers for the hospitalized pope.",
      "\"We are all sorry,\" said Raniero Mancinelli, who has tailored ceremonial clothing for Francis and the two previous popes in his shop just outside the Vatican's walls.",
      "Elisabetta Zumbo carried a 5-foot-long cross down a cordoned-off section of the street leading to St. Peter's as she prepared to lead a group of 34 pilgrims from the northern Italian city of Piacenza. With the rain pouring down, she pledged her group would pray intensely for the pope.",
      "\"There is a lot of emotion and a lot of sadness,\" Zumbo said.",
      "Nearby, a couple from London visiting St. Peter's with their son said that even though they're not Catholic, they felt close to the pontiff \"being there in his home\" in the monumental basilica.",

      "For the best chances, spectators should look at the sky as soon as the sun sets. That's when the planets will make a brief appearance.",
      "Which day is best will depend on the location. Tokyo started seeing the parade first, on Feb. 22, according to Star Walk, a sky-gazing app. New York will have the best view of the event on Feb. 25, Star Walk said. In other parts of the world, the phenomenon will be best visible in early March. Worldwide, the best day to see the alignment will be Feb. 28.",
      "How to watch the planetary parade",
      "Five planets are visible to the naked eye, according to NASA: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.",
      "Mars will appear reddish and high in the sky, near the Gemini constellation, Star Walk said. Jupiter will be a bit lower in the sky, near Taurus. Venus will appear as the brightest planet in the sky, near the Pisces constellation.",
      "Mercury will be in the constellation Aquarius, near the sun and just above the western horizon. Saturn will also be near the sun and low in the horizon, making it harder to spot, Star Walk said.",
      "To see Uranus and Neptune, you'll need a telescope, NASA said. Uranus will appear in the Aries constellation, and Neptune will be in Pisces, Star Walk said.",
      "The display will only be visible for a few minutes after sunset, because the planets near the horizon \u2014 Saturn and Mercury \u2014 will be setting. Once they drop below the horizon, they will no longer be visible, but the other planets will linger in the night sky.",
      "For the best view, head to a location with minimal light pollution and a clear view of the horizon. Clear skies will also be necessary to see all the planets.",
      "How do planetary alignments work?",
      "The planets in the solar system orbit the sun, just as Earth does. Every planet orbits at a different speed and distance.",

Another five-planet alignment will occur in late February 2034, with the planets visible after sunset.",

      "Israel's military operation in the occupied West Bank has now forced more than 40,000 Palestinians to flee their homes in the refugee camp towns of Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams, according to Israeli officials and the United Nations. It is the biggest displacement of civilians in the occupied West Bank since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.",
      "Over the weekend, Israel sent tanks into the northern West Bank town of Jenin for the first time in more than two decades.",
      "The Hamas-allied Islamic Jihad group, which like Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S., said Monday that the deployment of tanks after the forced displacements in the sprawling Palestinian refugee camps could be a step toward Israeli annexation of the entire West Bank.",
      "An AFP journalist in Jenin reported empty streets on Monday, except for a few Israeli Merkava tanks and displaced refugee camp residents occasionally entering through a back alley to retrieve belongings from their homes.",
      "\"We go back in to get things, whatever we can. We take the risk because we have to,\" 52-year-old Jenin resident Ahmad al-Qahrawi told AFP. \"We had nothing when we left, no clothes, nothing. We go back to get clothes because it's cold.\"",
      "Israel launched a major military operation in the north of the West Bank just a few days after a fragile\u00a0ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement took hold to end 15 months of war in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, the much smaller Palestinian territory in the southwest corner of Israel. The Israel Defense Forces has said troops looking for terrorist suspects have cleared the three refugee camps, and it confirmed that tanks were deployed to Jenin.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Sunday that troops would remain for many months in the evacuated refugee camps to \"prevent the return of residents and the resurgence of terrorism.\"",

      "The damage has hampered displaced residents' \"access to basic needs such as clean water, food, medical care and shelter,\" and the winter cold \"has made it more difficult to survive,\" the Red Cross added in a statement.",
      "The U.N. humanitarian agency OCHA said the military offensive, \"appears to exceed law enforcement standards,\" and has had severe consequences.",
      "\"The continued use of lethal war-like tactics in residential areas is extremely concerning,\" OCHA said.",
      "Israeli hardliners have long pushed for the outright annexation of the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israeli forces since 1967, but such proposals have been met with strong opposition from Palestinians and much of the international community.",
      "Violence has soared in the West Bank since Hamas triggered the war in Gaza with its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel. About 1,200 people were killed in that attack and 251 others kidnapped. Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza has displaced the vast majority of that territory's population, left most of its homes and other infrastructure in ruins, and killed well over 48,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 10:22:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is apparently nearing a deal with Ukraine that could grant the U.S. access to mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees.",
    "story": [
      "Exactly three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and under pressure from President Trump, a senior Ukrainian official said negotiations over a deal that would give Washington access to Ukraine's vast mineral reserves were \"in the final stages.\"",
      "Ukraine's leaders have voiced hope that such an agreement might serve as the foundation of a long-term security guarantee for the country against any future Russian aggression, but the Trump administration has thus far remained non-committal, framing access to the resources as a way for Ukraine to pay the U.S. back for its support over the last three years.",
      "\"The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,\" Olga Stefanishka, Ukraine's Vice President for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said in a Monday\u00a0social media post, written in English. \"We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature. We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.\"",
      "Often called Europe's \"breadbasket\" thanks to its massive agriculture sector, Ukraine is also one of the continent's most resource-rich nations. Much of Ukraine's mineral reserves remain untapped, however, due to difficult access, old and undeveloped infrastructure and a lack of investment \u2014 all exacerbated by Russia's ongoing offensive military campaign, which initially started in 2014 with its invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.",
      "Zelenskyy says he'd give up presidency in exchange for peace, NATO membership",

      "Roughly 20% of Ukrainian land \u2014 a vast swath of the eastern Donbas region plus Crimea \u2014 is now under Russian control. The occupied territory includes a significant portion of Ukraine's mineral reserves, including highly sought-after rare earth elements used in defense, aerospace, technology and energy production.",
      "The ground beneath Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's total reserves of rare earth elements. The U.S., which covers about 12 times as much ground, is estimated to have only 1-2% of the world's rare earths, by comparison.",
      "According to the Institute for the Study of War, about half of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves lie in territory currently occupied by Russia.",
      "Ukraine also has one of Europe's biggest reserves of titanium. The strong, lightweight metal is a vital component in modern aircraft, missiles and countless other civilian and military hardware, from satellites to bicycles. Ukraine's reserves are largely found in the northwest and central regions of the country, which have remained firmly under Kyiv's control.",
      "Lithium deposits, meanwhile, are scattered across Ukraine's central, east and southeast regions \u2014 the latter of which are currently held largely by Russia. Lithium is a key component in the rechargeable batteries found in everything from electric vehicles to laptops and smartphones.",
      "Ukraine also holds about 20% of the world's global reserves of graphite. Commonly used in pencils, the soft substance is also used in industrial lubricants for motors and other machinery.",
      "\"We must have an agreement with Ukraine on critical minerals and rare earths and various other things as security. And I think that that's happening. I think we've made a lot of progress,\" Mr. Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House on Monday with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "\"I think this discussion (a potential mineral deal) is a very important one,\" said Macron. \"First, because it's important for the U.S. and it will be a good occasion for a first very important meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Second, I think it's \u2014 there is a lot of economic upside on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals as a way for the country to pay back Washington for the military assistance provided over the past three years.",
      "U.S. industry currently relies largely on China, which is the world's biggest source of rare earths and other minerals, for its raw materials. An increase in the supply of those materials from Ukraine could eventually mean a decrease in minerals purchased from China \u2014 and less concern from a national security standpoint.",
      "While the details of the deal said to be taking shape have not been shared, Zelenskyy earlier refused to sign an agreement that reportedly would have given the U.S. access to about $500 billion worth of his nation's mineral wealth \u2014 about half of its estimated future value.",
      "\"I won't sign a document that 10 generations of Ukrainians will pay for,\" Zelenskyy said over the weekend. He has stressed that any agreement to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals must come with security guarantees\u2014\u00a0 including, he suggested Tuesday, the possibility of American forces deploying to protect American investments.",
      "Zelenkyy's chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, said Monday that Kyiv was considering investment opportunities with both the U.S and European countries, \"which includes minerals, their development and extraction,\" calling his country's natural resources \"a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees \u2014 military guarantees and others.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed the U.S. has given Ukraine $350 billion in assistance since the war started three years ago, and made it clear he wants to get that back.",
      "Ukraine Oversight, a U.S. interagency watchdog group, says the U.S. has provided no more than $183 billion, however, and roughly a third of that was spent domestically in the U.S. to manufacture ammunition and other weapons and equipment to be used by Ukraine.",

Maritime exploration firm Ocean Infinity has resumed the hunt for the missing plane, Malaysian transport minister Anthony Loke said Tuesday.",

      "The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people vanished from radar screens on March 8, 2014, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Despite the largest search in aviation history, the plane has never been found.",
      "\"We're very relieved and pleased that the search is resuming once again after such a long hiatus,\" Malaysian Grace Nathan, 36, who lost her mother on the doomed jet, told AFP.",
      "In December, Loke had said the new search would be on the same \"no find, no fee\" principle as Ocean Infinity's previous search, with the government only paying out if it finds the aircraft.",
      "The contract was for 18 months and Malaysia would pay $70 million to the company if the plane was found, Loke previously had said.",
      "Ocean Infinity, based in Britain and the United States, carried out an unsuccessful hunt in 2018.",
      "The company's first efforts followed a massive Australia-led search for the aircraft that lasted three years before it was suspended in January 2017.

      "The 2024 YR4 asteroid, which is nearly the size of a football field, now has roughly a 0.004% chance of hitting Earth in about eight years, according to the space agency's latest calculations. The Center for Near-Earth Object Studies previously projected a 3% chance of the asteroid striking our planet before lowering the chance to 0.28% last week.",
      "NASA said the changes are due to continued observations of the asteroid that allow experts to \"calculate more precise models of the asteroid's trajectory.\" There's now no significant potential for this particular asteroid to impact Earth for the next century, the agency added.",
      "\"The latest observations have further reduced the uncertainty of its future trajectory, and the range of possible locations the asteroid could be on Dec. 22, 2032, has moved farther away from the Earth,\" NASA said.",
      "The Moon, however, could be in 2024 YR4 asteroid's path. NASA's latest numbers show there's a 1.7% probability that it could impact the Moon.",
      "The asteroid was first spotted on Dec. 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",
      "Meanwhile, NASA continues to monitor other potential asteroid threats through Sentry, its automated collision monitoring system that scans the most current asteroid catalog for possibilities of future impact with Earth over the next century.",

      "The Catholic leader was last hospitalized for pneumonia in 2023. He previously underwent abdominal surgery, when part of his colon was removed.",
      "Most recently, the pope was hospitalized for a respiratory infection on Feb. 14, 2025, at Gemelli Hospital, one of the best hospitals in Italy.",
      "What is the pope's medical condition?",
      "The pope's condition has been described as bilateral pneumonia, which generally appears as consolidation on a chest x-ray or CT scan.",
      "Pneumonia is an infection in the air sacs of the lung. Bilateral pneumonia is more problematic and difficult to recover from than unilateral pneumonia or pneumonia in one lobe, especially in an elderly patient with scarring from previous surgeries and bouts of pneumonia.",

      "Why is the pope on oxygen?",
      "The pope is receiving what is known as high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula (a device that provides extra oxygen through a tube and into the nose), which can vary in oxygen percentage.",

      "While Pope Francis is certainly far from out of the woods, per Vatican reports, it is important to clarify that mild renal insufficiency simply means blood flow to the kidney is mildly reduced, perhaps from low volume or dehydration, and it might well be improving from the blood transfusions he is receiving.",
      "As long as his urine output keeps up and his kidney function doesn\u2019t worsen, this should not be a major obstacle.",

      "The goal is to create a specific role for scanning to make it easier on already strained agents.",
      "\"The majority of the fentanyl that is intercepted is at the ports of entry because of the technology that we have,\" Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., who drafted H.R. 1924, told Fox News Digital. \"Also because of the way that fentanyl looks and the way it gets transported, which are small pills and they can fit pretty much anywhere.\"",

      "Much of the known drug trafficking done across the border is through the ports. The majority of convictions in recent years for smuggling fentanyl specifically have been American citizens, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission.",
      "\"Through this kind of scanning process where goods are flowing back and forth, we can prevent the crossing of illegal drugs and also speed up the process of the legal goods coming in,\" Ciscomani said.

Rather, the association said they would defer to state law that makes it illegal to determine someone's athletic eligibility on the basis of their gender identity.",
      "Sarah Perry, a civil rights attorney who has extensive experience litigating Title IX issues, said that in addition to Trump's executive order, Maine is also flouting directives from the Department of Education and previously established precedent from a slew of cases that challenged former President Joe Biden's Title IX regulations allowing athletic eligibility to be determined by one's preferred gender identity.",

      "Perry added that besides the obvious risk of losing funding, these states also open themselves up to federal Title IX investigations, something she said could potentially force them to comply with Trump's demands.",

      "We saw a rise in infostealer malware in 2024, with hackers using it to steal credentials, cryptocurrency and other personal data from millions of users. If you recall, I reported countless\u00a0incidents of an infostealer called Lumma preying on Android, Windows and even iOS and Mac users.",

      "Security researchers have also observed 3.9 billion credentials shared in credential lists that appear to be sourced from infostealer logs.",

      "Infostealer-related attacks on the rise in 2024",
      "A\u00a0cybersecurity report by threat intelligence platform KELA has uncovered a sharp rise in infostealer malware in 2024. Researchers also observed an alarming trend in how stolen data was circulated. Large compilations of credentials, often referred to as \"credential lists,\" were being shared across cybercrime forums. These lists, primarily sourced from infostealer logs, contained billions of login details harvested from infected devices.",
      "One of the most notable incidents linked to infostealer malware was the breach of Snowflake, a cloud data storage provider. In April 2024, threat actors gained access to customer accounts using stolen login credentials, many of which were obtained through infostealers. Exploiting weak security practices, such as the absence of multifactor authentication, attackers extracted valuable data and later attempted to sell it on underground markets. The breach affected at least 165 companies.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The KELA report highlights that hackers deploying Lumma, StealC, Redline and other infostealers infected 4.3 million machines, leading to the compromise of 330 million credentials. Nearly 40% of these infected machines contained credentials for corporate systems, including content management platforms, email accounts, Active Directory Federation Services and remote desktop environments. In total, this accounted for 1.7 million compromised bots and 7.5 million stolen credentials.",
      "The report also found that 3.9 billion credentials were shared in credential lists that appear to be sourced from infostealer logs. KELA\u2019s analysis suggests that almost 65% of infected devices were personal computers storing corporate credentials, making them a prime target for infostealer malware.",

      "Infostealer malware is not going anywhere in 2025. With malware-as-a-service platforms on the rise and infostealers becoming more advanced, cybercriminals will likely keep using them as a go-to method for stealing credentials and gaining access to systems.",
      "Law enforcement has been cracking down, though. In 2024, authorities managed to take down key parts of the infostealer ecosystem, including disrupting Redline, one of the most widely used infostealers. This showed that international agencies can go after not just the malware developers but also the networks and underground markets that keep these operations running.",
      "But takedowns like these rarely put an end to the problem. When one major infostealer operation is shut down, others quickly step in to take its place. The constant demand for stolen credentials and the ability of cybercriminals to adapt means infostealer attacks will likely remain a major threat in 2025.",

      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are some effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "HOW TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST DEBIT CARD HACKERS WHO ARE AFTER YOUR MONEY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Given the surge in infostealer malware warnings, it is clear that cybercriminals are actively targeting passwords. Both organizations and individuals are urged to strengthen their security measures by enabling 2FA, monitoring credential exposure and using endpoint protection tools. While no security measure is completely foolproof, combining these practices can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to infostealer malware.",

      "I was one of the first to spit into a test tube, giving up my DNA forever to learn more about my health and heredity.\u00a0You know, the ones that promise to connect you with distant relatives you didn\u2019t even know existed or reveal genetic risks for conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s or heart disease. These DNA tests aren\u2019t just about satisfying curiosity; people buy them to uncover important health information, connect with loved ones or give thoughtful gifts.",
      "But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 and I\u2019m speaking from a data privacy perspective here \u2013 genetic information is highly valuable and a risk to unlocking deeply intimate information unique to only you. And while these commercial DNA tests seem harmless, they come with risks that most people don\u2019t immediately think about. Once you hand over your DNA, you\u2019re giving these companies access to your most personal data. And believe me, what happens to that data after the test can be anything but straightforward.",

      "Illustration of human DNA (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What\u2019s the big deal?",
      "Your DNA is more than just a string of letters; it's a unique and permanent blueprint of your identity. Using a commercial DNA testing service can mean handing over not only physical samples but also information about potential medical conditions and predispositions, ethnicity and familial connections and even behavioral or lifestyle markers. This can put you at risk of things like genetic testing without your consent, increased insurance premiums, health-related scams and family secrets coming to light, sometimes with painful consequences.\u00a0One woman even felt that she \"lost her entire family\" after taking one of these tests.",
      "And here\u2019s the kicker: Even if you choose to stay out of the genetic testing game, if anyone who shares some of your DNA, like your brother or your niece, chooses to take one, it can still expose you to many of these risks without you even knowing.",
      "What does happen to your genetic data?",
      "Aside from doing what the services advertise, it turns out that many DNA testing services may be sharing your genetic data with researchers, marketers, insurance companies and even law enforcement agencies.",
      "In fact, according to recent research, half of commercial DNA testing services use your genetic data for research (both internal and external). Nearly half (4 in 10) use it for marketing. And nearly half (also 4 in 10) also share your data with law enforcement agencies, potentially without any kind of subpoena or court order.",
      "While DNA testing companies often claim to use anonymized data for many of these purposes, the reality is that \"anonymized\" genetic information can\u00a0often be re-identified when combined with other data sources, sources like data brokers and people search sites that hold and sell troves of information (like lists of vulnerable individuals, such as those experiencing dementia) that could be used toward this purpose.",

According to Dr. Divya Vats, a clinical biochemical geneticist at Kaiser Permanente,\u00a0at-home genetic tests aren\u2019t as accurate as medical DNA tests ordered by your doctor. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety or false reassurance regarding your health. Even when it comes to ethnicity and ancestry, results usually rely on statistical comparisons to reference populations, which\u00a0don\u2019t necessarily yield accurate results, especially if you\u2019re from a less-studied ethnic group.",

According to an investigative journalist who tried to have her genetic footprint wiped, it was \"brutally difficult.\" Recent events, like 23andMe going bankrupt, highlight just how precarious the situation can be.",
      "Consumers are left worried about what will happen to their genetic data if a testing company is sold or acquired, especially when they have no easy way to retrieve or destroy that data. These companies often don\u2019t disclose where and how your samples are stored, either.",
      "According to Incogni, a data broker removal service, almost none of the DNA testing services it investigated provided any information more substantial than that of a \"secure facility.\" This lack of transparency about where their data is stored and how it can be destroyed creates a major roadblock for anyone trying to regain control over their genetic information.",

      "If you\u2019re still considering using a DNA service, if your genetic information has already been exposed or if you just want to take preventative steps, here are some things to do.",
      "1) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Proactively remove your personal information from online data brokers and people search sites to minimize the risk of linking anonymized genetic data back to you. Not only will this clean up and prevent your health and genetic data from circulating the web, but it\u2019ll also make it much harder for your anonymized data (genetic or otherwise) to be linked to you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Choose reputable companies: Select well-known and trusted DNA testing providers, as they are more likely to adhere to privacy and security standards due to public scrutiny.",
      "3) Review privacy options during sign-up: Pay close attention to privacy settings when registering your test kit. Many companies allow you to opt in or out of data sharing for research or marketing purposes.",
      "4) Limit data sharing: Carefully consider whether to permit your data to be shared with third parties. While you can revoke consent later, data already shared may not be fully retrievable or deletable.",
      "5) Delete data post-test: If you\u2019ve already taken a test, review the company\u2019s privacy policy and delete your data if possible. Note that data shared with third parties may remain accessible.",
      "6) Avoid uploading data to third-party databases: Refrain from uploading your genetic information to external services, which may share data with law enforcement or other entities without clear consent.",
      "7) Consider anonymous testing: Use anonymous methods when submitting DNA samples, such as pseudonyms or alternative payment methods, to reduce traceability.",
      "SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your DNA holds some of the most personal and sensitive information about you, and once it\u2019s out there, you lose control over how it\u2019s used. From potential privacy violations to emotional surprises and the challenges of deleting your genetic data, DNA testing kits come with risks that many don\u2019t recognize upfront. If you\u2019re considering diving into your genetic blueprint, ask yourself: Are you comfortable with this data potentially ending up in the hands of marketers, law enforcement or even a company you didn\u2019t agree to share it with?",

      "When to hang up",
      "So, once faced with a suspicious call, the solution is simply to hang up as soon as something seems off. And when is that, exactly? The moment someone calls you out of the blue and requires you to give or confirm any personal information. This could be the last four digits of your Social Security number, your address, which credit card company you're with \u2014 anything that concerns you, specifically. If the caller turns up the pressure and starts trying to get you to stay on the line, either by enticing you with \"rewards\" or even threatening you with dire consequences, then you can be absolutely sure the call is not legitimate.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The red herring of legitimacy",
      "But what if the call is legitimate? What if you hang up on someone who was only doing their job? What if they were truly trying to help you? These are the doubts that scammers and hackers play upon to ply their trades. We're all vulnerable to tactics like these, especially if caught off guard. Older adults are particularly vulnerable.\u00a0Studies suggest that older people \u2014 who collectively lose over $28 billion to scams each year \u2014 are more likely to cling to initial impressions of trustworthiness, even when later behavior puts that trustworthiness into question. Scammers typically start their interactions with well-rehearsed, smoothly executed preambles, creating good first impressions. Older people are also more likely to put stock in good manners, finding it more difficult than younger adults to directly or indirectly question a caller's intentions, let alone cut them off mid-sentence and hang up on them.",

      "Why call center staff won't ask for personal information",
      "So, how can you know if the caller is really who they say they are? That's the question many people get stuck on. The twist? It's a red herring. The fact is, it doesn't matter if the call is legit or not. If it's a scammer, they won't be hurt or offended: rejection and hang-ups come with the territory. If it's a real call, the caller also won't be hurt or offended \u2014 here's why. Call center staff and other people who make cold calls as part of their job are aware of the privacy and security concerns that such calls bring up. They know how dangerous it can be to divulge personal information over the phone, which is why they won't ask for it. They should also be familiar with one of the best practices there is for dealing with suspicious cold calls.",
      "10 ways to safeguard against phone scams and unwanted calls",
      "1. Use the \"Hang up, look up, and call back\" method for verification: When in doubt, hang up the phone, look up the organization the caller claimed to be calling from (using its official website, for example), and call it back using the number you find there. If the call you received was above board, they'll be able to redirect you back to the initial caller.",
      "2. Don't answer calls from unknown numbers: Let unknown calls go to voicemail, as legitimate callers will usually leave a message if it's important.",
      "3. Register your phone number on the\u00a0National Do Not Call Registry: This can help reduce telemarketing calls from legitimate businesses, but it won't stop scammers, illegal robocalls or exempt organizations (like charities and political groups) from calling you. Scammers often ignore the registry and use tactics like\u00a0number spoofing to bypass it. Want to know more about why your phone still won\u2019t stop ringing and what you can do about it? Check out our article on the\u00a0\u2018Do Not Call\u2019 list loophole.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Use a spam blocking app for texts and calls:\u00a0These apps can identify and block known spam numbers, significantly reducing the number of unwanted calls you receive.",
      "5. Never give out personal information in response to unexpected calls: Legitimate organizations won't ask for sensitive information over the phone if they've initiated the call.",
      "6. Be cautious of pressure tactics or requests for immediate action: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to prevent you from thinking clearly or verifying their claims.",
      "7. Set a password for your voicemail account: This prevents scammers from accessing your voicemail and potentially gathering personal information.",
      "8. Be wary of caller ID\u00a0spoofing \u2014 local numbers may not be local callers: Scammers can manipulate caller ID to display any number they choose, so don't trust it blindly.",
      "9. Don't respond to questions, especially those that can be answered with \"Yes\": Scammers may record your \"Yes\" response and use it to authorize fraudulent charges or changes to your accounts.",
      "10. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0To get fewer of these calls in the first place, you can enlist the help of a professional data removal service. These services can take your personal information out of circulation, including the contact details spammers and scammers use to call you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "If you receive a call that gives you any doubts at all, even if you can't quite put your finger on why, then you should end the call and either go on with your day or look up the company and call it back on its official number. You can reduce the number of calls like this by signing up for a data removal service. This will leave fewer spam and scam callers with your contact details and other personal information \u2014 something they use to craft convincing backstories and put potential victims at ease.",

    "title": "Airlines eye weight-based fees: Will heavier passengers pay more?",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:00:13 -0500",
    "summary": "A new debate has emerged about whether airlines should charge passengers based on their weight to help reduce fuel consumption and lower emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Laura Ingraham asks why there are so many plane crashes on 'The Ingraham Angle.'",
      "In 2008, American Airlines became the first major U.S. carrier to charge for checked bags, introducing a $15 fee as part of a cost-cutting measure. Since then, other airlines have adopted similar fees, with prices steadily increasing over the years. Now, a new debate has emerged about whether airlines should charge passengers based on their weight to help reduce fuel consumption and lower emissions.",

      "The changing landscape of airline weight policies",
      "In 2013, Samoa Air introduced a \"fat tax\" where passengers paid based on their weight, but it didn't catch on widely.",
      "In February 2024, Finnair expanded its weight data collection initiative. The airline is now asking passengers to voluntarily weigh themselves along with their carry-on luggage at Helsinki Airport. This data collection will take place over three months, covering both short Schengen-area flights and longer-haul routes.",
      "Finnair's approach is designed to be anonymous, with only age, gender and travel class recorded alongside the weight data. The collected information will be used to update the airline's aircraft balance and loading calculations for the period from 2025 to 2030.",
      "These developments indicate a growing interest in the airline industry in exploring weight-based strategies for both operational efficiency and potential future pricing models.",
      "Researchers believe it\u2019s important to discuss weight-based pricing as a way to reduce the environmental impact of air travel. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE BEST TRAVEL GEAR FOR 2025",
      "Weight-based airline pricing divides opinion",
      "A recent\u00a0study asked 1,012 U.S. adults for their opinion on charging based on weight. It looked at three pricing options: a regular fare with a set luggage limit, a \"weight threshold\" where passengers over 160 pounds would pay extra and a \"body weight\" model where ticket prices would depend on each person\u2019s weight.",
      "The results showed that lighter passengers were more in favor of weight-based fees, while heavier passengers preferred the current system. However, almost half of the heavier respondents were still open to the idea.",
      "Younger travelers, frequent flyers and wealthier passengers were more likely to support weight-based charges.",
      "The study also revealed concerns about fairness, with nearly 60% worried about possible discrimination. Despite these worries, researchers believe it\u2019s important to discuss weight-based pricing as a way to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.",
      "The airline industry faces the challenge of balancing environmental responsibility, economic efficiency and inclusive customer experience. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "FOOD TRACKING JUST GOT LAZY WITH THIS WEARABLE",
      "Ethical and environmental implications of weight-based airline pricing",
      "The potential implementation of weight-based airline pricing extends beyond simple economics, touching on complex environmental and social justice considerations. Climate researchers suggest that such a model could significantly reduce carbon emissions by creating a more direct correlation between passenger weight and fuel consumption. Environmental experts calculate that every additional pound on an aircraft increases fuel burn, with some estimates suggesting that a reduction of 1% in total aircraft weight could lead to approximately 0.75% fuel savings.",
      "This data provides a compelling scientific argument for weight-sensitive pricing strategies. However, the approach raises critical ethical questions about body diversity, accessibility and potential discrimination. Disability advocates argue that such pricing could disproportionately impact individuals with medical conditions or physical differences beyond their control.",
      "Emerging technologies like advanced lightweight materials and more fuel-efficient aircraft designs might ultimately provide alternative solutions to reducing aviation's carbon footprint, potentially rendering weight-based pricing unnecessary in the long term. As the debate continues, the airline industry faces the challenge of balancing environmental responsibility, economic efficiency and inclusive customer experience.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Although there's interest in weight-based charges, societal norms and the potential for discrimination make it challenging to address. As airlines continue exploring new ways to reduce fuel costs and environmental impact, it\u2019s clear that any move toward weight-based pricing will need to carefully consider fairness and public perception.",

Now, the shipping industry has joined the list, with a major global shipper that works with Amazon, eBay and Shopify exposing 14 million records.",
      "To make things worse, the open instance was found in December during the peak of international shipping when people are sending and receiving gifts all over the world. Researchers traced it back to an unprotected AWS bucket owned by Hipshipper.",

      "What you need to know",
      "Hipshipper, a shipping platform used by sellers on eBay, Shopify and Amazon, accidentally exposed millions of shipping labels with personal customer information. Researchers at Cybernews found the exposed data in December 2024, but it wasn't fixed until January, meaning it was open for at least a month. Hipshipper helps people ship packages to over 150 countries, offering tracking, free insurance and easy returns. The exposed shipping labels are important because they detail what's inside the packages and where they\u2019re supposed to go.",
      "However, an unprotected AWS bucket held over 14.3 million records, mainly shipping labels and customs forms. Researchers from Cybernews said,\u00a0\"Cybercriminals can use leaked data to carry out scams and phishing attacks. For example, criminals might pretend to be trusted businesses and send fake messages using specific order details to trick people into sharing personal or financial information.\"",

      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",

      "Researchers believe the exposed bucket contained sensitive information about buyers, including their full names, home addresses, phone numbers and order details such as mailing dates and parcel information. While there\u2019s no direct evidence that cybercriminals accessed the exposed data, millions of malicious actors use automated bots to search the internet for similar leaks, hoping to find data they can use for harmful purposes.",
      "These criminals could exploit the leaked information to launch\u00a0scams and\u00a0phishing attacks. For instance, they might pretend to be trusted companies and send fake messages that use specific order details to pressure people into urgently verifying personal or financial information. Unfortunately, retail companies are a prime target for hackers, and relying on large, well-known firms doesn\u2019t always protect your information. Recent breaches involving companies like\u00a0Grubhub,\u00a0Mizuno and\u00a0Hot Topic show that even big-name retailers can suffer significant security lapses.",

      "1) Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0After a data breach, scammers often use the stolen data to craft convincing phishing messages. These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions.\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Watch out for snail mail:\u00a0While many security threats happen online, physical mail can also be a target. With home addresses exposed in data leaks, criminals may send fraudulent letters or fake invoices to trick you into providing further personal information or making payments. If you receive suspicious mail, avoid responding and report it to the company it claims to be from.",
      "3) Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won't be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "5) Monitor your credit reports regularly: You can request free credit reports from major credit bureaus to check for any suspicious activity or unauthorized accounts opened in your name.",
      "6) Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.",
      "7)\u00a0Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it's crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams by removing your personal information from the web.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s high time every industry took cybersecurity seriously. If your business operates online, you are just as responsible for protecting customer data as a tech company, possibly even more so, since tech companies typically have stronger safeguards in place. The fact that Hipshipper left a storage bucket containing 14 million records unprotected speaks volumes about how little they prioritize cybersecurity. And it's not just Hipshipper. Many companies dealing with tech products aren\u2019t even careful enough to password-protect their critical documents. This lack of basic security highlights a worrying trend across industries.",

    "summary": "Some analysts believe that President Donald Trump was right to cut aid to Africa and that increased trade with the continent will fill &quot;the plates of hungry kids at the end of the day.&quot;",
    "story": [
      "House Foreign Affairs Committee member Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., breaks down USAID's wasteful spending on 'America Reports.'",
      "JOHANNESBURG: The key to Africa\u2019s future is in increasing trade with the U.S., not in receiving aid from it, a message key analysts told Fox News Digital in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign aid freeze.",
      "\"U.S. trade dollars exchanged with Africa massively exceed aid dollars granted,\" South African-based Frans Cronje, an advisor for the Yorktown Foundation for Freedom, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Some $11 billion of USAid funds were reportedly spent in Africa in 2024, but trade between the U.S. and Africa during the same period was seven times higher -\u00a0$71.6 billion, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.",

      "Cronje said \"the idea of helping people with aid may be admirable, but in practice achieves little in Africa by way of addressing the structural factors that underpin poverty. Trade, on the other hand, is a more viable route by which the U.S. can build strong relationships with Africa, and is also in line with President Donald Trump\u2019s style of diplomacy through transactions.\"",
      "Cronje elaborated, saying, \"Aid acts as a subsidy to bad governments, and thereby keeps them in power despite an absence of reform - whereas trade requires reforms and improving governance to be sustainable.\"",
      "Following the Trump administration's policy change, Ledama Olekina, senator for Kenya\u2019s Narok County, added, \"We don\u2019t need aid in Kenya; we can do it on our own!\" Posting on X on Jan. 28, Olekina wrote, \"Relying on aid from the West limits our opportunities to be industrious and creative. From now on, we must learn to live within our means, eliminate corruption, and instill a spirit of patriotism in our citizens. Together, let\u2019s build a brighter future for our country. Thank you @realDonaldTrump and @USAID it\u2019s time!\"",
      "Anna Mahjar-Barducci, a senior research fellow at the Middle East Media Research Institute, told Fox News Digital that aid \"does not help the needy, as foreign aid keeps the needy always being needy \u2026 international aid doesn't go directly to the starving population, but to governments. The direct consequence is the growth of the role of the State in the economy of the recipient country, which does not offer incentives to (the) private sector's development.\"",
      "She added, \"Foreign aid has been financing central governments, which (has) ended up promoting statism, and discouraging the creation of an entrepreneurial culture. As a result, government bureaucrats became richer, and regular citizens got poorer. As British economist Peter Bauer put it: \"Aid is a process by which the poor in the rich countries subsidize the rich in poor countries.\"",

      "Aid has other negative effects, according to Mahjar-Barducci, who added, \"aid is providing governments, many of which are dictatorships, in Africa with freely usable cash, which not only discourages the creation of an entrepreneurial culture, but it also discourages steps toward peace in war-torn areas.",
      "\"While many Westerners (mainly belonging to the radical left) criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pause U.S. foreign aid, many African intellectuals welcomed the new administration\u2019s policy.\"",
      "She pointed to a recent column by Nigerian expert Mfonobong Inyang, titled, \"Wake Up Africa, Foreign Aid Is Not A Development Strategy.\" She said \"in his article, he stated that foreign aid is meant to be a temporary relief and intervention, not an official policy of any country that seeks to assert its sovereignty.\"",
      "Mahjar-Barducci said, \"Many African economists are saying that the suspension of USAID funding, offers an opportunity to redefine the African countries\u2019 development strategy, and establish an \u2018Africa-first approach,\u2019 based on direct investments, innovation, partnerships, (and) empowering local governance.\"",

      "Cronje said that when it comes to Africa, China already believes in pushing trade, rather than aid, \"in terms of both foreign investment flows and trade flows, China is a significantly more important economic partner for Africa than is the U.S. Since around 2010, Chinese trade with Africa escalated sharply in dollar terms whilst trade levels between the U.S. and Africa remained relatively flat.\"",

      "Additionally, on China, Cronje concluded, \"In many respects, the U.S. is having to play catch-up in Africa. For American policy makers, the trade and investment deficit relative to China should be a more important concern than the question of future aid flows.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration directed federal agencies on Wednesday to prepare for mass layoffs, according to the heads of the White House budget and personnel management offices.",
      "Budget Director Russell Vought and Charles Ezell, the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, wrote in a memo to the heads of these agencies that the federal government is \"costly, inefficient, and deeply in debt.\"",
      "\"At the same time, it is not producing results for the American public. Instead, tax dollars are being siphoned off to fund unproductive and unnecessary programs that benefit radical interest groups while hurting hardworking American citizens,\" they said.",
      "The memo notes that President Donald Trump has required \"large-scale reductions in force\" and in order to implement that, it calls on the heads of departments and agencies to submit the first phase of reorganization plans by March 13, which \"shall focus on initial agency cuts and reductions.\"",
      "The plans should be grounded in the principles of ensuring \"better service\" for Americans, \"increased productivity,\" a \"reduced real property footprint\" and a \"reduced budget,\" the memo said.",
      "It calls for agencies to consolidate areas that are \"duplicative\" and where \"unnecessary layers exist\" within management. It also calls for implementing technology that can \"automate routine tasks\" so that staff can \"focus on higher-value activities.\"",
      "The memo specifically calls for the removal of \"underperforming employees or employees engaged in misconduct.\"",
      "The heads of departments and agencies will have to submit plans for a second phase workforce reduction by mid-April. \"That will outline a vision for more productive, efficient agency operations going forward and be implemented by the end of September,\" the memo said.",
      "That second part of the plan should include \"any proposed relocations of agency bureaus and offices from Washington, D.C. and the National Capital Region to less-costly parts of the country,\" it said.",
      "Vought and Ezell explained that the memo doesn't apply to positions that are necessary for law enforcement, national security, immigration enforcement, and U.S. military personnel. It also excludes the U.S. Postal Service and presidential appointees.",
      "Officials at two federal agency told NBC News that DOGE employees have started to go through each individual position to prepare for the reductions. One of the officials said the DOGE employees have created a spreadsheet of workers in the agency and started marking whether they and their positions are considered critical or not.",
      "Thousands of probationary workers were already terminated from agencies and departments across the federal government in the last two weeks as a result of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency effort.",
      "Then, this weekend, workers were notified they would have to answer a Elon Musk-directed email to justify their jobs by listing what they accomplished in the last week; if they didn't respond, he said, they would risk being fired.",
      "At his first Cabinet meeting on Wednesday afternoon, Trump backed Musk's message, despite the conflicting directives workers received from some agency leaders who responded to it by telling employees they did not have to respond.",
      "\"Those people are on the bubble, as they say,\" Trump said Wednesday about people who didn't respond. \"You know they maybe they\u2019re going to be gone, maybe they\u2019re not around, maybe they have other jobs, maybe they moved and they\u2019re not where they\u2019re supposed to be.\""

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 18:55:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Take a quick look at the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s list of canceled contracts and you\u2019d think the Agriculture Department spent $25 million on diversity trainings four separate times, while the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau spent $600 million on management consultants.",

      "Take a quick look at the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s list of canceled contracts and you\u2019d think the Agriculture Department spent $25 million on diversity trainings four separate times, while the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau spent $600 million on management consultants.",
      "DOGE\u2019s \u201cwall of savings\u201d and list of canceled contracts include many eye-popping \u201creceipts\u201d like those. There\u2019s just one problem: Many of the so-called receipts aren\u2019t receipts at all. They\u2019re negotiated agreements with known government contractors, who might provide future services.",
      "\u201cThis is a way to make it easier for the government to order, if it does order, and to set up good prices that they can order. It doesn\u2019t mean they buy it,\u201d Steve Kelman, who ran the Office of Federal Procurement Policy in the Office of Management and Budget in the 1990s, said of the contracts.",
      "The agreements are known as blanket purchase agreements (BPAs), working more like a catalog of things the government might buy than a placed order. But listed alongside actual orders for goods and services on DOGE\u2019s \u201cwall of savings,\u201d they create a wildly exaggerated and false impression of government spending.",
      "The wall of savings includes more than 60 listed \u201ccontracts\u201d that are clearly labeled as BPAs on the DOGE site, while many others are identified as BPAs in federal records \u2014 often easily spotted because of their high, round numbers. NBC News counted more than $1 billion value in DOGE\u2019s list of canceled contracts from BPAs.",
      "When asked for comment, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said in an email: \u201cThe continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE. The American public are in lockstep with the President\u2019s mission and will not be swayed by more lies coming from the legacy media.\u201d",
      "DOGE\u2019s records are clear that canceling BPAs doesn\u2019t result in any immediate savings, but the records do not make clear that the government may not have spent any money on the BPAs at all.",
      "Somewhat ironically, the contracts are meant to improve government efficiency. BPAs are negotiated deals that allow agencies to purchase frequently needed goods and services from contractors who have been previously vetted and approved for a multiyear period. These deals have negotiated rates and regulations to improve purchasing for the period of the deal, and speed up the process significantly.",
      "The findings add to a growing list of issues that have been found with DOGE\u2019s claims of cutting government waste. The agency has struggled to back up lofty claims of fraud and appeared to have misinterpreted data from the Social Security Administration and a Department of Homeland Security contract. An Associated Press analysis found 40% of contracts cut by DOGE aren\u2019t expected to save the government any money. The New York Times reported Tuesday that DOGE had quietly removed five of its biggest listed savings from its website.",
      "As of Wednesday, DOGE\u2019s website claimed $65 billion in savings, equal to about 0.9% of the 2024 federal budget.",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE is embroiled in a wide variety of lawsuits questioning its legality, and questions remain about how the agency is operating and who is in charge. On Wednesday, the White House said Amy Gleason had been named acting administrator, though President Donald Trump has consistently said that Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, is in charge.",
      "The BPA process was introduced in the \u201890s as a way of speeding up government ordering, Kelman said, and multiple BPAs for the same work are often arranged so the government can use competition to drive down prices.",
      "\u201cIt took a long time to build all that stuff up and mere minutes or hours for all of that to come burning to the ground,\u201d one current senior employee working in procurement for the federal government said of the Trump and DOGE mandated cuts.",
      "The federal database for government spending lists a contract value for BPAs that is referred to as the \u201cceiling,\u201d which DOGE appears to be using as the \u201cvalue\u201d on its wall of receipts.",
      "That \u201cceiling\u201d can vastly exceed agencies\u2019 actual spending. DOGE lists six $100 million contracts from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on management consultants.The agency wasn\u2019t planning to spend $600 million, however: all are BPAs for the same work, according to federal records, giving the bureau a list of vendors to choose from when it needs to outsource consulting services.",
      "The CFPB spends significantly less on all of its contracts every year; for fiscal year 2025, the contract budget was $230 million, according to an agency financial report dated February 2024. The year prior, it was $224 million.",
      "DOGE\u2019s wall of savings also includes four $25 million contracts for diversity trainings at the U.S. Agriculture Department\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service; federal records show they are all BPAs.",
      "The agency used one of the BPAs in 2023 to order \u2014 or \u201ccall\u201d on the BPA in government jargon \u2014 and approve $414,892 in diversity trainings. Much of the money has already been spent, but DOGE\u2019s cancellation prevents $121,770 from being spent.",
      "Terminating a \u201ccall\u201d for the direct purchase for goods or services early does stop the government from spending money or at least the possibility of spending money, but Kelman said canceling a BPA doesn\u2019t save money or even prevent future spending. Agencies could still spend money for these services, but it would possibly take longer and be more expensive to secure contracts outside the BPAs.",
      "The federal employee working in procurement said what it does is undermine months of work by government workers. While the employee was aware of federal workers unwinding a cancellation, the employee said that becomes impossible after 30 days or so.",
      "The federal employee expects that the spending needs won\u2019t all disappear, and that their office will be forced to redo some of the work they\u2019ve spent the last week canceling."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 When President Donald Trump convened his Cabinet secretaries for the first meeting of his new term on Wednesday, a tableful of big personalities largely sat and watched as the main character of the early Trump administration took center stage once more.",
      "The group, which included nominees who haven't yet been confirmed, was also joined by Elon Musk, whose early actions to reshape the federal bureaucracy have stoked rancor and unease among government employees, as well as early murmurs of concern among some Republicans in Congress.",
      "The agency leaders are all working to implement Trump's agenda at a spitfire pace \u2014 but it's Trump's billionaire adviser who is in front of the cameras and getting significant credit from Trump, and heat from elsewhere, for some of the defining actions of Trump's first month back in the White House.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s sacrificing a lot,\u201d Trump said as he introduced Musk. \u201cHe\u2019s getting a lot of praise, I\u2019ll tell you, but he\u2019s also getting hit.\u201d",
      "Trump's first Cabinet meeting outlined the hierarchy in his administration, with many of his Senate-confirmed department heads spending an hour as audience members after the president gave the floor to Musk at the top of the meeting.",
      "Trump's secretaries watched as Musk, standing at the edge of a long table, explained DOGE and its work as \u201ca support function for the president and for the agencies and departments to help achieve those savings to effectively find 15% reduction in fraud and waste.\"",
      "\"And we bring the receipts,\u201d Musk added. He argued the efforts were a necessary check on federal spending and a deficit he said the country could not sustain.",
      "Musk\u2019s efforts have prompted resistance from some Cabinet secretaries, including several who recently instructed staff to put aside a directive coming from Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency that required a five-point response to the question, \u201cWhat did you do last week?\u201d",
      "After the instruction landed in federal inboxes over the weekend, department and agency directors for the Justice, Defense and State Departments and the FBI began fending off the push, despite Trump and Musk\u2019s suggestions that those who didn\u2019t respond risked being fired.",
      "The Saturday night email, Musk insisted, was simply a \"pulse check,\" not a performance review. Still, he conceded, DOGE \"will make mistakes.\"",
      "Invited to ask questions of Musk, one reporter wondered why Trump had felt the need early Wednesday to declare that his Cabinet stood behind his cost-cutting ally. Had Musk heard anything about members of the Cabinet who weren't pleased with his directives?",
      "\u201cALL CABINET MEMBERS ARE EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH ELON,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cThe Media will see that at the Cabinet Meeting this morning!!!\u201d",
      "\u201cIs anybody unhappy?\u201d Trump asked the room, which broke out in applause. \u201cI think everyone\u2019s not only happy, they\u2019re thrilled.\u201d",
      "Musk praised the group assembled as \u201cliterally the best.\u201d",
      "While not a member of Trump\u2019s Cabinet, Musk has been near omnipresent by the president\u2019s side since he was elected last year, appearing frequently with him at the new president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate, where he joined meetings with senior advisers and other leaders. The close relationship between the two now appears as strong as ever, with Trump describing Musk's demand as \u201cgenius\u201d during a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron and saying employees who did not respond to the weekend email would be\u00a0\u201csemi-fired\u201d or \u201cfired.\u201d",
      "Trump later called the order from Musk \u201csomewhat voluntary,\u201d after Musk on Monday insisted that a non-response could lead to \u201ctermination.\u201d",
      "The meeting on Wednesday threatened to showcase a potentially fraught dynamic between the leaders of Trump's government agencies and the billionaire tycoon looking to make major cuts to their staff. Until this weekend, the leaders had embraced Musk's directives publicly. But Trump, who has praised Musk\u2019s slash-and-burn efforts, maintained on Wednesday morning that each voice in his Cabinet remains aligned behind Musk.",
      "Defending Musk's email throughout the meeting, Trump indicated that federal workers who failed to respond could lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those people are on the bubble, as they say,\" Trump said. \"You know, maybe they\u2019re going to be gone, maybe they\u2019re not around, maybe they have other jobs, maybe they moved and they\u2019re not where they\u2019re supposed to be.\"",
      "Later, he added, \"it\u2019s possible that a lot of those people will be actually fired.\"",
      "Most Cabinet secretaries said little as Trump took questions from reporters, saying of Ukraine that his presidency could halt Russian President Vladimir Putin, who \"wanted the whole thing.\"",
      "And Trump railed against the Biden administration\u2019s chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal, musing about how China had taken over a former U.S. air base after the U.S. exit and how he wanted to \u201cget back\u201d military equipment abandoned by American forces. Trump added that he was not surprised Russia invaded Ukraine amid the fallout.",
      "\u201cIn all fairness to Putin, when he saw that, he said, Well, this is our time to go, and go into Ukraine, I guess,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump invited Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to speak about an idea for an immigration \"gold card\" that the president introduced yesterday and punted a question about a recent measles outbreak in Texas to his Secretary of Health and Human Services, RFK Jr., a vaccine skeptic who has clashed with the medical establishment over his stance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to follow it,\u201d Kennedy said of the outbreak that has so far killed one person and he said had hospitalized about twenty. \u201cIncidentally, there have been four measles outbreaks this year in this country; last year there were 16, so it\u2019s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.\u201d"

    "summary": "A Nebraska father struggling to get a Social Security number and valid birth certificate for his toddler with the computer-generated name Unakite Thirteen Hotel gets a reprieve.",
    "story": [
      "A Nebraska father who has been struggling to get a Social Security number and a valid birth certificate for his toddler finally got a reprieve Wednesday.",
      "Jason Kilburn\u2019s 2-year-old, Caroline, has been listed in state records as \u201cUnakite Thirteen Hotel\u201d since she was born. In addition to not having a birth certificate with her real name on it, Caroline was never assigned a Social Security number \u2014 leaving her ineligible for Medicaid, day care and other services because they all require a Social Security number to verify her identity, her dad says.",
      "On Tuesday, a day after NBC News reported on his bizarre dilemma and was told by the Social Security Administration that it would contact Kilburn, the father received a call inviting him to come to the Social Security Administration\u2019s Omaha field office, said Kilburn\u2019s attorney, Joshua Livingston, who works at the Koenig | Dunne law firm in Omaha.",
      "The meeting, which took place Wednesday morning, went well: Kilburn left with a Social Security number for Caroline at last. A representative told Kilburn to expect to receive a Social Security card for her in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cI am just so relieved that we finally have this part of the puzzle in place,\u201d Kilburn, who lives in Valley, Nebraska, said in an email. \u201cI am absolutely overwhelmed by the outpouring of support for myself and Caroline and grateful for the support of each governmental agency that reached out to assist in finally resolving this part of the problem.\u201d",
      "The positive development, reported first by NBC News, is only a partial solution. The Social Security number was issued Wednesday under the name Unakite since the girl is not listed in any state records under the name her father calls her, Caroline Elizabeth Kilburn.",
      "But Livingston said it\u2019s a start. He plans to continue to help Kilburn to get a proper birth certificate for Caroline, which will be much easier now that she has a Social Security number.",
      "\u201cGetting it under \u2018Unakite\u2019 is obviously not the most desirable way to go about it, but having that number under any name at this point is such a victory,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s mechanisms in place to change names.\u201d",
      "Caroline\u2019s unusual saga began when she was born in November 2022 in a house just over the Nebraska border in Council Bluffs, Iowa, to a mother who immediately wanted to place her with another family, Kilburn said, adding that Nebraska foster parents took her in.",
      "Kilburn and Caroline\u2019s mother had dated on and off but were not together at the time of Caroline\u2019s birth, and he did not know if it was his baby, he said.",
      "After a DNA test proved he was Caroline\u2019s father, the juvenile court last year relinquished custody from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees foster care, to Kilburn. Court documents show that Caroline\u2019s birth mother\u2019s custody rights were terminated, and attempts by NBC News to reach her this week were unsuccessful.",
      "Once Caroline was in his custody, Kilburn learned that she did not have a usable birth certificate or a Social Security number due to a bureaucratic blunder, though it\u2019s not clear which agency made the mistake.",
      "In the time between Caroline\u2019s birth in Iowa and her court-ordered emergency transfer to her Nebraska foster family, she had received only a certificate of live birth \u2014 an unofficial document that hospitals submit to start the process of creating government-issued birth certificates.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like she\u2019s a ghost,\u201d Kilburn said in a phone interview earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s been very, very taxing.\u201d",
      "Adding to the confusion was the name on her certificate of live birth: Unakite Thirteen Hotel, which Kilburn says he was told was computer-generated by the Iowa hospital where Caroline was taken after her home birth.",
      "Previous attempts to resolve the issue did not pan out. In March 2023, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services filed a motion in juvenile court seeking an order \u201callowing NDHHS to establish a legal name for the above-named minor child as Unakite Thirteen Hotel\u201d so it could temporarily use her incorrect name to get a birth certificate and a Social Security number.",
      "The court granted the motion, and Livingston said the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services received a birth certificate that said \u201cfor government use only\u201d that listed Unakite Hotel as the child\u2019s name. But he said the state agency never followed through with getting her a valid Social Security number. Livingston filed a motion in December 2024 seeking to reopen the matter, which the court denied.",
      "In an email to NBC News earlier this week, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services said information about children in state custody is confidential but that it was working \u201cwith the child\u2019s father\u2019s attorney to resolve this issue.\u201d",
      "Not having proper identification for Caroline put her and Kilburn in a tough position.

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 19:45:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The University of North Texas Health Science Center's failure to obtain permission before using corpses for research may have violated state law, authorities said.",
    "story": [
      "This article is part of\u00a0\u201cDealing the Dead,\u201d\u00a0a series investigating the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research.",
      "Texas state regulators are investigating a medical school\u2019s failure to notify surviving family members before cutting up and leasing out the bodies of their loved ones.",
      "The Texas Funeral Service Commission notified the University of North Texas Health Science Center on Oct. 18 that it was opening an investigation into the center\u2019s body donation program, according to a letter obtained by reporters this week through a public records request.",
      "The notice of complaint was issued one month after NBC News published an investigation revealing that the Fort Worth-based center had dissected, studied and leased out hundreds of unclaimed bodies without prior consent from the dead or any survivors.",
      "The center\u2019s failure to obtain permission from next of kin before using corpses for medical research \u2014 and its refusal to immediately release remains to survivors who came forward later \u2014 may have violated state law, Funeral Service Commission investigator Rudy Villarreal wrote in the letter addressed to the Health Science Center\u2019s president, Sylvia Trent-Adams, who has since resigned. Villarreal also alleged that the center failed to get permission from regulators before shipping bodies and body parts across state lines.",
      "The Funeral Service Commission, which regulates body donation in the state, has the power to issue fines against programs for violations. In a statement Wednesday, the agency confirmed the investigation is ongoing.",
      "Health Science Center spokesperson Andy North said the center has been \u201cworking diligently to ensure a complete and accurate production\u201d of documents requested as part of the probe.",
      "The Funeral Service Commission investigation is part of a cascade of changes and official actions triggered by NBC News\u2019 reporting. The news organization discovered dozens of families who said they would have claimed their loved ones\u2019 bodies and given them proper funerals if they had been told about their deaths. Some were still searching for their relatives, unaware that they had died. The dead included military veterans, people who struggled with drug addiction and homelessness, and a young murder victim.",
      "The Health Science Center shipped many of the bodies and body parts to out-of-state medical schools, device makers and health care education companies \u2014 charging $649 for a head, $900 for a torso, $703 for a pair of legs.",
      "In response to the reporters\u2019 findings, the Health Science Center announced in September that it was suspending its body donation program, firing the officials who led it and hiring a consultant to review the program\u2019s operations. North issued a statement last fall apologizing to the affected families.",
      "Dallas and Tarrant counties\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which had provided the Health Science Center with more than 2,300 unclaimed bodies under contracts dating back to 2019\u00a0\u2014\u00a0ended their agreements with the center. Device makers, research companies and other groups that had relied on the center for bodies\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including Boston Scientific and the U.S. Army\u00a0\u2014\u00a0canceled or re-evaluated their business relationships with the program. And last week, a Texas state senator introduced a bill to ban the use of unclaimed bodies without consent.",
      "In its October letter, the Funeral Service Commission asked the Health Science Center to turn over documents related to the operation of its body donation program and set a 15-day deadline to comply. North said the Health Science Center was later granted a 45-day extension and has been providing records on a monthly rolling basis.",
      "So far, the center has turned over more than 1,800 documents, a Funeral Service Commission official said.",
      "Separately, the commission sent the Health Science Center a cease-and-desist letter in November ordering it to end its practice of disposing of corpses by liquefying them through a process commonly referred to as water cremation, which the commission said is illegal in Texas.",
      "In its official response to the commission, sent Dec. 4, the Health Science Center defended its use of water cremations, which are formally known as alkaline hydrolysis, but said it had already halted the practice in September."

    "story": [
      "BALTIMORE \u2014\u00a0Adnan Syed's murder conviction will remain in place after Baltimore City prosecutors withdrew a motion to vacate the conviction Tuesday.",
      "The motion contained \"false and misleading statements and unsubstantiated conclusions\" that prosecutors allegedly failed to turn over evidence favorable to the defense at trial, known as a Brady violation, Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney Ivan J. Bates said.",
      "\"As prosecutors, our duty is to seek justice and ensure that all legal proceedings are conducted transparently, accurately, and fairly,\" Bates said. \"I did not make this decision lightly, but it is necessary to preserve the credibility of our office and maintain public trust in the justice system.\"",
      "Syed, now 43, was back in court Wednesday morning for a hearing where a judge will consider a reduced sentence. He was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years after being convicted of killing his high school ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, in 1999.",
      "The case became famous when it was featured on the first season of the \"Serial\" podcast in 2014.",
      "Bates told \"NBC Nightly News\" in an exclusive interview Wednesday that he did not base his decision on whether Syed was guilty or not.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I would say is that we stand behind the jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d he said, noting that based on the evidence, he would \"no doubt\" bring the case against Syed again today.",
      "Syed was freed in October 2022 after a Baltimore judge vacated the conviction at the urging of prosecutors. But that conviction was reinstated by the state appeals court over problems with notifying Lee's family of the hearing. Since then, Syed's attorneys have been trying to get the conviction overturned and are also seeking to have the sentence reduced.",
      "\u201cThere is no need to guess whether Mr. Syed can lead a law-abiding life because he has been doing just that for over two years,\u201d Syed\u2019s attorneys wrote in a motion seeking a reduction of sentence.",
      "Read more on this story at\u00a0NBCNews.com\u00a0and watch \u201cNBC Nightly News with Lester Holt\u201d tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT.",
      "Witnesses speak out ahead of judge\u2019s decision",
      "Yusuf Syed told the court that his brother always supported him and believed in him.",
      "\"He was always there,\"  he said, fighting back tears. \"He taught me to keep going. If there is anything that I accomplished in my life it's because he was supporting me.\"",
      "Other witnesses said Syed was devoted to his family, did his best to help others and never got in trouble in prison.",
      "\"He\u2019s one of the most important people to me,\" said Eric Simmons, who was incarcerated with Syed. \"He\u2019s like a brother to me.\"",
      "Willie Hamilton, who also met Syed while they were incarcerated, recalled how he guided him.",
      "\"It was never like a student and teacher, it was like a friend giving you advice,\" he told the court.",
      "Dr. Anita Boss, a Virginia-based psychologist, did a risk assessment for Syed and said he was connected to family and devoted to religion.",
      "Lee\u2019s family opposes a reduction in sentence. Her brother, Young Lee, said her death devastated him and caused him to become closed off.",
      "\"Syed took away my ability to be an uncle,\" he said through tears. \"I always dreamed of being an uncle to her kids, and spoil them. I don\u2019t have a chance to see my sister walk down the aisle. He took that away from me.\"",
      "Attorney David Sanford, who represents the family, said Lee\u2019s murder caused a lot of pain. He asked the court to tune out any outside noise while making its decision.",
      "Youn Wha Kim, Lee\u2019s mother, recalled how her world collapsed when her daughter was killed.",
      "\"I was living in a prison without bars while Syed was living in a prison with bars,\" she said in a statement read by a translator. \"I had no will to live.\"",
      "Syed and Lee had turbulent relationship before her death",
      "Syed and Lee both attended Woodlawn High School and had dated, broken up, reunited and broken up again in a relationship an appeals court described as turbulent.",
      "Lee disappeared on Jan. 13, 1999, and her strangled body was found buried in a shallow grave in a Baltimore park the following month.",
      "Syed was arrested and charged in her killing. A first trial ended in a mistrial, but in a second in 2000 a jury convicted Syed of first-degree murder, kidnapping, robbery and false imprisonment.",
      "Advocates for Syed argued that the evidence used to convict him was unreliable and that police ignored leads pointing to other potential suspects.",
      "There\u2019s been a long history of court decisions in the case.",
      "A circuit judge overturned Syed's conviction in 2016 and ordered a new trial, but the state\u2019s appeals court reinstated the conviction in 2019.",
      "In October 2022, a judge vacated Syed's conviction for a second time, and Baltimore City State Attorney Marilyn Mosby said she was dropping the charges against him. Mosby, who lost re-election that year, said at the time that new DNA evidence supported his innocence.",
      "Maryland\u2019s appeals court in March 2023 reinstated the conviction, ruling that officials failed to provide sufficient notice for Lee\u2019s family to attend the hearing. Syed was allowed to remain free as more proceedings were held.",
      "An attorney for Mosby on Tuesday said that Mosby stands by the work of her office."

      "Abu Obaida, a spokesperson for Hamas\u2019 military wing Al Qassam Brigades, told NBC News that Hamas will release the bodies according to the terms of the ceasefire deal it brokered with Israel on Jan. 19.",
      "The four bodies are expected to be the final Israeli hostages released as part of the first phase of the five-week-old ceasefire, with 29 hostages returned so far out of an agreed 33. Israeli and Hamas negotiators have yet to begin talks regarding the ceasefire's second phase.",

      "Around 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were supposed to be handed over late last week but weren't. The Hamas Prisoners' Media Office said that 590 to 594 prisoners from Gaza were expected to be released Wednesday night. The Israeli government have yet to confirm that figure.",

      "Loke told reporters that Ocean Infinity was \u201cconfident that the current search area is more credible, as they have previously covered a large area and believe this is the area that was missed in past searches,\u201d The Malay Mail reported.",
      "\u201cThey are confident this area will yield a positive result, and they are ready to take the risk and resume the search,\u201d Loke said. \u201cThat is why the Malaysian government is proceeding with it.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Ocean Infinity said Wednesday that the company \u201cdoes not have any information to provide at this stage.\u201d",
      "According to the ship tracking website MarineTraffic, the Ocean Infinity ship Armada 78 06 was in the southern Indian Ocean as of Feb. 23.",
      "The Boeing 777 plane disappeared in one of the most remote parts of the world, and experts say it could be miles underwater. Early searches focused on the South China Sea, the Strait of Malacca and the Andaman Sea before being expanded to the Indian Ocean southwest of Australia.",
      "Despite a search spanning hundreds of thousands of square miles that was the largest in aviation history, nothing has ever been found of the plane aside from about two dozen pieces of debris that washed ashore on the East African coast and islands in the Indian Ocean.",
      "The cause of the crash remains unknown, with theories including mechanical failure, hijacking or the plane being deliberately taken off course by its pilots.",
      "Families of those on the plane, more than 150 of whom were Chinese citizens, have pressed for a renewed search.",
      "Loke said he hoped the new effort by Ocean Infinity would provide answers \u201cnot only for the families but also for the aviation industry as a whole, because this is the biggest mystery in the history of aviation.\u201d"

      "Texas state regulators are investigating a medical school\u2019s failure to notify surviving family members before cutting up and leasing out the bodies of their loved ones.",
      "The Texas Funeral Service Commission notified the University of North Texas Health Science Center on Oct. 18 that it was opening an investigation into the center\u2019s body donation program, according to a letter obtained by reporters this week through a public records request.",
      "The notice of complaint was issued one month after NBC News published an investigation revealing that the Fort Worth-based center had dissected, studied and leased out hundreds of unclaimed bodies without prior consent from the dead or any survivors.",
      "The center\u2019s failure to obtain permission from next of kin before using corpses for medical research \u2014 and its refusal to immediately release remains to survivors who came forward later \u2014 may have violated state law, Funeral Service Commission investigator Rudy Villarreal wrote in the letter addressed to the Health Science Center\u2019s president, Sylvia Trent-Adams, who has since resigned. Villarreal also alleged that the center failed to get permission from regulators before shipping bodies and body parts across state lines.",
      "The Funeral Service Commission, which regulates body donation in the state, has the power to issue fines against programs for violations. In a statement Wednesday, the agency confirmed the investigation is ongoing.",
      "Health Science Center spokesperson Andy North said the center has been \u201cworking diligently to ensure a complete and accurate production\u201d of documents requested as part of the probe.",
      "The Funeral Service Commission investigation is part of a cascade of changes and official actions triggered by NBC News\u2019 reporting. The news organization discovered dozens of families who said they would have claimed their loved ones\u2019 bodies and given them proper funerals if they had been told about their deaths. Some were still searching for their relatives, unaware that they had died. The dead included military veterans, people who struggled with drug addiction and homelessness, and a young murder victim.",
      "The Health Science Center shipped many of the bodies and body parts to out-of-state medical schools, device makers and health care education companies \u2014 charging $649 for a head, $900 for a torso, $703 for a pair of legs.",
      "In response to the reporters\u2019 findings, the Health Science Center announced in September that it was suspending its body donation program, firing the officials who led it and hiring a consultant to review the program\u2019s operations. North issued a statement last fall apologizing to the affected families.",
      "Dallas and Tarrant counties\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which had provided the Health Science Center with more than 2,300 unclaimed bodies under contracts dating back to 2019\u00a0\u2014\u00a0ended their agreements with the center.

And last week, a Texas state senator introduced a bill to ban the use of unclaimed bodies without consent.",
      "In its October letter, the Funeral Service Commission asked the Health Science Center to turn over documents related to the operation of its body donation program and set a 15-day deadline to comply. North said the Health Science Center was later granted a 45-day extension and has been providing records on a monthly rolling basis.",
      "So far, the center has turned over more than 1,800 documents, a Funeral Service Commission official said.",
      "Separately, the commission sent the Health Science Center a cease-and-desist letter in November ordering it to end its practice of disposing of corpses by liquefying them through a process commonly referred to as water cremation, which the commission said is illegal in Texas.",
      "In its official response to the commission, sent Dec. 4, the Health Science Center defended its use of water cremations, which are formally known as alkaline hydrolysis, but said it had already halted the practice in September."

In true soap opera fashion, the story behind Bill\u2019s upcoming nuptials is quite scandalous.",
      "As it turns out, Bill cheated on Dani with their daughter Naomi\u2019s (Arielle Prepetit) best friend, Hayley (Marquita Goings). The pair hit it off, leading to the dissolution of Bill and Dani\u2019s marriage.",
      "Like any tight-knit crew, the Duprees stick together and support each other through ups and downs, so the family unites to face this latest challenge together.",
      "From 'Generations' to 'Beyond the Gates'",
      "Before \u201cBeyond the Gates,\u201d a half-hour NBC series called \u201cGenerations\u201d made history as the first soap opera to feature a Black family at the forefront of the show alongside a white family. The show premiered in 1989 and ended in 1991.",
      "Clifton Davis, who plays the Dupree family's patriarch, Vernon, on \u201cBeyond the Gates,\u201d recalls watching a few episodes of \u201cGenerations\u201d to witness his Broadway co-star Jonelle Allen in action on the small screen.",
      "\u201cThat was a half-hour show.\u00a0This is an hour-long show with the primary family being African American.\u00a0That\u2019s a long way to come from \u2018Generations,\u2019\u201d he says.",
      "In the years since \u201cGenerations\u201d ended its two-season run on NBC, African American actors have played critical roles in a plethora of daytime soap operas.",
      "Kristoff St. John, who starred in \u201cGenerations,\u201d went on to build a wildly successful career on \u201cThe Young and the Restless\u201d as the head of the Winters family. He joined a host of Black stars who left their mark on the soap industry, including Debbi Morgan, Shemar Moore, Victoria Rowell, and countless others.",
      "Karla Mosley hadn\u2019t watched \u201cGenerations\u201d until she landed the role of Dani Dupree on \u201cBeyond the Gates.\u201d But when she did, she saw a few familiar faces, including St. John, who she worked with before his death in 2019.",
      "Watching \"Generations\" while preparing for her role in \u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d was inspiring for Mosley, who has appeared in several soap operas throughout her career, including \u201cThe Young and the Restless,\u201d \u201cThe Bold and the Beautiful\u201d and \u201cGuiding Light.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt emboldens and empowers me in my performance today.\u00a0I feel like I\u2019m standing on their shoulders,\u201d she says.",
      "Davis, 79, honed his acting career during a period where roles for Black performers were few and far between.",
      "\u201cWhen I got in television in the early \u201870s, Melvin Moore and I were the first African American couple to host a variety show on network television, so that was historic.\u00a0Trust me, there were no Black faces behind the scenes. It was just us.\u00a0And if there were Black faces, it was because we invited them to be a part of the show,\u201d he recalls.",
      "Looking back on this experience and comparing it to his time filming \u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d thus far, Davis can't help but marvel at how the industry has shifted toward a more inclusive one.",
      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t Black producers. There weren\u2019t Black writers. There weren\u2019t Black cameramen.\u00a0There weren\u2019t Black lighting people. But here we are in another dimension in 2025, where \u2018Beyond the Gates\u2019 has all of the above ...\u00a0I think we\u2019ve come a mighty, mighty, mighty long way, and in my 50 some years of television, this is darn amazing,\" he says.",
      "A new era of daytime TV",
      "When Duplaix auditioned for \u201cBeyond the Gates,\u201d she was excited for the project. But it wasn't until she landed the role of Nicole that she started to realize what the show would mean to her and its future audience.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m laying in bed and I woke up. I\u2019m staring at the ceiling and it just hit me. I was like, \u2018Whoa, this is huge.\u00a0This is groundbreaking,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201c(I suddenly understood) the weight that we\u2019re going to be carrying for everyone.\u00a0And that\u2019s when I got a little nervous.\u201d",
      "Luckily, Duplaix wouldn't have to go it alone. She soon witnessed the extensive support system she'd have on set from her castmates, show creator Michele Val Jean, and executive producers Julie Carruthers and Sheila Ducksworth.",
      "Val Jean previously worked as a writer for \u201cGenerations\u201d and has had a successful career with multiple soap opera writing credits, including \u201cThe Bold and the Beautiful\u201d and \u201cGeneral Hospital.\u201d",
      "In an \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d special titled \u201cBeyond the Gates: Welcome to the Neighborhood,\u201d Ducksworth spoke to the significance of her and Val Jean's partnership on the show.",
      "\u201cWe're the two first Black female executive producers in daytime television for a soap opera,\u201d she said.",
      "The powerhouse producers, who have known each other over 20 years, also gave some insight into how the show came to be. Ducksworth, a longtime soap opera fan, said she\u2019s always wanted to make a soap opera that was \u201creflective of people that I knew.\u201d",
      "\"Sheila said she wanted to make the soap about a family that lived in a gated community, so I just started thinking about characters and how to populate it and who they were and how they connected,\" Val Jean said.",
      "\u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d prioritizes representation in front of the camera, but the series has also made diversity a priority behind the scenes with its crew.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s comforting when you walk into a building and you know people understand you and they understand how to light you and they understand how to do your hair and you don\u2019t have to explain anything,\u201d Duplaix says.",
      "The diversity on set also helps fuel the actors' performances.",
      "\u201cI'm realizing that part of the reason I\u2019m able to play Dani with such freedom and bravery is because I feel so safe in this environment,\u201d Mosley explains.",
      "From writers and wardrobe stylists to makeup artists and hairstylists, each member of the crew is focused on making the show as authentic as possible and making the cast feel comfortable.",
      "\u201c(It\u2019s nice) coming in not having to worry about my hair and\u00a0if someone\u2019s gonna be able to know how to do it or not, not having to worry about my makeup, not having to worry about my clothes ... All of those things are elements that I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d been\u00a0concerned about in the past that I don\u2019t have to think about now and that just makes the job so much easier,\u201d Mosley says.",
      "'Beyond the Gates:' History in the making",
      "While \u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d is making history as the first series of its kind, Duplaix hopes the show\u2019s premiere is also significant for the soap opera industry in general.",
      "\u201cI keep saying, \u2018We\u2019re the first, but I surely hope we\u2019re not the last.\u2019\u00a0We\u2019re not reinventing the soap wheel; we\u2019re just making it better.\u00a0Hopefully, next year there\u2019s another new show and the year after that\u00a0so we can rebuild daytime television,\u201d she says.",
      "Several of the stars of \u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d have extensive experience in the soap opera realm, but joining a show at its inception is a pretty rare feat.",
      "\u201cThe other soaps have been on for decades, so you\u2019re jumping on a moving train.\u00a0We\u2019re at the beginning before the train leaves the station and the kind of impact that you can have in establishing the world is really special, and I\u2019m loving being a part of that,\u201d Tunie says.",
      "When Mosley first heard about \u201cBeyond the Gates,\u201d she thought the series was a no brainer. \u201cAt a time where there\u2019s a lot of division in our country and in our world, this can be a place where there\u2019s both entertainment and joy,\u201d she says.",
      "While discussing the significance of the show, Tunie reflects on the importance of representation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going away and we\u2019re not hiding our light. We\u2019re shining our light brightly, and this show does that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt shines the light very brightly.\u201d",
      "Meet the \u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d Cast",
      "Twenty regular characters will appear on the show, along with additional recurring characters. The four main members of the Dupree family are front and center, with members of their extended family also playing a vital role in the series. Below, get to know the key players.",
      "Who is Vernon Dupree? He's a former senator and the patriarch of the wealthy and accomplished Dupree family. Vernon\u2019s father founded Fairmont Crest, the exclusive gated community in Maryland where his family resides.",
      "Davis on his character: \u201cHe\u2019s humble, even though he\u2019s reached many heights in politics and in society.\u00a0He\u2019s a strong man.\u00a0He doesn\u2019t have to push.\u00a0He doesn\u2019t have to scream and yell,\u201d Davis says.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s a loving, tender father and husband. He\u2019s mad about his wife and he\u2019s mad about his children and his grandchildren and he\u2019ll do anything to protect them.\u201d",

      "What has Vernon taught you about yourself? \"It has taught me that I can still deliver. ... \u00a0That\u2019s all I ever wanted was the work.\u00a0The other stuff is nice.\u00a0It\u2019s extra, though, because the real joy is doing it,\" he says.",
      "Who is Anita Dupree? The matriarch of the Dupree family was once a famous singer and is married to Vernon. She has two daughters, Nicole and Dani, and four grandchildren: Naomi, Chelsea (RhonniRose Mantilla), Martin (Brandon Claybon) and Kat (Colby Muhammad).",
      "Tunie on her character: \u201cShe was a singer and an actor. She\u2019s won some awards. She fell in love with the rising politician and set her career aside in order to support his career and yet that performer is still in there,\u201d Tunie says. \"I saw her as a woman in her sixties who was glamorous, who was sexy, who was vibrant, who was vital, who loved unconditionally, who was all about family.\u00a0She reminded me of my own mother.\u201d",

      "Duplaix on her character: \u201cI actually wanted to be Dani Dupree because I knew she was feisty, fiery and she wore her feelings on the outside. Nicole is the complete opposite: she\u2019s sweet and soft. And I was like, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s boring.\u2019\u00a0But when we got into those first couple of scripts, our writers are so amazing.\u00a0I was like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m gonna have some fun with her.\u2019\u201d she says.",

We don\u2019t land on it, but we brush by a little bit of that history and so it\u2019s not left out,\u201d he says."

    "story": [
      "Glory Edim founded Well Read Black Girl in 2015 with a mission of connectivity. Books, she says, were a tool for \u201chealing and empowerment\u201d in her life.",
      "In Well Read Black Girl, she wanted to create a \u201cliterary home\u201d for other Black women where they could see themselves reflected, honored and uplifted.",
      "\u201cWhether you're a reader or a writer, you can see yourself on the pages of a book in a beautiful reflective way,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are so many other places where Black personhood is not valued, but this space is not that. It's something where it's just carefully considered love and cultivated.\u201d",
      "The club has chosen over 100 books by Black women and built a virtual community of over 400,000 readers.  The club's virtual meetings are a place for readers and writers to \"vent, find solace and mobilize\" \u2014 a type of \"community-driven storytelling,\" she says.",
      "In the nearly 10 years since its founding, Well Read Black Girl has also launched a podcast, newsletter, multiple book festivals and books of its own \u2014 Edim wrote about the books that \u201csaved her\u201d in her memoir, \u201cGather Me\u201d and curated the \u201cWell Read Black Girl\u201d essay series.",

      "\"Gather Me\" by Glory Edim",
      "The project has been five years in the making as Edim transitions from writer and reader to editor. \u201c(Editing) fiction was a learning curve for me \u2013 it was just a different part of my brain. It's been wild but it's been such an incredible experience,\u201d she says.",
      "It's fitting that she's moving into working directly with authors, as Edim has always been mindful of how authors feel when their books are chosen (you can view a full list on their website). Edim says from the beginning, she's been committed to aligning with authors to make sure their story is told they way they want it to be shared.",
      "\u201cBecoming an author is so, so vulnerable and scary. I love that Well Read Black Girl allows a space of comfort \u2014\u00a0but we're also celebrating the rich storytelling tradition of Black culture,\u201d she says.",
      "Below, Edim shares a list she says highlights Black women\u2019s contributions to literature across genres, from memoirs to speculative fiction.",
      "\"Grown Women\" by Sarai Johnson",
      "\u201cSarai Johnson\u2019s debut book is a fresh, fearless take on what it means to be a grown Black woman in today\u2019s world,\u201d Edim says. \u201cIt\u2019s giving wisdom, self-discovery, and sisterhood. I loved her dynamic characters and the way she illustrates how complicated, sophisticated Black women navigate adulthood.\u201d",
      "\"Black in Blues\" by Imani Perry",
      "\u201cScholar Imani Perry is a brilliant storyteller and cultural critic. 'Black in Blues' offers a historical analysis of Black identity through the lens of color. She examines how the color blue beautifully reflects the Black lived experience in America,\u201d Edim says.",
      "\"The Catch\" by Yrsa Daley-Ward",
      "\u201cYrsa Daley-Ward is back with another gut-punch of a book, and this time, it's an intoxicating story about love, longing, and self-discovery. If you love messy, complicated, deliciously emotional stories, this one\u2019s calling your name,\u201d Edim says.",
      "\"Beloved\" by Toni Morrison",
      "\u201cThe essential classic. Morrison\u2019s masterpiece is haunting, poetic, and unforgettable. I constantly recommend this title to anyone interested in understanding Morrison\u2019s profound literary legacy,\u201d Edim says.",
      "\"We Refuse\" by Kellie Carter Jackson",
      "\u201cThis book brings the fire and will spark your inner activist! It reclaims Black resistance as an act of love and power \u2014 perfect for understanding the complexity and nuance of Black activist movements,\u201d Edim says.",
      "\"Men We Reaped\" by Jesmyn Ward",
      "\u201cA gut-wrenching, beautiful memoir about grief and survival. Jesmyn Ward tells the stories of five young Black men \u2014 friends, family, and community members \u2014 who died too soon in her hometown in Mississippi, including her own beloved brother. It\u2019s heartbreaking but also beautifully written. Her writing will stay with you long after you turn the last page,\u201d Edim says.",
      "\"Unbound\" by Tarana Burke",
      "\u201cWe all know Tarana Burke as the powerhouse behind the #MeToo movement, but 'Unbound' is her story \u2014 raw, real, and deeply moving. She takes us through her own journey of survival and activism, showing how her personal experiences shaped the movement that changed the world. This isn\u2019t just a book about a hashtag; it\u2019s about resilience and the power of speaking your truth,\u201d Edim says.",
      "\"Seven Days in June\" by Tia Williams",
      "\u201cOver the course of seven days, Eva and Shane confront their painful past, revealing the deep love, trauma, and misunderstandings that shaped their complex lives. As they navigate their second chance at love, they must decide whether they can overcome their past wounds and truly be together. Who says Black History Month can\u2019t be sexy and romantic?\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s the beauty of flora and fauna on top, and then the reality of the dirtiness and messiness and complication and death underneath,\u201d star AnnaSophia Robb told TODAY.com ahead of the show's Feb. 23 premiere.",
      "The same contrast applies to the show\u2019s characters. \u201cAll of the characters want to seem like they have their lives together and they\u2019re put together. It\u2019s all about appearances,\u201d Robb said.",
      "Robb plays Alice, one of four friends \u2014 Birdie (Melissa Fumero), Brett (Ben Rappaport) and Catherine (Aja Naomi King) \u2014 tied together not only as members of a garden club, but by a dark secret: They buried a body.",
      "Like \"The White Lotus,\" the identity of the body isn't clear and it seems like there are plenty of twists and turns coming up before the truth is discovered. Here's what Robb says about what is in store.",
      "Who is killed in 'The Grosse Point Garden Society', according to Robb?",
      "The pilot begins with Alice, Birdie, Brett and Catherine burying a dead body.",
      "The premiere flashes back and forth in intervals of six months, showing the lead-up to this crime. We don't know who is buried, but we do know that the body was wrapped in a white and blue quilt with a large blood stain and was wearing New Balance sneakers.",
      "Robb told TODAY.com that viewers won't know the body's identity for a while. In fact, she \u201cjust found out recently\u201d herself.",
      "\u201cAll the crew was placing bets \u2014 we were all guessing,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cUp until reading that episode of who dies, we didn\u2019t know. All of us had our theories, but then it could be like five different people, so it was kind of a fun game.\u201d",
      "One episode in, there are plenty of options for the victim. Everyone in the gang seems to have made at least one \u2014 if not multiple \u2014 enemies.",
      "Robb says the four leads decided to mentally cast who they believed the body was from the beginning, just to keep their acting choices consistent. She's still keeping her guess a \u201ctop secret,\u201d but it was a \u201cfun mystery\u201d to not know.",
      "\u201cI think when you\u2019re so close to a project and you still don\u2019t know what happens, that\u2019s part of what makes the writing so good,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018If I know more details than everybody else and I still don\u2019t know who it is,\u2019 this is a fun show.\u201d",
      "She hopes people watch \u2014 and make guesses \u2014 together, just like the cast did.",
      "\u201cI hope it becomes a community-based show,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere you guess with your friends of who dies (and) how did it happen. Because I think it it lends itself to that discussion where you can come up with different theories or backstories for the characters.\u201d",
      "Getting into the mindset of Alice",
      "Robb made her official acting debut when she was 10 years old. She went on to turn violet as Violet Beauregarde in \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory,\u201d bring viewers to tears in \u201cBridge to Terabithia,\u201d fight through loss in \u201cSoul Surfer\u201d and channel a deep love for shoes in \u201cThe Carrie Diaries.\u201d",
      "The 31-year-old jokes that she was so excited to get the script for \"The Grosse Point Garden Society\" and find out she wasn\u2019t playing a high schooler this time. Instead, she takes on the mantle of a high school teacher.",
      "\u201cI was on set and all of the kids either looked older than me or were taller than me,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Dang, I need an apple box to raise me up.\u2019\u201d",
      "To prepare for the role, she says she crafted a character journal so she could chart Alice\u2019s backstory, get a feel for her motivations and relationships and understand where she wants to go.",
      "Robb thinks she and her character are in \"very similar life places,\" allowing her to draw some inspiration from reality.",
      "\u201cShe envisions herself living a different life, and she doesn\u2019t know how to go from here to there,\u201d Robb says. \u201cI think a lot of people our age feel that way, where you\u2019re meeting the reality of life, what you always dreamed and then what your decisions have led you to, and the frustration with yourself and with your life.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s where she\u2019s at,\u201d she continues. \u201cShe\u2019s married and her marriage is going through a bit of a rough patch. She\u2019s also getting a lot of pressure from her mother-in-law ... to have a family that she doesn\u2019t necessarily feel ready to have.\u201d",
      "Robb says that she thinks Alice\u2019s struggles will resonate with viewers watching.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of young women will probably identify with her, in terms of wanting to fulfill their dreams and their career and their aspirations and their goals but knowing that that might not be possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo you bet on yourself, or do you go with the safe choice,\u201d she continues. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of where she finds herself.\u201d",
      "Robb says she's grown up with her audience. The people who watched her in kids' movies are now all grown up.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in that same place now,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re probably getting married. They\u2019re probably thinking about having kids and how much of an existential crisis it feels like.\u201d",
      "Her character may be dealing with big problems \u2013 but set was nothing but fun, Robb says. She recalls a dinner she had with co-stars Fumero, Rappaport and King.",
      "\u201cWe just took a collective deep breath, and we started laughing because we just all really trust each other and have a really good relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just it feels like a really safe environment. When you\u2019re doing a show for six months with people, it is just so important to have that camaraderie and chemistry.\u201d"

    "summary": "Do the White Lotus opening credits art predict the characters' fates? An art historian thinks so and reads into what it all means.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \"The White Lotus\" Season Three.",
      "The opening credits of \"The White Lotus\" Season 3 might give away more information than just the cast and crew's names. Fans think the art has clues into the characters\u2019 fates \u2014 and some of the actors this season do, too.",
      "Jason Isaacs, who plays father of three and businessman Timothy Ratliff in the third season of the hit HBO show, brought up the meaning behind the opening credits this season in an interview with some of his castmates aired on TODAY on Feb. 12.",
      "\"Someone said to Patrick (Schwarzenegger) and I the other day that during the credits when each individual name comes up, did you notice that the drawing behind it means something about their character?\" Isaacs asked.",
      "Sarah Catherine Hook, who plays Tim's middle child Piper in the show, said the illustration accompanying her name directly corresponded with her character.",
      "\"Mine was meditating,\" Hook said. \"I was like, 'That's Piper.'\"",
      "Isaacs started laughing and replied, \"We didn't notice any of this at all.\"",
      "While the cast of the \"White Lotus\" are aware of what the illustrations could mean (or could not mean), fans have began posting their own theories on social media.",
      "One TikTok, which has more than 350,000 views, offered five minutes of analysis of the opening credits, from character illustrations to how Season Three's credits could connect to the credits (and plot lines) from Season One.",
      "Kelly Cahn, an art advisor, curator and appraiser, shared more insights about the opening credits in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "\"I feel like they're literally showing us the entire thing in advance,\" Cahn said of the opening images.",
      "The 'White Lotus' Season 3 credits, analyzed by an art expert",
      "The paintings shown in the opening credits are inspired by Thai mural paintings, which can be found in temples and royal palaces in Thailand, Cahn said.",
      "She noted that several paintings throughout the credits, including the one featured in the first few seconds, appear to be on top of panel that is behind the ones that are visible, meaning we might not be seeing the full, bigger picture.",
      "\"Like, there's some story that's a cover up or something,\" Cahn said.",
      "The first actor's name to appear is Leslie Bibb. The letters are surrounded by an illustration of several elephants \u2014 creatures known for having a remarkable memory.",
      "Cahn said at first she saw three elephants \u2014 which could correspond to the trio Bibb's character is with on the trip \u2014 but then could potentially see four, possibly hinting at more to come for their group.",
      "The illustration for Carrie Coon, who plays another one of the three women on vacation together, also features an elephant, though it's surrounded by a pack of animals as two winged creatures look on from above.",
      "\"There's almost a sense of you're being watched,\" Cahn says of the painting. \"Are these things that can fly away and report back? Again, it feels like an attack. Lying in wait, watching.\"",
      "Walton Goggins is the next name to appear after imagery of a palace or temple. His illustration shows a man sitting in a tower looking down below, which Cahn said could hint at his surveillance of the owners of the hotel.",
      "As Hook said on TODAY, her name is shown with a woman who appears to be meditating on a hill, and her character Piper is a Buddhist.",
      "Before Isaacs' name is alongside a man hiding in a tree (\"perhaps from the incriminating press,\" Cahn said). Above him in the tree are hanging knives or swords \u2014 which could be a sign of incoming danger for the father of three, Cahn said.",
      "And in Episode 2, Tim's business partner Kenny (voiced by Ke Huy Quan) tells him that the feds have raided his office. Kenny then warns Tim that they have everything on their business dealings in Brunei, which Tim implies could be tied to money laundering.",
      "The image for Blackpink singer Lalisa Manobal, who plays Mook, seems to show a woman holding an umbrella and flirting with a man, Cahn said.",
      "\"In the first episode, she is trying to convince her partner to go after more lucrative bodyguard positions that would enable them to travel,\" Cahn noted of Mook.",
      "Michelle Monaghan, who plays the third woman vacationing in Thailand with her two best friends, has a topless woman on a balcony in the image alongside her name.",
      "Sam Nivola, who plays one of Tim\u2019s sons Lochlan, shared on TODAY that the illustration beside his name is just a boy lying down \u2014 but he did give the show\u2019s creator Mike White some room for interpretation with the opening credits.",
      "\u201cWhat if he\u2019s just like, screwing with us all?\u201d Nivola asked.",
      "Cahn analyzed the painting as a boy in his underwear floating in the water, perhaps showing a direct line to who could end up dead in the water at the end of the series.",
      "But as Nivola himself said on TODAY, it all could be a red herring as well.",
      "Lek Patravadi, who plays the owner of the hotel, is shown with a woman seated in a lotus position holding a bird with a human head in her hand, Cahn said.",
      "Parker Posey's image shows two monkeys sitting together, one of which is blowing smoke, which Cahn said could allude to the Southern mom's dependence on prescription drugs.",
      "After Posey's name, the credits cut to an alligator looking in the distance, and then pans over to a heron or crane looking at its reflection in the water.",
      "Natasha Rothwell's name pops up, which Cahn said could relate to the myth of Narcissus, or even her ability to see Gary as Greg.",
      "\"Or perhaps it deals with the self-reflection she will be undertaking during her 3 months in Thailand,\" Cahn said.",
      "Two men appear to be peeping watching a topless woman (a possible reference to the image from Monaghan's name, Cahn noted) from afar in some trees in the next section \u2014 as Patrick Schwarzenegger's name comes up.",
      "\"Patrick Schwarzenegger is clearly, like, the guy that would be leering through the bushes,\" Cahn said, referring to his character Saxon. \"I feel like he instantly tries to hit on (women), and they're like, 'What?' ... it feels like this kind of peeping Tom energy.\"",
      "Tayme Thapthimthong, who plays the hotel's bodyguard Gaitok, has a man fighting a tiger alongside his name, while a cow or ram watches from above, Cahn said.",
      "A large cat has attacked another animal alongside Aimee Lou Wood's name, while two other animals look on and watch. Cahn questioned if Wood's character Chelsea is the attacked animal \u2014 or if she could be the feline itself.",
      "Wood\u2019s name is the last cast member\u2019s name to be shown before members of the crew. A large group of monkeys are seen traveling together, with one monkey pointing the way, as the casting director Meredith Tucker\u2019s name is shown.",
      "Two monkeys appear to be crawling up a tower as the Thailand casting director Non Jungmeier's name is shown, and four people are at the top of the tower as costume designer Alex Boivard's name comes into the frame. One person is holding a snake towards the monkeys, Cahn noted.",
      "The next few scenes show what could be an attack on a place, before a boat appears to capsize, and some of the crew are eaten by large fish, Cahn said.",
      "The last image is of a man paddling on a log while another fish looks on, as White's name is credited as creating the series.",
      "The credits end with an ornate red temple with a Buddha in the middle, which Cahn said could be an allusion to the hotel owner's husband.",
      "Whether Lochlan ends up floating the water, or if the tree of knives falls on Timothy, still remains to be seen. But the theories as to who dies at the end of Season 3 of \"The White Lotus\" are just getting started.",
      "And if \"The White Lotus\" has taught us anything, it\u2019s that we should analyze everything \u2014 from the\u00a0Testa di Moro statues to the art on the walls."

      "\u201cFor us, we\u2019re looking at what happens to the world inside of Paradise? The people who prepared for it, who knew that it was coming, how do they manage the situation? How do people manage the situation that had no idea what was coming and are forced to live without any sort of infrastructure?\u201d Brown says.",

      "\u201cThat is something that, if and when we get picked up for Season 2, we will be exploring,\u201d he says. \u201cI can tell you that much, but I think the main exploration and the main question will be, is his wife really alive? That will be a propelling, sort of, drive to Season 2.\u201d",

      "However Zelenskyy said the deal would fail if it did not adequately provide for Ukraine\u2019s future security against Russia \u2014 and only looked after American interests.",
      "\u201cIf I see and hear a broader vision from him [President Donald Trump] \u2014 one that aligns with our concept of a just peace for Ukraine \u2014 then this agreement can be part of broader security guarantees,\" Zelenskyy told a news conference.",
      "Whereas his prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, appeared to offer concrete details at an earlier news conference of how the agreement would be signed and implemented, Zelenskyy was far less equivocal in his account of events.",
      "\"This agreement could be a major success, or it could pass quietly,\" he said. \"The key factor will be my conversation with President Trump,\" which Trump said is set for Friday, though Zelenskyy indicated that no final decision about timing had been made. Zelenskyy also said he had \u201cnot yet seen the full, final version\u201d but would be reviewing it soon.",
      "Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House later Wednesday that Zelenskyy would be traveling to the U.S. on Friday, adding that the two would sign \u201ca very big agreement.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian president also gave a far more measured view than that of a senior White House official involved in negotiations, who told NBC News late Tuesday that the agreement was \"at the 99 yard line with one inch to go.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday morning that negotiators were \"very close to the finish line,\" and said, \"We expect the deal to be signed this week.\"",
      "\"And as President Trump said yesterday, if Zelenskyy wants to come to this White House to sign that deal, he is open to that,\" she added.",
      "Speaking about the deal and security guarantees for Ukraine, Trump said at his Cabinet meeting Wednesday, \"I\u2019m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much. We\u2019re going to have Europe do that ... Europe is the next-door neighbor, but we\u2019re going to make sure everything goes well. And as you know ... we\u2019ll be really partnering with Ukraine, [in] terms of rare earth. We very much need rare earth. They have great rare earth.\"",
      "Relations between Ukraine and its American benefactor have soured over the past week. Trump sparked outrage in Ukraine and Europe by suggesting that Ukraine should use its mineral wealth to pay back the U.S. for military aid delivered during the war.",
      "When Zelenskyy outright rejected the suggestion, Trump falsely called him a \"dictator\" and repeated the false claim that Ukraine was responsible for being invaded by Russia.",
      "The deal detailed by Zelenskyy and his administration Wednesday appeared to find compromise on some of the disagreements, but also left much up in the air.",
      "The U.S. and Ukraine have outlined their intention to establish an investment fund, drawing money from as-yet untapped seams of Ukraine's wealth of rare earth minerals. Both countries would then use this fund to invest in Ukraine's reconstruction and security, Shmyhal said in an earlier address.",
      "However, Zelenskyy said that the exact nature of these security guarantees \u2014 the central priority for Ukraine \u2014 were still unclear.",
      "\"Although this agreement is economic, I strongly advocated for at least some mention of security guarantees for Ukraine,\" he said. \"Government officials briefed me that security guarantees were included in the agreement in some form, but I don\u2019t yet have full details.\"",
      "Another key point for Zelenskyy is that Ukraine's critical and rare earth minerals will not be used to pay back the U.S. for military and humanitarian assistance provided so far. The fund would only include new mineral deposit licenses, rather than existing operations, and all profits would be split evenly, the Ukrainian president said.",
      "Trump has repeatedly criticized the multibillion-dollar assistance given to Kyiv under then-President Joe Biden. He says these costs should be underwritten by European powers, on whose doorstep the conflict sits.",
      "Trump has said he'll resolve within 24 hours Russia's three-year-old full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The president and his aides since extended this timeline to six months. The senior administration official said Tuesday that a peace deal was 30-60 days away, without elaborating on how this ambitious timeline would be achieved.",
      "Trump said Wednesday at the White House that peace between the two countries was not guaranteed. \"You have a lot of confidence in us because you assume there's going to be peace. You know, it's possible it doesn't work out,\" he said. \"There is a possibility, but I hope it does for the sake of humanity.\"",
      "Ukraine has for months supported the idea of giving Trump access to its wealth of critical rare earth elements, which are used for everything from green technology to modern weaponry. Zelenskyy hoped this would incentivize the White House to continue supporting Kyiv with military aid, something Trump has questioned in the past.",
      "In a likely appeal to Trump\u2019s transactional deal-maker spirit, Russia simultaneously proposed an agreement under which the U.S. would gain some ownership of rare earth minerals and other valuable metals in parts of Ukraine controlled by the Russian military, according to two American officials familiar with intelligence on the matter and another person briefed on the proposal.",
      "Russian and American officials are expected to hold a technical-level meeting on Thursday in Istanbul, according to the Turkish Communications Directorate.",

      "The Israeli government delayed their release, set for last Saturday, after forensic testing revealed that a casket handed over by Hamas bearing the image of Shiri Bibas, 32, did not contain her body.",
      "Bibas was laid to rest on Wednesday along with her two young sons, who\u00a0were 4 years old and just shy of 9 months old when they were taken hostage by Hamas during\u00a0the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.\u00a0Oded Lifshitz, the fourth body handed over last week by Hamas, was 84 when he died, and he was buried on Tuesday.",
      "Around 250 hostages were taken on Oct. 7 and around 1,200 Israelis were killed, Israeli officials say. The attacks sparked the almost year-and-a-half war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas that has killed more than 48,300 people in the enclave, Hamas-run health authorities say.",
      "With the handover due to happen at night, Hamas looks set to avoid a repeat of the scenes of previous handovers. Last week, caskets it said contained four deceased Israeli hostages were paraded on a stage against a backdrop of propaganda slogans.",
      "The ceremony was widely condemned by human rights groups and the international community.",
      "Shlomo Mantzur, one of the four deceased hostages to be handed over Wednesday, was the oldest of all the people kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7.",
      "Mantzur, who as 85, was seized at gunpoint from his home on kibbutz Kisufim. His family had remained hopeful that he had survived, but the Israeli army said earlier this month that he had been killed on Oct. 7 and his body taken to Gaza.",
      "Mantzur immigrated to Israel from Iraq at age 13, after surviving the 1941 pogrom against the Jewish community in Baghdad, known as the Farhud, in which 200 people were killed.",
      "A father of five and one of the founders of the kibbutz Kisufim, Mantzur ran his own carpentry and clock-repair workshop.",
      "Tsachi Idan was seized from his home in kibbutz Nahal Oz after Palestinians held his family at gunpoint and killed the oldest of his three children, 18-year-old Maayan.",
      "After using the family home as an organization point, Hamas gunmen left his wife, Gali, and their two other children, Yael, then 11, and son, Shahar, then 9, behind. Yael told Israel's Channel 12 last year that the gunmen had promised that her father would return.",
      "From the testimony of returning hostages, the family knew that Idan was initially alive when brought into Gaza.",
      "Itzhak Elgarat was the handyman at kibbutz Nir Oz \u2014 the kibbutz that saw many killed and taken hostage, including the Bibas family.",
      "A dual Israeli-Danish citizen, Elgarat was seized from a safe room in his house while on the phone to his brother Dani.",
      "Speaking last year to Australian website Quillette, Dani said he heard Itzhak say, \u201cDani, this is the end.\u201d A location marker from his phone later showed that he was in Gaza.",
      "Dani said that hostages released in November 2023 had told him that his brother was alive.",
      "Ohad Yahalomi was wounded and kidnapped also at kibbitz Nir Oz, as he guarded his family's safe room.",
      "His wife and their three children \u2014\u00a0aged 12 and 10 and a third who was a toddler \u2014were seized and placed on motorcycles.",
      "While their son Eitan, 12, was taken alone into Gaza and released in November 2023, the mother and her two daughters managed to escape, hiding in the fields around their kibbutz until they could return home."

      "\"Let\u2019s unite in praying for the healing of Pope Francis,\" Yusuf Asad, a priest of the Holy Family parish, wrote in a post on Facebook early Tuesday as he offered a prayer for the 88-year-old pope's recovery, as he has done each day since Francis was admitted to the hospital Feb. 14.",
      "News of Francis' condition has sent shock waves through this small community in the Gaza Strip, with the Holy Family parish's prayers for him highlighting the deep bond formed between the pontiff and the Palestinian church throughout the devastating war.",

      "When Francis was diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs, it was unclear whether he would be able to continue the tradition as he received care.",

      "At the end of a general audience on Jan. 22, Francis described the cautious optimism that leaders of the parish expressed after the current ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re happy. They ate lentils,\" Francis said at the time, according to Vatican News, adding: \"We must pray for peace.\"",

      "\u201cThey want to thank you, Holy Father. They pray for you because you always pray for them,\u201d Yusuf told the pope, according to Vatican News.",
      "Francis has been outspoken in condemning the violence unfolding in Gaza over the past 16 months, with more than 48,000 people, including thousands of children, killed since Israel launched its offensive in the territory, according to local health authorities.",
      "Last month, Francis stepped up criticisms of Israel's military campaign, calling the humanitarian situation in Gaza \"very serious and shameful\" in a yearly address to diplomats delivered on his behalf by an aide.",
      "The pontiff was also outspoken in his criticism of an incident that unfolded at the Holy Family parish in December 2023, when a mother and her adult daughter were shot dead while walking inside the grounds of the parish, according to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem.",
      "Israel at the time denied responsibility for the incident, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office saying that according to an Israel Defense Forces investigation, claims that Israel was responsible for their deaths were \"not true.\"",

    "story": [
      "A woman may have signed her name on the world's oldest dated runestone, researchers in Norway have found, as they piece together the 2,000-year-old puzzle.",
      "The inscription begins with the word \u201cI\u201d in runic script, followed by the name of the writer and a verb that indicates writing, before ending with the word \u201crune,\u201d researchers wrote earlier this month in the journal Antiquity after studying a fragment of the stone found at a grave site in Hole, a small municipality in southern Norway to the east of the capital, Oslo.",
      "\u201cBasically the text would be saying, I, the rune inscriber\u2019s name, wrote the runic inscription,\u201d one of the study\u2019s co-authors, Kristel Zilmer, told NBC News in telephone interview Monday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a type of inscription also that has parallels in some other romantic inscriptions, basically somebody telling us that they made this inscription,\u201d added Zilmer, a professor of runology at the University of Oslo\u2019s Museum of Cultural History.",
      "The researchers said they believed the Germanic alphabetic script was inspired by the Roman alphabet, of which runes formed the foundational blocks in the first A.D. centuries. It was widely used in Scandinavia up until the late Middle Ages.",
      "Runic inscriptions have been found on objects such as a bone knife and iron knife from Denmark and a comb, which archeologists have dated to around 150 A.D. Those found on other runestones date to around 700 A.D.",
      "Often they bore messages, including spells to bring back the dead and charm words.",
      "But very little is known about their development as it varied over time and deciphering them can be challenging without archaeological context.",
      "The latest research suggests the fragments, the first of which was discovered in 2021, were part of a single slab. The discovery also brings scientists one step closer to understanding the language\u2019s evolution and the use of such stones, the researchers said.",
      "Two years later, researchers found more fragments and the script on them appeared to continue across the fragments, indicating they were all part of a single stone.",
      "\u201cThey managed to find two extra pieces, and they fit perfectly within the middle part of one of the inscriptions, and gave us almost a complete inscription,\u201d Zilmer said.",
      "Due to the damage and the weathering of the stone, she added that determining the exact text, including the name of the inscriber, is a \u201cbit tricky,\u201d but what especially caught the attention of the researchers is a feature in the name that indicates it ended with a \u201c-u.\u201d",
      "In ancient runic script, she said that would indicate a possible woman\u2019s name which, if confirmed, \u201cwould be the earliest known record of a female rune-inscriber.\u201d",
      "Because the fragments found in Hole were buried along with cremated human remains, scientists had the crucial archeological context that allowed them to use radiocarbon dating to confirm the fragments dated between 50 B.C. and 275 A.D.",
      "\u201cWe may have here a series of events unfolding involving different people,\u201d Zilmer said. \u201cIt may be a stone that combines different purposes.\u201d",
      "While much of the research is still ongoing, \u201cwe are still missing significant portions, so there are evident gaps,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle with holes, but nonetheless it will be very interesting to see how far we can get, how many of these small fragments, some of these also inscribed, that might be able to connect to each other,\u201d she added."

      "L\u00e9v\u00eaque was 9 years old when her appendix was removed by the surgeon.",
      "\u201cImmediately I knew, voil\u00e0, that\u2019s what happened to me,\u201d L\u00e9v\u00eaque told AFP. \u201cThis explained so many strange things in my life, like my phobia of hospitals, my eating disorders \u2026 a life suspended since my operation.\u201d",
      "L\u00e9v\u00eaque is set to testify at France\u2019s largest-ever child sex abuse trial, which opens Monday in Vannes, a picturesque town in coastal Brittany. Former surgeon Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, 74, is charged with raping or sexually assaulting 299 victims over three decades, most of them girls and boys under 15 whose average age was 11.",
      "Many victims have said they don\u2019t remember being assaulted and experienced similar symptoms to L\u00e9v\u00eaque\u2019s, their lawyers said. Others suffered sexual dysfunction and fell into substance abuse. When police, taking names from Le Scouarnec\u2019s writings, sought them out and showed them the passages written about them, those revelations triggered physical and psychological reactions of varying degrees, the lawyers added. Two men, both 25, died by suicide in 2020 and 2021.",
      "The case, which includes a dark history of incest, has raised questions about how a well-respected surgeon who worked in nine hospitals and clinics across five regions in northwest France was allowed to practice when there were so many red flags that legal observers say should have signaled that Le Scouarnec was dangerous, including a 2005 conviction for possessing material depicting child sexual abuse.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s lawyers declined to comment, but prosecutors said he has admitted to many, but not all, of the charges. Unlike in the United States, defendants in France are brought to trial even if they admit guilt.",
      "Victims\u2019 advocates hope the trial, set to last four months, will prompt a hard look at what they call a lax pursuit of child abuse allegations, particularly when doctors \u2014 who are in short supply in many areas \u2014 are accused of misconduct.",
      "\u201cThere were warnings over 30 years,\u201d said Francesca Satta, who is representing 10 victims and families. \u201cThis man benefited from a system that opened the door for him to have his own hunting ground.\u201d",
      "\u2018Pedophile fantasies\u2019",
      "Beyond the medical world, the lines have often blurred in France over what constitutes child abuse versus seduction.\u00a0The once-celebrated writer Gabriel Matzneff, now 88, made having sex with adolescents a staple of his books, even boasting about the practice in an infamous TV interview, until a leading literary publisher, Vanessa Springora, called him out in her own 2020 book for grooming her for sex in the 1980s when she was 14 and he was 50.",
      "It is illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor under the age of 15, though child advocates say many adults are never charged. Earlier this month, in a closely watched case seen as a test of evolving attitudes toward sex with minors, the director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually assaulting actress Ad\u00e8le Haenel, now 35, from the time he cast her in a film when she was 12 and he was 36. He was sentenced to two years of house arrest, with two years suspended.",
      "\u201cL\u2019Affaire Scouarnec\u201d has drawn parallels with another high-profile trial that transfixed the country late last year and led to the conviction of Dominique Pelicot, 72, for organizing and documenting the mass rape of his sleeping wife, whom he drugged, by dozens of men over a decade. He is now under investigation for two other alleged crimes involving drugging: the rape and murder of a young woman in 1991 and the attempted rape of another in 1999.",
      "As in the Pelicot case, investigators discovered a trove of allegedly incriminating evidence on hard drives seized in the suspect\u2019s house, including thousands of photos depicting child sexual abuse and videos, many of them violent, French media reported.",
      "Le Scouarnec allegedly told investigators he was \u201cobsessed and tyrannized\u201d by his \u201cpedophile fantasies\u201d and began keeping a diary, according to court documents. Those digital files date to the early 1980s and include the names of patients and others, including young family members, along with their ages, addresses and a detailed account of what was done to them, the\u00a0documents show.",
      "The assaults tracked in the digital diaries stop in March 2017, when Le Scouarnec was arrested on charges of raping his 6-year-old neighbor after luring her across a gap in the mesh fence between their gardens, according to testimony. In December 2020, he was convicted in that case, along with the rape and sexual assault of two of his nieces when they were children in the 1980s and \u201990s, and a 4-year-old patient.",
      "Le Scouarnec faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, which would run concurrently with the 15 years he is now serving in connection with the 2020 conviction. With his pretrial detention and parole eligibility taken into account, he could be out by 2030, said lawyer Marie Grimaud.",
      "Grimaud, who is representing 37 victims, and other lawyers say the penalties for sex crimes and child abuse should be much more severe.",
      "\u201cIn France, if you rape one person, you rape 300, it\u2019s exactly the same number of years you\u2019re looking at,\u201d she said.",
      "Warning signs",
      "The first people who knew about Le Scouarnec\u2019s behavior were his family. As early as 1984, references to the rapes of a niece and a family friend appear in the surgeon\u2019s diaries, according to court documents. But none of the adults took action, even after the children told them, and the abuse continued, three family members told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis is a man who sees children as sexual objects,\u201d Le Scouarnec\u2019s niece Alexandra, 47, told NBC News. She said her uncle isolated her and then raped her from ages 5 to 13. (NBC News does not name victims\u00a0of sexual assault, but Alexandra has asked that her first name be used.)",
      "She said she will testify at the upcoming trial, along with a family friend who was also one of the first victims mentioned in the diaries, though Le Scouarnec cannot be charged in their cases because the acts happened too long ago under French law.",
      "Some children knew Le Scouarnec\u2019s \u201cexam\u201d was not appropriate, but their parents brushed aside their complaints, said Hugo Lemonier, a journalist who spent three years researching a new book about the case, \u201cTrapped: In the Intimate Diaries of Dr. Le Scouarnec.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we see in this case is the omnipotence of the medical profession,\u201d he said.",
      "French authorities were first alerted in January 2004, when the FBI told them Le Scouarnec\u2019s credit card was linked to a pedophile website the agency was monitoring, court records show. There is no indication that medical authorities were notified as the police carried out their investigation.",
      "At his trial for possession of child sexual abuse material in the fall of 2005, the surgeon was \u201calmost considered a victim,\u201d Lemonier said. Le Scouarnec presented himself as a man \u201cin a moment of great distress,\u201d recounting how his wife had left him, taking their three kids, and in his solitude he \u201cfound a refuge, an escape\u201d in viewing the material, he added.",
      "The surgeon, who specialized in appendectomies and abdominal and gynecological surgery, got a break when the judge imposed a four-month suspended sentence with no restrictions.",
      "\u201cThe judge could have ordered him to stop practicing or seek treatment, but he didn\u2019t,\u201d said Homayra Sellier, founder of the child protection agency Innocence in Danger. \u201cHe should have lost his medical license.\u201d",
      "Another opportunity was missed in June 2006, when a psychiatrist at the hospital where Le Scouarnec worked in Quimperl\u00e9, on the southern coast of Brittany, learned about his conviction and wrote a letter alerting the hospital director, who passed it along to the local medical board and ordered the surgeon to be accompanied whenever he was with minors, according to France Info.",
      "\u2018A nutcase in Brittany\u2019",
      "The local medical board requested a copy of the conviction, but it took the prosecutor\u2019s office five months to send it, which was then forwarded to state authorities, Lemonier said. \u201cAfter that, they washed their hands of it.\u201d",
      "Back at the hospital, the order requiring the surgeon to be shadowed was never carried out, and Le Scouarnec, whose modus operandi was to isolate victims under the guise of examining them, would go on to abuse at least 54 more victims from 2004 to 2017, all of whom are part of the current case, Lemonier said.",
      "Not all of the victims in the diaries have been pursued by investigators, he said, adding that according to his count the total could top 400.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a chain of failures where nobody wanted to take responsibility,\u201d Lemonier said. \u201cThe police, the courts, the medical association, the hospitals, the health authorities and the state are all responsible.\u201d",
      "The hospital director, Andr\u00e9 Labat, died in 2013. The current administration declined to comment when contacted by NBC News, as did all of the boards that could have imposed sanctions or revoked Le Scouarnec\u2019s medical license, including the local and regional medical boards and the regional health agency. The national Health Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The local branch of the national police referred questions to the national police press office, which also did not respond.",
      "\u201cThe French authorities were warned that we had a nutcase in Brittany,\u201d said lawyer Maud Touitou, who represents eight victims. She called local oversight boards \u201cbarons\u201d that \u201crevel in their provincial social status, who have no other goal but to continue to have and exercise their little power.\u201d",
      "In June 2008, Le Scouarnec moved to a hospital in Jonzac, about five hours\u2019 drive south, where he was considered the \u201cwise man\u201d on staff, Le Monde reported. The hospital\u2019s former director, Mich\u00e8le Cals, told police in 2017 that she didn\u2019t take \u201cany special measures\u201d when the surgeon told her about his conviction because there had been \u201cno physical aggression,\u201d according to Radio France, which counted more than 20 victims at the Jonzac hospital. Cals could not be reached for comment, and the Jonzac hospital declined to comment.",
      "\u200b\u200bChildren\u2019s advocates are hoping the trial will prompt sweeping changes beyond tougher laws. They are hoping that the accounts of victims will be given greater credence.",
      "For the victims, who have waited nearly eight years since the investigation began to tell their stories \u2014 some have waited decades \u2014 the trial represents a chance to heal.",
      "\u201cThe only fear they have is that the entire trial will focus on Le Scouarnec,\u201d Grimaud said.",
      "\u201cThey want to be recognized.\u201d",
      "Linda Hervieux reported from Paris, and Gabrielle Nolin from London.",
      "If you are a child being abused, or know a child who may be facing abuse, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at\u00a0(800) 422-4453, or go to\u00a0www.childhelphotline.org.

      "HONG KONG \u2014 A U.S.-based company is resuming the search for the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, almost 11 years after it vanished in one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history.",
      "Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke said Tuesday that the government had given initial approval for Ocean Infinity, a marine robotics company based in Austin, Texas, to resume the search. He said the details of the contract were being finalized, including how long the search would last.",
      "Ocean Infinity conducted a monthslong search in 2018 but found no sign of the plane, which was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members when it veered dramatically off course and disappeared from radar March 8, 2014, shortly after taking off from the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, on an overnight flight to Beijing.",
      "The company says advances in technology have increased the chances of success, and the Malaysian government said in December that it had agreed to another search by Ocean Infinity on a \u201cno find, no fee\u201d basis.",
      "Loke told reporters that Ocean Infinity was \u201cconfident that the current search area is more credible, as they have previously covered a large area and believe this is the area that was missed in past searches,\u201d The Malay Mail reported.",
      "\u201cThey are confident this area will yield a positive result, and they are ready to take the risk and resume the search,\u201d Loke said. \u201cThat is why the Malaysian government is proceeding with it.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Ocean Infinity said Wednesday that the company \u201cdoes not have any information to provide at this stage.\u201d",
      "According to the ship tracking website MarineTraffic, the Ocean Infinity ship Armada 78 06 was in the southern Indian Ocean as of Feb. 23.",
      "The Boeing 777 plane disappeared in one of the most remote parts of the world, and experts say it could be miles underwater. Early searches focused on the South China Sea, the Strait of Malacca and the Andaman Sea before being expanded to the Indian Ocean southwest of Australia.",
      "Despite a search spanning hundreds of thousands of square miles that was the largest in aviation history, nothing has ever been found of the plane aside from about two dozen pieces of debris that washed ashore on the East African coast and islands in the Indian Ocean.",
      "The cause of the crash remains unknown, with theories including mechanical failure, hijacking or the plane being deliberately taken off course by its pilots.",
      "Families of those on the plane, more than 150 of whom were Chinese citizens, have pressed for a renewed search.",
      "Loke said he hoped the new effort by Ocean Infinity would provide answers \u201cnot only for the families but also for the aviation industry as a whole, because this is the biggest mystery in the history of aviation.\u201d"

      "The country\u2019s fertility rate, the average number of babies a woman is expected to have during her reproductive life, stood at 0.75 in 2024, according to Statistics\u00a0Korea.",
      "In 2023, the birth rate fell for the eighth consecutive year to 0.72,\u00a0the lowest in the world,\u00a0from 1.24 in 2015, raising concerns over the economic shock to society from such a rapid pace.",

      "\u201cThere was a change in social value, with more positive views about marriage and childbirth,\u201d Park Hyun-jung, an official at Statistics\u00a0Korea, told a briefing, also citing\u00a0the impact of a rise in the number of people in their early 30s and pandemic delays.",
      "\u201cIt is difficult to measure how much each factor contributed to the rise in new births, but they themselves had an impact on each other too,\u201d Park said.",
      "Marriages, a leading indicator of new births, jumped 14.9% in 2024, the biggest spike since the data started being released in 1970. Marriages turned up for the first time in 11 years in 2023 with a 1.0% increase powered by a post-pandemic boost.",
      "In the Asian country, there is a high correlation between marriages and births, with a time lag of one or two years, as marriage is often seen as a prerequisite to having children.",
      "Across the country, the birth rate last year was the lowest in the capital, Seoul, at 0.58.",
      "The latest data showed there were 120,000 more people who died last year than those who were newly born, marking the fifth consecutive year of the population naturally shrinking. The administrative city of Sejong was the only major center where the population grew.",
      "South\u00a0Korea\u2019s population, which hit a peak of 51.83 million in 2020, is expected to shrink to 36.22 million by 2072, according to the latest projection by the statistics agency."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not incredibly unusual to have three hurricanes simultaneously in the month of September in the North Atlantic,\u201d said Brian Tang, an atmospheric science professor at University at Albany. \u201cCertainly it is a very busy period for the South Pacific and three tropical cyclones is a lot to happen at once, but not unprecedented.\u201d",
      "The last time three such storms occurred in the South Pacific was January 2021 when Lucas, Ana and Bina were churning simultaneously, though it\u2019s not clear if Bina officially reached Category 1 status, Tang said.",
      "Rae formed Friday north of Fiji and brought whipping winds and heavy rain that damaged fruit trees, according to local reports.",
      "Alfred developed in the Coral Sea on Monday and is expected to bring flooding rains to the northeast Australia state of Queensland this weekend.",
      "Seru became a cyclone Tuesday and is expected to track near the island nation of Vanuatu but remain offshore.",
      "Scientists say that\u2019s hard to say, but any explanation starts with the high activity that\u2019s usual this time of year.",
      "Gabriel Vecchi, a climate scientist at Princeton University, noted evidence of what\u2019s called a Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation \u2014 a fluctuation in the atmosphere that results in a blob of rising air and rainfall that circles the globe and lasts for 30 days or longer. He said it seems to be tracking over the southwest Pacific in a way that could enhance cyclone activity.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere is chaotic. There\u2019s a lot of natural fluctuation in it \u2026 we need to be open to the possibility that factors that are beyond our ability to predict might have led to these three cyclones at the same time,\u201d he said."
