      "The new Paramount+ series \u201cHappy Face\u201d has all the elements of a gripping true-crime yarn: A serial killer, his estranged daughter, a race to get an innocent man off death row",
      "NEW YORK -- The new Paramount+ series \u201cHappy Face\u201d has all the elements of a gripping true-crime yarn: A serial killer, his estranged daughter, a race to get an innocent man off death row. But perhaps the most intriguing part? How it examines the warping nature of true crime itself.",
      "\u201cI was less interested in the specific psychology of a serial killer or glorifying the murders or seeing violence against women on screen,\" says Jennifer Cacicio, executive producer and showrunner. \"I just feel like we\u2019ve seen that. I was very interested in making a true-crime show told through a different lens.\u201d",
      "\u201cHappy Face,\u201d which begins airing Thursday, is inspired by the true story of Melissa Moore, whose father was a prolific serial killer infamous for drawing smiley faces on letters to the media and prosecutors. She was just 15 when he was captured.",
      "Decades later, as an adult with her own children, she finds herself drawn back into his orbit as she sets out to save an innocent man for a crime her father committed. She also has to tell her daughter the truth about her grandfather.",
      "Starring Annaleigh Ashford and Dennis Quaid, \u201cHappy Face\u201d is told from a female point of view and looks at how a shameful secret can echo through generations. It's also about the push and pull of infamy, with horrendous crimes somehow remaining an alluring draw.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crime dramas out there that I think are very male-centric. It\u2019s either about the cops are the cool guys or the criminals are the cool guys, and it\u2019s all about kicking in doors. I\u2019ve written on those shows and they\u2019re fun and they serve a purpose. And I think that I really wanted to try something different,\u201d Cacicio says.",
      "\u201cWhat is it like for the rest of the family when there\u2019s this shameful secret and this series of crimes and these acts of violence and what are the ripple effects on everybody involved?\u201d",
      "Ashford, who earned a Tony Award nomination playing a serial killer on Broadway in \u201cSweeney Todd,\u201d plays Moore with tenderness and anger, saying she was interested in exploring generational trauma.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the worst nightmares,\u201d she says. \u201cThe worst nightmare of all is having a family member be a victim. And then the second worst nightmare is having a family member be the perpetrator. So what would you do if you\u2019re a parent or your sibling or your spouse or your child committed an atrocity?\u201d",
      "Moore previously shared her story in the bestselling memoir, \u201cShattered Silence\u201d and the 2018 \"Happy Face\" podcast, reaching out to her father's victims and advocating for other family members of killers. Cacicio was one of a number of writers interested in telling her story for TV.",
      "Cacicio approached Moore with this pitch: \u201cIf you want someone who\u2019s a straight-up journalist, who\u2019s just going to tell exactly the story of the podcast, you should let someone else do it,\u201d she told her. \u201cThere\u2019s also an opportunity for it to be a bigger story that\u2019s asking some questions about true crime.\u201d",
      "Cacicio and Moore, it turned out had plenty in common. They were the same age, and both the oldest of three kids. Both had close relationships with their fathers, who hid other lives \u2014 Moore's was a killer and Cacicio served time in prison for drug dealing.",
      "\u201cObviously, the crimes are different, the circumstances are different. But I think, in my family, it was something we didn\u2019t talk about and it was something I didn\u2019t want my friends to know,\u201d says Cacicio.",
      "\u201cA lot of it was really personal to me. And I think that\u2019s what made her trust me \u2014 that I really understood the feelings, even if I didn\u2019t necessarily understand the specific circumstances.\u201d",
      "Quaid plays Moore's father, but unlike other roles he's taken that involve a living person, he had no intention of meeting the prisoner. He didn't want to glorify the killer but also \u201cHappy Face\u201d isn't that kind of show.",
      "\u201cThis is told from Melissa\u2019s point of view, and I think it\u2019s actually truer than his point of view, because I think she knows him much better than he knows himself,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he shows emotions like a little boy who\u2019s trying to talk himself out of a whipping.\u201d",
      "Cacicio says it's time we took a look at the explosion in popularity of true crime, in which women are often the victims but women are also the chief consumers.",
      "\u201cAre we obsessed with these stories because we\u2019re trying to protect ourselves in case the worst happens?\u201d she asks. \u201cI read somewhere that it\u2019s an act of normalizing your own experiences, because usually it\u2019s whatever you\u2019re watching is worse than what\u2019s happened to you. So it kind of like makes you feel better about your own traumas.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Just cue up the first song from the new album by The Doobie Brothers and you'll hear something unusual: harmony, in a new way.",
      "It's not just that soulful blast from Michael McDonald, marking his first time recording with the band in 45 years. Listen and you'll also hear founding member Pat Simmons and original vocalist Tom Johnston.",
      "\u201cWalk This Road\u201d \u2014 with the always-welcome addition of Mavis Staples \u2014 is a horn-and-slide-guitar slice of bluesy, wailing rock that's also a celebration of a band that has endured changes and re-formed with members now in their 70s.",
      "\u201cSomehow, here we are,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends throughout the years. Our kids have all grown up together and our kids have kind of kept us in contact even at times when we might have dropped off the radar for each other.\u201d",
      "The Doobie Brothers, who formed in 1970 and initially broke up in 1982, have a packed 2025 planned: A European tour that leads to a North American one, the strong new album and inclusion in the Songwriters Hall of Fame.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us ever even really thought we\u2019d still be on stage at this age doing this, much less together,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cThat we\u2019re still able to express ourselves artistically is something that\u2019s not lost on us.\u201d",
      "The North American tour kicks off in Detroit on Aug. 4 and heads to such cities as New York, Boston, Chicago, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Toronto. The opening act will be The Coral Reefer Band.",
      "\u201cWalk This Road\u201d features 10 new songs sung by McDonald, Simmons and Johnston, who collaborated on writing the tracks and play on each other's tunes. Longtime collaborator John McFee also returned for the project.",
      "The album, out June 6, has something for everyone \u2014 honky-tonk, driving country, flirty Southern pop, moody folk and melodic rock. There are songs about New Orleans and Hawaii. Angels make the lyrics on two songs.",
      "\u201cOne of the strengths of our live show was the fact that you couldn\u2019t get bored with any one style of music because everything was kind of a different bag,\u201d says McDonald, who officially reunited with the band on tour in 2019. \u201cWe like to do that. You know, I think this album is hopefully no different in that respect.\u201d",
      "John Shanks, who produced the band's 2021 album \u201cLibert\u00e9,\u201d returned for \u201cWalk This Road,\u201d lending them his Los Angeles studio, with a writing room upstairs and a recording booth downstairs where each songwriter took turns cutting tracks.",
      "\u201cThe band, I think, presents all of us with an opportunity to do things that we might not do just as individual songwriters,\u201d says McDonald.",
      "While the Doobies have never been a concept band, the album explores seizing the moments, reflects on paths taken and coming to grips with the past.",
      "\u201cThis is a snapshot in time of where the band is and where the writers are,\u201d says Johnston. \u201cWe didn\u2019t consciously sit down and say, 'Well, we\u2019re going to try and do this.\u2019\u201d",
      "One track, \"Learn to Let Go,\" is an unrequited love song that's about letting go of things that hold you back, while \u201cSpeed of Pain\u201d is about how the worst things in life can become the best.",
      "\u201cIn many cases, it\u2019s just a situation where you have to lose it all. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I\u2019ve met over the years who have told me that going to jail was the best thing that ever happened to them,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cI think total defeat in this world is the great teacher.\u201d",
      "The Doobie Brothers are already members of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 with tracks like \u201cTakin\u2019 It To the Streets,\u201d \u201cWhat a Fool Believes\u201d and \u201cMinute By Minute\u201d \u2014 but shortly after the album comes out, they'll be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really great for this band,\" says Johnston. \"I think it\u2019s great for us as individual writers, but I think it\u2019s also great for the group, and it kind of carries on the name, if you will.\u201d",
      "McDonald and Johnston both expressed a little surprise that they're still making music with the folks they worked with in their 20s and are still a draw on the road.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just fun to visit all these places musically. It\u2019s fun to put that out in front of the crowd live. And to do an album now \u2014 I didn\u2019t picture doing this, but I\u2019m all for it,\u201d Johnston says.",

      "Good intentions, like swirling bluebirds, flutter through the new live-action \u201cSnow White.\u201d",
      "Mirror mirror on the wall, what\u2019s the fairest Disney live-action remake of them all?",
      "Wait, mirror. Hold on a second. Maybe choosing from the likes of \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d (2010), \u201cMulan\u201d (2020) and \u201cThe Lion King\" (2019) isn\u2019t such a good idea. Mirror, on second thought, what\u2019s on Netflix?",
      "Even the most devoted fans would have to acknowledge that these have not been the most illustrious illustrations of Disney magic. At their best (\u201cPete\u2019s Dragon\u201d? \u201cCinderella\u201d?) they breathe life into old classics that could use a little updating. At their worst, well, blue Will Smith.",
      "Given the rapacious rate of remakes in modern Hollywood, it\u2019s remarkable that it\u2019s taken nearly 90 years for Disney to return to \u201cSnow White.\u201d It means going back to the very foundation of the Mouse House. The 1937 \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was Disney\u2019s first animated feature; its grosses paid for the studio\u2019s Burbank lot.",
      "That legacy of \u201cSnow White,\u201d by comparison, doesn\u2019t do any favors to Marc Webb\u2019s inevitably lesser, inert live-action retread. Good intentions, like swirling bluebirds, flutter through this \u201cSnow White\u201d: to give its singing protagonist ( Rachel Zegler ) more agency; to expand that notion of \u201cfair\u201d beyond skin tone; to reframe that problematic prince. But all that updating adds up to a mishmash of a fable, caught in between now and once upon a time.",
      "It wouldn\u2019t be an earthshattering observation to note that a 1930s cartoon, let alone a 19th century German folk tale, might not be entirely in line with contemporary culture. Most of these Disney live-action remakes have carried with them more than a few notes of correction and atonement for the past \u2014 a laudable goal that means a generation of kids might not need a brief history lesson to go along with an old classic.",
      "But it\u2019s a tricky thing reworking a fable that\u2019s been around two centuries, and that\u2019s doubly true when leaping from the two-dimensional fantasy realm of animation to the more complicated land of flesh and bone. Webb\u2019s \u201cSnow White\u201d has been a veritable case study for the headaches that can arise when a window into the real world is cracked open. Everything from Israel's war in Gaza (Zegler and her co-star Gal Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, have differing opinions), the humanity of little people (there\u2019s a reason \u201cand the Seven Dwarfs\u201d has been stripped from the title) and the alleged \u201cwoke\u201d-ness of the production have been fuel for what we can gently refer to as online debate.",
      "Despite some gloriously lush production design, \u201cSnow White\u201d \u2014 innocent of most of those backlashes though not all \u2014 can\u2019t quite thread the needle. Even the new songs (by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul) that are good (\"Waiting on a Wish\") struggle to fit in alongside old standbys. Zegler does a spirited job remaking a classic Disney princess into a more modern woman; when she sings, the movie gets a lift. The last thing that's wrong with this \u201cSnow White\u201d is Zegler's casting.",
      "But like scaffolding that's been left up too long, the strain of renovation shows in Webb\u2019s film, particularly in its awkward handling of Dopey, Sneezy and company. The seven dwarfs, like the fawns and squirrels, are rendered in CGI. You could argue that this acknowledges the artificiality of a dated and offensive trope. But it also gives \u201cSnow White\u201d an uncanny quality, with all human characters but the dwarfs being played by real people. As if to Band-Aid over this, one of the woodsmen is played by an actor of short stature (George Appleby) whose presence seems like yet another atonement, only one for this \u201cSnow White,\u201d not 1937\u2019s.",
      "You might be thinking: But what about the movie? The problem with \u201cSnow White\u201d is that you never stop thinking about these much-strategized and sometimes superficial efforts to recontextualize the original movie. Erin Cressida Wilson's screenplay remakes Snow White's story as less a princess awaiting her Prince Charming (the song \u201cSomeday My Prince Will Come\" has been jettisoned) than an heir to a throne who loses her gumption. Though taught as a child to be \u201cfair\u201d as a leader by her father king (Hadley Fraser), Snow White has lost any ambition by the time Gadot's Evil Queen takes over the kingdom.",
      "Gadot sinks her teeth into the Evil Queen, a spikey, slinky villain who moves with a metallic rustle (the costumes are by Sandy Powell). But she feels cut off from the movie, without the lines that would elevate her flamboyant performance into something memorable. The prince has been altogether scrubbed; instead Andrew Burnap plays the blandly cocksure bandit Jonathan who encourages Snow White not to wait for her father's rescue.",
      "Presumably one of the reasons to bring actors into remakes of animated classics would be to add a warm-blooded pulse to these characters. Zegler manages that, but everyone else in \u201cSnow White\u201d \u2014 mortal or CGI \u2014 is as stiff as could be. You're left glumly scorekeeping the updates \u2014 one win here, a loss there \u2014 while pondering why, regardless of the final tally, recapturing the magic of long ago is so elusive.",
      "\u201cSnow White,\u201d a Walt Disney Co. release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for violence, some peril, thematic elements and brief rude humor. Running time: 109 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "\u201cA Thelma & Louise for our times,\u201d is how bestselling thriller writer Paula Hawkins describes the debut novel, \u201cKiller Potential,\u201d from Hannah Deitch",
      "When bestselling psychological thriller writer Paula Hawkins (\u201cThe Girl on the Train,\u201d 2015) stamps the cover of your debut novel with \u201cA Thelma & Louise for our times,\u201d your career is off to a fast start.",
      "The same goes for the plot pace of Hannah Deitch\u2019s book, \u201cKiller Potential,\u201d which opens at a breakneck clip and doesn\u2019t really slow down for about 200 pages. Evie Gordon is our narrator. She went to \u201ca liberal arts school, stupidly expensive,\u201d and is now working as an SAT tutor in pricey California zip codes. Her first sentence is a gem: \u201cI was once a famous murderess.\u201d The rest of the book reveals how she earned that appellation and the adverb \u201conce.\u201d",
      "The opening scene is at \u201cThe Victor House,\u201d which Evie describes in great detail \u2014 its \u201clive-edge table cut from Portuguese wood,\u201d the \u201cDe Gournay hand-painted silk wallpaper,\u201d and the \u201caquamarine Moroccan tile in the bathroom.\u201d It\u2019s where Evie discovers the dead bodies of Dinah and Peter Victor, the mother with her face bashed in and the father floating in a koi pond. As Evie flees, she hears a voice crying out for help and rescues a woman trapped behind a door under a staircase, before coming face-to-face with her tutoring student, Serena. Thinking Evie and her accomplice are killers fleeing the scene of their crime, Serena attacks with a lamp and the scene ends with Evie smashing a vase against Serena\u2019s head before escaping with the mystery woman in Evie\u2019s car.",
      "Cue the Hans Zimmer soundtrack for the next 100+ pages as Evie gets to know her partner in crime, who doesn\u2019t speak at first, traumatized by whatever happened to her in the house. Eventually we learn her name, Jae, and together they pull off a series of crimes, some petty (shoplifting, carjacking), some not (assaulting and shooting at a few men and boys who recognize them from TV). Throughout it all, Evie\u2019s inner monologue keeps readers engaged as she ponders things like how the language of courtship (Chase. Pursue. Stalk.) mirrors the language of hunting. It\u2019s clear after a while that Evie and Jae lust for one another and when that dam finally breaks, the novel takes on a torrid tone that feels authentic for two people on the run for weeks relying on only each other and their animal instincts to survive.",
      "Of course, Paula Hawkins doesn\u2019t blurb your book unless there\u2019s a well-earned twist, and \u201cKiller Potential\u201d delivers on that front. The final third or so of the novel is a real joy to read as Deitch fills in all the blanks using different narrative techniques. Saying anything more would spoil the fun, but \u201cKiller Potential\u201d earns Deitch a spot on the \u201cnew novelists to watch\u201d list.",

      "It\u2019s a kind of \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d for the incel age, a harrowing portrait of untreated mental illness, violence, false idols, steroids and male loneliness. There was, from the beginning, lots to discuss and debate in the fabric of \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d But in the two years since it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, it was also eclipsed by the very real-life travails of its star, who was convicted of assaulting his former girlfriend.",
      "In January 2023, \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d had an exciting future with Oscar hopes for Majors. Searchlight Pictures won the distribution rights, reportedly over the likes of Neon and Sony Pictures Classics. And Majors was skyrocketing to the top, with big roles in \u201cCreed III\u201d and as Marvel\u2019s new main villain, Kang. But two months later, he was arrested. By that December, Majors was found guilty of one misdemeanor assault charge and one harassment violation and fired by Marvel. A month later, \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d was without distribution. Majors has, throughout it all, maintained his innocence.",
      "The film was eventually picked up by Briarcliff Entertainment, the same distributor who jumped in to release the young Donald Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d after the rest of the entertainment business shied away from it. \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d went on to get Oscar nominations for its two stars.",
      "But there\u2019s a different kind of stigma around \u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d which is why this review has also been a bit eclipsed by what's happened in Majors' life. It\u2019s a film about a man teetering on the edge of violence, about the relentless pursuit of greatness \u2014 and it is deeply uncomfortable watching his descent.",
      "His simplistic devotion to one wild goal may be his undoing in a world that just doesn\u2019t care about him. This is not the movie that any public relations professional would choose as a \u201ccomeback role.\u201d Yet it\u2019s impossible to deny the monumental ferocity of Majors\u2019 performance, from his full transformation to his unsettling ability to show the pain behind (most of) the psychotic actions.",
      "Killian\u2019s life is nothing glamorous: He works in a grocery store and at home cares for his aging grandfather. But he has an intense, maniacal need to be seen and to be remembered. And the only way he\u2019s figured out how to achieve that is through physical perfection \u2014 or at least his very narrow idea. Success is a magazine cover, which he naively conflates with immortality.",
      "When co-worker Jessie (Haley Bennett, who does a lot with a small, somewhat thankless role) agrees to go out on a date with him, he is genuinely shocked that she isn\u2019t familiar with his bodybuilding idol, saying something to the effect of \u201cyou need to get out more.\u201d",
      "Writer-director Elijah Bynum effectively imbues his film with stylized intensity. You feel uneasy and captivated from the start, though you try to give Killian the benefit of the doubt \u2014 to look for his goodness, to root for his success, if only for the hope that it might keep him docile for a little longer. Though we\u2019re told early that he\u2019s had violent episodes, through his court-ordered therapist, the glass isn\u2019t fully shattered until Jessie starts to process that Killian is someone she needs to get away from, fast. This is notably after he orders perhaps $500 worth of protein on the date, just for himself. Sadly, we don\u2019t get to see the bill.",
      "While \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d is an interesting character study, one many actors would love to play for all its dramatic opportunities, it also seems crafted entirely to provoke and shock \u2014 especially in the almost unbearably bleak final hour. After two viewings, one of which I had to take a break from during one of his violent outbursts, I\u2019m not actually sure what it\u2019s trying to say about men, about trauma, about 'roid rage. Killian seems less like an authentic person and more a simplistic stand-in for the forgotten person, the quiet weirdo who ends up a mass killer.",
      "And yet as movies are being accused of being too straightforward, too moralistic, too simple, perhaps some ambiguity, some discomfort, some unresolved unpleasantness is overdue. Majors is a force, and Bynum is certainly a director to watch. The question with \u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d which was the same in January 2023 as it is in March 2025 is: Will anyone?",
      "\u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d a Briarcliff Entertainment release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cviolent content, drug use, sexual material, nudity and language.\u201d Running time: 104 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "As CBS' parent company considers settlement of President Donald Trump's lawsuit against \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d America\u2019s storied newsmagazine is pulling no punches in its coverage of the new administration",
      "NEW YORK -- As CBS corporate leaders ponder settling President Donald Trump's $20 billion lawsuit against the network's \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d America's storied newsmagazine has produced some fast and hard-hitting stories critical of the new administration in every episode since Trump was inaugurated.",
      "The latest was Sunday, when CBS News helped pay for a performance featuring non-white middle and high school musicians who had won a contest and with it, the right to play with the U.S. Marine Corps Band. The original concert, however, was canceled because of Trump's executive order ending diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "Correspondent Scott Pelley narrated six of the show's seven stories since Trump's inauguration, including Sunday's. He examined the administration\u2019s policies toward Ukraine and tariffs, looked at changes in the Justice Department and reported on firings of government watchdogs. Shortly after his piece on the dismantling of USAID, Elon Musk suggested \u201clong prison sentences\u201d for those working on the show.",
      "All came at a time when television's most popular and influential news broadcast was being watched to see how it would respond to a unique pressure.",
      "\u201cThis may be a lawsuit that is designed to intimidate, but they are clearly making a statement that they will not be intimidated,\u201d said Tom Bettag, a longtime television news producer who worked under Mike Wallace and Morley Safer at the CBS show.",
      "Pelley, meanwhile, has quickly become a polarizing figure.",
      "\u201cAnother week, another \u201860 Minutes\u2019 story trying to discredit Trump policies,\u201d Brent Baker, editor of the conservative media watchdog NewsBusters, wrote on X on Sunday night.",
      "Trump's lawsuit, coupled with a parallel Federal Communications Commission investigation, accuses \u201c60 Minutes\u201d of election interference for the way it edited Bill Whitaker's interview last fall with Trump's 2024 opponent, Kamala Harris.",
      "Two sound bites, broadcast on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and CBS' \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d depicted Harris giving different responses to Whitaker in a discussion about Israel. CBS said Harris made both comments in her answer to Whitaker and that the two shows ended up using different parts of a long sound bite. CBS argued the apparent discrepancy was typical of editing and not, as Trump has suggested, that different remarks by Harris were used to make her look better.",
      "CBS parent Paramount Global filed new motions in the past two weeks to get both the lawsuit and the FCC probe dismissed. Still, Shari Redstone, head of Paramount, is reportedly anxious for a settlement, much like Disney agreed to pay $16 million in December to end Trump's lawsuit against ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. Complicating matters is Paramount's proposed merger with Skydance Media, which needs approval from the Trump administration.",
      "Many at CBS News resist a settlement, insisting \u201c60 Minutes\u201d did nothing wrong. The show's executive producer, Bill Owens, told his staff last month that he would not apologize as part of any prospective settlement.",
      "\u201cMy precious \u201860 Minutes\u2019 is fighting, quite frankly, for our life,\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl said earlier this month in accepting a First Amendment award from the Radio Television Digital News Association. \u201cI am so proud of \u201860 Minutes\u2019 that we are standing up and fighting for what is right.\u201d",
      "Neither Owens nor Pelley would comment on whether the show is trying to deliver any sort of message about the lawsuit through its work. Bettag said he believed \u201c60 Minutes\u201d is motivated by the importance of the stories.",
      "What the show has done during the past two months is striking, said Bettag, now a journalism professor at the University of Maryland.",
      "\u201cThe \u201860 Minutes\u2019 people are such committed journalists that they\u2019d consider it foolish to be doing these stories because of what is a frivolous lawsuit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lawsuit pales in comparison with the monumental changes Trump is trying to implement. Those correspondents and producers know that this is a moment that requires their very best work.\"",
      "Some of the segments were unusually urgent for the newsmagazine, which tends to do longer-range stories that could take months to produce. Pelley's March 2 report about Ukraine came only days after the White House confrontation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Musk's angry comment on his X social media platform came after Pelley's Feb. 16 story about the billionaire's role in the quick shutdown of the USAID office. \u201cThe world's richest man had cut off assistance to the world's poorest families,\u201d Pelley said, noting that Musk collects \u201cbillions of taxpayer dollars\u201d for his SpaceX company.",
      "Hours later, Musk wrote on X: \u201c60 Minutes are the biggest liars in the world! They engaged in deliberate deception to interfere with the last election. They deserve a long prison sentence.\u201d",
      "Other news organizations have done admirable work under difficult circumstances, said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor. Besides Pelley, he cited the news staff of the Washington Post at a time the newspaper\u2019s owner, Jeff Bezos, has shown more friendliness to Trump.",
      "Sunday\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d story involved some elite high school students \u2014 each of them either of either Black, Hispanic, Indian or Asian descent \u2014 who had earned the right to play with the Marine band before the show was called off.",
      "CBS worked with Equity Arc, an organization devoted to increasing the number of minority students playing classical music, to organize a show for family and friends of the students outside Washington, D.C.. Retired members of military bands were brought in to work with the students. CBS News, which wanted to interview the students, paid for the travel and lodging of 22 of them.",
      "Pelley called it the \u201cconcert that was not meant to be heard.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe original Marine Band concert would have been seen by hundreds,\u201d he said. \u201cHere tonight, these musicians are being heard by millions.\u201d",
      "Pelley's March 9 report, \u201cFiring the Watchdogs,\u201d was about Trump's efforts to fire inspector generals and thwart others who protect whistleblowers in government agencies. He quoted Trump as saying the firings were standard for a new administration taking office. \u201cHe's wrong,\u201d Pelley said.",
      "His story about the U.S. Justice Department examined the resistance among some prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "\u201cAs he continues to step up his attacks on President Donald Trump and the new administration, Pelley is elbowing aside all others to emerge as Trump's loudest TV critic,\u201d wrote Paul Bedard of the Washington Examiner.",
      "In his stories, Pelley's deadpan voice and methodical style could not hide the sharpness of some observations. While narrating the story about USAID, Pelley noted that \u201cIt's too soon to tell how serious President Trump is in defiance of the Constitution.\"",

    "story": [
      "Robert De Niro's doing double duty in \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d literally",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re the actor!\u201d shouts Anna Genovese at her estranged spouse, gangster Vito Genovese, in a courtroom where he\u2019s implausibly claiming he lacks funds to support her. \u201cThe best actor in the world! Better than Clark Gable!\u201d",
      "And we all chuckle. They probably all chuckled on set, too. Because the man playing Vito in \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d is none other than Robert De Niro, indeed one of the best actors in the world, revered in our time as Gable was in his.",
      "It\u2019s a cute moment and an apt one, too, because Barry Levinson\u2019s film, which aims but fails to channel the magic of decades-old mob movies like \u201cGoodfellas\u201d \u2014 though penned by the same writer, Nicholas Pileggi \u2014 is all about De Niro. Actually, it\u2019s all about De Niro AND De Niro. The man plays both lead roles, feuding mobsters Genovese and Frank Costello, in a story based on real events.",
      "Is it a gimmick? Surely. Does it work? Well, there\u2019s the entertainment value \u2014 this is De Niro, after all \u2014 and if you feel that more De Niro minutes are always better, then it follows that two roles are better than one. Others may feel it has a mob-themed \u201cParent Trap\u201d vibe, less weighty than it should be given the obviously violent subject matter.",
      "Also, \u201cGoodfellas\u201d fans may wonder if the Vito role was once intended for Joe Pesci (the movie\u2019s been in development forever), so similar is the character to that actor\u2019s impulsive, manically suspicious persona. On the other hand, in two brief scenes where the De Niros appear together for momentous meetings, one might be forgiven for wondering if Al Pacino was in line at some point, for a \u201cHeat\u201d-like moment.",
      "Happily, De Niro relies here on makeup, and not de-aging as in \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d though it must be said that, at times, his two characters just don\u2019t look different enough. More importantly, \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d despite its pedigree, doesn't rise anywhere near the heights of its glorious predecessors. It is, rather, an enjoyable if choppily paced look at a relationship between two men, where unfortunately we\u2019re arriving pretty late in the game.",
      "There are, though, a few crackling surprises: that domestic courtroom scene; a tense, televised Senate committee grilling; and finally a climactic gathering of mob bosses in the countryside, with fabulous period vehicles parked on the lawn and sausages on the grill, that's disrupted in comically sudden fashion.",
      "We begin in 1957 in Manhattan. Costello, after a night partying respectably with high society, stops at his swank apartment building. \u201cThis one\u2019s for you,\u201d declares the nervous man who shoots him in the head in his lobby.",
      "The shooter (Cosmo Jarvis), sent by Genovese, makes a bad mistake, as his boss will remind him later: \u201cYou gotta go SEE if they\u2019re dead!\u201d Amazingly, Costello survives. \u201cI shoulda been paying more attention,\u201d says the genteel mobster who favors diplomacy over bloodletting, narrating from the future.",
      "We then go back in time to figure out how things got this bad.",
      "With the help of vintage photos and footage artfully edited to include actors playing the younger Frank and Vito, we learn the two were good friends as young Italian immigrants on the streets. But when Vito got mixed up in a murder case, he had to flee to Italy \u2014 leaving cooler-headed Frank in charge of the business.",
      "Years later, Vito returns, and wants his role at the top of the mob family. And so things go south, quickly.",
      "The women in their lives mirror the differences between the two men. Costello\u2019s wife of more than 50 years, Bobbie (Debra Messing, making a nice foray into drama), is a loyal partner who urges her husband to retire and leave New York \u2014 along with their adorable dogs (De Niro\u2019s own pooches, dressed in mink coats and hats \u2014 a costume design Oscar for this canine fashion, please!). Genovese\u2019s wife Anna (Kathrine Narducci, excellent) is a businesswoman \u2014 she owns a gay bar \u2014 whose fiery union with Vito turns disastrous.",
      "A mere glance at Wikipedia will tell you that both Genovese and Costello ultimately died in nonviolent ways. There\u2019s plenty in \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d that you won\u2019t see there \u2014 for example, the movie's version of just who engineered that farmland mob summit, and why.",
      "But watching dozens of mobsters run like heck when police happen upon their gathering is a hoot, and it\u2019s hard to beat the moment when two of them insist to suspicious cops: \u201cWe\u2019re hunters!\u201d",
      "If only such witty moments were more frequent in a two-hour movie that somehow, alas, feels much longer.",
      "\u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d a Warner Bros. Pictures release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor violence and pervasive language.\u201d Running time: 120 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "There was concern that attendance and overall interest in women\u2019s college basketball would drop this year with the departure of Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and other stars for the WNBA.",
      "Both took a dip -- but only a dip.",
      "With JuJu Watkins and Paige Bueckers and a host of other standout players leading the way, attendance across the country was just short of last season's record numbers in women's hoops and still the second-highest ever.",
      "More networks showed more games on TV this season and ratings were strong heading into March Madness that starts this week. ESPN will have the lion's share of tournament games again, but Fox increased its footprint in the sport with five games in primetime on Saturday nights and 18 total on the network.",
      "\u201cThere are great stars, great brands, we\u2019ve done more than we have done before and we\u2019re not alone in doing that,\u201d Fox Sports President of Insights and Analytics Mike Mulvihill said. \u201cThe 3-5-10 year trend clearly is an upward trend.\u201d",
      "While the network\u2019s overall ratings are down from last season\u2019s record mark that was due in large part to Clark being on Fox a lot, Mulvihill is happy with where they are.",
      "\u201cTo go from zero exposures a few years ago to 18 on our biggest platform speaks to the growth and interest in the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s growing confidence in this building that we can put it on broadcast and justify it. I love that we are able to put games on in primetime. It means something to the coaches and players.\u201d",
      "Having great matchups helps. The game between Watkins\u2019 USC and Bueckers\u2019 UConn on Dec. 21 was shown in primetime after an NFL game and averaged 2.2 million viewers, peaking at nearly 3.8 million. That was the second-most watched women\u2019s game on the network behind only Clark\u2019s game last year when she set the NCAA scoring record.",
      "The network also helped spearhead two new tournaments this year with the Champions Classic and the Coretta Scott King Invitational. Both were renewed for next season.",
      "CBS showed the third matchup of the season between UCLA and USC, two of the top teams in the country, in the Big Ten title game and it drew 1.44 million viewers, trailing only last season's league championship which saw Clark and Iowa win.",
      "ESPN had big numbers with regular-season ratings up 3% from last year and 41% from two seasons ago. This was the most watched year for the network before the NCAAs since 2008-09 (the network didn't have many of Clark\u2019s regular-season games at Iowa last season).",
      "A doubleheader on Feb. 16 was huge for ESPN: UConn vs. South Carolina drew 1.8 million viewers while LSU vs. Texas had 1.7 million. In all, 15 games on ESPN networks averaged over 500,000 viewers, the most in a single year.",
      "ESPN, which owns the rights to the NCAA Tournament and shows women's games every week during the season, has faith that March Madness will deliver.",
      "Women's basketball programming director Dan Margulis knows that the network had a perfect storm last season to achieve the record ratings that saw the women's championship game outdraw the men. Clark, a generational player, had guided Iowa back to the championship game where they were facing an undefeated South Carolina team looking for its own place in history.",
      "\u201cWe're looking at early rounds and everything growing going into it,\u201d Margulis said. \u201cCompared to two years ago, we see that growth.\u201d",
      "It wasn't just the championship game that drew huge numbers. A rematch between Reese and Clark in the Elite Eight game was massive as well.",
      "\u201cCertainly the floor has risen dramatically,\u201d said lead ESPN announcer Rebecca Lobo. \u201cThe expectation for this year\u2019s tournament, Final Four or national championship shouldn\u2019t be what we saw a year ago. Will it be better than pre-Caitlin? That floor should be much higher than it was.\u201d",
      "While there isn't an undefeated team this year or a generational player like Clark on her last run, there is more parity in the sport.",
      "People aren\u2019t just watching on TV, but also showing up at games. The power conferences had strong attendance marks. The SEC led the way, setting numerous conference records, including total for its tournament and the mark in both the semis and the finals.",
      "The Big Ten had its second-highest average attendance in the last 15 years.",
      "\u201cGranted we get to see some of the best ones, but the energy was different throughout the country,\u201d Lobo said. \u201cThe South Carolina-LSU game on a Thursday night with 2,500 students has a different energy. The increase from students across the country has made for incredible environments.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The trade organization that represents movie theater owners in the U.S. and abroad is getting a rebrand",
      "In hindsight, NATO was an unnecessarily confusing acronym for a trade organization representing movie theater owners. For 60 years, the National Association of Theatre Owners has promoted interests of movie theaters, from the biggest chains to the one screen mom and pop shops. They\u2019ve also regularly gotten mail and phone calls intended for the other NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.",
      "But the theater owner\u2019s organization is looking to the future, with a new name and a refocused mission. The group will now be known as Cinema United, president and CEO Michael O\u2019Leary told The Associated Press Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt can be a little complicated having the same name as a multinational military alliance,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cWe felt that it was time to look at our name and do a rebrand.\u201d",
      "They wanted the new name to reflect the \u201cpassion and energy of the people that run theaters,\u201d O\u2019Leary said, and to put the focus back on the exhibitors and movie theaters. Cinema United represents more than 32,000\u202fmovie screens in the U.S. and more than 30,000 screens in 88 countries. Their job, O\u2019Leary explained, is to promote and support theatrical exhibition. Moviegoing, the new tagline reads, is their mission.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a challenging four or five years. But with each passing day, we put those challenges in the rearview mirror a little bit more. Our focus right now is on the future,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cI think that we stand on the precipice of the next great era of cinema.\u201d",
      "Just a few weeks ago, \u201cAnora\u201d filmmaker Sean Baker made his own case for theaters on the national stage. In accepting his best director Oscar, he used his time at the podium to make a \u201cbattle cry\u201d for the theatrical experience \u2013 for filmmakers to keep making movies for the big screen and for studios to keep releasing them there.",
      "\u201cPeople were ecstatic about it,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cHe has earned the unyielding allegiance of theater owners all around the world for his strong support over the years, and certainly at the Oscars.\u201d",
      "Movie theaters big and small were hit hard by the pandemic \u2013 many closed and never re-opened. Last year, they also faced a depleted release calendar due to the Hollywood strikes. It\u2019s all resulted in a depleted domestic box office that has yet to reach pre-pandemic levels. In 2024, the industry finished just over $8.7 billion, down 3.3% from 2023 and 23.5% from 2019.",
      "A fuller release schedule is expected this year, but currently the box-office total is down about 5% from where the industry was last year at this time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we not put too much emphasis on a single year like 2025. We need to constantly be building and growing and moving forward,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.",
      "Despite challenges, it remains an all-ages and affordable entertainment pasttime. A recent study from the National Research Group said 76% of the American population ages 12 to 74 attended at least one movie in 2024.",
      "And though theater closures often make headlines, like the E Street Cinema in Washington D.C., where Cinema United is headquartered, there\u2019s also been a spate of investment and refurbishment in theaters around the country, some spearheaded by famous filmmakers and actors.",
      "Jason Reitman along with more than 30 directors including Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan and Bradley Cooper last February acquired Westwood\u2019s Village Theater in Los Angeles, which dates back to 1931. Patrick Wilson also purchased and helped restore an historic theater in New Canaan, CT, joining big screen disciples like Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino who have all invested in movie theaters.",
      "Last fall, the eight biggest theater chains in the U.S. and Canada announced that they planned to invest more than $2.2 billion to modernize 21,000 movie theater screens over the next three years. This includes anything from projectors, lighting and sound to features in the concessions area. But upgrades in theaters are nothing new, O\u2019Leary said, they\u2019re just helping to draw attention to it.",
      "\u201cThe entire membership reinvests in their theaters on a regular basis,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cPart of the reason we made that announcement was because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s obvious to people that theater owners are constantly in the process of reinventing themselves and reinvesting.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes just over a week before some 6,000 movie theater employees from around the world convene in Las Vegas for the annual CinemaCon conference, which Cinema United hosts.",
      "All the major Hollywood studios, including The Walt Disney Studios, Warner Bros. Pictures, Universal Pictures and even Amazon/MGM will be making big, starry presentations on the main stage at Caesar\u2019s Palace \u2014 where executives and stars will show off new footage and trailers to make the case that they have the goods to get audiences in the theaters.",
      "NATO was coined in 1965, a merger of the nation\u2019s largest movie theater trade organizations: The Theater Owners of America, itself a product of a merger dating back to 1948, and the Allied States Association of Motion Picture Exhibitors, which goes back to the 1920s.",
      "Those at Cinema United like to say that \"we\u2019re not a Hollywood industry. We\u2019re a Main Street industry.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, the vast majority of our members are small businesses, so they feel the same pushes and pulls that other small businesses feel throughout the United States and around the world, O\u2019Leary said. \u201cThe headquarters of our biggest members are not in Los Angeles or New York. They\u2019re in Knoxville, Dallas and Kansas.\"",

      "A federal judge has dismissed the charges against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d Prosecutors informed the court Monday that he died Sunday",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- A federal judge dismissed the charges Monday against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in the 1939 musical \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d after prosecutors informed the court that he died on Sunday.",
      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of Crystal, who had been in poor health with lung disease and other ailments, had been scheduled to change his plea to guilty in January but that hearing was postponed indefinitely after he was hospitalized.",
      "Federal prosecutor Matthew Greenley notified the court in a one-page motion Monday that Saliterman died Sunday but did not say how or where. U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz granted the request and dropped the charges.",
      "Defense attorney John Brink confirmed Monday that his client had died but declined to give details. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Fargo, North Dakota, which is handling the case, did not immediately return a phone call seeking further information.",
      "According to court filings, Saliterman was hospitalized in early January \"for inability to walk and sepsis,\u201d an infection that can be life-threatening. He attended his arraignment three days later via video from what looked like a hospital room. In an update to the court late last month, Brink told the court that his client had been discharged to a hospice facility and that his prognosis was poor. An accompanying letter from his doctor listed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen and Parkinson's disease.",
      "Saliterman was in a wheelchair and on oxygen last March when he made his first court appearance. He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The sequined red slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million in December, according to Heritage Auctions. The slippers were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only three other pairs remain.",
      "Terry Jon Martin, now 78, of Grand Rapids, used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum\u2019s door and display case to steal them. According to his attorney, an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But he got rid of the slippers when he learned they were fake, and they ended up with Saliterman. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",

      "Dequenne was only 18 when she was selected as best actress at Cannes in 1999. In \u201cRosetta,\u201d from Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, she portrayed a teenager trying to escape her difficult life in a caravan park with an alcoholic mother. The film also won the Palme d\u2019Or that year.",

      "NEW YORK -- The band Semisonic is pushing back at the White House for using their hit song \u201cClosing Time\u201d over a social media post that shows a shackled deportee.",
      "The White House added the song in a post of a man with his wrists handcuffed to his waist as he is patted down at an airport. The video was captioned with the song\u2019s lyrics: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go home but you can\u2019t stay here.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe did not authorize or condone the White House\u2019s use of our song in any way. And no, they didn\u2019t ask. The song is about joy and possibilities and hope, and they have missed the point entirely,\u201d the power pop trio from the Twin Cities said in a statement to The Associated Press.",

      "The recent move by U.S. President Donald Trump to make cuts at Voice of America and other U.S. government-run media may be welcome news for China\u2019s ruling Communist Party",
      "BEIJING -- The recent move by U.S. President Donald Trump to make cuts at Voice of America and other U.S. government-run media may be welcome news for China's ruling Communist Party.",
      "A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson refrained from commenting on Trump's decision Tuesday but took the opportunity to criticize the outlets.",
      "\u201cI do not comment on U.S. domestic policy changes,\u201d Mao Ning said when asked about it. \u201cBut as for the media you mentioned, their bad records in reporting on China are not a secret.\u201d",
      "The Trump\u2019s administration put almost the entire staff of Voice of America on leave last weekend and ended grants to Radio Free Asia and other media with similar news programming.",
      "Radio Free Asia has an extensive Chinese-language service and frequently reports on human rights issues, including the detention of activists and repression of ethnic groups in Xinjiang and Tibet. The government refutes allegations of abuse.",
      "Voice of America, also known as VOA, has a Chinese-language website that often publishes stories not covered by Chinese media, which is state-controlled. China ranks 172 out of 180 in the Reporters Without Borders press freedom index.",
      "The Global Times, a state-owned tabloid, criticized Voice of America at length in an editorial this week.",
      "\u201cThe so-called beacon of freedom, VOA, has now been discarded by its own government like a dirty rag,\u201d it said.",
      "Beyond China, Cambodia's former Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ruled his country for near four decades as an autocrat, welcomed Trump's move.",
      "\u201cThis is a major contribution to eliminating fake news, disinformation, lies, distortions, incitement, and chaos around the world coming from the propaganda machine that President Trump has stopped funding,\u201d he said Monday in a written statement.",
      "Clayton Weimers, USA executive director of the press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders, said that authoritarian regimes are \u201cthe biggest winners\u201d from Trump's gutting of the U.S. Agency for Global Media.",
      "\u201cMany of them, like China, are looking forward to filling the gap left by American leadership in media freedom with their own propaganda,\" Weimers said.",
      "In Washington, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition with the Chinse Communist Party, said the moves against VOA and other broadcasters would \u201cseverely weaken our ability to compete\u201d with China's ruling party and \u201cultimately make us less safe.\"",
      "The media outlets \u201cprovide real reporting to millions living under authoritarian regimes, countering CCP distortion,\" and allowing Chinese people to \"question the CCP\u2019s propaganda and aggression toward the U.S. and our allies and partners,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said.",

      "An unprecedented exhibition at the Pompidou Center in Paris explores the presence and influence of Black artists in the city from the 1950s to 2000",
      "PARIS -- An unprecedented exhibition at the Pompidou Center in Paris explores the presence and influence of Black artists in the city from the 1950s to 2000, offering a vibrant immersion in France's cosmopolitan capital and a history of anti-colonial, civil rights struggles.",
      "The \u201cBlack Paris\u201d exhibition features the works of about 150 major artists of African descent, many of whom have never or rarely been displayed in France before. Running from March 19 to June 30, it's one of the final shows before the museum closes for a five-year renovation later this year.",
      "\u00c9va Barois De Caevel, associate curator, said that the exhibition is \u201cunprecedented,\u201d with more than 300 paintings and sculptures by artists of various backgrounds.",
      "\u201cSome are African Americans, some are Caribbeans, some are Africans, and some are Afro-descendants,\u201d said Barois De Caevel, adding that the focus of the exhibit is not geography or race, but rather \u201cBlack consciousness,\u201d shaped by the history of slavery and experience of racism shared by Black artists.",
      "After World War II, many African American painters, musicians, and intellectuals flocked to Paris, seeking a sense of freedom that they couldn't find in the United States at the time. Barois De Caevel pointed out that for many, Paris represented a break from the racial segregation that they faced back home.",
      "\u201cMany enjoyed being free in the streets of Paris \u2014 being able to go out with white women, enter cafes, bars and restaurants, and be treated like white people,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBut they were not fooled,\" she added, noting that African American writer James Baldwin \"wrote about this early on, that in France, racism is especially targeting Black Africans and Algerians, who were really extremely mistreated. So it\u2019s an ambivalent relationship with Paris.\u201d",
      "The exhibition also shows how many African artists from French colonies \u2014 and later former colonies \u2014 came to Paris to join a political and intellectual movement fighting for civil rights and racial justice, while others from the Caribbean were supporting independentist movements, which were gaining strength there.",
      "Alicia Knock, curator of the exhibition, praised the ambitious scope of the show, which she described as \u201can incredible epic of decolonization,\u201d highlighting how Paris city served as both a \u201clab for Pan-Africanism,\u201d the movement that encouraged solidarity between peoples of African descent, and an \u201canti-colonial workshop.\u201d",
      "Visitors \u201cwill see how these artists contributed to rewriting the history of modernism and postmodernism,\u201d Knock said, and how they \u201dreframed abstraction and surrealism, and at the same time you will also see the Black solidarities that happened at the time.\u201d",
      "\"Many of these artists were not only creators, but also cultural ambassadors, teachers, poets, and philosophers,\u201d she added.",
      "For some coming from the U.S., Paris was also \u201ca gateway to Africa,\u201d Knock said, based on discussions she had with some of the artists' families: \"They told us that, in fact, they had come to Paris to go to Africa, and in the end they found Africa in Paris.\u201d",
      "The exhibition also includes installations from four artists chosen to provide contemporary insights, including Shuck One, a Black graffiti and visual artist native of the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.",
      "In addition, the Pompidou Center has acquired around 40 of the show's artworks, which will remain part of the museum\u2019s collection.",
      "\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Knock said. \u201cIt\u2019s a baby step for many French institutions, French museums and French universities to start working on these artists, start collecting them, writing about them, preserving their works in their archives and hopefully dedicating a lot of solo shows to many of these artists, because they really deserve it.\"",

      "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- The mayor of Miami Beach, Florida, wants to terminate a lease and cut financial support for an independent film theater that screened an Oscar-winning documentary about the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.",
      "Mayor Steven Meiner introduced a resolution describing the film \u201cNo Other Land\u201d as antisemitic. City commissioners will discuss the resolution Wednesday during their next meeting.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d opened last Friday at O Cinema, located at the Miami Beach Historic City Hall. Meiner had reached out several days before the premiere to discourage O Cinema CEO Vivian Marthell from showing the film.",
      "\u201cThe City of Miami Beach has one of the highest concentrations of Jewish residents in the United States,\u201d Meiner said in his letter to Marthell. \u201cThe \u2018No Other Land\u2019 film is a one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents.\u201d",
      "Marthell initially agreed not to screen the movie in a response to Meiner, but the showing went on as scheduled.",
      "\u201cMy initial reaction to Mayor Meiner\u2019s threats was made under duress,\u201d Marthell said in a email Thursday. \u201cAfter reflecting on the broader implications for free speech and O Cinema\u2019s mission, I (along with the O Cinema board and staff members) agreed it was critical to screen this acclaimed film.\u201d",
      "O Cinema has always been committed to sharing films that not only entertain, but also challenge, educate and inspire meaningful dialogue, Marthell said.",
      "\u201cWe understand the power of cinema to tell stories that matter, and we recognize that some stories \u2014 especially those rooted in real-world conflicts \u2014 can evoke strong feelings and passionate reactions. As they should,\u201d Marthell said. \u201cOur decision to screen \u2018No Other Land\u2019 is not a declaration of political alignment. It is a bold reaffirmation of our fundamental belief that every voice deserves to be heard.\u201d",
      "In December and January, the city of Miami Beach executed two grants worth about $80,000 for O Cinema, according to the mayor's proposed resolution. About half the money has already been paid, but the resolution would stop the rest. The city began leasing space to O Cinema in 2019 with the ability to terminate the contract with 180 days of notice, which is what Meiner is seeking to do.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which was shot between 2019 and 2023 and released last year, was directed by a group of Israeli and Palestinian filmmakers: Basel Adra, Hamdan Ballal, Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.",
      "\u201cWhen the mayor uses the word antisemitism to silence Palestinians and Israelis who proudly oppose occupation and apartheid together, fighting for justice and equality, he is emptying it out of meaning,\u201d Abraham said in an email. \u201cI find that to be very dangerous.\u201d",
      "The film documents the destruction of Palestinian villages in the West Bank by the Israeli military. It won the Academy Award for best documentary feature as well as earlier awards.",
      "While the film has earned wide praise from film critics, it has also drawn controversy.",
      "\u201cFreedom of expression is an important value, but defamation of Israel into a tool for international promotion is not art,\u201d Israeli culture minister Miki Zohar said in a social media post.",

      "The cargo van she was riding in flipped over and was then hit by a truck on March 1, music producer and Stone\u2019s longtime manager Walter Millsap III has said.

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- An iconic reindeer so beloved that he has been in parades, featured on reality TV shows and visited by schoolchildren on field trips in Alaska's largest city is fighting for his life after mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen.",
      "Ever since, 8-year-old Star has had pneumonia, digestion issues and rapid weight loss. Star's owner, Albert Whitehead, has taken him to a veterinarian every other day to receive care and in hopes of finding a cause for the issues.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve done everything possible for him,\u201d Whitehead said. Veterinarian Sabrieta Holland said she the reindeer's prognosis is \u201cguarded.\u201d",
      "Star lives in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house at the edge of downtown Anchorage. It\u2019s been over 20 years since someone last tried to tamper with the enclosure where reindeer named Star have been kept for the last seven decades. Star is the seventh in a line of reindeer to carry that name.",
      "In early January, someone cut a huge hole in the fencing to gain entrance, spending about five minutes inside with Star before taking off. What the person did in the pen is unknown, but Star began having stomach issues and dropping weight shortly after.",
      "Then, on Feb. 20, Anchorage police found the friendly and trusting reindeer wandering around downtown and returned him home.",
      "When Whitehead reviewed his security cameras, he found someone had used bolt cutters to remove padlocks off Star\u2019s pen and an alley gate. Star followed the man out into the neighborhood, and the reindeer wound up alone downtown, familiar streets because that's where Whitehead walks him.",
      "The next night, the situation turned more serious.",
      "Whitehead was watching the video feed when a man wearing a scarf over his face sprayed something from two different cans into Star\u2019s pen and twice hit the reindeer in the face with an unknown substance.",
      "Whitehead rushed outside to confront the man.",
      "\u201cI yelled at him to stop, \u2018What the hell are you doing? What are you spraying on the animal? Don\u2019t do that, quit that!\u2019\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "The man replied: \u201cI\u2019m trying to help Star.\"",
      "\u201cI have no idea what he meant by that,\u201d said Whitehead, who suspects \u2014 based on the smells \u2014 that the sprays could have been a disinfectant and deodorizer.",
      "Whitehead and police believe it was the same man from the prior night. It\u2019s not known if the January tampering involved the same person.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the individual wanted to harm Star, but by his actions, he did,\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "Anchorage police posted the surveillance video on social media in hopes it would lead to the suspect\u2019s identity. So far, no viable tips have come in, spokesperson Christopher Barraza said in an email.",
      "Star's pneumonia worsened, and a cough leads Whitehead to believe Star ate something harmful, perhaps while loose.",
      "The pneumonia is likely due to him accidentally inhaling the chronic reflux or regurgitation of the contents in the largest of the reindeers\u2019 four stomachs, Holland said. The sprays possibly also contributed.",
      "It\u2019s possible there\u2019s a blockage, but the largest stomach of a reindeer is quite big and not easily obstructed, Holland said. However, ingested plastic bags causing chronic weight loss and indigestion problems are the most common foreign objects she's seen in reindeer.",
      "The next option would be surgery to look at the reindeer's abdomen and possibly remove any blockage, but it\u2019s generally a poor outcome, even in healthy deer, she said.",
      "The bond between Whitehead and Star is \u201cquite significant and precious,\" Holland said.",
      "\"Albert\u2019s daily life and reason for getting out for walks and such all are because of Star. And Star is really fond of Albert, too,\u201d Holland said in a text. \u201cIt will be quite devastating for him if he loses Star.\u201d",
      "Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart started the reindeer tradition, bringing the deer they received from an Alaska Native herder to Anchorage in the 1950s. Whitehead took over as caretaker from his friends in 2002.",
      "The average lifespan of a reindeer is about 15 years, but some Stars had long lives, like the first who lived to 23. Others didn't live as long, including the second Star, who was stolen, beaten to death and then butchered by a known Fairbanks meat thief. The third Star died after eating a plastic bag.",

      "Two hundred years have passed since the invention of braille, the tactile writing system that has transformed the lives of many blind and partially sighted people",
      "BAMAKO, Mali -- Amadou Ndiaye meticulously ran his fingers across bumps in a piece of paper, making sense of the world he can no longer see.",
      "Two hundred years have passed since the invention of braille, the tactile writing system that has transformed the lives of many blind and partially sighted people by offering a path to literacy and independence.",
      "\u201cBraille helped me live my life,\" said Ndiaye, a social worker in Mali who lost his eyesight as a child. \u201cBefore, people asked themselves the question: Here is someone who can\u2019t see, how will he make it? How will he integrate into society?\u201d",
      "The West African country, with a population of over 20 million people, has long struggled to integrate blind and partially sighted people. According to eye care charity Sightsavers, around 170,000 people in Mali are thought to be blind.",
      "The 47-year-old Ndiaye was fortunate to attend the institute for the blind in Mali, where he learned to write in braille, and told himself: \u201cReally, everything that others do, I can do too.\u201d He later attended university.",
      "He said braille has allowed him to develop his main passion, playing the guitar, which also emphasizes the importance of touch.",
      "\u201cEach pressure on the strings, each movement of the finger on the neck, becomes a living note, loaded with meaning,\" Ndiaye said.",
      "The guitar is an integral part of Mali's griot tradition, the cultural practice of storytelling through music. Musicians adapted the guitar to emulate the sounds of traditional string instruments like the kora. Local artists such as Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 have fused Malian melodies with elements of the blues, creating a soulful, hypnotic sound that has gained international acclaim.",
      "Iconic Malian musical duo Amadou and Mariam awakened Ndiaye's passion for the instrument when he was a boy.",
      "\u201cOne day, near a photography studio, I heard their music resonating through the window, which pushed me to discover this universe,\u201d he said.",
      "Known as \u201cthe blind couple from Mali,\" the duo of Amadou Bagayoko, who lost his vision at age 16, and Mariam Doumbia, who became blind at age 5 as a consequence of untreated measles, rose to international fame in the 1990s with their fusion of traditional Malian music, rock, and blues.",
      "The couple met at Mali's institute for the blind, where Doumbia was studying braille and teaching classes in dance and music.",
      "At such places, braille has allowed students to overcome educational barriers such as taking longer to learn how to read and write. They can then take the same exams as anyone else, which allows them to seek employment, said Ali Moustapha Dicko, who teaches at the institute for the blind in the capital, Bamako.",
      "Dicko is also blind. Using a special typewriter, he can create texts in braille for his students. But he says his students are still at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cWe have a crisis of teaching materials,\u201d Dicko said. He has one reading book in braille for his entire class of dozens of students.",
      "But with the development of new technologies, some blind and partially sighted people hope that educational barriers will continue to fall.",
      "\u201cThere is software, there are telephones that speak, so there are many things that are vocal,\u201d said Bagayoko of the musical duo. \u201cThis allows us to move forward.\u201d",
      "But Moussa Mbengue, the Senegal-based program officer for inclusive education at Sightsavers, said such advances still don't make the leap that braille did two centuries ago.",
      "\"It cannot replace braille. On the contrary, for me, technology complements braille,\u201d he said.",

      "A jury has found the alleged ringleader of a massive pandemic fraud case in Minnesota guilty on all counts for her role in a scheme that federal prosecutors say stole $250 million from a program meant to feed children in need",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A jury found the alleged ringleader of a massive pandemic fraud case in Minnesota guilty on all counts Wednesday for her role in a scheme that federal prosecutors say stole $250 million from a program meant to feed children in need.",
      "Aimee Bock \u2014 founder of Feeding our Future, the group at the heart of the plot \u2014 was one of 70 defendants charged in the overall case, which prosecutors said was the nation's single largest fraud scheme against COVID-19 relief programs.",
      "The Minnesota case has also drawn attention for an attempt to bribe a juror in an earlier trial and witness tampering in Bock's trial, which began last month. Thirty-seven defendants have already pleaded guilty, while five were convicted in a group of defendants who were tried last year.",
      "The jury also convicted a co-defendant, Salim Ahmed Said, owner of the now-defunct Safari Restaurant in Minneapolis.",
      "Bock, 44, and Said, 36, were charged with multiple counts involving conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery. Said was also charged with money laundering. Bock allegedly pocketed nearly $2 million, while Said was accused of taking around $5 million. They both maintained their innocence and testified at trial.",
      "U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel ordered them both held without bail pending their sentencing, for which she did not set a date.",
      "\u201cIt was the largest COVID fraud scheme in the country, and what Bock and and her co-defendants did was reprehensible.\u201d Lisa Kirkpatrick the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, said at a news conference afterward.",
      "\u201cDuring COVID, while so many were trying to be helpers, Bock and Said were thieves,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey used a time of crisis as their golden opportunity to enrich themselves and their criminal partners \u2014 outlandishly so. At every step of the way, Bock fought to keep her fraud scheme going. Today her efforts to lie, to blame others, to escape responsibility, all came to an end.\u201d",
      "Bock's attorney, Kenneth Udoibok, said there will be an appeal. While he has not decided what legal grounds might be used as its basis, he told The Associated Press that the jury could not have fairly considered all six weeks' worth of evidence in the few hours they deliberated after getting the case Wednesday morning.",
      "But lead prosecutor Joe Thompson called the scheme \u201cbrazen and corrupt\u201d and told reporters it tarnished Minnesota's reputation for good governance and civic mindedness as well as its high quality of life and low crime.",
      "\u201cThe Feeding Our Future case has come to symbolize the problem of fraud in our state,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt has become the shame of Minnesota. Hopefully today\u2019s verdict will help turn the page in this awful chapter in our state\u2019s history.\u201d",
      "Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who came under heavy criticism from Republicans who said his administration should have caught the fraud earlier, told reporters he remains \u201cfurious\u201d with \u201ccriminals that preyed on the system that was meant to feed children.\u201d But he pointed out that nobody in state government, which administered the federal funding, was ever charged in the case.",
      "\u201cWe just need to make sure that we put up more firewalls, more security, more ability to make sure that these criminals aren\u2019t able to prey on this,\u201d Walz said.",
      "Thompson said authorities have recovered only about $60 million of the $250 million that was stolen. He declined to speculate on what prosecutors might recommend for sentences but said Bock and Said face \u201csubstantial\u201d prison time.",
      "The defendants are being tried in several groups. The first trial was marred by an alleged attempt by some defendants and people linked with them to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash. That juror went straight to police. That led to tighter security for Bock\u2019s trial and additional precautions ordered by the judge.",
      "Despite all that, an allegation of witness tampering surfaced midway through the proceedings. A defendant scheduled for trial in August approached a government witness who was due to testify against Bock and Said and asked to speak with him in a courthouse bathroom. That witness declined and instead told his lawyer, who informed prosecutors.",
      "That defendant, Abdinasir Abshir, 32, of Lakeville, soon agreed to plead guilty to a wire fraud charge and to have his tampering attempt factored into a longer sentencing recommendation, which isn\u2019t binding on the judge.",

      "Members of the Sackler family who own the OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma would hand over the company and up to $7 billion in cash in the latest plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids",
      "Purdue Pharma asked a bankruptcy judge late Tuesday to consider the latest version of its plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of the powerful prescription painkiller OxyContin, a deal that would have members of the Sackler family who own the company pay up to $7 billion.",
      "The filing is a milestone in a tumultuous legal saga that has gone on for more than five years.",
      "Under the deal the family members \u2014 estimated in documents from 2020 and 2021 to be worth about $11 billion \u2014 would give up ownership of the company in addition to contributing money over 15 years with the biggest payment up front.",
      "Family members resigned from Purdue's board, stopped receiving money from the company and ceased other involvement before it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 as it faced lawsuits from thousands of state and local governments, plus others.",
      "The new entity would be run by a board appointed by state governments, and its mission will be to abate the opioid crisis that has been linked to hundreds of thousands of deaths in the U.S. since OxyContin hit the market in 1996. The first wave of deadly overdoses were tied to OxyContin and other prescription drugs, and subsequent waves have involved first heroin and more recently illicit versions of fentanyl.",
      "This settlement plan was hammered out in months of mediation involving groups that sued Purdue, and nearly all of them are supporting it, according to mediator reports filed in court.",
      "Approval would take at least several more months.",
      "A previous version had bankruptcy court approval but was rejected last year by the U.S. Supreme Court because it protected members of the Sackler family from civil lawsuits even though none of them filed for bankruptcy protection themselves.",
      "Under the new version, plaintiffs will have to opt in to get full shares of the settlement. If they do not, they can still sue Sackler family members, who agreed to put in about $1 billion more than under earlier plans. The Sacklers' cash contribution would depends in part on how many parties join the settlement and on the sale of foreign drug companies. Some of the money they put into the settlement is to be reserved to pay any judgments if they are sued and lose; but if that doesn't happen, it's to go into the main settlement.",
      "Members of the family have been cast as villains and have seen their name removed from art galleries and universities around the world because of their role in the privately held company. They continue to deny any wrongdoing.",
      "Other drugmakers, distribution companies, pharmacy chains and others have already reached opioid lawsuit settlements worth about $50 billion, according to an Associated Press tally. Purdue's, which would also include about $900 million from company coffers, would be among the largest if finalized.",
      "The deals require most of the money be used to fight the opioid crisis.",
      "Purdue's is the only major one that also provides direct money for victims \u2014 potentially more than $850 million total in pools for people who became addicted, their families and babies born in withdrawal. That figure is more than in the previous incarnation.",
      "The deadline to apply for a piece of those funds passed years ago. In earlier versions, individuals were expected to receive between about $3,500 and $48,000. Families were split over the deal.",
      "Purdue would also provide millions of documents to a repository that would make them public. The company has also been producing a low-cost version of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses.",

      "The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati is hearing arguments in a lawsuit pitting a suburban Ohio school district\u2019s policy on preferred pronouns against the free speech rights of classmates who believe there are only two genders",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati will hear arguments Wednesday in a legal dispute that pits a suburban Ohio school district's policy requiring use of students' preferred pronouns against the free speech rights of classmates who believe there are only two genders.",
      "The lawsuit brought by Parents Defending Education, a national Christian organization, against the Olentangy Local School District in 2023 has captured broad national attention from groups ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to the conservative Manhattan Institute. Ohio's solicitor general has asked to participate in oral arguments on behalf of 22 U.S. states that have interests in the case.",
      "A lower court rejected the group\u2019s arguments that the policies violated students\u2019 First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and a three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit affirmed that decision in July.",
      "The full court will reconsider that decision in a rare en banc hearing Wednesday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:",
      "The lawsuit takes issue with overlapping district policies that prohibit the use of gender-related language that other students might deem insulting, dehumanizing, unwanted or offensive and call for the use of peers' \u201cpreferred pronouns.\u201d",
      "The district's electronic devices policy \u2014 which applies both on and off school time \u2014 prohibits transmitting \u201cdisruptive\u201d material or material that could be seen as harassing or disparaging other students based on their gender identity or sexual orientation, among other categories.",
      "A separate antidiscrimination policy prohibits students from engaging in \u201cdiscriminatory language\u201d during times when they're under the school's authority. That is defined as \u201cverbal or written comments, jokes, and slurs that are derogatory towards an individual or group based on one or more of the following characteristics: race, color, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and transgender identity), disability, age, religion, ancestry, or genetic information.\u201d",
      "The district's code of conduct echoes many of the same themes a third time.",
      "Parents Defending Education, founded in 2021 amid the culture wars over schools\u2019 teachings on race, diversity and sexuality, argues that the policies compel students and parents who belong to their group to \u201caffirm an idea that gender is fluid\u201d in contradiction of their religious beliefs.",
      "\u201cThese students have views that the District disfavors,\u201d the group wrote in a court filing. \u201cSpecifically, they believe that people are either male or female, that biological sex is immutable, and that sex does not change based on someone\u2019s internal feelings. Accordingly, they \u2018d(o) not want to be forced to \u2018affirm\u2019 that a biologically female classmate is actually a male \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 or that a classmate is \u2019nonbinary' and neither male nor female.\u201d",
      "The group argues that the policies unconstitutionally compel \u201cviewpoint-based\u201d speech by forcing students who believe in only two genders to use pronouns that suggest otherwise. They say that violates the First Amendment's guarantees to free speech and similar protections contained in the 14th Amendment, particularly since students are subject to punishment for violating the policies.",
      "Parents Defending Education further challenges the electronic devices policy for applying outside school hours and off school property. The ACLU has sided with the parents' group on this point, arguing the district's policies are overbroad.",
      "Olentangy Local School District outside Columbus, one of the state's largest districts, maintains the policies protect students against abuse and harassment and asserts that Parents Defending Education represents \u201cChristian, cisgender\u201d students \"seeking dispensation under the free speech clause of the First Amendment to harass other students based on their gender identity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not illegal immigrants subject to deportation. They are not gay soldiers under Don't Ask Don't Tell. They're not African Americans in the Jim Crow south. They've not been systematically oppressed,\" the district's lawyers told the lower court. \"They're members of the majority who want to \u2014 under the guise of the First Amendment \u2014 openly voice their opposition to an historically maligned minority group, transgendered people.\u201d",
      "Olentangy argues that Parents Defending Education has failed to provide evidence of injury \u2014 as the lawsuit was filed before disciplinary action had been brought against any student. The district also says that its policies leave open other options for students who don't wish to use someone's preferred pronouns. That includes calling the person by their first name, using a gender-neutral pronoun or simply not referring to them at all.",
      "The availability of such options, an argument against the policies unconstitutionally compelling students to say certain things, played a role in the three-judge panel's 2-1 ruling in favor of the district last summer.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. births rose slightly last year, but experts don't see it as evidence of reversing a long-term decline.",
      "A little over 3.6 million births were reported for 2024, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention preliminary data. That's 22,250 more than the final tally of 2023 U.S. births, which was released Tuesday.",
      "The 2024 total is likely to grow at least a little when the numbers are finalized, but another set of preliminary data shows overall birth rates rose only for one group of people: Hispanic women.",
      "The rise \u2014 less than 1% \u2014 may just be a small fluctuation in the middle of a broader trend, said Hans-Peter Kohler, a University of Pennsylvania sociologist who studies family demographics.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be hesitant to read much into the 2023-24 increase, and certainly not as an indication of a reversal of the trend towards lower or declining U.S. fertility,\u201d Kohler said, adding that more analysis is needed to understand any changes that happened in birth patterns last year.",
      "U.S. births and birth rates have been falling for years. They dropped most years after the 2008-09 recession, aside from a 2014 uptick. They also dropped in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, then rose for two straight years after that, an increase experts partly attributed to pregnancies put off amid the pandemic.",
      "A 2% drop in 2023 put U.S. births at fewer than 3.6 million, the lowest one-year tally since 1979. Vermont had the lowest birth rate that year, and Utah had the highest, according to Tuesday's 86-page report on 2023 birth data.",
      "The report, based on a review of all the birth certificates filed that year, shows the average age of mothers at first birth has continued to rise, hitting 27 1/2 years. It was 21 1/2 in the early 1970s, before beginning a steady climb.",
      "Birth rates have long been falling for teenagers and younger women, but were rising for women in their 30s and 40s \u2014 a reflection of women pursuing education and careers before trying to start families, experts say. But in 2023, birth rates fell for women in almost all age groups, include women in their early 40s.",
      "Preliminary birth rate data for 2024 shows a continued decrease among teenagers and women in their early 20s. But it also showed increases for women in their late 20s, due entirely to a rise in births to Hispanic women. Increases also were seen for women in their 30s, due to rises among Hispanic and white women, and those in their 40s, due to rises among white women.",

      "A new report identifies ways to create resilient water and wastewater systems in communities hardest hit by climate change",
      "Malynndra Tome was helping to map livestock ponds in the Navajo Nation when she saw something that inspired her to act. An elderly woman was filling milk jugs with water at the back of a gas station in the Native American reservation, where about 30% of people live without running water.",
      "\u201cHow can we be living in the United States of America \u2026 one of the most powerful countries in the world, and people are living like this here?\u201d asked Tome, a citizen who grew up in the community of Ganado, Arizona, in the nation's largest Native American reservation at 27,000 square miles (69,930 square kilometers) in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.",
      "A report published Tuesday identifies ways historically neglected communities most vulnerable to climate change, like Tome\u2019s, can create resilient water and wastewater systems. Its highlights include nature-based solutions, tailoring approaches to each community and using technology \u2014 all the while recognizing barriers to implementing them.",
      "\u201cWhat we hope to do with this report, what I hope, is that it actually gives people hope,\u201d said Shannon McNeeley, a report author and senior researcher with the Pacific Institute, which published the report with DigDeep and the Center for Water Security and Cooperation. \u201cIn spite of some of the major federal funding sources becoming uncertain and possibly not available, I think people will find other ways.\u201d",
      "Weather extremes made worse by climate change have disrupted people\u2019s access to water.",
      "In September, more than 100,000 residents in western North Carolina were under boil-water notices for nearly two months after Hurricane Helene destroyed much of a local water system. In January, several water providers declared their drinking water unsafe after wildfires roared through Los Angeles. One utility in Pasadena, California, sent out its first notice since it began serving water more than a century ago.",
      "Aging water systems leak trillions of gallons, leaving residents in some of the country\u2019s poorest communities with a substantial financial burden to fix them.",
      "An estimated 30% of the population in the Navajo Nation lives in homes that don\u2019t have running water, and many residents drive long distances to get water from public spigots, according to the Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources and the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The report also notes that some federal resources and funding have become unavailable since Donald Trump returned to the White House. The Trump administration has cut or paused funding for critical water infrastructure projects, touted a reversal of diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and eliminated environmental justice policies meant to protect the communities the report centers on.",
      "Greg Pierce, director of the Human Right to Water Solutions Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the report \u201ccomes at a very depressing moment where we're not going to see federal action in this space, it doesn't seem, for the next four years.\u201d",
      "The report synthesizes existing literature about water, climate change and solutions. Its authors reviewed academic studies, government and private reports and interviewed experts to identify ways low-income and communities of color can build water and wastewater systems to withstand extreme weather.",
      "The report highlights technology like rainwater harvesting and gray water reuse systems that can decrease water demand and increase resilience to drought. But it adds that implementing and maintaining technology like it can be too expensive for poorer communities.",
      "The report also advocates nature-based solutions such as wetlands, which studies find can reduce the length and severity of droughts, provide flood control, reduce or remove pollutants in water and protect water supplies. Communities across the country are increasingly recognizing the benefits of wetlands. In Florida\u2019s Everglades, for example, officials have spent billions of dollars to build engineered wetlands that clean and protect a vital drinking water source.",
      "The report argues for government-funded water assistance programs to help poorer households pay water and sewer bills, like the Low Income Household Water Assistance Program launched during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Gregory Moller, a professor in the soil and water systems department at the University of Idaho, notes that some approaches are too complex and expensive for smaller or poorer communities. \u201cOur innovations also have to be on a scale and stage that is adaptable to small systems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I think some of the most serious challenges are.\u201d",
      "Some solutions the report highlights are benefiting communities. In the Navajo Nation, hundreds of solar-powered home water systems have brought running water to more than 2,000 people. Kimberly Lemme, an executive director at DigDeep, which is installing the systems, said it can be a complex and lengthy process. But it shows that solutions do exist.",
      "\u201cWater is a basic human right,\u201d said Tome, whose encounter with the elderly woman inspired her to pursue a doctorate in water resources. \u201cAnd in order for people to live productively, to have healthy lives, I think water is a big part of that.\u201d",

      "A new study out Monday finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef is no less carbon-intensive than industrial beef",
      "For cattle fattened in fields instead of feedlots, the grass may be greener, but the carbon emissions are not.",
      "A study out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef produces no less planet-warming carbon emissions than industrial beef. The finding calls into question the frequent promotion of grass-fed beef as a more environmentally friendly option. Still, other scientists say grass-fed beef wins out on other factors like animal welfare or local environmental pollution, complicating the choice for conscientious consumers.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a large portion of the population who really do wish their purchasing decisions will reflect their values,\u201d said Gidon Eshel, a research professor of environmental physics at Bard College and one of the study's authors. \u201cBut they are being misled, essentially, by the wrong information.\u201d",
      "When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it\u2019s being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.",
      "The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.",
      "Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn\u2019t make up for the emissions of the cattle.",
      "Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions \u201cwithout concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,\u201d like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.",
      "The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.",
      "Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper \u201chelps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,\u201d she said.",
      "Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.",
      "It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is \u201csecond to none\u201d when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,\" Eshel said.",
      "For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, \"don't make beef a habit.\"",

    "story": [
      "A three-judge panel has ruled that Ohio\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for minors is unconstitutional and ordered it permanently blocked by a trial court",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio's ban on gender-affirming care for minors is unconstitutional and must be permanently blocked from being enforced, a three-judge panel of appellate judges ruled Tuesday. The law also banned trans women and girls from participating in female sports.",
      "The state attorney general vowed an immediate appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, the state 10th District Court of Appeals reversed a lower court judge's decision last summer to allow the law to go into effect, after finding it \u201creasonably limits parents' rights.\u201d The law bans counseling, gender-affirming surgery and hormone therapy for minors, unless they are already receiving such therapies and a doctor deems it risky to stop.",
      "The litigation was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Ohio and the global law firm Goodwin, who argued the law not only denies health care to transgender children and teens, but specifically discriminates against them accessing it.",
      "The appellate court agreed, in a 2-1 majority opinion written by Judge Carly Edelstein, and cited a number of flaws in the lower court's reasoning.",
      "The judge cited a number of flaws in the lower court\u2019s reasoning. She said that the Ohio law does not outlaw identical drugs when they're used for other reasons, only when they're used for gender transitioning, which makes it discriminatory. She also said that a prescription ban is not a reasonable exercise of the state's police power when it is weighed against the rights of parents to care for their children.",
      "Addressing proponents' arguments that minors are not in a position to understand the long-term impacts such procedures could have on their lives, the judge said that, while they may not be, their parents are.",
      "\u201cThus, in considering whether the H.B. 68 ban is reasonable, it is necessary to keep in mind that the law recognizes the maturity, experience, and capacity of parents to make difficult judgments and act in their children\u2019s best interest,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The ACLU called the ruling \u201chistoric.\u201d",
      "\"This win restores the right of trans youth in Ohio to choose vitally important health care, with the support of their families and physicians,\" Freda Levenson, legal director of the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement. \u201cWe are gratified by the Court\u2019s decision, which soundly rejects this interference of politicians with Ohioans\u2019 bodily autonomy.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's ruling marked the second blow for the legislation.",
      "Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed the law in December 2023, after touring the state to visit children\u2019s hospitals and talking to families of children with gender dysphoria. He cast his action as thoughtful, limited and \u201cpro-life\u201d \u2014 citing the suicide risks associated with minors who don't get proper treatment for gender dysphoria.",
      "DeWine simultaneously announced plans to move to administratively ban gender-affirming surgeries until a person is 18, and to position the state to better regulate and track gender-affirming treatments in both children and adults. He hoped the move would allay concerns of fellow Republicans at the Ohio Statehouse, but the administration swiftly backed off that plan after transgender adults raised serious concerns about how state regulations could impact their lives and health.",
      "Ohio lawmakers stood their ground on the bill, easily overriding his veto \u2014 making Ohio the 23rd state to ban gender-affirming health care for trans youth.",
      "Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a candidate to succeed DeWine next year who serves as the Legislature's lawyer, quickly released a statement saying that he will appeal Tuesday's ruling.",
      "\u201cThis is a no-brainer \u2013 we are appealing that decision and will seek an immediate stay,\" he said. \u201cThere is no way I\u2019ll stop fighting to protect these unprotected children.\u201d",
      "Levenson acknowledged that Tuesday's ruling was likely not the end of the legal dispute, but she said in a statement that her organization remained \u201cfervently committed\u201d to preventing the bill from ever taking effect again.",

      "Arizona highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of all rulings issued by the justices",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona's highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of every ruling issued by the justices, marking what is believed to be the first example in the U.S. of a state court system tapping artificial intelligence to build more human-like characters to connect with the public.",
      "A court in Florida uses an animated chatbot to help visitors navigate its website, but the Arizona Supreme Court is charting new territory with the creation of Victoria and Daniel. Made of pixels, the two avatars have a different job in that they serve as the face of news coming from the court just as a spokesperson made of flesh and blood would do \u2014 but faster.",
      "The use of AI has touched nearly every profession and discipline, growing exponentially in recent years and showing infinite potential when it comes to things as simple as internet searches or as complex as brain surgery. For officials with the Arizona Supreme Court, their venture into AI is rooted in a desire to promote trust and confidence in the judicial system.",
      "There was a protest outside the state Capitol last April and calls for two justices to be booted after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that a Civil War-era law that banned nearly all abortions, except when a woman\u2019s life is in jeopardy, could be enforced. Emotions flared on both sides of the issue.",
      "When Chief Justice Ann Timmer took over the court last summer, she made public trust a key pillar of her platform. She had already been thinking about ways to reach out to the public using digital media for a few years, and the abortion ruling, among other rulings, helped her to solidify the idea that the court needs to be part of the narrative as people learn about opinions and what they mean.",
      "\u201cWe serve the public better by saying, OK, we\u2019ve issued this decision,\" she said. \"Now, let us help you understand what it is.\u201d",
      "Timmer told The Associated Press earlier this year that if the court had to do the abortion ruling over again, it would have approached the dissemination of information differently. In a Wednesday interview, she said that a news release and avatar video could have helped the public better understand the legal underpinnings of the lengthy decision \u2014 possibly including what it didn't do, which she said some misunderstood.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of backlash for it and probably deservedly so, in terms of how can we complain that people don\u2019t understand what we did when we didn\u2019t really do enough to give a simplified version,\" she said in the January interview, explaining that people want to know the basis for the court\u2019s decisions and what they can do, such as lobbying state lawmakers for whatever changes in law would support their positions.",
      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a repeal of the ban last May, and in November, Arizona voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding abortion access up to the point of fetal viability.",
      "Created with a program called Creatify, Daniel and Victoria in a way bring to life the court's news releases. Videos featuring one or the other are being posted for every ruling by the high court, and may be used for Access to Justice projects, community programs and civics information in the future.",
      "The court has been sending out releases since October to summarize and explain rulings. After seeing success with the releases, it began exploring options to convey that information through video.",
      "The AI-generated avatars were the most efficient way to produce videos and get the information out, said court spokesperson Alberto Rodriguez. Producing a video usually can take hours, he said, but an AI-generated video is ready in about 30 minutes. The court might introduce more AI-generated reporters in the future, Rodriguez said in a news release.",
      "The justice who authors the legal opinion also drafts a news release, the wording of which must be approved by the entire bench. The justice then works with the court's communications team to craft a script for the avatars \u2014 the avatars aren't interpreting original court decisions or opinions, Rodriguez said.",
      "Daniel and Victoria's names and physical appearances were designed to represent a wide cross-section of people, Rodriguez said. He said they aren\u2019t meant to come off as real people and the court emphasizes their AI origins with disclaimers. The court is exploring different emotional deliveries, cadences and pronunciations as well as Spanish translations for the avatars, Rodriguez said.",
      "Mason Kortz, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, described the court's new cyber employees as \"quite realistic.\" While their voices might give them away, he said some people could be fooled into thinking that Daniel and Victoria are real reporters if viewers are only reading the subtitles and looking at the characters' movements and facial expressions.",
      "Kortz also said it would be better for the language of the disclaimer that is in the videos' text description to be featured more prominently.",
      "\u201cYou want to make it as hard as possible for someone to advertently or inadvertently remove the disclaimer,\u201d he said.",
      "Asheley Landrum, associate professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, said the avatars feel robotic. She said a format that mimics real dialogue and storytelling might be more engaging than an AI reading of a news release.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s not just about using AI or even creating videos,\u201d she said, \u201cbut about doing so in a way that really resonates with audiences.\u201d",
      "Still, it's fine line. She said engaging characteristics can help to build trust over time but the danger is that content could appear biased.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Thousands of employees returned to the Food and Drug Administration's headquarters Monday to find overflowing parking lots, long security lines and makeshift office spaces without chairs and other basic supplies.",
      "The FDA is the latest agency scrambling to meet the Trump administration\u2019s return-to-office mandate, part of a flurry of actions \u2014 including firings and buyouts \u2014 intended to radically shrink the federal workforce. Monday was the first day that all rank-and-file FDA staffers were required to report to offices, including the agency\u2019s 130-acre campus just outside Washington.",
      "The Associated Press spoke with more than a half-dozen FDA staffers who described long lines to park and clear security, followed by hours of hunting for space and supplies in offices that were not designed to accommodate the agency\u2019s full workforce. The staffers spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media.",
      "One staffer described \u201cchaos and lost work hours\" for commuting, security lines and shuffled office space.",
      "About half the FDA\u2019s 20,000 scientists, attorneys, inspectors and support staff report to the agency\u2019s main campus in White Oak, Maryland, which until the late 1990s was a naval weapons testing facility.",
      "While many agencies switched to telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA began embracing the practice a decade earlier. Most employees had the option to work from home at least two days a week \u2014 flexibility that was seen as a competitive perk for recruiting highly trained experts who can often earn more working in industry.",
      "By 7:30 a.m., many on-campus parking lots were full, with cars parked along side streets, according to employees. Some workers reported waiting up to one hour to clear security checkpoints, and photos viewed by the AP showed lines of employees winding out doorways, along sidewalks and around corners.",
      "Once inside, employees confronted broken desks, missing chairs and locked offices for which they didn\u2019t have keys.",
      "\u201cAll of the staff is definitely bending over backwards to make an impossible situation work and get their work done,\u201d said one employee.",
      "Some employees were left to scour the campus for chairs and other essentials.",
      "\u201cPeople are looting chairs from conference rooms and other buildings,\u201d a staffer said. \u201cWe have no supplies. People are hunting around all of the buildings on campus for pads of paper and other basics.\u201d",
      "When employees did get situated, many shared cramped spaces with people from different divisions and teams, making it difficult to hold calls and meetings. Photos shared with the AP show folding chairs and tables setup in hallways and lobbies.",
      "An FDA spokesman said in an email Monday the agency \u201cis continuing its return-to-office activities to ensure staff remain able to conduct their important public health work.\u201d",
      "All the employees told the AP that they brought their own drinking water Monday. That\u2019s due to a monthslong issue involving Legionella, the bacteria that causes Legionnaires\u2019 disease, which was detected at several FDA buildings. The General Service Administration, which oversees federal buildings, has been working on the issue since last summer.",
      "FDA staff received an email earlier this month that all water is safe to drink, but it did not detail the latest testing results or corrective actions taken.",
      "Anthony Lee, who represents the local chapter of the federal union for FDA employees, said the agency has not granted the group's request for a meeting on the issue.",
      "Asked about the water, one staffer said: \u201cHonestly, none of us have tried it. After months of Legionella warnings, it\u2019s not very inviting.\"",

      "Democrats, meanwhile, will question Oz's tax filings, which they say show he has used a tax code loophole to underpay taxes by thousands of dollars on Medicare, the program he'll oversee. They will also grill Oz on any cuts he would make to the health insurance coverage as well as comments on his TV show supporting privatized Medicare.",

      "Oz\u2019s net worth is between $98 million and $332 million, according to an analysis of the disclosure, which lists asset values in ranges but does not give precise dollar figures. His most recent disclosure shows he also holds millions of dollars worth of shares in health insurance, fertility, pharmaceutical and vitamin companies. He has promised to divest from dozens of companies that would pose conflicts for him as the CMS administrator.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's attorney general on Wednesday reported irregularities in an investigation by state authorities into an alleged cartel killing site and training camp at a ranch in the western state of Jalisco where people searching for relatives found hundreds of articles of clothing and other personal effects.",
      "The ranch in the town of Teuchitlan, outside Guadalajara, was found by authorities in September 2024. Six months later, a so-called search collective found charred bone fragments and personal items, raising questions about the original investigation by the Jalisco State Prosecutor's Office.",
      "Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero, whose office took over the investigation last week, said that investigators in Jalisco failed to register evidence and fingerprints and process vehicles found at the ranch, three of which were later stolen.",
      "He said local authorities didn\u2019t investigate the ownership of the ranch and failed to scientifically analyze locations at the ranch to understand if they were used as crematoriums. Investigators did not arrest local officials who have been linked to activities at the ranch, he said.",
      "Gertz Manero said federal prosecutors were also not alerted about the site, as is standard procedure, and cast blame on the state prosecutor\u2019s office despite the National Guard carrying out an operation at the site carried out last year. There is still not enough information to confirm if the ranch was used to cremate bodies or train cartel members, he added.",
      "The Jalisco Search Warriors group last week shared images that shocked many in a country that's long accustomed to stark news of cartel warfare, forced disappearances and government corruption. The images and videos showed dozens of shoes, piles of clothing and what appeared to be human bone fragments.",
      "Such collectives have long risked their lives to seek answers about what has happened to Mexico\u2019s 120,000 disappeared people in the face of rampant impunity.",
      "Vigils took place over the weekend for the victims of the alleged site.",
      "On Monday, a video was circulated showing masked and heavily armed men who read a statement identifying themselves as the Jalisco New Generation cartel and questioning the motivations of the searchers.",

      "TOKYO -- Thirty years on from the fatal sarin nerve gas attack in Tokyo's subway network, survivors and families who lost loved ones are still seeking justice.",
      "Thirteen people were killed and thousands were sickened when cult members released sarin nerve gas in the capital's subway trains on March 20, 1995. The attack remains one of the most shocking atrocities in Japan, a country known for its low crime rates.",
      "The cult, Aum Shinrikyo or Supreme Truth, has since disbanded. Its founder, Shoko Asahara, and 12 of his disciples were executed in 2018.",
      "But 1,600 former members still operate under renamed groups and have ignored an order to pay damages to survivors and bereaved families.",
      "Shizue Takahashi lost her husband, a deputy station master, in the attack. The couple was just starting to enjoy time to themselves after raising three children when tragedy struck.",
      "\u201cMy life is still being ruined by Aum and its successor groups,\u201d said Takahashi, 78. \u201cWe need to carry on and not let the memories fade.\u201d",
      "At 8 a.m. during the morning rush, five cult members got on separate train cars on three subway lines converging at Kasumigaseki, Japan\u2019s government center, each dropping bags of sarin on the train floors. They punctured the bags with umbrellas, releasing the gas inside the train cars.",
      "Within minutes, commuters poured out of the trains onto the platforms, rubbing their eyes and gasping for air. Some collapsed. Others fled onto the streets where ambulances and rescue workers in hazmat suits gave first-aid.",
      "Kazumasa Takahashi didn\u2019t know the puddle he was cleaning on the subway car floor was sarin. He collapsed as he removed a bag \u2014 a sacrifice some survivors say saved lives \u2014 and never woke up.",
      "The attack sickened more than 6,000. A 14th victim died in 2020 after battling severe after-effects.",
      "The subway gassing happened after a botched police investigation failed to link the cult to earlier crimes, says Yuji Nakamura, a lawyer for the survivors and the bereaved families. \u201cIt could have been prevented,\" he said.",
      "Two days after the gassing, Tokyo police, carrying a caged canary to detect poison, raided Aum\u2019s headquarters near Mount Fuji, where the cultists lived together, trained and produced sarin. Asahara was found in a hidden compartment.",
      "Born Chizuo Matsumoto in 1955, Asahara founded Aum Shinrikyo in 1984. The cult combined Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and yoga, and attracted young people disillusioned with materialism. He taught that death could elevate their spirits and justified killing as a virtue.",
      "Followers paid to drink Asahara\u2019s bathwater and wore electrical head gear they believed synchronized their brain waves with the guru\u2019s. He prophesized an imminent apocalypse, which only true believers would survive.",
      "Asahara gathered doctors, lawyers and scientists from Japan\u2019s top universities as his closest aides.",
      "Using donations from followers and earnings from yoga classes and health food businesses, they bought land and equipment. Asahara\u2019s scientists developed and manufactured sarin, VX and other chemical and biological weapons.",
      "In 1989, its members killed Tsutsumi Sakamoto, a lawyer who opposed the cult, his wife and baby boy. Their criminal activities escalated after their defeat in the 1990 parliamentary elections. A 1994 sarin attack in the central Japanese city of Matsumoto killed eight and injured more than 140 others.",
      "In all, Aum killed 27 people in more than a dozen attacks that culminated in the subway gassing. It was part of a plot by Asahara to hasten Armageddon, envisioning overthrowing the government.",
      "Shizue Takahashi attended most of the Aum criminal trials. She has lobbied for government support, winning the enactment of a law to support crime victims and government benefits of 3 billion yen ($20 million) for more than 6,000 survivors and bereaved families of the Aum crimes.",
      "The government has also enacted laws banning sarin production and possession, and restricted the activities of groups linked to mass killings. Police have since established nuclear, biological and chemical weapons units and beefed up training.",
      "Aum\u2019s main successor, Aleph, has ignored a court order to pay 1 billion yen ($6.7 million) in compensation to survivors and bereaved families. The group has allegedly hidden billions of yen of income from yoga and spiritual seminars.",
      "Many of the subway gassing survivors still suffer health problems and trauma, according to support groups.",
      "Takahashi and others last week called on Justice Minister Keisuke Suzuki to do more to accelerate compensation by Aleph and keep them under close watch.",
      "Survivors and their supporters say lessons have not been sufficiently shared with the public.",
      "Shoko Egawa, a journalist and expert on Aum crimes, says attention on the group has largely focused on its crimes rather than teaching people to stay away from dangerous cults. \u201cThere is still a lot to learn from (the Aum problems), including how they attracted followers, so that we can prevent people from getting their lives ruined by cults,\u201d Egawa said.",
      "Takahashi recently launched a website that compiles articles and comments by survivors, lawyers and writers, including Haruki Murakami\u2019s 2007 article about his 1997 book \u201cUnderground.\u201d",
      "At its peak, the cult boasted more than 10,000 followers in Japan and 30,000 in Russia and elsewhere. Aum has disbanded, but about 1,600 people belonging to Aleph and two smaller groups in Japan still practice Asahara\u2019s teachings, said the Public Security Intelligence Agency, which monitors the groups.",
      "Minoru Kariya, whose father was killed by Aum members in early 1995 while he was trying to get his sister to quit the cult, said authorities need to do much more to tackle the threat.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s scary that they still exist and are operating as organizations and recruiting new followers,\u201d he said.",

      "MADRID -- Spain adopted a measure Wednesday to redistribute thousands of unaccompanied underage migrants currently sheltered on the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off northwest Africa where thousands of people arrive by boat each year trying to reach Europe.",
      "The reform ends a months-long political stalemate between Spain\u2019s regions and the central government and is aimed at easing pressure on overcrowded migrant reception centers, mainly in the Canary Islands.",
      "For several months, local leaders in the Canaries have complained about a lack of resources to shelter the thousands of unaccompanied children and teenagers, many of them from West Africa, who reached their shores.",
      "In Spain, which has a population of 49 million, the central government handles the treatment of adult migrants, while regional governments are responsible for unaccompanied minors.",
      "After the measure was approved Tuesday, \u00c1ngel Victor Torres, the government minister in charge of Spain's relations with its regions, called the measure a \u201cmilestone in the defense of human rights\u201d and the rights of minors.",
      "\u201cIt would be good for anyone with doubts to visit a migrant (reception) center,\u201d said Torres, who previously led the Canary Islands regional government. \"And see that in spaces for 20 people, there are 300 people, and that they are kids of 15 years, 10 years and five years.\"",
      "For regions such as the Canary Islands and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta in North Africa who cannot host more unaccompanied minors, the measure would allow for some of them to be transferred to other regions in Spain, factoring in a region's population, per capita income, unemployment rate and other considerations.",
      "The Canary Islands are sheltering more than 5,000 unaccompanied minors across the archipelago. Some 4,000 migrants will be transferred elsewhere within mainland Spain.",
      "While final numbers are still being hashed out, the wealthy Catalonia region that includes Barcelona will only receive between 20 and 30 unaccompanied minors, a spokesperson for the Junts per Catalunya party said.",
      "The support of Catalan-separatist party Junts for the measure was key to Spain's Socialist-led minority government clinching a deal.",
      "The strip of Atlantic ocean between West Africa and the Canary Islands is one of the world's deadliest migration routes. Nearly 47,000 people who made the crossing last year reached the archipelago, shattering previous records for a second time. Most were citizens of Mali, Senegal and Morocco, with many boarding boats to Spain from the coast of Mauritania.",
      "Numbers so far this year are down, according to Spain's Interior Ministry. Almost 11,000 migrants have reached Spain this year by sea as of March 15, a 21% decrease from the same period last year.",

      "LONDON -- A 19-year-old British man who shot and killed his mother and two younger siblings and who wanted to carry out a high-profile school shooting has been told he will not be eligible for parole for at least 49 years.",
      "At the sentencing hearing at Luton Crown Court on Wednesday, Justice Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said she had considered handing Nicholas Prosper a full life order in prison but opted against that given his age \u2014 he was 18 at the time of the shootings \u2014 and the fact that he had pleaded guilty,",
      "Last month, Prosper admitted at a hearing to murdering his mother Juliana Falcon, 48, and his 13-year-old sister Giselle Prosper and 16-year-old brother Kyle Prosper at the apartment the family shared in Luton, Bedfordshire, on Sept. 13.",
      "The judge said Prosper had wanted to emulate and outdo the U.S. school massacres at Sandy Hook in Dec. 2012 and Virginia Tech in April 2007.",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Teguh Islean Septura groans in pain as each staccato rat-a-tat-tat of the laser fires an intense beam at the elaborate tattoos on his arm. But the former musician's determination to \u201crepent\u201d in the holy month of Ramadan is enough to keep him going.",
      "The 30-year-old guitarist got his back, arms and legs tattooed to \u201clook cool\u201d when he was performing in a band. But these days Septura has a newfound zeal for Islam, including the conviction that Muslims should not alter the body that God gave them.",
      "\u201cAs humans, sometimes we make mistakes. Now I want to improve myself by moving closer to God,\u201d Seputra said, as a health worker aimed the white laser wand at Septura\u2019s skin, blasting the red, green and black pigments with its penetrating light. \u201cGod gave me clean skin and I ruined it, that\u2019s what I regret now.\"",
      "Septura is among a growing number of people in Indonesia's capital who have signed up for free tattoo removal services offered by Amil Zakat National Agency, an Islamic charity organization, during Ramadan to give practicing Muslims an opportunity to \u201crepent.\"",
      "Launched in 2019, the tattoo removal program is now held every Ramadan, a month of fasting, increased worship, religious reflection and good deeds. Some 700 people have signed up for the services this year, and in total nearly 3,000 people have taken part.",
      "\u201cWe want to pave the way for people who want to hijrah (to move closer to God), including those who want to remove their tattoos\u201d said Mohammad Asep Wahyudi, a coordinator of the event. He added that many people cannot afford to remove their tattoos or know where and how they can do so safely.",
      "Laser removal, which takes repeated treatment and may not be completely successful, could cost thousands of dollars for tattoos as extensive as Septura's.",
      "Tattooing remains strongly associated with gangs and criminality in some Asian cultures. In addition to the religious prohibitions in Muslim-majority Indonesia, ideas about tattoos also reveal oppressive attitudes toward women, who if tattooed can be labeled as promiscuous or disreputable and not worth marrying.",
      "Sri Indrayati, 52, said she tattooed the name of her first daughter on her hand shortly after she gave birth to her at the age of 22. She said she regretted it when her two grandchildren kept asking her to erase it because it looked like dirty, thick marker writing.",

      "Another woman, Evalia Zadora, got a tattoo of a large star on her back and the words \"Hope, Love and Rock & Roll\u201d on her upper chest as a teen to gain acceptance into a gang. She wants to remove them now to move closer to God and out of consideration for her family.",
      "\u201cBad image (against people with tattoos) is not a big deal for me, but it affected my husband and son,\u201d said Zadora, 36. \u201cThey are not comfortable with my tattoos and I respect their feelings, so I want to remove it.",

      "A multi-year cleanup at a former U.S. air base in Vietnam was abruptly halted when the Trump administration cut funding, leaving tons of dioxin-contaminated soil exposed",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- At a former American air base in southern Vietnam, work abruptly stopped last month on efforts to clean up tons of soil contaminated with deadly dioxin from the military\u2019s Agent Orange defoliant.",
      "The Trump administration's broad cuts to USAID also halted efforts to clear unexploded American munitions and landmines, a rehabilitation program for war victims, and work on a museum exhibit detailing U.S. efforts to remediate the damage of the Vietnam War.",
      "In addition to exposing thousands of people to health hazards, the cuts risk jeopardizing hard-won diplomatic gains with Vietnam, which is strategically increasingly important as the U.S. looks for support in its efforts to counter a growingly aggressive China.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help at all,\u201d said Chuck Searcy, an American Vietnam War veteran who has dedicated his time to humanitarian programs in the country for the last three decades. \u201cIt is just another example of what a lot of critics want to remind us of: You can\u2019t depend on the Americans. It is not a good message.\u201d",
      "Funding for the Agent Orange cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base was unfrozen about a week after it was stopped, but it\u2019s unclear whether funds are fully flowing or how they\u2019ll be disbursed, with no USAID employees left to administer operations, said Tim Rieser, a senior adviser to Sen. Peter Welch, who drafted a letter to administration officials signed by Welch and more than a dozen other Democratic senators urging the continued funding of the programs.",
      "Other programs remain cut.",
      "\u201cThey have reversed a number of these arbitrary decisions, but we\u2019re far from out of the woods and we don\u2019t know how this is going to end,\u201d Rieser said.",
      "The interruptions to aid comes as the U.S. and Vietnam prepare to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War and the 30th anniversary of the normalization of relations between Washington and Hanoi.",
      "It was a slow road back from the war, which lasted some 20 years and saw more than 58,000 Americans, and many times that number of Vietnamese, killed before it finally ended in 1975.",
      "Starting in the 1990s, the U.S. began helping its former enemy address wartime legacies like Agent Orange, a herbicide dropped from planes during the war to clear jungle brush, and which was later found to cause a wide range of health problems, including cancer and birth defects.",
      "The two countries have since been increasing defense and security cooperation as China has become increasingly assertive in the region. In 2023, Vietnam elevated relations with the U.S. to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest level of cooperation and the same as Russia and China.",
      "On Inauguration Day, Trump issued an executive order directing a freeze of foreign assistance funding and a review of all U.S. aid and development work abroad, charging that much of foreign assistance was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.",
      "But Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Feb. 7 \u201cunderscored the department\u2019s support for ongoing efforts to collaborate on the legacy of war issues,\u201d in his introductory call with his Vietnamese counterpart, according to the Defense Department.",
      "Twenty days later, the administration ordered all but a fraction of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, staffers off the job and terminated at least 83% of its contracts and cut programs globally, including in Vietnam.",
      "Rieser, who was retired Sen. Patrick Leahy\u2019s foreign policy aide when the Vermont Democrat secured the original funding for Vietnam War remediation projects, said the idea that money was being wasted is \u201cfactually wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur foreign aid advances our own national interests, and if the Trump administration doesn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s hard to know what to say,\u201d he said.",
      "A U.S. project to clean up from the former Da Nang Air Base was successfully completed in 2018, giving rise to the Bien Hoa cleanup effort outside of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon.",
      "The contamination at Bien Hoa, the busiest airport in the world during the war, was nearly four times greater than in Da Nang, with some 500,000 cubic meters (650,000 cubic yards) of dioxin-contaminated soil and sediment.",
      "As of 2024, the province in which Bien Hoa is located had more than 8,600 people still suffering from Agent Orange-related health issues, according to local authorities.",
      "Work began in 2020 on a 10-year project funded by USAID and the Department of Defense, with an estimated cost of $430 million overall. Soil with low levels of dioxin contamination were to be unearthed and taken to secure landfills, while highly contaminated soil was to be taken to short-term storage for treatment.",
      "Workers have already excavated more than 100,000 cubic meters of dioxin-contaminated soil, with 13 hectares treated. Ground was to be broken next month on the construction of a system to treat the most severely contaminated soil.",
      "\u201cYou have to wonder if the people who made the decision to freeze these funds know anything about the tragic history of the U.S. and Vietnam ... and they must not care about the many thousands of tons of severely contaminated soil that is exposing tens of thousands of people to a very serious health risk,\u201d Rieser said.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Hanoi and USAID referred all questions on the war legacy projects to the State Department in Washington.",
      "In a one-line email, the State Department said that \u201cUSAID has three contracts conducting dioxin remediation at Bien Hoa in Vietnam that are active and running.\u201d",
      "Asked to elaborate on how long the Bien Hoa project was shut down and what operations had resumed, as well as the status of other war legacy programs, the State Department said \u201cwe have nothing to share on the details of these programs at this time.\u201d",
      "Vietnam\u2019s Defense Ministry referred questions to the Foreign Ministry, which did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "But in a Feb. 13 press conference, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pham Thu Hang expressed concern about what could happen if American funding for war legacy projects, which amounts to some $200 million per year, were to end.",
      "\u201cThe suspension of USAID-supported projects, especially those on clearing bombs and explosives left over from the war, as well as the Bien Hoa airport detoxification project, will have a strong impact on human safety as well as the environment in the project areas,\u201d she said.",
      "On Tuesday, a U.S. federal judge ruled that the dismantling of USAID likely violated the U.S. Constitution and blocked further cuts, but stopped short of reversing firings or fully resurrecting the agency.",
      "Sen. Leahy, who retired in 2023, told The Associated Press that it had been a lengthy process over the last 35 years to build the relationship by working hand-in-hand with the Vietnamese to address the problems left behind.",
      "\u201cIt is through these efforts that two former enemies are now partners. If we pack up and leave without finishing what we started, it will send a message that the Americans can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d he wrote in an email.",
      "\u201cPeople in the Trump administration who know nothing and care less about these programs are arbitrarily jeopardizing relations with a strategic partner in one of the most challenging regions of the world.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s too early to say exactly how the abrupt decision will affect relations, but it is likely to call into question whether Washington is still a reliable partner in other dealings, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a political scientist who is a visiting fellow in the Vietnam Studies Program at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute.",
      "\u201cThe level of trust gradually increased and it is very easy to dismantle,\u201d he said, adding that Vietnam may now think twice before deepening military cooperation ties or purchasing American weapons.",
      "\u201cThere is good reason for Hanoi to be very cautious.\u201d",
      "One joint program not affected by the USAID cuts is ongoing efforts to find and identify missing American troops, the Hawaii-based Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency in Hawaii told the AP. Funding for the effort falls under the U.S. defense budget rather than foreign aid.",
      "But funding for the effort to find and identify hundreds of thousands of missing Vietnamese war victims was cut, then reinstated, and it\u2019s still unclear whether money is again flowing, Rieser said.",
      "And, he said, funds remain frozen for a new U.S. exhibit at the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\u2019s main museum on the war, which is currently focused on documenting American atrocities like the My Lai massacre and the devastating impact of Agent Orange.",
      "The exhibit, which was to open this year to coincide with the two anniversaries, highlights U.S. efforts to address the worst legacies of the war, Rieser said.",
      "\u201cRight now it\u2019s a museum of American war crimes and the whole point of this is to show that we didn\u2019t just walk away from what happened, we decided to do something about it,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe want that to be part of the story for the hundreds of thousands of visitors to that museum, to show that the United States didn\u2019t just walk away.\u201d",

      "Strikes hit Sanaa, Yemen's rebel-held capital, as well as their stronghold of Saada in the country's northwest on Wednesday night, the Houthi's al-Maisrah satellite news channel reported.",
      "It also said strikes happened overnight Tuesday, though the U.S. military has not offered a breakdown of places targeted since the airstrikes campaign began. The first strikes this weekend killed at least 53 people, including children, and wounded others.",

Tehran routinely denies arming the rebels, despite physical evidence, numerous seizures and experts tying the weapons back to Iran. That\u2019s likely because Tehran wants to avoid sanctions for violating a United Nations arms embargo on the Houthis.",
      "The Houthi rebels attacked over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, from November 2023 until January this year when a ceasefire began in Gaza. The campaign also greatly raised the Houthis\u2019 profile in the wider Arab world and tamped down on public criticism against their human rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent and aid workers.",

      "Five months after deadly floods ravaged Valencia, the Spanish city is hosting its biggest celebration of the year",
      "VALENCIA, Spain -- The enormous blue cone slowly crushes tiny piles of sand that represent houses. It symbolizes the deadly havoc wrought by floods that ravaged Spain's eastern Valencia five months ago.",
      "The artwork is one of hundreds of wood and papier-mach\u00e9 sculptures that are painstakingly crafted \u2014 and then burned \u2014 when Las Fallas, the most important yearly celebration in Valencia, reaches its climax on Wednesday night.",
      "This year\u2019s festival has taken on special meaning. There is hope that the burning ceremony, or Crema, will provide some catharsis for the city and surrounding villages after over 220 people died in October\u2019s flooding.",
      "UNESCO, which added Las Fallas to its catalog of intangible cultural heritage in 2016, describes the incineration of the sculptures as \u201ca form of purification\" and \"social renewal.\u201d",
      "The festival originated in the 18th century, according to UNESCO, and now brings together some 200,000 people for the event that runs from March 14-19, culminating in the day of St. Joseph.",
      "Spain's King Felipe VI visited the party on Wednesday to show his continued support for flood victims. The king had been pelted by mud when he visited a hard-hit area along with politicians in the immediate aftermath of the floods.",
      "The sculptures made by local artisans can tower over 20 meters (65 feet). This year, some were built using wreckage from peoples\u2019 homes.",
      "Others lampoon politicians accused of mishandling the catastrophe. And U.S. President Donald Trump was depicted unfavorably in a few sculptures \u2014 one alongside Elon Musk \u2014 after his wavering on Europe's defense.",
      "But \u201cNada,\" or \u201cNothing,\u201d the wooden cone by artist Miguel Hache, stands out for directly taking on the pain of the floods.",
      "Passersby can use cardboard molds to make little houses of sand, then roll the cone to flatten them, evoking the brutality of the rushing waters. In its path, the cone leaves an imprint of a street map of the southern neighborhoods where the deluge was the heaviest.",
      "\u201cIf I had to sum my work in one phrase, I would call it \u2019the weight of the water on the earth,\u201d Hache told The Associated Press. \u201cA devastated landscape is left behind.\u201d",
      "Hache, 40, has been crafting sculptures for Las Fallas for 25 years. He originally planned to save the idea for \u201cNada\u201d for the 2027 Fallas to mark the 70th anniversary of a previous flood that hit Valencia\u2019s city center in 1957.",
      "But he decided this year was perfect for the design, especially after he spent days joining thousands of volunteers cleaning up the mud months ago.",
      "Hache said he had been pleased by receiving so many messages of appreciation for the work.",
      "On Wednesday night, \u201cNada\u201d will be consumed by flames.",
      "\u201cI am excited to see how it will come apart and reveal itself,\u201d Hache said. \u201cNormally I don\u2019t get emotional, but maybe tonight I will.\u201d",

      "Turkish police have arrested Istanbul\u2019s mayor \u2014 a key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2014 as part of an investigation into alleged corruption and terror links",
      "ISTANBUL -- Turkish police on Wednesday arrested Istanbul\u2019s mayor \u2014 a popular opposition leader and key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan  \u2014 as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links. It was a dramatic escalation in an ongoing government crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey.",
      "The state-run Anadolu Agency said prosecutors issued detention warrants for the mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, and some 100 other people. Among those detained was Imamoglu's close aide, Murat Ongun.",
      "Authorities also closed several roads around Istanbul and banned demonstrations in the city for four days in an apparent effort to prevent protests following the arrest.",
      "Critics say the crackdown follows significant losses by Erdogan\u2019s ruling party in local elections last year amid growing calls for early national elections. Government officials insist that the courts operate independently and reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated.",
      "The arrest came during a search of Imamoglu's home, but it was not immediately clear if police confiscated anything at the site.",
      "The mayor's wife, Dilek Imamoglu, told the private Now television station that police arrived at their residence before dawn and that the mayor was taken at around 7:30 a.m.",
      "A day earlier, a university in Istanbul invalidated Imamoglu's diploma, effectively disqualifying the popular opposition figure from running in the next presidential race. Having a university degree is a requisite for running in elections under Turkish law.",
      "The mayor\u2019s party \u2014 the main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP \u2014 was to hold a primary on Sunday where Imamoglu was expected to be chosen for its candidate in future presidential elections. Turkey\u2019s next presidential vote is scheduled for 2028, but early elections are likely.",
      "With all the arrests on Wednesday, it was unlikely that vote would be held.",
      "\u201cWe are facing great tyranny, but I want you to know that I will not be discouraged,\u201d Imamoglu said earlier in he day in a video message posted on social media. He accused the government of \u201cusurping the will\u201d of the people.",
      "In a social media post on English, Imamoglu said: \u201cThe will of the people cannot be silenced through intimidation or unlawful acts. I stand resolute, entrusting myself not only to the 16 million residents of Istanbul but to the 86 million citizens of (Turkey.)\"",
      "CHP's chairman, Ozgur Ozel, denounced Imamoglu's detention as a \u201ccoup.\u201d",
      "\u201cCurrently, there is a power in place to prevent the nation from determining the next president,\u201d he said. \"We are facing an attempted coup against our next president.\u201d",
      "Turkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Equality and Democracy Party condemned the detentions and called for the immediate release of all taken into custody.",
      "\u201cThe dawn raid and detention of the mayor of the country\u2019s largest city for political motives is a disgrace that will not be forgotten for centuries. This operation, which shatters faith in justice, is an attempt to redesign politics through the judiciary,\u201d Tulay Hatimogullari, the party\u2019s co-chairwoman, wrote on X.",
      "As he was being arrested, Ongun, Imamoglu's aide, posted on X about his detention, though he at the time did not appear to know that the mayor was also being taken into custody.",
      "\u201cThey think they can silence us and prevent us from defending and supporting Ekrem Imamoglu,\u201d Ongun said. \u201cI entrust Ekrem Imamoglu to the Turkish nation. Protect, watch over and support him. They cannot be defeat the nation.\u201d",
      "Separately, police also detained a prominent investigative journalist, Ismail Saymaz, for questioning, the opposition-aligned Halk TV reported.",
      "Meanwhile, internet-access advocacy group netblocks.org reported on Wednesday that access has been restricted in Turkey to popular social media platforms.",
      "In nullifying Imamoglu\u2019s diploma, Istanbul University cited alleged irregularities in his 1990 transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus to its Faculty of Business Administration. Imamoglu said he would challenge the decision.",
      "The opposition leader faces multiple lawsuits, including allegations of trying to influence a judicial expert investigating opposition-led municipalities. The cases could result in prison sentences and a political ban.",
      "Imamoglu is also appealing a 2022 conviction of insulting members of Turkey\u2019s Supreme Electoral Council, a case that could result in a political ban.",
      "He was elected mayor of Turkey\u2019s largest city in March 2019 in a historic blow to Erdogan and the president\u2019s Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. The party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.",
      "The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which his party made significant gains against Erdogan\u2019s governing party.",

      "The country's population shrank by nearly 10% over the past two decades, dropping below 2 million, according to census data. Most of those who leave are young people seeking better opportunities elsewhere.",
      "For those left behind, Sunday\u2019s fire is the first major tragedy for their generation, born after North Macedonia\u2019s independence from war-torn former Yugoslavia. Candlelight vigils and demonstrations in the wake of the tragedy have been led by the young.",

      "If you qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit you don\u2019t have to take any action. The IRS plans to send letters to eligible taxpayers notifying them of the special payment. The payments will go out automatically this month and should arrive by direct deposit or check by late January. They\u2019ll be sent to the bank account listed on the taxpayer\u2019s 2023 return or to the address IRS has on file.",

In December 2020, eligible individuals received up to $600 per income tax filer and $600 per child under the Consolidated Appropriations Act.

In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.",
      "Four Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.",
      "In Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word \u201cresist\u201d was also painted in red across the building\u2019s front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails \u2014 crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid \u2014 and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.",
      "\u201cWas this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think \u2014 the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,\u201d Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. \u201cNone of those factors are lost on us.\u201d",
      "Tesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn\u2019t have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.",
      "More recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.",
      "Musk continues to run Tesla \u2014 as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX \u2014 while also serving as Trump\u2019s adviser.",
      "Tesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump\u2019s election but has since shed all those gains.",
      "Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric vehicle showroom. The president promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s podcast, saying \u201cat least some of it is organized and paid for\u201d by \u201cleftwing organizations in America, funded by leftwing billionaires, essentially.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\u201d Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. \u201cTesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\u201d",
      "The progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize \u201cMusk Or Us\u201d protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and \u201cit explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.\u201d",
      "Some Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle\u2019s new stigma, and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like \u201cI bought this before we knew Elon was crazy,\u201d or \u201cI just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.\u201d",
      "Prices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla\u2019s most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.",
      "The White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of the administration and a key donor to committees promoting Trump's political interests. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to \u201cdomestic terror,\u201d and Trump has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are \u201cgoing to go through hell.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said she\u2019d opened an investigation \u201cto see how is this being funded, who is behind this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we\u2019re coming after you,\u201d Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network. In a statement Tuesday, she vowed to \u201ccontinue investigations that impose severe consequences,\u201d including for \u201cthose operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.\u201d",
      "Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point.",
      "\u201cI\u2019s not the type of act that I would prioritize,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cNot right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.\u201d",
      "Theresa Ramsdell is the president of the Tesla Owners of Washington state, a club for Tesla enthusiasts, and she and her husband own three of them.",
      "\u201cHate on Elon and Trump all you want \u2014 that\u2019s fine and dandy, it\u2019s your choice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify ruining somebody\u2019s property, vandalizing it, destroying it, setting it on fire. There\u2019s other ways to get your voice heard that\u2019s more effective.\u201d",
      "Someone recently slapped a \u201cno Elon\u201d sticker on the tailgate of her Cybertruck, but she said she doesn\u2019t intend to stop driving her Teslas. Other club members have taken a similar view, she said.",
      "\u201cI love my car. It\u2019s the safest car,\u201d Ramsdell said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let somebody else judge me for the car I drive.\u201d",

      "Commercial fishermen and seafood processors and distributors seeking to convert to new, lower-carbon emission systems say they are finding federal funding they were counting on for the work is frozen or unavailable in the wake of sweeping budget cuts t...",
      "BREMEN, Maine -- Commercial fishermen and seafood processors and distributors looking to switch to new, lower-carbon emission systems say the federal funding they relied on for this work is either frozen or unavailable due to significant budget cuts promoted by President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "The changes are designed to replace old diesel-burning engines and outdated at-sea cooling systems and are touted by environmentalists as a way to reduce seafood's carbon footprint. Salmon harvesters in Washington state, scallop distributors in Maine and halibut fishermen in Alaska are among those who told The Associated Press their federal commitments for projects like new boat engines and refrigeration systems have been rescinded or are under review.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty. This is not a business-friendly environment,\u201d said Togue Brawn, a Maine seafood distributor who said she is out tens of thousands of dollars. \u201cIf they want to make America great again, then honor your word and tell people what's going on.\"",
      "Decarbonization of the fishing fleet has been a target of environmental activists in recent years. One study published in the  Marine Policy journal states that more than 200 million tons of carbon dioxide were released via fishing in 2016.",
      "That is far less than agriculture, but still a significant piece of the worldwide emissions puzzle. With Earth experiencing worsening storms and its hottest year on record in 2024, reducing the burning of fossil fuels across different industry sectors is critical to fighting climate change, scientists have said.",
      "But climate-friendly projects often cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, leading fishermen to seek U.S. Department of Agriculture or Environmental Protection Agency funds to cover some costs. DOGE, a commission assembled to cut federal spending, has targeted both agencies for cutbacks.",
      "That has left fishermen like Robert Buchmayr of Seattle on the hook for huge bills. Buchmayr said he is nearing completion of a refrigeration project for a salmon boat and was counting on a $45,000 USDA grant to pay for a chunk of it. The agency told him last month the funding is on hold until further notice, he said.",
      "\u201cI'm scrambling, where does the money come from. I was counting on the grant,\u201d Buchmayr said. \u201cI was under the impression that if you got a grant from the United States, it was a commitment. Nothing in the letter was saying, 'Yes, we'll guarantee you the funds depending on who is elected.'\u201d",
      "The full extent of the cuts is unclear, and fishermen affected by them described the situation as chaotic and confusing.",
      "Representatives for the USDA and EPA did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press about the value of the cuts and whether they were permanent. Dan Smith, USDA Rural Development's state energy director for Alaska, said updates about some grants could arrive in April.",
      "Numerous fishermen, commercial fishing groups and advocates for working waterfronts told The Associated Press they learned about the changed status of their grant money in February and March. Some were told the money would not be coming and others were told the funds were frozen while they were subject to a review.",
      "Many prospective grant recipients said they have had difficulty getting updates from the agencies. The lack of certainty has fishermen worried and seeking answers, said Sarah Schumann, a Rhode Island fisherman and director of the Fishery Friendly Climate Action Campaign, a fishermen-led network that works on climate issues.",
      "\u201cThey've started contacting me in the last couple of weeks because they've had the plug pulled on money that was already committed,\u201d Schumann said. \u201cIf they miss a season they could go out of business.\u201d",
      "In Homer, Alaska, Lacey Velsko of Kaia Fisheries was excited for her decarbonization project, which she said hinged on hundreds of thousands of dollars via a USDA grant to improve a refrigeration system on one of her boats. The recently completed project burns less fuel and yields a higher quality project for the company, which fishes for halibut, Pacific cod and other fish, she said.",
      "But, now the company is told the money is unavailable, leaving a huge cost to bear, Velsko said.",
      "\u201cOf course we think it was unfair that we signed a contract and were told we would be funded and now we\u2019re not funded. If six months down the road we\u2019re still not funded I don\u2019t know what avenue to take,\u201d she said.",
      "The funding cuts have also hurt seafood processors and distributors, such as Brawn in Bremen, Maine. Brawn said she received a little more than half of a USDA grant of about $350,000 before learning the rest might not arrive.",
      "Brawn received the grant for Dayboat Blue, a project that uses a membership-based model to get Maine seafood to nationwide customers while reducing the carbon footprint of transportation and packaging.",
      "\u201cThis model can really help fishermen, it can help consumers, it can help communities,\u201d Brawn said. \u201cWhat it's going to do is it's going to stop the program.\u201d",
      "The confusion on the waterfront is another example of the bumpy rollout of government cutbacks under Trump. The Trump administration halted its firings of hundreds of federal employees who worked on nuclear weapons programs last month. It also moved to rehire medical device, food safety and other workers lost to mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration. New tariffs on key trading partners have also been chaotic.",
      "In Bellingham, Washington, EPA funding was paused for five engine replacement projects split between three companies, said Dan Tucker, executive director of the Working Waterfront Coalition of Whatcom County. He said the uncertainty about funding has made it difficult for fishermen to move ahead with projects that will ultimately benefit their businesses and the community at large.",
      "\u201cA lot of the small guys are like, 'Well, I really want to help out with climate change but I can't afford it,'\u201d Tucker said.",

      "In his place, the three appointed Kenneth Jackson, an administrator with the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to the lawsuit.",
      "DOGE staff tried multiple times to access the building Monday before successfully getting in, partly with police assistance. The lawsuit says the institute's lawyer told DOGE representatives multiple times that the executive branch has no authority over the nonprofit.",

Ben & Jerry\u2019s said that violated its merger agreement with Unilever, which states that any decisions regarding a CEO\u2019s removal must come after a consultation with an advisory committee from Ben & Jerry\u2019s board.",
      "The Associated Press left a message seeking comment with London-based Unilever on Wednesday.",
      "Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry\u2019s in 2000 for $326 million. At the time, Ben & Jerry\u2019s said the partnership would help the progressive Vermont-based ice cream company expand its social mission.",

    "story": [
      "A hair loss drug that first gained popularity in the 1990s is seeing a resurgence of interest",
      "WASHINGTON -- The latest trend in treating hair loss may sound familiar \u2014 essentially, it's a repurposed drug first popularized in the 1990s.",
      "Back then, TV viewers were inundated with ads for Rogaine, a sticky topical solution that could help treat thinning hair when applied to the scalp.",
      "Now dermatologists are increasingly prescribing the drug, known generically as minoxidil, in low-dose pills to help men and women maintain or regrow hair.",
      "The practice follows a handful of recent studies suggesting the ingredient works as well \u2014 and possibly better \u2014 when swallowed, rather than applied to hair follicles on the head. Telehealth companies are also driving new demand by offering a quick, easy way to get a prescription and have the pills shipped directly to customers' doors.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the drug:",
      "Minoxidil was originally developed as a pill to treat high blood pressure in the 1970s. Researchers noticed that some patients taking it experienced increased hair growth as a side effect.",
      "Rogaine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1988, the first drug to win the agency\u2019s endorsement for male pattern baldness. Studies showed that men on the medication, which was applied directly to the scalp, had a slower rate of hair loss and, in some cases, regrew hair.",
      "Starting in 1991, a lower dose was approved for women and the brand was aggressively marketed as an over-the-counter medication on TV and in print.",
      "The drug\u2019s ability to slow hair loss is likely related to its effect on blood circulation, according to experts.",
      "\u201cBy increasing blood flow to the scalp it signals hairs to stay in their grow phase for longer,\u201d said Dr. Adam Friedman, chair of dermatology at George Washington University. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep those hairs in that growth phase as long as possible.\u201d",
      "A recent consensus paper by more than 40 U.S. and international dermatologists concluded that minoxidil pills are effective and often more convenient and affordable than the liquid formulation.",
      "There's little research comparing the two forms of minoxidil, but many dermatologists believe the drug works better as a pill.",
      "At a chemical level, minoxidil is absorbed more directly when digested in the gut than when applied to the hairline. It\u2019s also more convenient, with patients taking the drug by mouth once a day, instead of applying the liquid once or twice daily using a dropper.",
      "\u201cAs you can imagine, that can be rather onerous,\u201d said Dr. Susan Taylor of the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cAlthough people often enthusiastically begin therapy\u2014 and even see results \u2014 after a while there are many who drop off.\u201d",
      "The doses prescribed for oral use are also very low. Dermatologists often direct men to take one half of the lowest-dose pill; women may only need a quarter of a pill.",
      "Those low doses can also reduce the chances for side effects, which can include dizziness, rapid heartbeat and swollen legs. The drug isn\u2019t recommended for people with a history of heart issues or who are pregnant or breastfeeding.",
      "The only other FDA-approved medication for hair loss is finasteride, sold under the brand name Propecia, a drug that blocks a byproduct of testosterone that triggers hair loss in men. That drug is generally considered more effective than minoxidil, but it can occasionally cause troubling sexual side effects, including erectile dysfunction. For optimal results, some dermatologists prescribe the two drugs in combination.",
      "In short, because there\u2019s very little money to be made.",
      "Minoxidil's patent has expired and it is now available as a low-cost generic medication. That means drugmakers have little financial incentive to spend millions on the new studies that would be needed to win FDA approval for hair loss.",
      "\u201cFor a drug like oral minoxidil \u2014 which is as old as dirt at this point \u2014 there are no reasons to do that,\u201d said Friedman. Like other dermatologists, Friedman gives hair-loss patients a prescription for the pills intended to treat blood pressure, a practice known as off-label prescribing.",
      "The upside for patients is that minoxidil is extremely affordable, with some pharmacies offering a month\u2019s supply for less than $5.",
      "\u201cNot a single patient has complained to me about the cost of this medication, which is extremely rare,\u201d said Dr. Luiz Garza of Johns Hopkins University.",
      "The vast majority of doctors prescribing minoxidil for hair loss are dermatologists, who often turn to older drugs off-label for various hair and skin conditions.",
      "A survey of U.S. dermatologists published last year found 80% reported prescribing oral minoxidil. But with only about 12,000 dermatologists in the U.S., some patients may have trouble finding a provider.",
      "Telehealth providers like Hims and Ro say they are helping fill the gap. The companies' business model offers patients quick access to the medications they are seeking, often after simply filling out a questionnaire about their medical history, medications and treatment goals. The information is reviewed by a health provider who can quickly approve a prescription, assuming there are no red flags.",
      "Hims and Ro each say that their providers won't prescribe minoxidil for patients who have complicating health conditions or prescriptions that could negatively interact with the drug. In some cases, patients may be referred for an office visit.",
      "Many dermatologists say patients are better served by an in-person appointment, where a doctor will usually take a blood pressure reading, evaluate medical history, prescriptions and discuss the drug's side effects.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a proponent of going to an online service,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cI recommend seeing your board-certified dermatologist who\u2019s trained, who knows the data and can evaluate all of you.\u201d",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that a vow by Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin not to attack energy infrastructure was \u201cvery much at odds with reality\u201d following an overnight barrage of drone strikes across the country.",
      "Zelenskyy said that he would speak with U.S. President Donald Trump later in the day and expected to hear more about the American leader's phone call with Putin about a ceasefire and to discuss the next steps to be taken.",
      "\u201cEven last night, after Putin\u2019s conversation with ... Trump, when Putin said that he was allegedly giving orders to stop strikes on Ukrainian energy, there were 150 drones launched overnight, including on energy facilities,\u201d Zelenskyy said at a news conference in Helsinki with Finnish President Alexander Stubb.",
      "Russia said it had halted its targeting of Ukraine's energy facilities and accused Kyiv of attacking equipment near one of its pipelines.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, we see that for now there is no reciprocity on the part of the Kyiv regime,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.",
      "Russian strikes, which hit civilian areas and damaged a hospital, followed Putin's refusal to back a full 30-day ceasefire during discussions with Trump.",
      "The White House described the call between Trump and Putin as the first step in a \u201cmovement to peace\u201d that Washington hopes will include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and eventually a full and lasting end to the fighting.",
      "But there was no indication that Putin backed away from his conditions for a prospective peace deal, which are fiercely opposed by Kyiv.",
      "Stubb called the discussions between Putin and Trump a step in the right direction, but Finland's president said that Russia needs to end its aggression.",
      "\u201cThere are only two ways to respond to the proposal of the president of the United States: it\u2019s a yes or a no \u2014 no buts, no conditions,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cUkraine accepted a ceasefire without any forms of conditions. If Russia refuses to agree, we need to increase our efforts to strengthen Ukraine and ratchet up pressure on Russia to convince them to come to the negotiating table.\u201d",
      "Shortly after the lengthy phone call between Trump and Putin on Tuesday, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions as residents took shelter.",
      "Despite efforts to repel the attack, several strikes hit civilian infrastructure, including a direct drone strike on a hospital in Sumy and attacks on cities in Donetsk region. Russian drones were also reported over Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said that the military complied with Putin\u2019s order to halt energy infrastructure strikes and downed seven drones its forces fired before the order at power facilities related to the military-industrial complex in Ukraine\u2019s southern Mykolaiv region.",
      "Moscow accused Ukraine of targeting its energy facility in the Krasnodar region bordering the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, several hours after the Putin and Trump talks. The ministry said that three drones targeted oil transfer equipment that feeds the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, causing a fire and leading one oil tank to lose pressure.",
      "\u201cIt is absolutely clear that we are talking about yet another provocation deliberately concocted by the Kyiv regime, aimed at derailing the peace initiatives of the U.S. president,\u201d the ministry said.",
      "Zelenskyy said that \u201cwords of a ceasefire\u201d weren't enough.",
      "\u201cIf the Russians don\u2019t hit our facilities, we definitely won\u2019t hit theirs,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "Russia said that its air defenses intercepted 57 Ukrainian drones over the Azov Sea and several Russian regions \u2014 the border provinces of Kursk and Bryansk and the nearby regions of Oryol and Tula.",

      "ISLAMABAD -- A leading rights group said on Wednesday that Pakistan's authorities have intensified pressure on Afghan refugees to go back to neighboring Afghanistan, where they risk persecution by the Taliban and face dire economic conditions.",
      "\u201cPakistani officials should immediately stop coercing Afghans to return home and give those facing expulsion the opportunity to seek protection,\u201d said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at New York-based Human Rights Watch.",
      "\u201cThe Taliban authorities in Afghanistan should prevent any reprisals against returning Afghans and reverse their abusive policies against women and girls,\u201d she said.",
      "Pakistan set a March 31 deadline for the deportation of all foreigners living illegally in the country. Most of them are Afghans.",
      "The HRW appeal came a month after the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad said that Pakistan has stepped up arrests of Afghan citizens in Islamabad and nearby Rawalpindi for forced expulsion.",
      "However, Pakistan has dismissed the allegation by Kabul, saying that the authorities were only trying to facilitate conditions for the swift return of Afghans to their home country.",
      "More than 500,000 Afghans who fled the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 have been living without papers in Pakistan, thousands of them waiting for resettlement in the United States and elsewhere.",
      "There are also around 1.45 million Afghan refugees, registered with the U.N. refugee agency, most of whom fled during the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation of their country. Last July, Pakistan extended the stay of refugees registered with UNHCR until June, saying they won't be arrested or deported at least until the extension expires.",
      "In January, U.S. President Donald Trump paused American refugee programs for at least three months and since then, around 20,000 Afghans who were awaiting resettlement in Pakistan are now in limbo. Afghans waiting for relocation to the United States have also urged Trump to restore the refugee program to end their ordeal.",
      "HRW said in a statement that the human rights situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate since the Taliban takeover in August 2021.",
      "\u201cWomen and girls are banned from post primary education and denied a broad range of rights and freedoms. Human rights defenders, journalists, and former government personnel are at particular risk,\u201d the group said.",
      "The statement also said that Afghans returning to their country struggle to survive amid Afghanistan\u2019s soaring unemployment rate, broken health care system and dwindling foreign assistance.",
      "Earlier this year, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also approved the March 31 deadline for the deportation of those Afghans awaiting relocation to third countries unless their cases are swiftly processed by the governments that have agreed to take them.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan is not safe for any forced refugee returns,\u201d Pearson said, \u201cCountries that pledged to resettle at-risk Afghans should respond to the urgency of the situation in Pakistan and expedite those cases.\u201d",
      "HRW said that Pakistan\u2019s Interior Ministry has also announced that Afghans without official residence documents, along with holders of Afghan Citizen Cards, must leave the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi or face deportation.",

      "More than 70% of those returning to Afghanistan have been women and children, including girls of secondary school age and women who will no longer have access to education, according to HRW.",
      "The group said that \u201cPakistani police have raided houses, beat and arbitrarily detained people, and confiscated refugee documents, including residence permits. They have demanded bribes to allow Afghans to remain in Pakistan.\"",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Delaware is trying to protect its status as the corporate capital of the world amid fallout from a judge's rejection of billionaire Elon Musk \u2019s landmark Tesla compensation package, although critics say fast-tracked legislation will tilt the playing field against investors, including pensioners and middle-class savers.",
      "A Delaware House committee was expected to vote Wednesday on the bill, which is backed by Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer who says it'll ensure the state remains the \"premier home for U.S. and global businesses\u201d to incorporate.",
      "Backers say it'll modernize the law and maintain balance between corporate officers and shareholders in a state where the courts, for a century, have settled all sorts of business disputes as the legal home of more than 2 million corporate entities, including two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies.",
      "Critics \u2014 including institutional investors, pension funds and asset managers \u2014 say it\u2019ll lower corporate governance standards, curb shareholder rights and, as a result, limit the ability to hold corporate officers accountable for decisions that violate their fiduciary duty.",
      "The bill passed the state Senate unanimously last week.",
      "A Delaware judge last year invalidated Musk's compensation package from Tesla that was potentially worth more than $55 billion. Lawyers for shareholders had sued over the package that Tesla\u2019s board of directors awarded Musk in 2018.",

      "The fallout seemed to accelerate in recent weeks when the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta Platforms \u2014 the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 was considering moving its incorporation to Texas. Meta didn't confirm the report.",
      "DropBox, the online file-sharing platform, moved its corporate listing to Nevada, and Bill Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, a major hedge fund, said he\u2019d leave Delaware, too.",

      "That said, critics of the bill say there's no evidence that corporations are fleeing Delaware in any numbers.",
      "It changes several things.",
      "One, it gives corporations more protections in conflict-of-interest cases \u2014 such as a pay package for a CEO or intercompany agreements \u2014 in state courts when fighting shareholder lawsuits.",
      "Two, it limits the kind of documents that a company must produce in court cases and makes it harder for stockholders to get access to internal documents or communication that could prove time-consuming and expensive for a company to produce \u2014 not to mention, damaging to its case.",

      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing\u2019s business empire is in the crosshairs after CK Hutchison Holdings chose to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., apparently angering Beijing.",
      "Over the past week, Beijing's Hong Kong affairs offices have posted scathing commentaries from a local state-backed media outlet over the tentative deal by Hutchison, which is controlled by Li\u2019s family.",
      "That raises questions about the deal and highlights the difficulties Hong Kong businesses face as they balance demands from Beijing for national loyalty and their own capitalist interests in the once free-wheeling Asian financial hub. Here's what to know about the issue.",
      "Nicknamed \u201cSuperman,\u201d Li is among the world\u2019s 50 richest people, with Forbes calculating his net worth at $38 billion. Li, 96, retired from his position as chairman of CK Hutchison in 2018, succeeded by his elder son Victor. But he's still one of Hong Kong's most influential figures.",
      "Li's rags-to-riches story paralleled the former British colony\u2019s rise. His business empire touches almost every aspect of daily life in Hong Kong, from properties and supermarkets to telecommunications and utilities. Globally, his conglomerate owns assets including British drugstore chain Superdrug and European mobile phone network operator Three.",
      "A Hutchison subsidiary has operated ports at both ends of the Panama Canal since 1997. That was one reason U.S. President Donald Trump has alleged Chinese interference with the critical shipping lane's operations.",
      "Li\u2019s influence extends beyond business. He has met with top Chinese leaders and has served on the elite committee that selected Hong Kong\u2019s leader.",
      "Experts on ties between Beijing and Hong Kong said ruling Communist Party leaders once understood that support from the business sector was crucial for maintaining Hong Kong\u2019s capitalist system. It's has been strategically vital for mainland China\u2019s economy, given the role their global networks and resources play in the country\u2019s development. So, Li has had notable political influence.",
      "But Li has faced criticism over some business decisions. When he sold off some mainland Chinese assets in 2015, an article published by a think tank affiliated with Chinese official news agency Xinhua accused him of being immoral.",
      "During pro-democracy protests in 2019, Li was blasted by some pro-Beijing supporters for his perceived ambivalence about the unrest. Some other Hong Kong business leaders adopted a harsher stance.",
      "CK Hutchison announced March 4 that it would sell all its shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium that also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, which is chaired by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte, whose family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with Li\u2019s.",
      "If approved, the deal, valued at nearly $23 billion including $5 billion in debt, will give the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the canal. The transaction does not include ports in Hong Kong or mainland China. CK Hutchison said the transaction was purely commercial in nature.",
      "The deal pleased Trump but angered Beijing.",
      "One of the Beijing-backed newspaper commentaries described the deal as a betrayal of all Chinese and said the company should think about which side to take. The other said great entrepreneurs are patriots, suggesting that businesspeople who \u201cdance with\u201d predatory American politicians would be doomed to infamy.",
      "Comments on popular posts about the deal on Chinese social media platform Weibo tend to be more critical than favorable toward Li.",
      "Chief Executive John Lee avoided direct criticism of the deal or Trump, but told reporters on Tuesday his government opposes bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations, reiterating Beijing's stance.",
      "Some unconfirmed reports have suggested Chinese leaders were angry not to have been consulted in advance about the deal.",
      "George Chen, managing director for Hong Kong at The Asia Group, a Washington-headquartered business and policy consulting firm, said Beijing may have been disappointed because it had almost no time to devise a response in advance.",
      "Ports are valuable strategic assets and transactions involving them are always sensitive, said Wilson Chan, co-founder of the Pagoda Institute, a think tank focusing on public policy and the global political economy.",
      "It is unclear whether pressure from Beijing will affect the deal, which has to be approved by Panama's government. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry deflected a question about whether authorities are investigating the deal, saying reporters should ask other authorities.",
      "CK Hutchison has not commented on the controversy. It was due to report its 2024 financial results on Thursday, but said it was not planning a news conference.",
      "Cancelling the deal would be risky, Chan said.",
      "\u201cStrictly speaking, you just let Trump take credit for it, then you later say \u2018Sorry, I\u2019m canceling the deal.\u2019 You can imagine what Trump\u2019s reaction would be,\u201d he said, adding that would also affect how the outside world views Hong Kong businesses.",
      "The first Trump administration sanctioned Chinese and Hong Kong officials for undermining the autonomy of the territory promised when Britain handed its colony to Beijing in 1997 under a concept dubbed \u201cOne country, two systems.\u201d It promised the city could keep its Western-style civil liberties and economic autonomy for at least 50 years, but following the 2019 protests, Beijing has doubled-down on its political control of the city.",
      "Li could try to placate critics who deem him insufficiently patriotic, Chan said, by using proceeds from selling the port assets for investments aligned with Beijing\u2019s policies, particularly in developing Hong Kong and mainland port businesses.",
      "But relations between private businesses and Beijing remain uncertain, said The Asia Group's Chen. Even though Chinese President Xi Jinping recently met with private sector business leaders in a show of support, some may wonder if they must follow the party line even if that might conflict with their business interests, he said.",

    "story": [
      "The number 200 is top of mind across wine country in France, Italy and Spain, Europe's top producers of wine",
      "CHAMPAGNE, France -- Across wine country in France, Italy and Spain one number is top of mind: 200%.",
      "That's because last week U.S. President Donald Trump threatened a tariff of that amount on European wine, Champagne and other spirits if the European Union went ahead with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. products. The top wine producers in Europe could face crippling costs that would hit smaller wineries especially hard.",
      "Europe's wine industry is the latest to find itself in the crosshairs of a possible trade spat with the U.S.",
      "Among those concerned is David Levasseur, a third-generation wine grower and owner of a Champagne house in France\u2019s eponymous region.",
      "\u201cIt means I\u2019m in trouble, big trouble. We hope it\u2019s just, as we say, blah blah,\u201d Levasseur said, standing in his Champagne house as he swilled a flute of his vineyard\u2019s bubbly. \u201cWhen someone speaks so loudly,\u201d he said of Trump\u2019s 200% threat, \u201cit\u2019s about the media buzz. But in any case, we think there will be consequences.\u201d",
      "Like other wine sellers and exporters, Levasseur said that a 200% tariff on what he exports to the U.S. would essentially grind to a halt his business in that country.",
      "\u201cIt could be a real disaster,\u201d Levasseur said.",
      "Italy, France and Spain are among the top five exporters of wine to the United States. Trump made his threat to Europe's alcohol industry after the European Union announced a 50% tax on American whiskey expected to take effect on April 1. That duty was unveiled in response to the Trump administration's tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum.",
      "Gabriel Picard, who heads the French Federation of Exporters of Wines and Spirits, said 200% tariffs would be \u201ca hammer blow\u201d for France\u2019s industry, whose wine and spirits exports to the U.S. are worth 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) annually.",
      "\u201cWith 200% duties, there is no more market,\" Picard said.",
      "Still, he understood why European leaders responded to Trump's initial tariffs.",
      "\u201cThere's no debate about that. We agree that Mr. Trump creates and likes to create contests of strength. We have to adapt to that,\u201d he said.",
      "In Italy, the wine industry has called for calm, hoping that negotiators in Brussels and Washington can back down from the growing trade spat.",
      "The U.S. is Italy\u2019s largest wine market, with sales having tripled in value over the past 20 years. Last year, exports grew by nearly 7% to over 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) according to Italy's main farming lobby Coldiretti.",
      "Strong sales at high-end restaurants, in particular, make the U.S. market difficult to replace, said Piero Mastroberardino, vice president of the national winemakers\u2019 association Federvini.",
      "Mastroberardino\u2019s \u201cTaurasi Radici\u201d red wine, for example, was rated the fifth-best wine in the world in 2023 by Wine Spectator, an American wine and lifestyle magazine. It sells for around $80 a bottle retail in the U.S., roughly twice how much it costs in Italy, so any tariffs would push it to an \u201cunthinkable price point,\u201d he said.",
      "In January, Mastroberardino's U.S. import partners increased orders by about 20% in January anticipating possible Trump tariffs. But the increase in orders would not offset the impact of tariffs, particularly that high, he said, for long.",
      "\"It is in everyone\u2019s interest to maintain a united front at the negotiating table,\" Mastroberardino said, \"especially those who are being targeted.\u201d",
      "Wine producers and industry experts in Spain, whose smooth reds are savored by tens of millions of American tourists who visit the southern European country every year, shared similar concerns about prospective tariffs.",
      "\u201cWe don't think they have much logic and we hope it never comes to fruition,\" said Bego\u00f1a Olavarr\u00eda, an economic analyst at the Interprofessional Wine Organization of Spain.",
      "Spain was the fourth-largest exporter of wine to the U.S. last year in sales, and the seventh-largest by volume, according to the trade group. Spanish wine exports to the U.S. grew by 7% last year. And the wine industry represents about 2% of the country's overall economic output, the trade group said.",
      "For Spain's producers of Cava, the threat of U.S. tariffs hit especially hard. The U.S. is the largest market for the Spanish bubbly wine, which like Champagne has a designation of origin meaning it can only be made in Spain.",
      "Mireia Pujol-Busquets is owner of the Alta Alella Bodega located in Cava country just south of Barcelona. Founded by her family in 1991, she said her business and its 40 employees immediately risk losing sales of some 25,000 bottles if the American market slams shut.",
      "\u201cWe spent 10 years of effort opening the American market, finding distributors and building a brand,\u201d she told the AP by phone.",
      "While the Catalan bodega and its distributors in the U.S. were able to absorb the price increase induced by Trump\u2019s 25% tariff on wines during his first term, Pujol-Busquets said that it is \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d to consider eating a 200% hike.",
      "\u201cThe situation is pretty desperate,\" she said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Social Security Administration's plan to require in-person identity checks for millions of new and existing recipients while simultaneously closing government offices has sparked a furor among lawmakers, advocacy groups and program recipients who are worried that the government is placing unnecessary barriers in front of an already vulnerable population.",
      "The new requirements will impact anyone who needs to verify their bank information with the agency, as well as families with children who receive Social Security benefits and cannot verify a child's information on the SSA website. They are intended to combat fraud and waste within the system, which President Donald Trump and officials in his administration have claimed are widespread.",
      "The agency announced Tuesday that, beginning March 31st, those who cannot properly verify their identity over the agency\u2019s \u201cmy Social Security\u201d online service will be required to visit an agency field office in person to complete the verification process. They also announced recently that Social Security field offices across the country will be closing.",
      "Of the 47 SSA field offices listed for closure on the Department of Government Efficiency website, 26 are slated for closure this year, with some taking effect as early as next month, according to an Associated Press analysis of the data.",
      "That change, in addition to the impending closure of field offices across the country, and a plan to reduce the agency workforce with mass layoffs, could result in massive delays to services, advocates say. Nancy LeaMond of the AARP said eliminating phone verification \u201cwill result in more headaches and longer wait times to resolve routine customer service needs.\"",
      "Leamond, the AARP's chief advocacy and engagement officer, said the announcement \u201cnot only comes as a total surprise but is on an impractical fast-track.\u201d",

      "Agency leaders said Tuesday that the agency would begin training frontline employees and management about the new policy for the next two weeks.",
      "Pushback from Democrats came quickly. A group of 62 House Democrats wrote Wednesday to the agency's acting commissioner, Leland Dudek, to express concern about how the changes could hurt older beneficiaries in remote areas and people with limited internet access.",
      "\u201cRequiring beneficiaries to seek assistance exclusively online, through artificial intelligence, or in person at SSA field offices would create additional barriers, particularly for those who live far from an office,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe strongly urge you to consider the individuals who may be harmed.\"",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking out for seniors by doing this,\u201d Fields said.",
      "In announcing the changes, Dudek said that the agency sees $100 million in direct deposit fraud every year. However, congressional testimony from an official with the SSA inspector general in May 2023 said that \u201cfrom January 2013 through May 2018 fraudsters redirected $33.5 million in benefits intended for 20,878 beneficiaries\" and made unauthorized direct deposit changes through the agency's website.",
      "The agency distributes roughly $1.6 trillion in old-age and disability benefits annually.",
      "The end of phone service identification could be dramatic for some recipients, including families with children who will be required to visit an SSA office, since children can\u2019t open online accounts through the \u201cmy Social Security\" online service.",
      "Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, said \"this will make it far harder for the American people to claim their earned benefits. It could even cause major delays, and ultimately collapse the system, by overwhelming the field offices.\u201d",
      "Altman, of the advocacy group, believes the administration's ultimate goal is to privatize the Social Security system.",

Trump's message drew a rare rebuke from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "Climate United Fund and other groups had sued the EPA, Zeldin and Citibank, saying they had illegally denied the groups access to $14 billion awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a \u201cgreen bank.\" The program was created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects.",
      "Climate United and two other groups, the Coalition for Green Capital and Power Forward Communities, said the freeze not only prevented them from financing new projects, but might force them to lay off staff. They said the allegations they were mishandling funds were utterly meritless.",

      "Questions are mounting in Canada and in Europe over whether big-ticket purchases of high-end U.S. weaponry \u2014 such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter \u2014 are still a wise strategic choice for Western countries worried about their investment in U.S. defense ...",
      "BERLIN -- Questions are mounting in Canada and in Europe over whether big-ticket purchases of high-end U.S. weaponry, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, are still a wise strategic choice for Western countries worried about their investment in U.S. defense technology.",
      "In less than two months, U.S. President Donald Trump has upended decades of U.S. foreign policy. He has left NATO members questioning whether the U.S. will honor the alliance's commitment to defend each other if other European countries are attacked by Russia. He's also made repeat overtures to Russia and suspended most U.S. foreign aid.",
      "And Pete Hegseth, Trump's defense secretary, last month told a gathering of European defense ministers \u201cthat stark strategic realities\u201d prevent the U.S. from being primarily focused on the security of Europe.",
      "That could impact foreign sales of the Lockheed Martin-produced F-35 and other advanced U.S. jets like the F-16. As the war in Ukraine continues into its fourth year, it's become clear that Eastern European NATO members still have vast stores of Soviet-era weapons in their stockpiles that were not interoperable with Western weaponry. A long-term plan to get all of NATO on similar platforms \u2014 by replacing old Soviet-era jets with Western ones, particularly the F-16 and in some cases, the F-35 \u2014 has gained momentum.",
      "Some of the NATO countries are now re-thinking tying their defense to U.S.-made systems and potentially considering European jets like the Saab Gripen, Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale instead.",
      "In Canada, where Trump has launched a trade war and has threatened economic coercion to make it the 51st American state, new Prime Minister Mark Carney has asked Defense Minister Bill Blair to review its purchase of F-35s. Canada has been a partner with the U.S. in developing the F-35.",
      "Blair will see if there are other options \u201cgiven the changing environment,\u201d a defense spokesman said.",
      "And in Portugal, the outgoing defense minister said in an interview with a Portuguese newspaper published last week that \u201crecent positions\u201d taken by the U.S. compelled a rethink about the purchase of F-35s because the U.S. has become unpredictable. Portugal is considering various options to replace its F-16s.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not just buying an airplane, you\u2019re buying a relationship with the United States,\u201d said Winslow T. Wheeler, a longtime government watchdog who spent 30 years in the U.S. Congress working for Democrats and Republicans on national security and defense issues. \u201cPeople in the past have not just welcomed but craved that kind of relationship.\u201d",
      "The Netherlands and Norway have voiced recent support for the F-35 program in comments to the media.",
      "\u201cThe F-35 is a vital component of our national defense capability, and the cooperation and dialogue with the United States continues to support the development and use of this high-end platform,\" Norwegian State Secretary Andreas Fl\u00e5m said in a statement. \u201dWe expect this constructive cooperation to continue into the future.\"",
      "The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter was designed to combine stealth, maneuverability and attack capabilities in a single aircraft. Each jet costs about $85 million (78 million euros), and the price jumps to $100 million (91 million euros) to $150 million (137 million euros) when supporting infrastructure and spare parts are included. About 1,100 have been produced to date for 16 military services across the globe.",
      "The F-35B, a variant that can take off from ship decks vertically, is the latest model. It's the most expensive weapons system the U.S. has ever produced, with estimated lifetime costs now expected to top $1.7 trillion. One of the ways the program was counting on reducing those costs was by selling more aircraft to international customers.",
      "But the Trump administration's recent pause on providing intelligence to Ukraine to force the country to negotiate with Russia has fueled fears that the U.S. may have similar ways to coerce them in a future fight \u2014 such as by embedding a hypothetical \u201ckill switch\u201d in the F-35's millions of lines of programming.",
      "In a statement, the Pentagon's F-35 Lightning II Joint Program Office on Tuesday vehemently rejected any notion that jets sold to allies could be remotely disabled.",
      "\u201cThere is no kill switch. The F-35 was conceived, developed, and continues to be operated and sustained as a joint/coalition platform, built on strong partnerships with U.S. allies and partner nations across the globe,\u201d the office said in a statement. \u201cThe strength of the F-35 program lies in its global partnership, and we remain committed to providing all users with the full functionality and support they require.\u201d",
      "But that's not the only way to impact an ally's program, Wheeler said. The F-35 requires constant U.S.-controlled tech upgrades to operate in combat. If a relationship with the U.S. soured and updates were delayed, it could make a jet, or even a fleet, inoperable, he said.",
      "Lockheed Martin, in a statement Tuesday, said the company is committed to helping its customers \u201cstrengthen their airpower and security with the F-35.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs part of our government contracts, we deliver all system infrastructure and data required for all F-35 customers to sustain the aircraft,\u201d the defense contractor said. \u201cWe remain committed to providing affordable and reliable sustainment services to our customers that enable them to complete their missions and come home safely.\u201d",
      "The Saab Gripen, Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale could see an increase in sales if other countries decide to forgo their F-35 purchases. But none of them have the stealth capabilities of the F-35.",
      "The Swedish-made Saab Gripen is used by the militaries of Sweden, the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa,Brazil and Thailand. Conventional defense industry wisdom says it's significantly cheaper than the F-35, Wheeler said.",
      "The Eurofighter Typhoon, a swing-role combat aircraft, is part of the British, German, Spanish and Italian forces. It's manufactured by a consortium of defense companies: Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo.",
      "The French-built Dassault Rafale twin-jet fighter is used by the French Navy and the French Air and Space Force. The governments of Egypt, India, Qatar, Greece, Croatia, the United Arab Emirates, Serbia and Indonesia have all signed contracts for Rafales.",
      "David Jordan, a senior lecturer in defense studies at King\u2019s College London and co-director of the Freeman Air and Space Institute, said that previously, European leaders felt it was easier and more cost-effective to lean on the U.S. defense industry \u2014 and American taxpayers \u2014 to get access to advanced weaponry. But the Trump administration's move away from Europe could be the turning point, Jordan said.",
      "It would require the continent to pool its money and resources \u2014 often a sticking point among the countries \u2014 into research and development, manufacturing and logistics, but Jordan said it's possible within five to 10 years.",
      "\u201cThe European defense industry is more than capable of building what it needs,\u201d Jordan said.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron is already ramping up his efforts to persuade France\u2019s allies to switch to European defense contractors and weapons systems, including French-built Rafale fighters.",
      "\u201cThose who buy the F-35 should be offered the Rafale. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll increase the pace,\u201d La D\u00e9p\u00eache du Midi quoted Macron as saying during a press briefing Friday to journalists from regional French newspapers.",
      "If the Europeans increase their production, it would greatly affect the bottom lines of Lockheed Martin and other U.S. defense companies. Jordan said U.S. defense contractors are likely concerned about Trump\u2019s next move.",
      "\u201cAt what point will they say \u2018we don\u2019t like this, we\u2019re talking about risking billions of dollars here,\u2019\u201d Jordan said.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- The videos roll through TikTok in 30-second flashes.",
      "Migrants trek in camouflage through dry desert terrain. Dune buggies roar up to the United States-Mexico border barrier. Families with young children pass through gaps in the wall. Helicopters, planes, yachts, tunnels and jet skis stand by for potential customers.",
      "Laced with emojis, the videos posted by smugglers offer a simple promise: If you don\u2019t have a visa in the U.S., trust us. We\u2019ll get you over safely.",
      "At a time when legal pathways to the U.S. have been slashed and criminal groups are raking in money from migrant smuggling, social media apps like TikTok have become an essential tool for smugglers and migrants alike. The videos \u2014 taken to cartoonish extremes \u2014 offer a rare look inside a long elusive industry and the narratives used by trafficking networks to fuel migration north.",
      "\u201cWith God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to continue working to fulfill the dreams of foreigners. Safe travels without robbing our people,\u201d wrote one enterprising smuggler.",
      "As President Donald Trump begins to ramp up a crackdown at the border and migration levels to the U.S. dip, smugglers say new technologies allow networks to be more agile in the face of challenges, and expand their reach to new customers \u2014 a far cry from the old days when each village had its trusted smuggler.",
      "\u201cIn this line of work, you have to switch tactics,\u201d said a woman named Soary, part of a smuggling network bringing migrants from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that her last name would not be shared out of concern that authorities would track her down. \u201cTikTok goes all over the world.\"",
      "Soary, 24, began working in smuggling when she was 19, living in El Paso, where she was approached by a friend about a job. She would use her truck to pick up migrants who had recently jumped the border. Despite the risks involved with working with trafficking organizations, she said it earned her more as a single mother than her previous job putting in hair extensions.",
      "As she gained more contacts on both sides of the border, she began connecting people from across the Americas with a network of smugglers to sneak them across borders and eventually into the U.S.",
      "Like many smugglers, she would take videos of migrants speaking to the camera after crossing the border to send over WhatsApp as evidence to loved ones that her clients had gotten to their destination safely. Now she posts those clips to TikTok.",
      "TikTok says the platform strictly prohibits human smuggling and reports such content to law enforcement.",
      "The use of social media to facilitate migration took off around 2017 and 2018, when activists built massive WhatsApp groups to coordinate the first major migrant caravans traveling from Central America to the U.S., according to Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University focused on the migrant smuggling industry.",
      "Later, smugglers began to infiltrate those chats and use the choice social media app of the day, expanding to Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Migrants, too, began to document their often perilous voyages north, posting videos trekking through the jungles of the Darien Gap dividing Colombia and Panama, and after being released by extorting cartels.",
      "A 2023 study by the United Nations reported that 64% of the migrants they interviewed had access to a smart phone and the internet during their migration to the U.S.",
      "Around the time of the study's release, as use of the app began to soar, that Correa-Cabrera said she began to see smuggling ads skyrocket on TikTok.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a marketing strategy,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said. \u201cEveryone was on TikTok, particularly after the pandemic, and then it began to multiply.\u201d",
      "Last year, Soary, the smuggler, said she began to publish videos of migrants and families in the U.S. with their faces covered and photos of the U.S.-Mexico border with messages like: \u201cWe\u2019ll pass you through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, no matter where you are. Fence jumping, treks and by tunnel. Adults, children and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of videos examined by the AP feature thick wads of cash, people crossing through the border fence by night, helicopters and airplanes supposedly used by coyotes, smugglers cutting open cacti in the desert for migrants to drink from and even crops of lettuce with text reading \u201cThe American fields are ready!\u201d",
      "The videos are often layered over heavy northern Mexican music with lyrics waxing romantically about being traffickers. Videos are published by accounts with names alluding to \u201csafe crossing,\u201d \u201cUSA destinations,\u201d \u201cfulfilling dreams\u201d or \u201cpolleros,\u201d as smugglers are often called.",
      "Narratives shift based on the political environment and immigration policies in the U.S. During the Biden administration, posts would advertise getting migrants access to asylum applications through the administration's CBP One app, which Trump ended.",
      "Amid Trump's crackdown, posts have shifted to dispelling fears that migrants will be captured, promising American authorities have been paid off. Smugglers openly taunt U.S. authorities: one shows himself smoking what appears to be marijuana right in front of the border wall; another even takes a jab at Trump, referring to the president as a \u201chigh-strung gringo.\u201d",
      "Comments are dotted with emojis of flags and baby chickens, a symbol meaning migrant among smugglers, and other users asking for prices and more information.",
      "Cristina, who migrated because she struggled make ends meet in the Mexican state of Zacatecas, was among those scrolling in December after the person she had hired to smuggle her to the U.S. abandoned her and her partner in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.",
      "\u201cIn a moment of desperation, I started searching on TikTok and, well, with the algorithm videos began to pop up,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me a half an hour\u201d to find a smuggler.",
      "After connecting, smugglers and migrants often negotiate on encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, doing a careful dance to gain each other's trust. Cristina, now living in Phoenix, said she decided to trust Soary because she was a woman and posted videos of families, something the smuggler admitted was a tactic to gain migrants' trust.",
      "Smugglers, migrants and authorities warn that such videos have been used to scam migrants or lure them into traps at a time when cartels are increasingly using kidnapping and extortion as a means to rake in more money.",
      "One smuggler, who asked to only be identified by his TikTok name \u201cThe Corporation\u201d due to fear of authorities tracking him down said other accounts would steal his migrant smuggling network's videos of customers saying to camera they arrived safely in the U.S.",
      "\u201cAnd there's not much we can do legally. I mean, it's not like we can report them,\u201d he said with a laugh.",
      "In other cases, migrants say that they were forced by traffickers to take the videos even if they haven't arrived safely to their destinations.",
      "The illicit advertisements have fueled concern among international authorities like the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, which warned in a report about the use of the technology that \u201cnetworks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and evasive, thus challenging government authorities to address new, non-traditional forms of this crime.\u201d",
      "In February, a Mexican prosecutor also confirmed to the AP that they were investigating a network of accounts advertising crossings through a tunnel running under the border fence between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. But investigators would not provide more details.",
      "In the meantime, hundreds of accounts post videos of trucks crossing border, of stacks of cash and migrants, faces covered with emojis, promising they made it safely across the border.",

      "The jury will deliberate after the closing arguments and jury instructions. Nine jurors and two alternates have heard the case.",
      "North Dakota District Court Judge James Gion told the jury last month when the trial began, \u201cYou are the judges of all questions of fact in this case,\u201d and to \u201cbase your verdict on the evidence.\u201d",
      "Dallas-based Energy Transfer and its subsidiary Dakota Access alleged defamation, trespass, nuisance and other offenses by Netherlands-based Greenpeace International, its American branch Greenpeace USA, and funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc. The pipeline company is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.",
      "The lawsuit stems from protests in 2016 and 2017 of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline and its Missouri River crossing upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe for years has opposed the pipeline as a risk to its water supply. The pipeline has transported oil since mid-2017.",
      "Trey Cox, an attorney for the pipeline company, previously said Greenpeace \u201cplanned, organized and funded a game plan to stop construction\u201d of the pipeline, \u201cwhatever the cost.\u201d",
      "Cox also alleged Greenpeace paid outsiders to come into the area to protest, sent blockade supplies, organized or led protester trainings, passed \u201ccritical intel\u201d to the protesters and told untrue statements to stop the line from being built.",
      "He said a letter signed by leaders of Greenpeace International and Greenpeace USA and sent to Energy Transfer's banks contained an allegedly defamatory statement that the company desecrated burial grounds and culturally important sites during construction.",
      "Greenpeace's \u201cdeceptive narrative scared off lenders\u201d and the company lost half its banks, Cox said.",
      "Attorneys for the Greenpeace entities denied the allegations, saying there is no evidence, they had little or no involvement with the protests and the letter was signed by hundreds of organizations from dozens of countries, with no financial institution to testify the organization received, read or was influenced by the letter.",
      "Greenpeace representatives have said the lawsuit is an example of corporations abusing the legal system to go after critics and is a critical test of free speech and protest rights. An Energy Transfer spokesperson said the case is about Greenpeace not following the law, not free speech.",

That move, and how it was announced, annoyed outgoing IOC president Thomas Bach and also leaders of other sports. Some of those will vote Thursday. Has promised IOC members more genuine involvement in debates and decisions. And to present himself for re-election after four years instead of eight.",
      "A two-time Olympic champion in swimming and currently the appointed sports minister of Zimbabwe. At age 41, she would be a young IOC president, also the first woman and first African leader in its 131-year history. Crucially, she has Bach's support and in her manifesto offered almost complete continuity with his policies. How active and interventionist that support has been is a major talking point. She is widely expected to lead in the first-round ballot. From 2018-21 she was athlete representative on the Bach-chaired IOC executive board. That period did little to expand athlete commercial rights now proposed by other candidates.",
      "The Swedish-born, British citizen president of the International Ski and Snowboard Federation since 2021. Also the billionaire owner and former long-time CEO of the Head sportswear and equipment brand. He has been an advisor to British governments of both main political parties. A key line in his manifesto was this is \u201cno time for a novice.\" Long involved in environmental projects. As a response to the challenges of changing climate, proposes rotating the Winter Games among a group of permanent venues. Opposes paying athlete prize money from IOC revenues, and wants to ensure \"only those who were born female can compete in women\u2019s sport.\u201d If Eliasch does not win, he might soon rise to the IOC executive board.",
      "The younger brother of Jordan's King Abdullah II, Prince Feisal is the latest of his family to run for sports leadership. His sister Princess Haya was a former IOC member when president of equestrian's governing body \u2014 and like Prince Feisal, voted in Thomas Bach's 2013 win \u2014 and their brother Prince Ali was a FIFA vice president who twice ran for the top job in 2015 and 2016. \u201cI grew up in a family that knows all about service,\u201d Prince Feisal said Wednesday. From a military background, he has led Jordan's Olympic body for 22 years, joined the IOC in 2010 and created a peace-promoting sports NGO. He proposes giving members more input, that athletes should be \u201cproperly valued\u201d and would open continental offices to decentralize the 700-strong IOC administration in Switzerland.",
      "The former mayor of a small town in Brittany, France, has been president of the International Cycling Union since 2017. Lappartient is a fast-rising and busy IOC member since joining just three years ago. He already oversaw, at Bach's request, preparing a 12-year deal with Saudi Arabia for creating and staging video gaming Esport Olympics. It will debut in 2027. As head of the French Olympic body, he quickly pulled together an Olympics bid in 2023 leading to the French Alps hosting the 2030 Winter Games. Though he has flourished in the Bach presidency, his manifesto proposes ideas including giving members more active input, cutting the number of committees and giving the IOC Ethics Commission independence from the president's office. Aged just 51, a loss Thursday need not end his IOC leadership ambition.",
      "Samaranch turned seven in the year his father, also Juan Antonio, was first elected as an IOC member in 1966. He joined the IOC at the same 2001 meeting in Moscow where his father stood down after 21 years as president. Now at 65 comes the chance to follow his father leading the worldwide Olympic movement. Samaranch positions himself as a genuinely global figure tuned in to all political challenges the IOC presidency demands. He grew up in Franco\u2019s Spain, experienced Soviet Russia when his father was ambassador there, worked in 1980s banking and finance in the U.S. and is well connected in modern China. Samaranch was the IOC's point person preparing for the 2022 Beijing Winter Games in a pandemic lockdown that was President Xi Jinping's personal project. He has been on the IOC board for most of the past 13 years and delivered a manifesto with the most policy proposals. He wants to relax strict broadcast rules and let Olympic athletes use footage of their games performances on social media and be global influencers.",
      "Though clearly an outsider in the IOC contest, the Japanese president of the International Gymnastics Federation had some of the most vivid ideas in his manifesto. An eye-catching rethinking of the Summer Games suggested a rolling 24-hour sports program across five continents: one city and 10 sports in each of five continents. Watanabe said this would add more sports and allow more and smaller cities to be Olympic hosts while meeting sustainability targets. He also would restructure the IOC as a House and Senate. A lower chamber of the 206 national Olympic bodies and sports governing bodies would recommend ideas for a decision-making upper chamber of up to 120 IOC members. The IOC president would have three terms of four years instead of the current initial eight year mandate followed by four years.",

      "WICHITA, Kan. -- The chances of Houston cutting down the nets at the Final Four in a few weeks could depend on the uncertain status of J'Wan Roberts' ailing right ankle. The same can be said for fellow No. 1 seed Duke and Cooper Flagg's left ankle.",
      "Or injuries that have impacted second-seeded Alabama, No. 3 seeds Iowa State and Texas Tech, and so many others.",
      "Health is always a factor in the NCAA Tournament, shaping the way games transpire. And the status of some key players on some noteworthy teams should likewise shape the way millions of Americans fill out their brackets.",
      "In the case of the Cougars, the headliner in the Midwest Region, the 6-foot-8 Roberts is both their best rebounder and one of their veteran leaders, one of just a few players left from their Final Four team in 2021. Roberts sprained his ankle in the Big 12 Tournament and watched from the bench as Houston romped to the title in Kansas City, Missouri.",
      "\u201cI'm doing pretty good,\u201d Roberts said Wednesday before taking part in the Cougars' open practice for their opener against No. 16 seed SIU-Edwardsville. \u201cGetting a lot of treatment and just taking it day by day so I can be 100%.\u201d",
      "Elsewhere in the region, third-seeded Kentucky is expected to have Lamont Butler back for its first-round game against No. 14 seed Troy on Friday. The Wildcats' assist and steals leader hurt his shoulder in their SEC Tournament opener against Oklahoma.",
      "No. 4 seed Purdue is hopeful Fletcher Loyer is able to play against No. 13 seed High Point on Thursday. The Boilermakers' third-leading scorer hurt his elbow during a quarterfinal loss to eventual champion Michigan in the Big Ten Tournament.",
      "The news wasn't so positive for No. 5 seed Clemson, which lost Dillon Hunter to a broken hand in the ACC Tournament. He had been averaging more than 22 minutes off the bench, and coach Brad Brownell described him as a \u201cglue guy\u201d for the Tigers.",
      "There's been no more closely watched injury than the one to Flagg, the first-team All-American from Duke, who sprained his ankle against Georgia Tech in the ACC Tournament. Flagg missed the rest of the tourney, but the Blue Devils were so confident in his availability that they informed the NCAA Tournament selection committee of it.",
      "The Blue Devils, who play American or Mount St. Mary's on Friday, probably won't need Flagg and his team-best 18.9 points, 7.5 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game in their opener. They might for a second-round game against Mississippi State or Baylor.",
      "Duke also is monitoring Maliq Brown, one of its best defenders, who re-injured his shoulder in the same game Flagg was hurt.",
      "In the bottom half of the East Region, second-seeded Alabama hopes Grant Nelson will be available this weekend, though he may miss its game against No. 15 seed Robert Morris on Friday. Nelson hurt his knee in the SEC Tournament.",
      "No. 10 seed Arkansas and coach John Calipari face seventh-seeded Kansas and Bill Self on Friday, and the Razorbacks expect to have freshman Boogie Fland on the floor. Their second-leading scorer and top distributor hurt his hand in January.",
      "The Razorbacks are still expected to be without Adou Thiero, their top scorer and rebounder, who missed their last six games because of a knee injury. That could hurt Arkansas' ability to defend the Jayhawks' 7-foot-2 center, Hunter Dickinson.",
      "Texas Tech coach Grant McCasland, whose third-seeded team plays No. 14 seed UNC Wilmington on Thursday, said he expects to have \u201ceverybody playing\u201d in its first-round matchup. That would include second-leading scorer Darrion Williams, who has been dealing with a leg injury, and third-leading scorer Chance McMillian, who has an upper-body injury.",
      "Memphis is unsure whether guards Tyrese Hunter (foot) and Dante Harris (ankle) will be available when the fifth-seeded Tigers play No. 12 seed Colorado State on Friday. Hunter started 32 games this season while Harris appeared in 16.",
      "Third-seeded Iowa State ruled out second-leading scorer Keshon Gilbert with a muscle strain that had limited him late in the season and allowed him to play just 11 minutes in the Big 12 Tournament. Gilbert also led the Cyclones in assists.",
      "That makes Tamin Lipsey's availability against No. 14 seed Lipscomb even more important. He sustained a groin injury in the Big 12 tourney and did not play in Iowa State's loss to BYU, but he should be on the floor for its NCAA opener.",
      "No. 8 seed Louisville is still monitoring the ankle of Reyne Smith, who sprained it on March 5 in a win over California and missed the ACC Tournament. But coach Pat Kelsey indicated the senior guard would play against No. 9 seed Creighton on Thursday.",

      "The 6-foot-9 forward said he needed further tests to determine the nature and extent of the injury.",
      "While lying on the court, Rogers reached out to grab Simpkins' hand as trainers looked at his knee. Rogers was helped to the locker room and quickly ruled out. He returned to the bench using crutches for the start of the second half, with his mother watching from the stands with tears rolling down her cheeks.",

      "Rogers averages 17 points a game and was making his NCAA Tournament debut after leading the Eagles to the Patriot League title and their first March Madness appearance since 2014. He had seven points before the injury.",
      "\u201cAs you can see, I tried to give it my all tonight,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cI feel like I still had a lot left in my heart for these guys because y\u2019all don\u2019t know what goes into this process of being a college basketball player. I was proud of the guys and how they responded and how they adapted with me not being out there.\u201d",
      "The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Rogers turned down what his father called \u201clife-changing money\u201d from an unnamed school to stay at American, which could only promise him free parking on its Northwest Washington campus and the occasional free meal if he chose to remain with the Eagles.",
      "\u201cFor me to go out like that, unfortunately, I wish I could have done more for us and for the AU community because they deserved an NCAA win,\u201d Rogers said.",

      "TOKYO -- Shohei Ohtani's every step, swing and smile were intensely followed this week during his homecoming at the Tokyo Dome, an event that would make most mortals wilt under the pressure.",
      "The Japanese slugger was introduced before each at-bat to loud roars that continued until a few seconds before the pitch, when the crowd went into a silent trance that\u2019s normally reserved for events like Wimbledon or the Masters. Every mighty hack \u2014 even if it produced a foul ball \u2014 drew gasps as roughly 42,000 fans waited to see if the national hero would deliver.",
      "And then, he did.",
      "Because of course he did.",

      "\u201cIt is pretty crazy to see the stuff he does on a daily basis.\u201d",
      "It's hard to fathom how much pressure Ohtani felt during his much-anticipated return to his home country, and manager Dave Roberts said he could feel the star's emotions, particularly during the Japanese national anthem on Tuesday night. It seemed like his picture was on half the billboards in Tokyo, and a huge chunk of the pregame advertisements on the center field video board featured his face.",
      "After admitting to some nerves during Tuesday's opener, the slugger was more relaxed a day later.",
      "It led to another baseball moment that will live in MLB lore for quite a while.",
      "Ohtani turned on a 99 mph fastball from Pearson and the crowd roared as the ball traveled on a majestic arc deep into the outfield. A few fans reached for the ball but couldn't make the catch. Cubs outfielder Pete Crow-Armstrong threw the ball back into the stands and a 10-year-old Japanese boy was the lucky recipient to a valuable souvenir.",
      "\u201cI was happy I was able to hit a homer off a pretty good pitcher,\" Ohtani said. \"I thought the ball was going to travel a little bit more, but I\u2019m glad it at least got in (the stands).\u201d",
      "The homer was upheld after an umpire review and gave the Dodgers a 6-2 lead, much to the delight of the roughly 42,000 in attendance.",
      "It was another example of Ohtani rising to the moment in a big occasion. The 30-year-old also homered in an exhibition game on Saturday against the Yomiuri Giants.",
      "\u201cI know Shohei puts his pants on like we all do \u2014 one leg at a time,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cBut if there's ever a superhero, I think Shohei just seems like a superstar. In the biggest of games, the biggest of moments, he always seems to deliver.\u201d",
      "The homer was Ohtani's third hit in the two-game Tokyo Series. He was 2 for 5 with a double and a single in the Dodgers' 4-1 win on Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that my teammates got to experience Japan on and off the field, but most importantly coming away with two wins is something really huge for us,\" Ohtani said. \"I\u2019m glad we\u2019re going to head back to the U.S. on a good note.\u201d",
      "Ohtani \u2014 who finished 1 for 3 with two walks on Wednesday \u2014 had two more plate appearances after the homer.",
      "He was intentionally walked in the seventh, which was met with loud disapproval from the fans. Ohtani had one more chance in the ninth with runners on first and second with one out, but drew another walk to load the bases before Tommy Edman grounded into a double play.",
      "It did little to damper the mood in Tokyo, where Ohtani's excellence was on display again.",

      "The 23-year-old's first six pitches of his career blazed toward the plate at 99.5, 99.5, 100, 100.5, 99.4 and 98.9 mph and he retired the first three Chicago Cubs batters in order, including countryman Seiya Suzuki on a swinging strikeout.",
      "Sasaki was obviously amped for the first inning and his grunts echoed throughout the Tokyo Dome as he fired his fastball. The lanky 6-foot-2 pitcher signed a minor league contract with a $6.5 million signing bonus back in January, becoming the 13th Japanese player to join the franchise.",
      "Sasaki ran into trouble in the second inning, walking Michael Busch and Dansby Swanson before he was aided by some good fortune. With one out, Pete Crow-Armstrong hit a hard liner that was snagged by shortstop Miguel Rojas, who was then able to step on second base to double up Busch for the final two outs.",
      "In the third, Jon Berti reached on an infield single and Sasaki walked Ian Happ, Seiya Suzuki and Kyle Tucker, which forced in a run and cut the Dodgers advantage to 3-1. But the rookie recovered, striking out Busch and Matt Shaw to end the threat.",
      "After Sasaki's initial burst of triple-digit velocity, he settled into the 97-99 mph range, and his famed splitter was occasionally spectacular, but often out of the strike zone.",
      "Sasaki left the game with the Dodgers holding a 5-1 lead.",

      "The winner will get an eight-year mandate with key issues including steering the Olympics on a smooth path in politics and sports toward the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles and picking a host for the 2036 edition. That could go to India or the Middle East for the first time.",

      "DENVER -- Perhaps the surest sign that artificial intelligence really is taking over the world will come the day it wins your favorite March Madness bracket pool.",
      "The day could be coming soon.",
      "In an experiment that a) was bound to happen, b) might actually make us all look smarter and c) should probably also scare the daylights out of everyone, a successful CEO-turned-disruptor is running a $1 million March Madness bracket challenge that pits his AI programmers' picks against those belonging to one of the world's best-known sports gamblers.",
      "\u201cWe're not a crystal ball,\u201d says Alan Levy, whose platform, 4C Predictions, is running this challenge. \u201cBut it's going to start to get very, very creepy. In 2025, we're making a million-dollar bet with a professional sports bettor, and the reason we feel confident to do that is because data, we feel, will beat humans.\u201d",
      "Levy isn't the only one leveraging AI to help people succeed in America's favorite pick 'em pool \u2014 one that's become even more lucrative over the past seven years, after a Supreme Court ruling led to the spread of legalized sports betting to 38 states.",
      "ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by OpenAI, is hawking its services to help bracket fillers more easily find stats and identify trends. Not surprisingly, it makes no promises.",
      "\u201cWith upsets, momentum shifts, and basketball\u2019s inherent unpredictability, consistently creating a perfect bracket may still come down to luck,\u201d said Leah Anise, a spokesperson for OpenAI.",
      "Also making no promises, but trying his hardest, is Sheldon Jacobson, the computer science professor at Illinois who has been trying to build a better bracket through science for years; he might have been AI before AI.",
      "\u201cNobody predicts the weather,\u201d he explained in an interview back in 2018. \u201cThey forecast it using chances and odds.\u201d",
      "Levy's angle is he's willing to wager $1 million that the AI bracket his company produces can beat that of professional gambler Sean Perry.",
      "Among Perry's claims to fame was his refusal to accept a four-way split in a pot worth $9.3 million in an NFL survivor pool two years ago. The next week, his pick, the Broncos, lost to New England and he ended up with nothing.",
      "But Perry has wagered and won millions over his career, using heaps of analytics, data and insider information to try to find an edge that, for decades, has been proprietary to casinos and legal sports books, giving them an advantage that allows them to build all those massive hotels.",
      "Levy says his ultimate goal is bring that advantage to the average Joe \u2014 either the weekly football bettor who doesn't have access to reams of data, or the March Madness bracket filler who goes by feel or what team's mascot he likes best.",
      "\u201cThe massive thesis is that the average person are playing games that they can never win, they're trading stocks where they can never win, they're trading crypto where they can never win,\u201d Levy said. \u201c4C gives people the chance to empower themselves. It's a great equalizer. It's going to level the playing field for everyone.\u201d",
      "It's one thing to find an edge, quite another to take out every element of chance \u2014 every halfcourt game-winner, every 4-point-a-game scorer who goes off for 25, every questionable call by a ref, every St. Peter's, Yale, FAU or UMBC that rises up and wins for reasons nobody quite understands.",
      "For those who fear AI is leading the world to bad places, Levy reassures us that when it comes to sports, at least, the human element is always the final decider \u2014 and humans can do funny and unexpected things.",
      "That's one of many reasons that, according to the NCAA, there's a 1 in 120.2 billion chance of a fan with good knowledge of college basketball going 63 for 63 in picking the games. It's one of many reasons that almost everyone has a story about their 8-year-old niece walking away with the pot because she was the only one who picked George Mason, or North Carolina State, or VCU, to make the Final Four.",
      "\u201cYou can't take the element of fun and luck out of it,\u201d Levy said. \u201cHaving said that, as AI develops, it's going to get creepier and creepier and the predictions are going to get more and more accurate, and it's all around data sets.\u201d",
      "Levy suggests AI is no three-headed monster, but rather, an advanced version of \u201cMoneyball\u201d \u2014 the classic book-turned-movie that followed Oakland A's GM Billy Beane's groundbreaking quest to leverage data to build a winning team.",
      "Now, it's all about putting all that data on steroids, trying to minimize the impact of luck and glass slippers, and building a winning bracket.",
      "\u201cWe've got to understand that this technology is meant to augment us,\u201d Levy said. \u201cIt's meant to make our lives better. So, let's encourage people to use it, and even if it's creepy, at least it's creepy on our side.\u201d",
      "The AI's side in this one: Houston to win it all. Perry, the gambler, is going with Duke.",

      "Despite it all, the Los Angeles Marathon's Legacy Runners have stuck to their mission: finish the race.",
      "On Sunday, the group of 92 marathoners, including 10 women, marked their 40th LA Marathon, participating in the 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) race every year since the city's iconic event began in 1986.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re legacy runners, we just don\u2019t know when to quit,\u201d 77-year-old Lou Briones said.",
      "Briones even has finished the race on crutches after surgery. Since getting both knees replaced, he walks the race.",
      "\u201cYou gotta do it,\u201d Briones said. \u201cNo matter what the conditions are, you gotta be there at the starting line on race day.\u201d",
      "When Briones and others gathered at the starting line for the first LA marathon, President Ronald Reagan had just been reelected and few weeks prior the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded, shocking the country. Tom Bradley was serving as the first Black mayor of Los Angeles and the city was grappling with the spread of HIV/AIDS.",
      "Los Angeles was inspired to start its own marathon after the success of hosting the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, much like the beginning of the Boston Marathon in 1897 after the first marathon competition was held in the 1896 Summer Olympics. Los Angeles is now preparing to host its next Olympics in 2028.",
      "Five years after the LA Marathon started, event organizers began recognizing runners who had completed every race with a plaque. They continued to hold celebrations for the dedicated runners every five years.",
      "Around the 15th year, Briones decided he wanted to formalize the group. He and a friend printed out stickers with an email address and brought them to the marathon in 2002.",
      "\u201cWe went to the race and we just started yelling out,\u201d Briones said. \u201cWe\u2019d stick it right on their bib, and then after the race, most of them immediately sent an email. That was the beginning.\u201d",
      "Some Legacy Runners said they were inspired by U.S. runner Joan Benoit, who won the first Olympic women\u2019s marathon at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.",
      "May DuBois, 80, remembers watching the race on TV and seeing Benoit finish far ahead of the rest of the pack of runners. A classical pianist, she had never run in her life.",
      "Two years later, DuBois ran the same path as Benoit \u2014 starting and ending at the Memorial Coliseum \u2014 since back then, the LA Marathon route was the same as the Olympics. She said it felt just \u201clike running in the Olympics with everybody cheering us on.\u201d",
      "Now, she can\u2019t imagine going a day without running 3 to 5 miles (4.8 to 8 km).",
      "\u201cI\u2019m healthy, I look good, and I don\u2019t get tired. I never get sick, I don\u2019t even catch colds,\u201d said DuBois, who hosts a brunch to celebrate after each marathon.",
      "Each year, Legacy Runners are given the same bib number. They start meeting monthly for training about six months before the marathon.",
      "Cliff Housego, 76, started running after his father died at 48 from a heart attack. He decided he wanted to live long enough to see his grandchildren and even great-grandchildren.",
      "Over the years, Housego has gone through two divorces and lost his daughter. Through it all, the marathon has been a constant in his life.",
      "\u201cMany, many things could\u2019ve stopped me from being there,\u201d Housego said.",
      "At 83, Sharon Kerson realizes that, too.",
      "After a year of dealing with sickness and vertigo, Kerson completed her training last week at the West Los Angeles College track, the same place she first started running more than 40 years ago. She has run more than 600 marathons.",
      "She wore a rain jacket from the St. George Marathon in Utah, shorts from the San Francisco Marathon and a T-shirt from the 30th LA Marathon.",
      "\u201cI never was fast and I\u2019m not competitive at all,\u201d Kerson said, adding that her only goal each time is to finish.",
      "Rick Bingham began racing in a wheelchair a decade ago after injuring his Achilles tendon during a triathlon. At 87, he swims half a mile (0.8 kilometer) every other day and lifts weights. To train, he went 5 miles (8 kilometers) one day around his ranch in a wheelchair.",
      "Bingham has no plans to slow down. He wants to reach his 50th LA Marathon.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll only be 97 when I do that,\u201d he said.",

She's due to lead another Axiom crew to the space station later this spring. Because of her delayed homecoming, Williams moved into the No. 2 spot with 608 days in space over three missions.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon has sued the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission for finding the e-commerce giant legally responsible for the recalls of hundreds of thousands of products sold on its site.",
      "The independent federal agency ordered Amazon in January to take several actions, including notifying customers who bought more than 400,000 items covered by recalls and giving refunds to those who could prove the products were properly disposed of or destroyed.",
      "The order followed the commission's unanimous determination last summer that Amazon was a \u201cdistributor\u201d of faulty items sold on its website by third-party sellers and shipped through the company\u2019s fulfillment service",
      "But Amazon has long disputed it qualifies as a \u201cdistributor\u201d of products offered by other sellers. In its lawsuit filed on March 14, the company maintained it serves as a \u201cthird-party logistics provider\" and therefore should not be held liable for recalls of products that were made, owned and sold by others.",
      "The commission sued Amazon in 2021 for allegedly distributing hazardous items, accusing the company of putting consumer safety at risk by failing to properly notify the public about recalled products that included defective carbon monoxide detectors and flammable children\u2019s pajamas.",
      "Amazon said in its lawsuit that it issued previous recall notices and some refunds shortly after the CPSC raised safety concerns several years ago. The company argues the commission is an \u201cunconstitutionally structured agency\u201d that overstepped its authority with the new directive.",
      "\u201cThe remedies ordered by the CPSC are largely duplicative of the steps we took several years ago to protect customers, which are the same steps we take whenever we learn about unsafe products,\u201d Amazon said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. The Seattle-based company said it could not comment further on its lawsuit filed last week.",
      "Amazon and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX also have active lawsuits challenging the structure of the National Labor Relations Board as unconstitutional. The two companies initiated the cases after the labor agency filed complaints against them in disputes about workers\u2019 rights and union organizing.",
      "The Consumer Product Safety Commission declined to comment Wednesday on Amazon's lawsuit complaint. In a Jan. 17 statement about the hazardous products order, Commissioner Richard L. Trumka Jr. said it was the CPSC's job to \u201chold companies like Amazon accountable\" and \u201cno company is above the law.\u201d",

      "The research led by Washington University in St. Louis involves families that pass down rare gene mutations almost guaranteeing they\u2019ll develop symptoms at the same age their affected relatives did \u2013 information that helps scientists tell if treatments are having any effect.",
      "The new findings center on a subset of 22 participants who received amyloid-removing drugs the longest, on average eight years. Long-term amyloid removal cut in half their risk of symptom onset, researchers reported Wednesday in the journal Lancet Neurology.",
      "Despite the study\u2019s small size, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly important,\u201d said Northwestern University neuroscientist David Gate, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "Now participants have been switched from an earlier experimental drug to Leqembi, an IV treatment approved in the U.S., to try to answer the obvious next question.",
      "\u201cWhat we want to determine over the next five years is how strong is the protection,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Dr. Randall Bateman, who directs the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer\u2019s Network of studies involving families with these rare genes. \u201cWill they ever get the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease if we keep treating them?\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the worry: Bateman raised money to start that confirmatory study while seeking National Institutes of Health funding for the full project but his grant has been delayed as required reviews were canceled. It's one example of how millions of dollars in research have been stalled as NIH grapples with funding restrictions and mass firings.",
      "At the same time researchers wonder if NIH will shift focus away from amyloid research after comments by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, nominated as the agency's new director.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons I think that we have not made progress in Alzheimer\u2019s, as much as we ought to have, is because the NIH has not supported a sufficiently wide range of hypotheses,\u201d Bhattacharya told senators, responding to one who brought up an example of earlier science misconduct unrelated to current research.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know exactly what causes Alzheimer\u2019s, a mind-destroying disease that affects nearly 7 million Americans, mostly late in life. What\u2019s clear is that silent changes occur in the brain at least two decades before the first symptoms -- and that sticky amyloid is a major contributor. At some point amyloid buildup appears to trigger a protein named tau to begin killing neurons, which drives cognitive decline.",
      "Tau-fighting drugs now are being tested. Researchers also are studying other factors including inflammation, the brain\u2019s immune cells and certain viruses.",
      "NIH\u2019s focus expanded as researchers found more potential culprits. In 2013, NIH\u2019s National Institute on Aging funded 14 trials of possible Alzheimer\u2019s drugs, over a third targeting amyloid. By last fall, there were 68 drug trials and about 18% targeted amyloid.",
      "Northwestern\u2019s Gate counts himself among scientists who \u201cthink amyloid isn\u2019t everything,\u201d but said nothing has invalidated the amyloid hypothesis. He recently used brain tissue preserved from an old amyloid study to learn how immune cells called microglia can clear those plaques and then switch to helping the brain heal, possible clues for improving today's modest therapies.",
      "For now, amyloid clearly is implicated somehow and families with Alzheimer's-causing genes are helping answer a critical question for anyone at risk: Can blocking amyloid buildup really stave off symptoms? Without NIH funding, Bateman said, that opportunity will be lost.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane,\u201d said longtime study participant June Ward, who lives near Asheville, North Carolina, and plans to ask friends to complain to lawmakers.",
      "Ward turns 64 in June and is healthy, two years older than when her mother's symptoms appeared. \u201cIt is exciting to think about the possibility that Alzheimer\u2019s disease might not be what gets me,\u201d she said.",
      "In New York, Heinrichs said he has hope that his 3-year-old son won\u2019t \u201cexperience the stress and sorrow that I lived through as a young man to watch my father fade away.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need the NIH to be not politicized,\u201d added Chavkin, his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s just about keeping people alive or helping them live better. And in this case, it\u2019s helping my husband survive.\u201d",

      "States and cities across the country are grappling with how to stay on the right side of government transparency laws as the use of encrypted messaging apps becomes more widespread",
      "As a devastating wildfire burned through a Maui town, killing more than 100 people, emergency management employees traded dozens of text messages, creating a record that would later help investigators piece together the government's response to the 2023 tragedy.",
      "One text exchange hinted officials might also be using a second, untraceable messaging service.",
      "\u201cThat's what Signal was supposed to be for,\u201d then-Maui Emergency Management Agency Administrator Herman Andaya texted a colleague.",
      "Signal is one of many end-to-end encrypted messaging apps that include message auto-delete functions.",
      "While such apps promise increased security and privacy, they often skirt open records laws meant to increase transparency around and public awareness of government decision-making. Without special archiving software, the messages frequently aren't returned under public information requests.",
      "An Associated Press review in all 50 states found accounts on encrypted platforms registered to cellphone numbers for over 1,100 government workers and elected officials.",
      "It's unclear if Maui officials actually used the app or simply considered it \u2014 a county spokesperson did not respond to questions \u2014 but the situation highlights a growing challenge: How can government entities use technological advancements for added security while staying on the right side of public information laws?",
      "The AP found accounts for state, local and federal officials in nearly every state, including many legislators and their staff, but also staff for governors, state attorneys general, education departments and school board members.",
      "The AP is not naming the officials because having an account is neither against the rules in most states, nor proof they use the apps for government business. While many of those accounts were registered to government cellphone numbers, some were registered to personal numbers. The AP's list is likely incomplete because users can make accounts unsearchable.",
      "Improper use of the apps has been reported over the past decade in places like Missouri, Oregon, Oklahoma, Maryland and elsewhere, almost always because of leaked messages.",
      "Public officials and private citizens are consistently warned about hacking and data leaks, but technologies designed to increase privacy often decrease government transparency.",
      "Apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Confide, Telegram and others use encryption to scramble messages so only the intended end-user can read them, and they typically aren\u2019t stored on government servers. Some automatically delete messages, and some prevent users from screenshotting or sharing messages.",
      "\u201cThe fundamental problem is that people do have a right to use encrypted apps for their personal communications, and have those on their personal devices. That\u2019s not against the law,\u201d said Matt Kelly, editor of Radical Compliance, a newsletter that focuses on corporate compliance and governance issues. \u201cBut how would an organization be able to distinguish how an employee is using it?\u201d",
      "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, has recommended that \u201chighly valued targets\u201d \u2014 senior officials who handle sensitive information \u2014 use encryption apps for confidential communications. Those communications are not typically releasable under public record laws.",
      "CISA leaders also say encrypted communications could be a useful security measure for the public, but did not encourage government officials to use the apps to skirt public information laws.",
      "Journalists, including many at the AP, often use encrypted messages when talking to sources or whistleblowers.",
      "While some cities and states are grappling with how to stay transparent, public record laws aren\u2019t evolving as quickly as technology, said Smarsh general manager Lanika Mamac. The Portland, Oregon-based company helps governments and businesses archive digital communications.",
      "\u201cPeople are worried more about cybersecurity attacks. They\u2019re trying to make sure it\u2019s secure,\u201d Mamac said. \u201cI think that they are really trying to figure out, \u2018How do I balance being secure and giving transparency?\u2019\u201d",
      "Mamac said Smarsh has seen an uptick in inquiries, mostly from local governments. But many others have done little to restrict the apps or clarify rules for their use.",
      "In 2020, the New Mexico Child, Youth and Families Department\u2019s new division director told employees to use the app Signal for internal communications and to delete messages after 24 hours. A 2021 investigation into the possible violation of New Mexico\u2019s document retention rules was followed by a court settlement with two whistleblowers and the division director's departure.",
      "But New Mexico still lacks regulations on using encrypted apps. The AP's review found at least three department or agency directors had Signal accounts as of December 2024.",
      "In Michigan, State Police leaders were found in 2021 to be using Signal on state-issued cellphones. Michigan lawmakers responded by banning the use of encrypted messaging apps on state employees\u2019 work-issued devices if they hinder public record requests.",
      "However, Michigan's law did not include penalties for violations, and monitoring the government-owned devices used by 48,000 executive branch employees is a monumental task.",
      "The best remedy is stronger public record laws, said David Cuillier, director of the Brechner Freedom of Information Project at the University of Florida. Most state laws already make clear that the content of communication \u2014 not the method \u2014 is what makes something a public record, but many of those laws lack teeth, he said.",
      "\u201cThey should only be using apps if they are able to report the communications and archive them like any other public record,\u201d he said.",
      "Generally, Cuillier said, there\u2019s been a decrease in government transparency over the past few decades. To reverse that, governments could create independent enforcement agencies, add punishments for violations, and create a transparent culture that supports technology, he said.",
      "\u201cWe used to be a beacon of light when it came to transparency. Now, we\u2019re not. We have lost our way,\u201d Cuillier said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Scientists are homing in on the nature of a mysterious force called dark energy, and nothing short of the fate of the universe hangs in the balance.",
      "The force is enormous \u2014 it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful \u2014 it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate.",
      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, which scientists have long thought, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year.",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe.",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe\u2019s history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements \u2014 exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape \u2014 support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning.",
      "\u201cIt's moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we've thought about cosmology and start over,\u201d said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist with the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the research.",
      "It's not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026. And other efforts around the globe have an eye on dark energy and aim to release their own data in the coming years, including the European Space Agency\u2019s Euclid mission and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.",
      "\u201cWe want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements\u201d at that gold standard to be sure that dark energy is weakening, said cosmologist Kris Pardo with the University of Southern California who was not involved with the new research.",
      "If dark energy is constant, scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still.",
      "If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what\u2019s called the Big Crunch. It might not seem like the cheeriest fate, but it offers some closure, said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas.",
      "\u201cNow, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,\u201d he said. \u201cWould we consider that a good or bad thing? I don\u2019t know.\u201d",

      "The prime minister's office said the Canadian $6 billion ($4.2 billion) Over-the-Horizon Radar system will provide early warning radar coverage from the Canada-United States border into the Arctic.",
      "Carney announced the purchase at a military base in the capital of the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut on his last stop after visiting Paris and London for meetings with leaders there.",
      "\u201cArctic sovereignty is a strategic priority of our government,\u201d Carney said. \u201c\u201cCanada is, and forever will be, an Arctic nation.\"",
      "The Australian radar system will consist of a series of pillars almost a mile (1.6 kilometers) in length. Officials said that the system would have a smaller footprint than what the similar American system would take up.",

      "\u201cObviously, there are issues taking place, particularly between Canada and the United States, I wouldn\u2019t have expected to have been happening in my lifetime,\" Albanese said.",
      "Senior Canadian government officials, who briefed reporters on Carney's plane before the announcement, said the purchase has been well received by top military officials in the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the joint U.S.-Canadian military command that overseas threats over the two countries.",
      "But the officials said they couldn't say how the Australian purchase would be received politically by Washington. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Carney also announced the government will spend Canadian $420 million ($294 million) to expand Canada\u2019s Arctic operations and training exercises and deploy more personnel. He said Canada will have a \u201cgreater sustained year-round presence.\u201d",
      "The prime minister\u2019s flight path took him over Greenland. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland, northeast of Nunavut, comes as part of an aggressively \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy platform that has included threats to take control of the Panama Canal and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "\u201cThe United States priorities, once closely aligned with our own, are beginning to shift,\" Carney said.",
      "Trump has threatened economic coercion to make Canada the 51st state. His constant talk of annexation has infuriated Canadians and turned around the political fortunes of the governing Liberal party, which was headed for a historic defeat but now has a chance of winning a fourth term. Carney is expected to call a general election by the end of the week.",
      "The president is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products and has already placed them on steel and aluminum.",
      "Carney and Trump have not spoken since Carney was elected as the new Liberal party leader and prime minister more than a week ago. Carney said at the \u201cappropriate time\u201d he will have a discussion with the U.S. president, as \u201ctwo sovereign nations, that is comprehensive and not targeted at one issue.\u201d",
      "But Trump keeps disrespecting Canada, saying twice on Fox News on Tuesday night that that \u201cCanada was meant to be the 51st state.\"",
      "He said that's why he's he's tougher on his neighbor than America's biggest adversaries.",
      "Trump also repeated several times that he didn't care that the Liberals might win the Canadian election now.",
      "\u201cThe Conservative that\u2019s running is stupidly no friend of mine. I don\u2019t know, but he said negative things,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo, when he says negative things, I couldn\u2019t care less. I think it\u2019s easier to deal actually with a Liberal. And maybe they\u2019re going to win, but I don\u2019t really care. It doesn\u2019t matter to me at all.\u201d",
      "Carney visited Iqaluit, which is by far the largest municipality in Nunavut, a vast territory straddling the Arctic Circle. Nunavut is roughly the size of the U.S. states of Alaska and California combined, with a mostly Inuit population of about 40,000.",
      "For much of the year, the weather in Iqaluit can be severe. In February 2010, Iqaluit hosted a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven nations. Several of the dignitaries, including Carney when he was head of Canada\u2019s central bank, went dogsledding in subfreezing temperatures.",

      "South African officials say a member of a research team at an isolated Antarctica base has been put under psychological evaluation after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- A member of a South African research team that is confined for more than a year at an isolated Antarctica base was put under psychological evaluation there after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues, government officials said.",
      "The problems at the SANAE IV base were first reported by South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, which said it had seen an email from a team member to authorities last month claiming the man had attacked the base leader and made threats.",
      "The email pleaded for help.",
      "\u201cHis behavior has escalated to a point that is deeply disturbing,\u201d the email said, according to The Sunday Times. \u201cI remain deeply concerned about my own safety, constantly wondering if I might become the next victim.\u201d The report said the man allegedly made a death threat.",
      "South Africa\u2019s Ministry of Environment, which oversees the research missions, said in a statement Monday night that the alleged assault on the base leader was reported on Feb. 27, and officials and counselors intervened remotely \u201cto mediate and restore relationships at the base.\u201d They were speaking with team members almost daily, it said.",
      "\u201cThe alleged perpetrator has willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative,\u201d the ministry said, adding that he had written a formal apology to the victim of the alleged assault. It said the allegations were being investigated. No one was identified.",
      "The nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June.",
      "The base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa.",
      "The next planned visit by a supply ship is in December, according to the South African National Antarctic Program. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town.",
      "Authorities said they had decided not to evacuate anyone from SANAE IV, where the onset of unpredictable weather conditions meant the team was now confined to the base.",
      "The ministry said all team members had undergone evaluations ahead of the trip to ensure they are able to cope with the \u201cextreme nature of the environment in Antarctica\u201d and the isolation and confinement, and no problems were identified.",
      "\u201cIt is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required,\u201d it said.",
      "Previous problems have been reported at another of South Africa's remote research bases on Marion Island, a South African territory near Antarctica.",
      "In 2017, a member of a research team there smashed a colleague's room with an ax over an apparent love triangle, according to a report to South Africa's Parliament. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions.",
      "The National Science Foundation, the federal agency that oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, published a report in 2022 in which 59% of women in the U.S. program said they\u2019d experienced harassment or assault while on research trips in Antarctica.",

      "If closed, the-cash transaction, announced Tuesday, will become Google\u2019s most expensive acquisition in the company\u2019s 25-year history. The purchase gives Google new momentum in its efforts to compete in the cloud-computing business by offering more security for its services.",
      "\u201cWiz and Google Cloud are both fueled by the belief that cloud security needs to be easier, more accessible, more intelligent, and democratized, so more organizations can adopt and use cloud and AI securely,\u201d Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport said in a blog post.",
      "The company says Wiz will join Google Cloud \u2014 and that this deal represents a company investment \u201cto accelerate two large and growing trends in the AI era: improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds.\u201d",
      "Together, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a statement, Google Cloud and Wiz \u201cwill turbocharge improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds.\u201d",
      "Assaf Rappaport, Co-Founder & CEO, added that the deal will \u201cbolster our mission to improve security and prevent breaches by providing additional resources and deep AI expertise.\u201d",
      "Wiz, based in New York, was founded in 2020, makes security tools designed to shield the information stored in remote data centers from intruders.",
      "Google has had its eyes on Wiz for some time. The purchase price announced Tuesday surpasses a reported $23 billion buyout proposal that Wiz rejected last July.",
      "The proposed buyout will get a close look from antitrust regulators. While many expect the Trump administration to be more friendly to business deals, it has also shown skepticism of big tech.",
      "Also, the new Federal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson has vowed to maintain a tough review process for mergers and acquisitions.",

      "NASA's stuck astronauts are heading home now that a replacement crew has arrived at the International Space Station",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were barely known outside space circles when they strapped in for what was supposed to be a quick test flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule last June. Nine months later, they've captured the world's attention \u2014 and hearts \u2014 as NASA's stuck astronauts.",
      "Their homecoming is imminent now that a new crew has arrived at the International Space Station to replace them after launching from Florida last week. They'll fly back with SpaceX as soon as Tuesday, their problem-plagued Starliner having returned to Earth empty months ago, leaving them behind in orbit.",
      "Here's a look at \u201cSuni and Butch\u201d and their drama-filled mission:",
      "The two test pilots came to NASA via the Navy. Wilmore, 62, played high school and college football in his home state of Tennessee before joining the Navy. Williams, 59, grew up in Needham, Massachusetts, a competitive swimmer and distance runner.",
      "Wilmore racked up 663 aircraft carrier landings, while Williams served in combat helicopter squadrons.",
      "NASA picked Williams as an astronaut in 1998 followed by Wilmore in 2000. Each had two spaceflights behind them including monthslong stints at the space station before signing up as Starliner's first crew.",
      "While they accepted their repeated homecoming delays, they noted it was much harder on their families. Wilmore\u2019s wife Deanna has held down the fort, according to her husband. Their oldest daughter is in college and their youngest in her last year of high school.",
      "Williams\u2019 husband, Mike, a retired federal marshal, has been caring for their two Labrador retrievers. She said her mother is the worrier.",
      "Besides reuniting with loved ones, Wilmore, an elder with his Baptist church, can\u2019t wait to get back to face-to-face ministering and smelling fresh-cut grass.",
      "Wilmore kept in touch with members of his congregation over the months, taking part in occasional prayer services and calling ailing members via the space station's internet phone.",
      "Williams looks forward to long walks with her dogs and an ocean swim.",
      "Several other astronauts have spent even longer in space so no special precautions should be needed for these two once they're back, according to NASA.",
      "\u201cEvery astronaut that launches into space, we teach them don't think about when you're coming home. Think about how well your mission's going and if you're lucky, you might get to stay longer,\u201d NASA's space operations mission chief and former astronaut Ken Bowersox said last week.",
      "Wilmore and Williams found themselves in the middle of a political storm when President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk announced at the end of January they would accelerate the astronauts' return and blamed the Biden Administration on keeping them up there too long.",
      "NASA officials stood by their decision to wait for the next scheduled SpaceX flight to bring them home, targeting a February return. But their replacements got held up back on Earth because of battery work on their brand new SpaceX capsule.",
      "SpaceX switched capsules to speed things up, moving up their return by a couple of weeks. The two will come back in the capsule that's been up there since last fall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to see how much people care about our astronauts,\u201d Bowersox said, describing the pair as \u201cprofessional, devoted, committed, really outstanding.\u201d",
      "Astronauts almost always fly back in the same spacecraft they launched in. Wilmore and Williams launched aboard Boeing's Starliner and will return in SpaceX's Dragon.",
      "Their first flights were aboard NASA's space shuttle, followed by Russia's Soyuz capsule. Both the Starliner and Dragon are completely autonomous but capable of manual command if necessary.",
      "As test pilots, they were in charge of the Starliner. The Dragon had fellow astronaut Nick Hague in command; he launched in it last September with a Russian and two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Starliner almost didn't make it to the space station. Soon after the June 5 liftoff, helium leaked and thrusters malfunctioned on the way to the orbiting lab.",
      "NASA and Boeing spent the summer trying to figure out what went wrong and whether the problems would repeat on the flight back, endangering its two test pilots. NASA ultimately decided it was too risky and ordered the capsule back empty in September.",
      "Engineers are still investigating the thruster breakdowns, and it's unclear when Starliner will fly again \u2014 with astronauts or just cargo. NASA went into its commercial crew program wanting two competing U.S. companies for taxi service for redundancy's sake and stand by that choice.",

      "A new study out Monday finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef is no less carbon-intensive than industrial beef",
      "For cattle fattened in fields instead of feedlots, the grass may be greener, but the carbon emissions are not.",
      "A study out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef produces no less planet-warming carbon emissions than industrial beef. The finding calls into question the frequent promotion of grass-fed beef as a more environmentally friendly option. Still, other scientists say grass-fed beef wins out on other factors like animal welfare or local environmental pollution, complicating the choice for conscientious consumers.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a large portion of the population who really do wish their purchasing decisions will reflect their values,\u201d said Gidon Eshel, a research professor of environmental physics at Bard College and one of the study's authors. \u201cBut they are being misled, essentially, by the wrong information.\u201d",
      "When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it\u2019s being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.",
      "The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.",
      "Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn\u2019t make up for the emissions of the cattle.",
      "Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions \u201cwithout concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,\u201d like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.",
      "The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.",
      "Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper \u201chelps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,\u201d she said.",
      "Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.",
      "It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is \u201csecond to none\u201d when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,\" Eshel said.",
      "For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, \"don't make beef a habit.\"",

      "Iguanas may have pulled off a 5000 mile voyage on a raft of floating vegetation to get to Fiji",
      "NEW YORK -- Researchers have long wondered how iguanas got to Fiji, a collection of remote islands in the South Pacific. Most modern-day iguanas live in the Americas \u2014 thousands of miles and one giant ocean away.",
      "They thought maybe they scurried there through Asia or Australia before volcanic activity pushed Fiji so far away.",
      "But new research suggests that millions of years ago, iguanas pulled off the 5,000 mile (8,000 kilometer) odyssey on a raft of floating vegetation \u2014 masses of uprooted trees and small plants. That journey is thought to be a record \u2014 further than any other land-dwelling vertebrate has ever traveled on the ocean.",
      "Scientists think that's how iguanas got to the Galapagos Islands off of Ecuador and between islands in the Caribbean. Initially they thought Fiji might be a bit too far for such a trip, but in a new study, researchers inspected the genes of 14 iguana species spanning the Americas, the Caribbean and Fiji. They discovered that Fijian iguanas were most closely related to desert iguanas from North America, and that the two groups split off around 31 million years ago.",
      "The researchers created a statistical model using that information and other tidbits about where iguanas live today and how they may spread. It suggested that the iguanas most likely floated to Fiji from North America.",
      "\u201cGiven what we know now, their result is by far the most strongly supported,\u201d said Kevin de Queiroz, an evolutionary biologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The research was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
      "The journey from North America to Fiji could have taken a few months, but these desert iguanas would have been ideal passengers because they were adept at resisting dehydration and could have snacked on the plants underfoot.",
      "\u201cIf you had to pick a vertebrate to survive a long trip on a raft across an ocean, iguanas would be the one,\u201d said study author Simon Scarpetta from the University of San Francisco, in an email.",

      "Arizona highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of all rulings issued by the justices",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona's highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of every ruling issued by the justices, marking what is believed to be the first example in the U.S. of a state court system tapping artificial intelligence to build more human-like characters to connect with the public.",
      "A court in Florida uses an animated chatbot to help visitors navigate its website, but the Arizona Supreme Court is charting new territory with the creation of Victoria and Daniel. Made of pixels, the two avatars have a different job in that they serve as the face of news coming from the court just as a spokesperson made of flesh and blood would do \u2014 but faster.",
      "The use of AI has touched nearly every profession and discipline, growing exponentially in recent years and showing infinite potential when it comes to things as simple as internet searches or as complex as brain surgery. For officials with the Arizona Supreme Court, their venture into AI is rooted in a desire to promote trust and confidence in the judicial system.",
      "There was a protest outside the state Capitol last April and calls for two justices to be booted after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that a Civil War-era law that banned nearly all abortions, except when a woman\u2019s life is in jeopardy, could be enforced. Emotions flared on both sides of the issue.",
      "When Chief Justice Ann Timmer took over the court last summer, she made public trust a key pillar of her platform. She had already been thinking about ways to reach out to the public using digital media for a few years, and the abortion ruling, among other rulings, helped her to solidify the idea that the court needs to be part of the narrative as people learn about opinions and what they mean.",
      "\u201cWe serve the public better by saying, OK, we\u2019ve issued this decision,\" she said. \"Now, let us help you understand what it is.\u201d",
      "Timmer told The Associated Press earlier this year that if the court had to do the abortion ruling over again, it would have approached the dissemination of information differently. In a Wednesday interview, she said that a news release and avatar video could have helped the public better understand the legal underpinnings of the lengthy decision \u2014 possibly including what it didn't do, which she said some misunderstood.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of backlash for it and probably deservedly so, in terms of how can we complain that people don\u2019t understand what we did when we didn\u2019t really do enough to give a simplified version,\" she said in the January interview, explaining that people want to know the basis for the court\u2019s decisions and what they can do, such as lobbying state lawmakers for whatever changes in law would support their positions.",
      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a repeal of the ban last May, and in November, Arizona voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding abortion access up to the point of fetal viability.",
      "Created with a program called Creatify, Daniel and Victoria in a way bring to life the court's news releases. Videos featuring one or the other are being posted for every ruling by the high court, and may be used for Access to Justice projects, community programs and civics information in the future.",
      "The court has been sending out releases since October to summarize and explain rulings. After seeing success with the releases, it began exploring options to convey that information through video.",
      "The AI-generated avatars were the most efficient way to produce videos and get the information out, said court spokesperson Alberto Rodriguez. Producing a video usually can take hours, he said, but an AI-generated video is ready in about 30 minutes. The court might introduce more AI-generated reporters in the future, Rodriguez said in a news release.",
      "The justice who authors the legal opinion also drafts a news release, the wording of which must be approved by the entire bench. The justice then works with the court's communications team to craft a script for the avatars \u2014 the avatars aren't interpreting original court decisions or opinions, Rodriguez said.",
      "Daniel and Victoria's names and physical appearances were designed to represent a wide cross-section of people, Rodriguez said. He said they aren\u2019t meant to come off as real people and the court emphasizes their AI origins with disclaimers. The court is exploring different emotional deliveries, cadences and pronunciations as well as Spanish translations for the avatars, Rodriguez said.",
      "Mason Kortz, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, described the court's new cyber employees as \"quite realistic.\" While their voices might give them away, he said some people could be fooled into thinking that Daniel and Victoria are real reporters if viewers are only reading the subtitles and looking at the characters' movements and facial expressions.",
      "Kortz also said it would be better for the language of the disclaimer that is in the videos' text description to be featured more prominently.",
      "\u201cYou want to make it as hard as possible for someone to advertently or inadvertently remove the disclaimer,\u201d he said.",
      "Asheley Landrum, associate professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, said the avatars feel robotic. She said a format that mimics real dialogue and storytelling might be more engaging than an AI reading of a news release.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s not just about using AI or even creating videos,\u201d she said, \u201cbut about doing so in a way that really resonates with audiences.\u201d",
      "Still, it's fine line. She said engaging characteristics can help to build trust over time but the danger is that content could appear biased.",

      "Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost lander fell silent over the weekend, wrapping up two weeks of science experiments for NASA. The end came as the sun set at the moon, no longer providing energy for the lander\u2019s solar panels.",
      "\u201cMission is completed,\u201d Firefly CEO Jason Kim said via X late Sunday night. \"But the Ghost still lives on in our hearts and minds for the journey it\u2019s taken us on!\"",
      "The lander operated five hours into the lunar night as planned before it died Sunday evening. Photos of the lunar sunset and glow will be released on Tuesday, Kim said.",
      "Blue Ghost launched from Cape Canaveral in January as part of NASA\u2019s commercial lunar delivery program. It landed at the moon\u2019s far northeastern edge on March 2. It carried a drill, vacuum and other science and tech instruments for NASA. Firefly confirmed Monday that all 10 experiments worked.",
      "Late last week, Blue Ghost observed a total solar eclipse from the moon \u2014 a total lunar eclipse as seen from Earth.",
      "The Texas-based Firefly became the first private company to land on the moon without falling or crashing after a string of failed missions by other companies over the past few years. Only five countries \u2014 the United States, Russia, China, India and Japan \u2014 have achieved a successful landing.",
      "A Japanese company's lunar lander shared the SpaceX rocket ride, but took an even longer route to get to the moon. That lander from ispace is targeting an early June touchdown.",
      "Another Texas company, Intuitive Machines, ended up sideways in a crater near the moon's south pole earlier this month, dooming the mission. It was the second incomplete mission for Intuitive Machines. Its first lander put the U.S. back on the moon last year for the first time since the Apollo era after a less-than-perfect landing that hampered communications.",
      "Firefly is already working on its next lunar lander and striving for one moon landing a year.",

      "The bus pulls away from the stop with its passengers on its own, brakes before changing lanes and eases down one of Barcelona\u2019s most fashionable boulevards.",
      "Renault is testing a new driverless mini-bus in Barcelona this week. The autonomous vehicle is running on a 2.2-km (1.3-mile) circular route with four stops in the center of the Spanish city. Adventurous commuters can jump on free of charge.",
      "The French carmaker has teamed up with WeRide, a company specializing in autonomous vehicles, to make the prototype. It unveiled the driverless bus at the French Open venue last year, but now it is testing it on the open road in Barcelona. It also has testing projects going in Valence, France, and at the Zurich airport.",
      "Pau Cugat was one of the curious to step aboard for a short ride along Passeig de Gracia boulevard.",
      "\u201cWe just passed by a regular, combustion-engine city bus, and I thought, \u2018Look, there is a bus of the past, and right behind it you have the bus of the future,\u2019\u201d the 18-year-old student said.",
      "Driverless taxis and buses are being tried out by companies in other cities, from San Francisco to Tokyo.",
      "But Renault\u2019s initiative comes as Europe generally lags behind the United States and China in driverless vehicle technology, where companies are fiercely competing to get ahead.",
      "\u201cThe US is doing a lot of experimentation with autonomous vehicles, the same thing in China,\u201d Patrick Vergelas, head of Renault's autonomous mobility projects, told The Associated Press. \u201cUntil now we don\u2019t have a lot in fact in Europe. And this is why we want to show that this works and prepare Europe to this route in public transportation.\u201d",
      "The electric bus can run for 120 kilometers without a recharge and reach 40 kilometers per hour (25 mph). It is equipped with 10 cameras and eight lidars (sensor arrays) to help it navigate the streets filled with cars, motorbikes and pedestrians. The company says the bus is able to drive safely on a given course through a busy downtown like that of bustling Barcelona.",
      "Carlos Santos, of Renault\u2019s autonomous driving group, said that he has seen all types of reactions from riders.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of behaviors of people. Some of them were smiling, (while) other people just start crying, taking photographs or even try to open the doors,\" Santos said before he insisted that the bus ride was a safe one.",
      "Barcelona's city officials said that they have had no reports of accidents caused by the experimental bus.",

      "In an advisory posted earlier this week, government officials warned that a ransomware-as-a-service software called Medusa, which has launched ransomware attacks since 2021, has recently affected hundreds of people. Medusa uses phishing campaigns as its main method for stealing victims' credentials, according to CISA.",
      "To protect against the ransomware, officials recommended patching operating systems, software and firmware, in addition to using multifactor authentication for all services such as email and VPNs. Experts also recommended using long passwords, and warned against frequently recurring password changes because they can weaken security.",
      "Medusa developers and affiliates \u2014 called \u201cMedusa actors\u201d \u2014 use a double extortion model, where they \u201cencrypt victim data and threaten to publicly release exfiltrated data if a ransom is not paid,\u201d the advisory said. Medusa operates a data-leak site that shows victims alongside countdowns to the release of information.",
      "\u201cRansom demands are posted on the site, with direct hyperlinks to Medusa affiliated cryptocurrency wallets,\u201d the advisory said. \u201cAt this stage, Medusa concurrently advertises sale of the data to interested parties before the countdown timer ends. Victims can additionally pay $10,000 USD in cryptocurrency to add a day to the countdown timer.\u201d",
      "Since February, Medusa developers and affiliates have hit more than 300 victims across industries, including the medical, education, legal, insurance, technology and manufacturing sectors, CISA said.",

      "\u201cThe Department of Education (ED) appears to be abandoning the millions of parents, students, and borrowers who rely on a functioning federal student aid system to lower education costs,\u201d Warren and a group of Democratic senators wrote in a letter to McMahon.",

      "The Education Department intended to remove the \u201cSubmit a Complaint\u201d button from FSA\u2019s website, according to the letter. It found a senior employee at the department called the move an \u201coverall win\u201d as the change would decrease the volume and number of complaints.

      "The letter alleges the FSA website changes -- like moving the submit a complaint function -- weakens FSA\u2019s capacity to resolve complaints and puts borrowers at risk of loan scams. Warren, D-Mass., and the senators demand answers about the agency\u2019s complaint backlog, why the department fired the civil servants, and how much influence Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency had on the firings.",

After a federal judge ordered that former probationary employees be reinstated, dozens were rehired.

FSA civil servants are tasked with helping the nation's students achieve higher education, including overseeing a $1.6 trillion portfolio of student loans.",

      "STARKE, Fla. -- A Florida man who killed an 8-year-old girl and her grandmother on a night in which he drank heavily and used drugs is set to be executed Thursday.",
      "Edward James, 63, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection starting at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison outside Starke under a death warrant signed in February by Gov. Ron DeSantis. Barring a last-minute reprieve, the execution is to be the second this year in Florida, which is planning a third in April.",
      "Three other executions were scheduled this week around the United States: Louisiana put a man to death Tuesday using nitrogen gas for the first time as it resumed executions after a 15-year hiatus. Arizona on Wednesday lethally injected a man who had kidnapped and murdered his girlfriend\u2019s ex-husband. Another lethal injection is planned Thursday in Oklahoma.",
      "James drew the death penalty for the Sept. 19, 1993, killings of 8-year-old Toni Neuner and Betty Dick, 58, the child's grandmother. James had been renting a room in Dick's house in Casselberry. where Toni Neuner and three other children were also staying that night.",
      "Court records show James drank up to 24 beers at a party, downed some gin and also took LSD before returning to his room at Dick's house. The girl was raped and strangled to death. The other children were not harmed.",
      "James, who pleaded guilty to the charges, was also found guilty of the rape and of stealing Dick's jewelry and car after stabbing her 21 times. Court documents show James drove the car across the country, occasionally selling pieces of jewelry until he was arrested on Oct. 6 of that year in Bakersfield, California.",
      "Police obtained a videotaped confession from James, who despite his guilty pleas was sentenced to death upon an 11-1 recommendation by a jury.",
      "James' lawyers filed several appeals with state and federal courts, all of which were denied. Most recently, the Florida Supreme Court rejected an argument that James' longtime use of drugs and alcohol, several head injuries and a heart attack in 2023 led to mental decline that would make his execution cruel and unusual punishment.",
      "The justices, however, agreed with a lower court decision that \"James\u2019s cognitive issues do not shield him from execution.\u201d The court also rejected an argument from James' lawyers that the heart attack he suffered in prison led to deprivation of oxygen that affected his brain and should be considered new evidence to halt the execution.",
      "Even if it is new evidence, the court determined, the \"defendant cannot establish that such evidence would likely yield a less severe sentence at a new penalty phase.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center said Florida uses a three-drug cocktail for its lethal injection: a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart.",
      "Earlier this year, James Ford was executed for the 1997 killings of a couple in Charlotte County \u2014 witnessed by their toddler daughter, who survived. DeSantis also signed a death warrant for the April 8 execution of Michael Tanzi for the 2000 slaying of a woman in the Florida Keys.",

      "Pete Marocco, the Trump administration official tasked with dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, told State Department staff on Tuesday night that he is stepping away from his role at USAID and returning to his previous role at the State Department, according to an email obtained by ABC News.",
      "\"It's been my honor to assist Secretary Rubio in his leadership of USAID through some difficult stages to pivot this enterprise away from its abuses of the past,\" Marocco said in the email. \"Now that USAID is under control, accountable and stable, I am going to return to my post as the Director of Foreign Assistance to bring value back to the American people.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio named Marocco USAID deputy administrator in early February, and Marocco -- along with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency -- led the widespread effort to dismantle the agency by laying off thousands of employees, revoking funding for more than 80% of its programs, and shedding its Washington, D.C., headquarters.",
      "Marocco said in his email that he is leaving now that \"USAID is under control, accountable, and stable\" -- however many of the administration's moves are currently being challenged or stalled in the courts, with a judge on Tuesday ruling that the dismantling of USAID was unconstitutional.",
      "A State Department official confirmed that Marocco would return to his role as the agency's Director of Foreign Assistance, and that two political appointees would assume the responsibilities of the deputy administrator.",
      "Those two individuals are Jeremy Lewin, who will serve as USAID COO and Deputy Administrator for Policy and Programs, and Ken Jackson, who will be USAID CFO and Deputy Administrator for Management and Resources, according to Marocco's email.",
      "Lewin, 28, has been working with DOGE at the State Department, helping in the effort to dismantle USAID, sources told ABC News. He graduated in 2022 from Harvard Law School, where he co-authored multiple op-eds with renowned liberal constitutional law expert Laurence Tribe.",

    "story": [
      "The American Federation of Teachers represents 1.8 million educators.",
      "One of America's largest unions is taking aim at President Donald Trump's administration\u00a0for\u00a0shutting down access to affordable student loan repayment plans -- saying the decision is \"effectively breaking\" the system.",
      "The American Federation of Teachers (AFT), representing 1.8 million educators across the country, filed a lawsuit against the Department of Education in Washington, D.C., hoping to restore the programs that have now been shuttered for three weeks.",
      "The filing alleges the administration halting the application process for all Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans and ordering student loan servicers to stop all processing violates federal law.",
      "\"AFT sued the United States Department of Education (ED) for effectively breaking the student loan system, denying borrowers' access to affordable loan payments and blocking progress towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), in violation of federal law,\" the union said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Federal Income-Driven Repayment plans were first created by Congress in the 1990s to make student borrowers' loan bills more affordable and cap the length of time students would be on the hook for paying back debt.",
      "As of this year, there were four IDR plans offered by the Department of Education: the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan, the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Repayment Plan, the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan and the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) Plan.",
      "All of the plans are based on the borrower's income, with student loan forgiveness of any remaining debt after a fixed repayment term of 20 or 25 years.",
      "There are over 12 million student loan borrowers enrolled in IDR plans and more than 1 million borrowers were waiting for their applications to be processed when the Dept. of Education shuttered the system three weeks ago, according to the union.",
      "On its website, the Education Department cites a federal court-issued injunction on the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan, which was introduced under former President Joe Biden's administration, as the reason for the pause on all IDR plans.\u00a0The agency also says students can submit paper applications to programs.",
      "The teachers' union, however, says the Education Department's decision to interpret the 8th Circuit's decision on Feb. 18 \"in such a maximalist way\" has \"wreaked havoc\" on the system. The union claims in its filing that paper applications are not currently being processed as well.",
      "\"Student loan borrowers are desperate for help, struggling to keep up with spiking monthly payments in a sinking economy, all while President Trump plays politics with the student loan system,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "\"Borrowers have a legal right to payments they can afford and today we are demanding that these rights are enforced by a federal judge,\" Pierce added.",
      "The union said in its filing that the department has not provided any guidance to borrowers about when their applications will be restored and when they can expect to see their payments lowered.",
      "In a statement to ABC News on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Dept. of Education said the federal agency \"is working to ensure these programs conform with the 8th Circuit's ruling, and anticipates the revised form allowing borrowers to change repayment plans to be available as soon as next week.\"",
      "In a\u00a0letter\u00a0earlier this month to the agency, 25 U.S. senators similarly called for clarity, noting that the federal court's ruling focused on a single IDR plan, not the remaining three.",
      "\"While the Department was tasked with implementing a judicial ruling to suspend a single IDR plan... the Department inexplicably and confusingly chose to also suspend access to every other IDR plan,\" the senators wrote in the letter.",
      "\"Borrowers have relied on many of these plans for decades and this sudden and reckless action means millions of borrowers have fewer repayment options available and are unsure of what to do in order to manage their debt,\" the senators wrote.",
      "Student loan debt remains massive in the United States and reliance on federal support for payments is a reality for millions of borrowers.",
      "According to AFT's filing, there are nearly 43 million federal student loan borrowers in the U.S., with approximately $1.62 trillion outstanding in debt.",

    "summary": "President Trump is lashing out again against the top federal judge who issued an order stopping deportation flights of alleged gang members under the Alien Enemies Act.",
    "story": [
      "\"Our Country is in very big trouble, and destined to fail!\" Trump said.",
      "A day after a federal judge ordered the Justice Department to provide details about two deportation flights to El Salvador over the weekend, the Trump administration is escalating its legal battle against him.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg on Saturday blocked the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens under the Alien Enemies Act and ordered that they turn around two flights the administration said were deporting migrant gang members to El Salvador.",
      "After officials failed to turn the flights around, Judge Boasberg demanded that they provide more information about the flights, under seal, but DOJ attorneys refused, citing national security concerns.",
      "According to a court filing Wednesday morning, DOJ attorneys say they are considering invoking the state secrets privilege to deny the judge that information.",
      "Despite signaling a willingness, in a filing Tuesday, to provide the information if it's shielded from public view, the administration said Wednesday they should not be forced to provide the information privately,",
      "\"The underlying premise of these orders, including the most recent one requiring the production of these facts ex parte today at noon, is that the Judicial Branch is superior to the Executive Branch, particularly on non-legal matters involving foreign affairs and national security,\" they wrote. \"The Government disagrees. The two branches are coequal, and the Court's continued intrusions into the prerogatives of the Executive Branch, especially on a non-legal and factually irrelevant matter, should end.\"",
      "In his response, Judge Boasberg gave the government a one-day extension -- until noon Thursday -- to either provide the information he requested or invoke the state secrets doctrine and provide an explanation as to why they are invoking it.",
      "Later Wednesday, the Trump administration asked a federal appeals court for a green light for the president to unilaterally deport noncitizens under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "DOJ lawyers, in their court filing, argued that Boasberg's ruling blocking the deportation of noncitizens under the AEA overstepped his authority as a judge and was an \"extraordinary intrusion upon the President's constitutional and statutory authority to protect the Nation from alien enemies.\"",
      "\"Merits aside, the equities strongly favor the government, given the manfiest harms to the public from letting dangerous alien members of a foreign terrorist organization remain in the country,\" the filing said, though an ICE official has acknowledged that many of the men lack criminal records in the United States and were deported on the belief they might be gang members.",
      "The DOJ argued that Judge Boasberg lacks the authority to review deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, and that there is \"no basis for a court to look behind [the] factual determinations\" that the men deported were members of Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua. They also argued that the court's order intrudes on President Donald Trump's ability to conduct the United States' foreign policy.",
      "A panel of three judges on the D.C. Circuit Court, including two judges nominated by Republican presidents, will hear thirty minutes of oral argument from each side on Monday afternoon.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, lashed out again at Boasberg Wednesday morning in a post on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\"If a President doesn't have the right to throw murderers, and other criminals, out of our Country because a Radical Left Lunatic Judge wants to assume the role of President, then our Country is in very big trouble, and destined to fail!\" Trump wrote.",
      "The escalation comes after Trump called for Boasberg's impeachment.",
      "\"Many people have called for his impeachment, the impeachment of this judge. I don't know who the judge is, but he's radical left,\" Trump told Fox News' Laura Ingraham in a Fox News interview on Tuesday.",
      "\"He was Obama-appointed, and he actually said we shouldn't be able to take criminals, killers, murderers, horrible, the worst people, gang members, gang leaders, that we shouldn't be allowed to take them out of our country,\" Trump said. \"That's not for a local judge to be making that determination.\"",
      "In the wake of Trump's call for impeachment, Chief Justice Roberts issued an unusual statement of rebuke.",
      "\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" Roberts said in the statement. \"The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"",
      "Congress can impeach a judge if a simple majority is reached in the House. If the articles were taken up and ultimately clear the House, the Senate would need to hold a trial. It would require a two-thirds majority vote in the upper chamber to convict a judge.",
      "It's rare, but not unprecedented, for members of Congress to file articles of impeachment against a judge.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, brushed off Roberts' criticism, saying, \"He didn't mention my name in the statement. I just saw it quickly. He didn't mention my name.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"I'm very offended by how DOGE has operated,\" District Judge Beryl Howell said.",
      "A federal judge denied Wednesday an emergency effort by ousted officials at the United States Institute of Peace to have them immediately reinstated to their positions but assailed the Trump administration over what she described as \"abominable\" treatment to \"strong-arm\" them out of their office this week using armed agents acting on behalf of the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\"I'm very offended by how DOGE has operated at the Institute and treated American citizens trying to do a job that they were statutorily tasked to do at the Institute,\" District Judge Beryl Howell said. \"But that concern ... Is not one that I have that can sway me in my consideration of the factors for a TRO.\"",
      "Howell questioned counsel for USIP Andrew Goldfarb over the extraordinary series of events that led to DOGE agents -- with assistance from armed agents from the FBI, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, as well as attorneys from the D.C. U.S. Attorney's office, removing leadership from the office on Monday.",
      "According to Goldfarb and sworn testimony from the ousted USIP leaders and the building's chief security officer, the institute received information as early as March 8 that DOGE staff was undertaking \"reconnaissance efforts\" to evaluate USIP's security operations.",
      "Last Friday, when members of the USIP board of directors received emails that they'd been terminated from their positions, DOGE staff members arrived at the headquarters where they were denied entry by USIP's security staff. Later in the day, the DOGE staffers returned with FBI agents accompanying them and were again denied entry, court records say.",
      "On Saturday, the top security officer for the institute then reported he was visited by two FBI agents at his home who questioned him over how to gain entrance to the building -- even though he was on medical leave and was caught off guard by their visit.",
      "The agents then contacted another security officer and told him he was the subject of investigation by DOJ over his refusal to grant DOGE's agents access to USIP, after which he made the recommendation the institute terminate its relationship with the contractor that oversees the building's security operations after expressing concern that DOGE would turn the contractor against the existing staff.",
      "The events led to a standoff at USIP's headquarters on Monday, where ousted leaders again initially denied entry to representatives of DOGE and the security contractor -- at one point ordering a full lockdown of the building \"for safety purposes.\"",
      "D.C. police ultimately arrived and escorted the members out of the building while granting access to DOGE's representatives.",
      "\"I mean, this conduct of using law enforcement, threatening criminal investigation, using armed law enforcement from three different agencies ... to carry out the executive order... with all that targeting probably terrorizing employees and staff at the institute when there are so many other lawful ways to accomplish the goals [of the executive order]... Why?\" Howell asked. \"Why those ways here -- just because DOGE is in a rush?\"",
      "Brian Hudak, an attorney for the government, defended the actions of the government, arguing that Trump's replacement as the acting USIP president, Kenneth Jackson, was the lawfully appointed head of the institute and those removed should not have been prevented his access to the building.",
      "\"The way that it's been portrayed in the papers from the plaintiffs and perhaps elsewhere that this was an assault or storming of the building \u2014 it is Mr. Jackson, who is president of the organization seeking access to his organization's building,\" Hudak said.",
      "\"Are you at least offended by how this was executed?\" Howell pressed. \"Because I have to say I'm offended on behalf of American citizens who've done so much -- as I've just said that, Mr. Moose himself, so much service to this country, to be treated so abominably, let alone the directors on the board.\"",
      "\"I will put it this way, to strong-arm a private contractor, to threaten this security chief -- threaten people with criminal investigation given the, you know, clear statute ... Doesn't that strike you as a little offensive?\" she asked.",
      "Hudak responded by presenting a hypothetical of if he were removed from his job by Trump and \"decided to barricade myself into my office,\" he said. \"That's basically what happened on Friday, as I understand it.\"",
      "Hudak further argued that even if Trump didn't explicitly follow the statute that established USIP when moving to fire its acting president and board members, he was still justified in doing so under his Article II removal powers.",
      "Howell, however, said the government was falling well short of showing that George Moose, the acting president of USIP fired by Trump, as well as other ousted board directors, were fired lawfully.",
      "Hanging over Wednesday's proceedings was the unusual legal position of USIP in comparison with other federal agencies. The institute is technically an independent nonprofit corporation established by Congress and designed to have a bipartisan board of directors which vote to appoint its president.",
      "Howell noted that judges in D.C.'s District Court and in other jurisdictions around the country have had to wrestle with a lack of clarity in legal precedent over the president's firing authorities that ultimately will have to be decided by the Supreme Court.",
      "Further complicating the case by USIP's board members, was that the acting head fired by Trump, Robert Moose, wasn't technically added as a plaintiff to the lawsuit.",
      "Howell said that she was unsure how she could restore him as USIP's president if he wasn't joining with other board members to specifically request it.",
      "Howell also expressed concern over if she enjoined the government from essentially \"trespassing\" on the USIP premises, if that would risk inviting an \"armed battle\" if it refused -- given its previous willingness to bring armed agents to escort fired officials from the facility.",

      "\"Republicans are refusing to meet with their constituents after voting to take away health care and make it harder for families to put food on the table,\" DNC Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement. \"This isn't surprising -- over the last few months, one word has come to describe Republicans: cowards.\"",
      "The billboards are going up in Republican-held districts in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska and Pennsylvania. Each billboard calls the member of Congress a \"coward\" and provides the phone number for the member's Washington, D.C., office to \"demand a town hall.\"",
      "Democrats have claimed in recent weeks that Republican members are not holding town halls because they want to avoid their constituents' anger over President Donald Trump's policies and cuts to the federal government. Both the national party and individual elected officials have also begun holding town halls in Republican-held districts.",
      "\"We are hosting events in Republican-held districts and we are pasting Republican representatives' phone numbers on billboards across their districts because working families deserve to be heard,\" Martin wrote.",
      "In a statement to ABC News responding to the billboard campaign, Republican National Committee Communications Director Zach Parkinson wrote, \"The Democrat Party's approval rating just hit a record low after getting trounced in November, and the DNC's new messaging strategy is to buy some billboards. We fully encourage liberal donors to keep funding these innovative approaches at the DNC.\"",
      "Earlier this month, House Republicans were encouraged by the National Republican Congressional Committee to do more virtual events over in-person town halls, which allows for more control, although some Republican members have continued to host or appear at in-person town halls despite the pushback.",
      "On Tuesday, Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., held a 90-minute town hall, though he faced numerous interruptions from audience members.",
      "\"Ultimately, I am accountable to you,\" Flood told constituents on Tuesday. \"You will decide whether I do this job. The people of the 1st District will decide whether I do this job. I will continue to do town halls. I will continue to show up in person.\"",

Only minutes in, a cacophony of jeers, boos and angry demands for answers revealed most were there to voice their displeasure with the congressman.",

He had picked Columbus, Nebraska, for his first in-person town hall this year, hometown of Republican Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and the seat of a county that voted nearly 3-to-1 for Trump in November.",
      "Flood was the latest Republican member of Congress to face backlash at home over actions by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to slash government spending. Those actions have sparked fear among the public that popular programs like Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security services and benefits could be cut.",
      "\u201cMy main concern is that I believe what Trump and Musk are doing are way beyond the boundaries of how things should be done in a democracy,\u201d Pat Lostroh said as she stood in line to get into the event. She traveled from David City, more than 30 miles (53 kilometers) away, to attend.",

He has called Social Security \u201cthe biggest Ponzi scheme of all time\" and hinted that it could be a primary target in his effort to downsize the federal government.",

    "summary": "The Pentagon aims to cut 50,000 to 60,000 civilians -- and 21,000 voluntary resignations have been accepted so far.",
    "story": [
      "About 21,000 voluntary resignations have been accepted so far.",
      "The Pentagon is attempting to reduce the size of its civilian workforce by between 50,000 to 60,000 employees through voluntary workforce reductions, though it remains unclear if it will be able to meet that goal without possibly having to carry out forced reductions in the civilian workforce.",
      "The Defense Department is currently carrying out a voluntary process to reach its goal of a 5% to 8% reduction of its 878,000 civilian employees -- a number that equates to 50,000 to 60,000 employees, a senior defense official told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "\"The number sounds high, but I would focus on the percentage, a 5% to 8% reduction is not a drastic one,\" said the official, who added that the percentage is one that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \"is confident can be done without negatively impacting readiness in order to make sure that our resources are allocated in the right direction.\"",
      "The voluntary process includes employees who have chosen to resign through what is known as the \"Fork in the Road,\" a freeze on hiring new employees to replace those who are departing and the dismissal of 5,400 probationary employees who have less than one or two years' experience in their current jobs.",
      "About 21,000 civilian employees have had their voluntary resignation requests approved under what the Pentagon calls the Deferred Resignation Program (DRP), which allows employees to resign but continue to be paid through the end of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.",
      "The senior defense official declined to disclose how many civilian employees in total had sought to opt into the Deferred Resignation Program.",
      "ABC News has previously reported that 31,000 civilian employees had offered to resign under the Trump administration initiative with some of the requests being denied.",
      "The hiring freeze means that the average 6,000 employees who join the Pentagon every month are also not coming into the workforce as other employees leave.",
      "The Defense Department had also begun the termination of 5,400 probationary civilian employees -- which has now been paused by a temporary restraining order imposed by a federal judge.",
      "The official stressed that the 5,400 probationary employees had not been selected for termination \"blindly based on the time they had been hired.\" The Department has 54,000 total probationary employees, a term that refers to employees who have less than one or two years' experience in their current jobs.",
      "Instead, the official said the 5,400 were employees who \"were documented as significantly underperforming in their job functions and or had misconduct on the record.\" It is unclear if all of the 5,400 probationary employees targeted for termination fell into those categories.",
      "\"The fact that someone was a probationary employee did not directly mean that they were going to be subject to removal,\" said the official.",
      "The official declined to offer what \"reduction in force\" steps the Pentagon might undertake should the voluntary efforts not reach the goal of reducing the workforce by 50,000 to 60,000 employees.",
      "\"I won't get ahead of the Secretary,\" the official said. \"It'll be the Secretary's prerogative to designate how and when he might use any of the other tools that would be available to him to achieve the stated reduction targets.\"",
      "There has been speculation that military service members may be asked to fill in for some of the civilian jobs that are being vacated or will not be filled by the hiring freeze, but the official said the goal is not to affect military readiness.",
      "\"We are confident we could absorb those removals without detriment to our ability to continue the mission, and so that's how we can be confident that we don't need to worry about any resulting impact on the uniformed force,\" the official said.",
      "The official acknowledged that some military veterans would be among the civilians who would be leaving the department, but did not provide an estimate of how many.",
      "\"Some of those people will be veterans that served in uniform previously, we're certainly again looking at case by case as we plan workforce reduction,\" said the official. \"There are so many critical skills and experience that veterans have to offer, and that's part of the analysis when we consider who is contributing to the core mission functions and who should be retained.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s own words keep getting used against him in court while he faces lawsuits against his aggressive agenda",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s shoot-from-the-lip style kept Americans on the edge of their seats during last year's campaign. But now that he's speaking as a president and not as a candidate, his words are being used against him in court in the blizzard of litigation challenging his agenda.",
      "The spontaneity is complicating his administration's legal positions. Nowhere has this been clearer than in cases involving Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, the driving force in Trump's efforts to downsize and overhaul the federal government.",
      "The latest example came earlier this week, when U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled that Musk had likely violated the Constitution by dismantling the United States Agency for International Development.",
      "The lawsuit turned on the question of whether the billionaire entrepreneur had overstepped his authority. Justice Department lawyers and White House officials insist that Musk is merely a presidential adviser, not the actual leader of DOGE.",
      "But Trump has said otherwise \u2014 in speeches, interviews and public remarks \u2014 and Chuang quoted him extensively in his decision.",
      "Trump most notably boasted of creating DOGE during his primetime address to a joint session of Congress and said it was \u201cheaded by Elon Musk.\" Republicans gave Musk a standing ovation, who saluted from the gallery above the House chamber.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s words were essential, central and indispensable,\u201d said Norm Eisen, one of the lawyers for USAID employees who filed the lawsuit. \u201cHis admissions took what would have been a tough case and made it into a straightforward one.\u201d",
      "The looseness with words is a shift from predecessors like President Barack Obama, who used to say that he was careful because anything he said could send troops marching or markets tumbling.",
      "Trump has no such feeling of restraint, and neither do other members of his administration like Musk.",
      "Chuang, who is based in Maryland and was appointed by Obama, also cited social media posts from Musk, who writes frequently on X, the platform that he owns.",
      "For example, Musk posted \u201cwe spent the weekend feeding USAID to the woodchipper\u201d on Feb. 3. The agency was being brought to a standstill at that time, with staff furloughed, spending halted and headquarters shut down.",
      "\"Musk\u2019s public statements and posts ... suggest that he has the ability to cause DOGE to act,\" Chuang wrote in his ruling.",
      "Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House, said Trump was fulfilling his campaign promise \u201cto make the federal government more efficient and accountable to taxpayers.\u201d",
      "\u201cRogue bureaucrats and activist judges attempting to undermine this effort are only subverting the will of the American people and their obstructionist efforts will fail,\u201d he said.",
      "Anthony Coley, who led public affairs at the Justice Department during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, said statements involving civil litigation were always coordinated between his office and the West Wing.",
      "\u201cThe words could be used to support what we\u2019re doing or undermine what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a carefully choreographed effort to make sure there was no daylight between what was said in the court of public opinion and what could ultimately play out in the court of law.\u201d",
      "In comparison to how things were done in the past, Coley said, Trump has a \u201cready-fire-aim approach of doing business.\u201d",
      "Trump doesn't usually let legal disputes force him to turn down the volume. During a criminal investigation over his decision to keep classified records at Mar-a-Lago after leaving the White House following his first term, Trump spoke extensively about the case in an interview with Fox News.",
      "Longtime defense lawyers were startled \u2014 defendants are usually encouraged to keep mum while facing an indictment. But the situation panned out for Trump. His legal team delayed the case, and the special counsel's office dropped the charges after he won the election because presidents can't be prosecuted while in office.",
      "DOGE has been the focus of nearly two dozen lawsuits. It's often prevailed so far in cases involving access to government data, where several plaintiffs have struggled to convince judges to block the organization's actions.",
      "But it's also run into challenges, such as a lawsuit over whether DOGE must comply with public records requests. The Trump administration asserted in court that DOGE is part of the White House, meaning it's exempt.",
      "Judge Christopher Cooper, also appointed by Obama, disagreed, siding with a government watchdog group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW.",
      "\u201cMusk and the President\u2019s public statements indicate that USDS\" \u2014 the original acronym for the organization that was renamed as DOGE \u2014 \"is in fact exercising substantial independent authority,\u201d wrote Cooper, who is based in Washington.",
      "Cooper concluded that DOGE can \"identify and terminate federal employees, federal programs, and federal contracts. Doing any of those three things would appear to require substantial independent authority; to do all three surely does.\u201d",
      "He ordered DOGE to start responding to requests about the team\u2019s role in mass firings and disruptions to federal programs. The administration unsuccessfully asked the judge to reconsider, saying the judge \u201cfundamentally misapprehended\u201d the agency's structure.",
      "Just because Musk claims credit online for deep agency cuts, doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to DOGE having authority in the eyes of the law, Stanford Law School professor Michael McConnell argued in a recent debate on the issue.",
      "DOGE is recommending changes, he said, but it\u2019s the agency heads who are actually putting them into effect.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s all that the courts are going to care about as to what the Supreme Court is going to do,\u201d McConnell said at the debate hosted by the National Constitution Center.",

      "Last year was the hottest year on record, the top 10 hottest years were all in the past decade and planet-heating carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at an 800,000-year high, a report Wednesday said.",
      "In its annual State of the Climate report, the World Meteorological Organization laid bare all the markings of an increasingly warming world with oceans at record high temperatures, sea levels rising and glaciers retreating at record speed.",
      "\u201cOur planet is issuing more distress signals,\" said Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General. He noted that the report says the international goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.8 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times is still possible. \"Leaders must step up to make it happen \u2014 seizing the benefits of cheap, clean renewables for their people and economies,\u201d he said.",
      "The report attributed the heating to human activity \u2014 like the burning of coal, oil and gas \u2014 and in a smaller part to the naturally occurring El Nino weather phenomenon. An El Nino formed in June 2023 and dissipated a year later, adding extra heat and helping topple temperature records. In 2024, the world surpassed the 1.5 C limit for the first time \u2014 but just for a single year. Scientists measure breaching the climate goal as Earth staying above that level of warming over a longer time period.",
      "The report said global heating is contributing to more extreme weather events that have led the highest levels of displacement for 16 years, contributed to worsening food crises and caused massive economic losses. There were at least 151 \u201cunprecedented\u201d extreme weather events in 2024 alone, it said.",
      "\u201cIt is a wake-up call that we are increasing the risks to our lives, economies and to the planet,\u201d said Celeste Saulo, WMO's Secretary-General.",
      "The report's warnings come as the United States President Donald Trump has issued a series of rollbacks on climate commitments and cast doubt on climate science. The U.S. is the world\u2019s second biggest polluter currently and the largest emitter of greenhouse gases historically. It's left some worried that other countries will also have less ambitious targets as a result.",
      "\u201cThe science is indisputable. Attempts to hide climate science from the public will not stop us from feeling the dire impacts of climate change,\" said Brenda Ekwurzel of the U.S.-based not-for-profit, Union of Concerned Scientists.",

      "NEW YORK -- A Columbia University student activist who was detained by the U.S. government over his participation in pro-Palestinian demonstrations has the right to challenge the legality of his detention, but the case should be heard in New Jersey, rather than in New York or Louisiana, a judge ruled Wednesday.",
      "Mahmoud Khalil, a legal U.S. resident with no criminal record, was detained by federal immigration agents on March 8. From there, he was taken to an immigration detention center in New Jersey, where he spent the night. Then he was taken back to New York, put on a plane and flown to an immigration facility in Jenna, Louisiana.",
      "\u201cThese are serious allegations and arguments that, no doubt, warrant careful review by a court of law; the fundamental constitutional principle that all persons in the United States are entitled to due process of law demands no less,\u201d wrote U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman.",
      "This review should happen in federal court in New Jersey, rather than in the New York court where his legal team initially brought the case, or in Louisiana, where Khalil is now detained, because New Jersey is state where Khalid was being held at the time his lawyers first went to court, Furman wrote.",
      "The federal government said it had to move Khalid to Louisiana because of a lack of available detention center beds in the metropolitan New York region. It also cited a bedbug infestation at the closer lockup in Elizabeth, New Jersey.",
      "Attorneys for Khalil have disputed these justifications in a series of court filings since his arrest. They describe the transfer as a \u201cretaliatory\u201d action meant to deprive their client of access to counsel while ensuring the case is held in a jurisdiction that may be more favorable to the Republican administration\u2019s unusual legal claim.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cited as grounds for Khalil\u2019s deportation a rarely-used statute giving him sweeping power to deport those who pose \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d",
      "While the White House has accused Khalil of \u201csiding with terrorists,\u201d they have yet to give any evidence for the claim. Still, President Trump has described Khalil\u2019s case as the \u201cfirst of many to come.\u201d",
      "Khalil, a 30-year-old international affairs graduate student, had served as a negotiator and spokesperson for student activists at Columbia University who took over a campus lawn last spring in protest of the war in Gaza.",
      "Images of his maskless face at protests, along with his willingness to share his name with reporters, had made him a target among people who saw antisemitism in the demonstrations. In the weeks leading up to his arrest, Khalil repeatedly appealed to Columbia University\u2019s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, for protection, citing threats from right-wing doxing groups.",

      "BOSTON -- A Massachusetts woman accused of operating a high-end brothel network with wealthy and prominent clients in that state and the Washington, D.C., suburbs is set to be sentenced Wednesday.",
      "Han Lee and two others were indicted last year on one count of conspiracy to persuade, entice, and coerce one or more individuals to travel in interstate or foreign commerce to engage in prostitution and one count of money laundering, according to prosecutors. The operation, according to court documents, generated millions of dollars a year, and customers paid hundreds of dollars an hour for services.",
      "Junmyung Lee of Dedham, Massachusetts, pleaded guilty in October and is set to be sentenced next month. James Lee of Torrance, California, accused of renting the apartments in the operation, pleaded guilty last month to his involvement in the scheme as well as fraudulently obtaining nearly $600,000 in pandemic relief funds. He is set to be sentenced next month.",
      "Prosecutors are demanding that Han Lee, who pleaded guilty in September, be sentenced to six years imprisonment and three years of supervised released for running \u201cone of the most successful prostitution networks\u201d on the East Coast. They estimate that nearly 10,000 commercial sex dates occurred in her brothels, according to court records, and that she \u201ccontrolled the day-to-day operations.\u201d",
      "\u201cHan profited immensely off women selling their bodies for sex and she concealed multimillions of dollars of illicit proceeds earned from her business,\u201d Assistant United States Attorney Lindsey Weinstein wrote. \u201cHan enticed and recruited women to travel to Massachusetts or Virginia from other states, and on thousands of occasions, directed women to have sex with strangers for money. She made a staggering total amount of money \u2013 at least $5.46 million dollars over more than four years \u2013 and used sophisticated means to hide that money from law enforcement.\u201d",
      "But Lee's federal public defender, Scott Lauer, plead for leniency, saying in court documents that Lee grew up poor in South Korea and had a father who drank heavily and was abusive. After arriving in the United States, she became a sex worker in California, Las Vegas and New York before settling in Massachusetts and continuing to work in the trade.",
      "After a brothel was raided, Han Lee saw the opportunity to set up the network. The defense contends none of the sex workers in this operation were forced to do the job and that they kept a majority of the revenues.",
      "\u201cWhile cases involving prostitution often involve some degree of force or coercion exerted against the women involved, this case does not,\u201d Lauer wrote. \u201cThere is a world of difference between Ms. Lee \u2014 a sex worker herself \u2014 and a pimp (or madam) who enriches themselves at the expense of those performing the work. The commercial sex workers in this case were well treated and well compensated.\u201d",
      "Authorities said the commercial sex ring in Massachusetts and northern Virginia catered to politicians, company executives, military officers, lawyers, professors and other well-connected clients.",
      "Nearly 30 of the buyers are appearing court this month in Cambridge, after the state's highest court ruled last year that the hearings should be public. The first group of buyers appeared in court last week, and a second group is set to appear Friday.",
      "The women who worked in the brothels were not identified or criminally charged and were considered victims, prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors said their evidence included witness testimony from women who worked at the brothels, sex buyers who made appointments or received services, physical surveillance and electronic evidence.",
      "Han Lee maintained the operation from 2020 to November 2023. The money made at the brothels was sometimes kept in the freezer to be picked up, prosecutors said. They said she also helped train Junmyung Lee to help vet sex buyers.",
      "The brothel operation used websites that falsely claimed to advertise nude models for professional photography, prosecutors allege. The operators rented high-end apartments to use as brothels in Watertown and Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Tysons and Fairfax, Virginia, prosecutors said. Brothels were maintained at four locations in Massachusetts and two in Virginia.",
      "According to court documents, the defendants established house rules for the women during their stays in a given city to protect and maintain the secrecy of the business and ensure the women did not draw attention to the prostitution work inside apartment buildings.",
      "Each website described a verification process that interested sex buyers undertook to be eligible for appointment bookings, including requiring clients to complete a form providing their full names, email addresses, phone numbers, employers and references if they had one, authorities said.",

      "Aimee Bock \u2014 the founder of Feeding our Future, the group that prosecutors say was at the heart of the plot \u2014 was one of 70 defendants charged in the overall case, said to be one of the country's largest frauds against COVID-19 relief programs.",
      "The Minnesota case has also drawn attention for an attempt to bribe a juror in an earlier trial and witness tampering in Bock's trial, which began last month. Thirty-seven defendants have already pleaded guilty, while five were convicted in a group of defendants who were tried last year.",
      "The jury also convicted a co-defendant, Salim Ahmed Said, the owner of the now-defunct Safari Restaurant in Minneapolis.",
      "Bock and Said were charged with multiple counts involving conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery. Said was also charged with money laundering. Bock allegedly pocketed nearly $2 million, while Said was accused of taking around $5 million. They both maintained their innocence and testified at trial.",
      "In closing arguments, prosecutors said the evidence showed that Bock and Said exploited the chaos of the early days of the the pandemic by submitting falsified paperwork to enrich themselves and failed to provide anywhere near as many meals to needy children as they claimed.",
      "Defense attorneys did not dispute that there was massive fraud but insisted that their clients were not responsible for it.",
      "Bock's attorney said she was deceived by dishonest people and tried to cut them off whenever she suspected fraud. Said's attorney blamed his client's business partner.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged that the conspiracy revolved around Feeding Our Future and another small nonprofit that were approved as sponsors of the Federal Child Nutrition Program before the pandemic.",
      "They dramatically grew as the pandemic took hold, and Feeding Our Future went from receiving and disbursing $3.4 million in federal funds in 2019 to nearly $200 million in 2021. Food sites it sponsored falsely claimed to be serving thousands of children daily, prosecutors allege.",
      "Besides fraudulently obtaining and disbursing more than $240 million in federal funds, prosecutors say, Bock and other Feeding Our Future employees solicited and received bribes and kickbacks from other participants connected with the scheme.",
      "The defendants are being tried in several groups. The first trial was marred by an alleged attempt by some defendants and people linked with them to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash. That juror went straight to police. That led to tighter security for Bock\u2019s trial and additional precautions ordered by U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel.",
      "Despite all that, an allegation of witness tampering surfaced midway through the proceedings. A defendant scheduled for trial in August approached a government witness who was due to testify against Bock and Said and asked to speak with him in a courthouse bathroom. That witness declined and instead told his lawyer, who informed prosecutors.",
      "That defendant, Abdinasir Abshir, 32, of Lakeville, soon agreed to plead guilty to a wire fraud charge and to have his tampering attempt factored into a longer sentencing recommendation, which isn\u2019t binding on the judge.",

He wants to spend $33.65 billion in the year starting July 1 \u2014 about $2 billion more than planned for this fiscal year \u2014 then increase it by $700 million the following year.",
      "His plan for the nation's ninth-largest state also seeks big raises for public schoolteachers, more money for child care and affordable housing, and tax breaks for lower- and middle-income households.",
      "\u201cMy budget ensures that we will be able to continue investing in our people, meeting their needs, and keeping North Carolina strong,\u201d Stein told reporters.",
      "Stein said his budget is balanced, even as a forecast from his budget office and the General Assembly shows year-over-year operating revenues would drop by $825 million in the 2026-27 fiscal year.",
      "How does he do it? In part by asking lawmakers to halt already enacted laws by Republicans that next January would reduce the current individual income tax rate of 4.25% and the corporate income tax rate of 2.25% even further.",
      "\u201cThe truth is that we are in for some self-inflicted fiscal pain,\u201d Stein said in asking to maintain the current rates. Otherwise, the individual income rate is also likely to fall even further in 2027 thanks to programmed \u201ctriggers\u201d in the law if the state surpasses certain annual tax collection totals.",
      "Stein\u2019s administration has warned that these triggers could mean the state falls billions of dollars short of revenue necessary to provide services in light of population growth and inflation.",
      "Democrats have complained that these rate cuts benefit the highest wage earners and corporations the most. In contrast, Stein does propose some targeted tax breaks for \u201cworking families,\u201d including a state version of the federal earned income tax credit.",
      "Republicans who will prepare and approve their own two-year budget in the coming months have downplayed forecast shortfalls, saying previous tax reductions have boosted the state\u2019s economy and fiscal picture.",
      "With tax reform a major hallmark of the Republican agenda since taking over the General Assembly in 2011, GOP lawmakers are unlikely to back away from changes.",
      "But they may have to pay more attention to Stein given the GOP is currently one seat short of a veto-proof majority in both chambers. That could give Stein more leverage compared to his predecessor Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's last two years in office.",
      "New GOP House Speaker Destin Hall opened the door to considering changes later Wednesday, telling reporters that inflation, which boosts numerical revenues, may have thrown \"off our numbers just a little bit.\u201d",
      "But \u201cwe\u2019re not going to raise taxes obviously,\u201d Hall said. Republican Senate leader Phil Berger's office said Stein's proposal raises taxes by preventing a lower tax rate.",
      "Stein also proposed average teacher pay raises of 10.7% over two years, with an emphasis on helping early-career instructors.",
      "Stein said it's part of a plan to raise North Carolina starting teacher pay from near the bottom in the Southeast to first in 2027.",
      "Essentially Stein's budget covers these increases by scaling back and ultimately phasing out taxpayer-funded scholarships for K-12 students to attend private schools. The General Assembly made the Opportunity Scholarship program universal in 2023 \u2014 meaning families of all incomes can now qualify.",
      "\u201cWe have to meet the needs of our public school students,\u201d Stein said.",
      "Hall said he certainly wants to raise teacher pay robustly, but called Stein's proposal to end the private school scholarships \u201ca nonstarter with us.\" Nearly 80,000 students are benefiting this school year from the aid.",
      "Stein's budget \u201crips educational freedom and parental choice from hardworking families,\u201d Berger spokesperson Lauren Horsch said.",
      "Stein's budget didn't include a package to address the historic flooding and damage caused by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina nearly six months ago. He said Wednesday he would issue another separate request in the coming weeks",
      "The General Assembly has already appropriated or made available over $1.1 billion for Helene recovery activities, according to Stein\u2019s office. And a bill going to Stein's desk this week locates over $500 million more.",
      "Stein, who plans to sign the bill into law, said Wednesday that he'll also \u201ckeep pushing Congress for meaningful help.\u201d",
      "State officials have estimated the storm caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs.",

      "Newly released documents related to President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination in 1963 are giving curious readers more details Wednesday into Cold War-era covert U.S. operations in other nations but didn\u2019t initially lend credence to long-circulating con...",
      "DALLAS -- Newly released documents related to President John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963 gave curious readers more details Wednesday into Cold War-era covert U.S. operations in other nations but didn't initially lend credence to long-circulating conspiracy theories about who killed JFK.",
      "Assessments of the roughly 2,200 files posted by the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration on its website came with a huge caveat: No one had enough time as of Wednesday to review more than a small fraction of them. The vast majority of the National Archives\u2019 more than 6 million pages of records, photographs, motion pictures, sound recordings and artifacts related to the assassination have previously been released.",
      "An initial Associated Press review of more than 63,000 pages of records released this week shows that some were not directly related to the assassination but rather dealt with covert CIA operations, particularly in Cuba. And nothing in the first documents examined undercut the conclusion that Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.",
      "\u201cNothing points to a second gunman,\u201d said Philip Shenon, who wrote a 2013 book about the assassination. \u201cI haven't seen any big blockbusters that rewrite the essential history of the assassination, but it is very early.\"",
      "Kennedy was killed on a visit to Dallas, when his motorcade was finishing its parade route downtown and shots rang out from the Texas School Book Depository building. Police arrested the 24-year-old Oswald, a former Marine who had positioned himself from a sniper\u2019s perch on the sixth floor. Two days later Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner, fatally shot Oswald during a jail transfer broadcast live on television.",
      "A year after the assassination, the Warren Commission, established by President Lyndon B. Johnson to investigate, concluded that Oswald acted alone and there was no evidence of a conspiracy. But critics of the commission still spun a web of alternative theories.",
      "Historians are hoping for details fleshing out Oswald's activities before the assassination and what the CIA and FBI knew about him beforehand.",
      "Shenon pointed Wednesday to previously released documents about a trip Oswald made to Mexico City at the end of September 1963. Records show Oswald intended to contact the Soviet Union's embassy there after living as a U.S. defector in the U.S.S.R. from October 1959 until June 1962.",
      "Shenon said the U.S. government may have kept information about what it knew about Oswald before the assassination secret to hide what he described as officials' possible \u201cincompetence and laziness.\"",
      "\u201cThe CIA had Oswald under pretty aggressive surveillance while he was there and this was just several weeks before the assassination,\u201d Shenon said. \u201cThere\u2019s reason to believe he talked openly about killing Kennedy in Mexico City and that people overheard him say that.\u201d",
      "Speculation about such details surrounding Kennedy\u2019s assassination has been intense over the decades, generating countless conspiracy theories about multiple shooters and involvement by the Soviet Union, the mafia and the CIA. The new release fueled rampant online speculation and sent people scurrying to read the documents and share online what they might mean.",
      "The latest release of documents followed an order by President Donald Trump, though most of the records were made public previously with redactions. Before Tuesday, researchers had estimated that 3,000 to 3,500 files were still unreleased, either wholly or partially. Last month, the FBI said it had discovered about 2,400 new records related to the assassination.",
      "Jefferson Morley, vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a repository for files related to the assassination, said in a statement posted on the social platform X that much of the \u201crampant overclassification of trivial information has been eliminated\u201d from the documents.",
      "The timing of the release drew criticism from a Kennedy grandson, Jack Schlossberg. In a post on X, Schlossberg said the Trump administration did not notify family members before the records were made public.",
      "\u201ca total surprise, and not shocker !!\u201d Schlossberg wrote.",
      "Trump issued his executive order to release the files on Jan. 23.",
      "The latest release also is a boon to historians of the Cold War. Timothy Naftali, an adjunct professor at Columbia University who is writing a book about JFK's presidency, said scholars now appear to have more details about U.S. intelligence activities under Kennedy than under any other president.",
      "For example, in October 1975, U.S. senators were investigating what the CIA knew about Oswald, and an October 1975 memo said they considered the agency \"not forthcoming.\u201d",
      "A version of that memo released in 2023 redacted the name of the CIA's security contact on Oswald in Mexico, as well as the identity of someone behind the \u201cpenetration of the Cuban embassy\" there. The latest version shows that the security contact was the president of Mexico in 1975, Luis Echeverria Alvarez, who died in 2022, and that the Mexican government itself penetrated the Cuban embassy.",
      "Also, Naftali said, before the latest release, the government had made public copies of Johnson's presidential \u201cdaily checklist\u201d of highly sensitive foreign intelligence in the days after Kennedy's assassination, but with much of the material redacted. Now, he said, people can read what Johnson read.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite remarkable to be able to walk through that secret world,\u201d he said.",
      "Documents show that in December 1963, the CIA director's office was receiving messages from and replying to operatives in Cuba seeking to undermine the government under Fidel Castro. One, on Dec. 9, 1963, relayed a message to the director from Cuba: \u201cTODAY RECD THE MAGNUM PISTOLS BUT NO BULLETS.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re getting both a bird\u2019s-eye view of U.S. foreign policy, and you\u2019re also getting a snail\u2019s eye view of covert action, right there on the ground,\u201d Naftali said.",
      "In a previously released April 1975 memo, the CIA downplayed what it knew about Oswald's visit to Mexico City before the assassination. The memo said the CIA recorded three phone calls between Oswald and a guard at the Soviet embassy, but only in the last one did Oswald identify himself.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re now discovering how much more the CIA and the FBI knew before the assassination about Oswald,\u201d Shenon said. \u201cAnd the question is, why didn\u2019t they act on the information in their own files?\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court seems to be in no hurry to address an issue that has irritated Republican and Democratic administrations alike: the ability of a single judge to block a nationwide policy.",
      "Federal judges responding to a flurry of lawsuits have stopped or slowed one Trump administration action after another, from efforts to restrict birthright citizenship to freezes on domestic and international spending.",
      "While several justices have expressed concern about the use of so-called nationwide, or universal, injunctions, the high court has sidestepped multiple requests to do something about them.",
      "The latest plea comes in the form of an emergency appeal the Justice Department filed with the court last week, seeking to narrow orders issued by judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington that prohibit the nationwide enforcement of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump to restrict birthright citizenship.",
      "The justices usually order the other side in an emergency appeal to respond in a few days or a week. But in this case, they have set a deadline of April 4, without offering any explanation.",
      "The standard practice in U.S. courts is that a judge issues an order that gives only the people who sued what they want. As the name suggests, nationwide injunctions go well beyond the parties to a case and apply everywhere and to everyone who might be affected.",
      "There is a scholarly dispute over when the first nationwide injunctions were issued, but there is no disagreement that they started increasing in frequency during the Obama administration and have only grown in number since.",
      "One reason for the growth in these broad orders may be a corresponding increase in executive action.",
      "In 2015, for instance, a judge in Texas blocked President Barack Obama's program to protect immigrant parents of U.S. children after Congress failed to pass an immigration overhaul. Shortly after Trump took office for the first time, judges initially shut down his imposition of travel restrictions on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries.",
      "The Trump administration's acting top Supreme Court lawyer, Sarah Harris, described one major flaw in these court orders with universal effect. \"Years of experience have shown that the Executive Branch cannot properly perform its functions if any judge anywhere can enjoin every presidential action everywhere,\u201d Harris wrote in the emergency appeal over birthright citizenship.",
      "Her predecessor in the Biden administration, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, struck a similar theme in high court filings last year, noting that \u201cthe government must prevail in every suit to keep its policy in force, but plaintiffs can block a federal statute or regulation nationwide with just a single lower-court victory.\u201d",
      "The issue has been exacerbated by the tendency of conservatives to seek out like-minded judges in Texas, Louisiana and Missouri, while liberals file suit in friendlier courthouses in Massachusetts, California and New York.",
      "\u201cYou look at something like that and you think, that can\u2019t be right,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan said in 2022. \u201cIn the Trump years, people used to go to the Northern District of California, and in the Biden years, they go to Texas. It just can\u2019t be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks and leave it stopped for the years that it takes to go through the normal process.\u201d",
      "At least two justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch have made clear they think the answer is no. Several others have suggested the injunctions raise questions the court might someday answer.",
      "Samuel Bray, a professor at Notre Dame Law School, is a leading voice arguing that judges have no power to issue nationwide injunctions. The limits on a judge\u2019s power remain even in the face of an obviously unconstitutional policy, Bray said.",
      "That restraint applies even in the birthright citizenship cases, Bray wrote on the Divided Argument blog. \u201cAny illegal act by the president should be rejected by the federal courts. But they should reject it as courts do\u2014one case at a time, with remedies for the parties,\u201d he wrote, citing Kagan's remarks.",
      "People challenging the executive order could file a class-action lawsuit, which would have broader application. Indeed, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing immigration advocates and individuals in a case in New Hampshire told a judge that the ACLU was considering a nationwide class action.",
      "But the group's lawyer, Cody Wofsy, pointed out what might happen in the interim, if the Supreme Court agrees to the administration's request. \"Children would be exposed to all the harms we\u2019ve talked about immediately,\u201d Wofsy said.",
      "Amanda Frost, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, thinks the Supreme Court could be open to addressing the broader issue at some point because judges impose nationwide injunctions too often.",
      "But birthright citizenship would be a terrible issue on which to do so, Frost said.",
      "\u201cIt would create a burden on people at a moment in their lives when they\u2019re entering into the labor delivery room...And then you create a patchwork across the United States, incentivizing pregnant women to leave for a state that recognizes birthright citizenship,\u201d she said.",

      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- Tapping into his state's love of college basketball, Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman has recruited two players from top programs and given them roles as social media influencers to promote his drug prevention initiative aimed at young people.",
      "Social media videos released Tuesday feature University of Kentucky forward Trent Noah and University of Louisville guard J\u2019Vonne Hadley. The separate messages bridge their schools' storied rivalry by offering a common theme \u2014 the importance of staying active and disciplined as part of the \u201cBetter Without It\u201d campaign. Their videos coincide with the start of the NCAA basketball tournament.",
      "\u201cMarch always brings madness to the commonwealth, and this year it also brings a lifesaving message: our young people are \u2018Better Without It,\u2019\u201d Coleman said.",
      "The Bluegrass State is using prevention and treatment efforts to fight back against a drug addiction epidemic. Kentucky's drug overdose death toll reached nearly 2,000 in 2023, with fentanyl \u2014 a powerful synthetic opioid \u2014 blamed as the biggest culprit. It marked a second straight annual decline in deaths, but the state's top leaders say the fight is far from over. Kentucky lawmakers last year created tougher penalties for fentanyl dealers when their illicit distribution results in a fatal overdose.",
      "Coleman launched the drug prevention campaign last month with pitches from college coaches. The messages from Noah and Hadley are a key part of Coleman's playbook. In a state where top college athletes become household names, he's enlisting some of them to deliver positive, anti-drug messages.",
      "\u201cTo reach Kentucky\u2019s young people with an effective statewide drug prevention message, we need the right messengers,\" Coleman said in February. \"That\u2019s why we\u2019re partnering with some of the biggest names in Kentucky\u2019s college athletics to tell ... young people they are truly better without it.\u201d",
      "In his video, Noah says staying active \u201chelps me to be my best self by keeping me disciplined.\u201d At day's end, when checking off all the things he's done that day, \"it creates the best me,\u201d he says.",
      "In a previous video, University of Kentucky women's basketball player Cassidy Rowe urges viewers to find pursuits that give them joy and that they can work toward. She said basketball taught her resilience, accountability and discipline \u2014 traits she applies to her everyday life.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re feeling pressured, I would just encourage you to stay true to yourself and not let others influence you to become something that you\u2019re not,\u201d she said in the video released last month.",
      "The drug prevention campaign encourages young people to be independent, make their own decisions and stay informed about the dangers of drug use, while highlighting the positive effects of a drug-free lifestyle, Coleman's office said.",
      "Last year, the Kentucky Opioid Abatement Advisory Commission approved Coleman's two-year, $3.6 million proposal to establish the youth education campaign. Through name, image and likeness deals and other partnerships, student-athletes, influencers and others will promote positive messages about a drug-free lifestyle, the office said.",

      "Investigators say more than 25 songs have been played or distributed online without the consent of Eminem or Interscope Capital Labels Group, which owns Eminem\u2019s music. The music was stored on password-protected hard drives kept in a safe at Eminem's studio in Ferndale, Michigan, according to an FBI affidavit.",
      "Joseph Strange, 46, of Holly, Michigan, is charged with copyright infringement and interstate transportation of stolen goods, Acting U.S. Attorney Julie Beck in Detroit said. Strange, who lost his job at Eminem's studio in 2021, could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted of both counts.",
      "Strange's attorney, Wade Fink, said in a text to The Associated Press that Strange is a married father of two \u201cwith decades of dedication to the music industry.\u2033 He called the charges \u201cuntested allegations\u201d that haven't been vetted by a grand jury or a judge.",
      "\u201cWe will handle the matter in a courtroom and we have great faith in the judges of our district,\u201d he said.",
      "Studio employees reported the theft to the FBI in January, saying unreleased music that was still in development was being played on various websites, including Reddit and YouTube.",
      "A review showed someone transferred files from a hard drive in a safe to an external hard drive in October 2019 and January 2020, when Strange was a sound engineer at the studio.",
      "Investigators found buyers after Eminem business associate Fred Nassar posted an online warning to fans not to distribute the music.",
      "A Canadian resident who used the screen name Doja Rat told investigators he had purchased 25 unreleased songs from Strange for about $50,000 in Bitcoin. He said he raised the money from a group of fans of Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers III.",
      "Strange also was trying to sell some of Eminem's handwritten lyric sheets, Doja Rat said.",
      "Another group of fans organized by someone in Connecticut using the screen name ATL also purchased a \u201ccouple\u201d of songs from Strange for about $1,000, according to the affidavit.",
      "An FBI search of Strange's home in January turned up numerous handwritten Eminem lyric sheets and notes; a VHS tape of an unreleased Eminem video; and hard drives with 12,000 audio files. The music was in various stages of development and created by Eminem as well as by other unidentified artists working with him.",
      "Eminem won for best hip hop act at the 2024 MTV EMAs and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2022.",
      "The affidavit notes that Strange signed an agreement as part of his severance package that specifically prohibited him from electronically circulating Eminem's work.",
      "\u201cProtecting intellectual property from thieves is critical in safeguarding the exclusive rights of creators and protecting their original work from reproduction and distribution by individuals who seek to profit from the creative output of others,\u201d Beck said in a news release.",

      "GREEN RIVER, Wyo. -- A series of chain-reaction crashes and a fire in a Wyoming highway tunnel that killed three people started when a pickup truck lost control and partially blocked traffic on the slick roadway, federal investigators said Wednesday.",
      "It had snowed before the Feb. 14 crashes along Interstate 80, the primary east-west road corridor through Wyoming, near the small town of Green River, Wyoming. The highway was wet with possible ice or slush near the tunnel exit when a westbound Toyota pickup drove out of the tunnel and spun, hitting a guardrail before stopping, blocking the right lane and part of the left lane, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a preliminary report.",
      "Other vehicles headed out of the tunnel tried to avoid hitting the Toyota, including a tractor trailer that jackknifed and blocked both lanes of traffic about 200 feet before the tunnel's exit, it said.",
      "A Dodge pickup hit that tractor trailer, and another tractor trailer hit the Dodge pickup. That second tractor trailer, entangled with the Dodge truck, hit the jackknifed tractor trailer again before hitting the Toyota and another truck outside the tunnel, the NTSB said.",
      "Several other vehicles then collided inside the tunnel, and there was a post-crash fire, the report said.",
      "Two of the people in the Dodge pickup truck died as a result of the crashes, the NTSB said. The driver of a tractor trailer in the tunnel was trapped inside the vehicle and died in the fire, it said.",
      "Twenty other people had injuries of varying degrees, the NTSB said.",
      "The crash took place in the westbound tube of the twin tunnel under Castle Rock, a sandstone formation that looms over the town of Green River in the state\u2019s southwest region.",

      "The Republican-backed candidate in Wisconsin\u2019s closely watched state Supreme Court race has resurfaced long debunked concerns about voting fraud because of the late reporting of ballots in Milwaukee",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The Republican-backed candidate in Wisconsin's closely watched state Supreme Court race has resurfaced long debunked concerns about voting fraud because of the late reporting of ballots in Milwaukee just two weeks before the April 1 election.",
      "Brad Schimel, a former Republican attorney general, spoke of the possibility of \u201cbags of ballots\u201d and fraud in Milwaukee during an interview Tuesday on conservative talk radio. Schimel faces Democratic-backed Susan Crawford in the April 1 election with majority control of the Wisconsin Supreme Court at stake.",
      "Schimel, in an interview on WISN-AM, said his supporters need to \u201cget our votes banked, make this too big to rig so we don\u2019t have to worry that at 11:30 in Milwaukee, they\u2019re going to find bags of ballots that they forgot to put into the machines.\u201d",
      "Schimel said that happened in 2018 and in November \u201cwhen (U.S. Senate candidate) Eric Hovde was ahead all night, and then all of a sudden, Milwaukee County changed that.\u201d",
      "Republicans and Democrats alike, along with state and Milwaukee election leaders, warned in the run-up to the November election that Milwaukee absentee ballots would be reported late and cause a huge influx of Democratic votes. Milwaukee is the state's most populated city and is heavily Democratic.",
      "The reporting of those absentee ballots swung the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, fueling baseless conspiracy theories that the election had been stolen from President Donald Trump.",
      "Milwaukee's absentee ballots are counted at a central location and reported all at once, often well after midnight on election day. Elections officials for years have made clear that those ballots are reported later than usual due to the sheer number that have to be counted and because state law does not allow them to be processed until polls open.",
      "In 2018, the reporting of more than 47,000 absentee ballots after midnight put Democrat Tony Evers ahead of then-Gov. Scott Walker. Evers went on to win and Walker criticized the late reporting, saying it blindsided him.",
      "And in November, Hovde said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the reporting of more than 108,000 ballots in Milwaukee early in the morning after the election in his defeat to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.",
      "Schimel said in the radio interview he didn't know what happened.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if there was fraud there,\u201d Schimel said. \"There\u2019s no way for me to know that. All I know is this: We need to turn our votes out. That\u2019s the best insulation we have against any potential fraud, is just get our people to the polls.\u201d",
      "Asked about his concerns during an appearance later Tuesday at the Milwaukee Rotary Club, Schimel said he brought up fraud because voters often ask him how to guarantee election integrity.",
      "\u201cI tell people, by following the rules,\u201d Schimel said. \u201cAnd then I tell them, \u2018Here\u2019s the best way to make sure your vote isn\u2019t stolen: Go use it.\u2019 That\u2019s the answer.\u201d",
      "Yet despite his concerns, Schimel said: \u201cI will always accept the results of the election.\u201d",
      "Crawford's spokesperson, Derrick Honeyman, said Schimel was \"dabbling in conspiracy theories to please his ally, Elon Musk, and it\u2019s unbecoming of a judge and candidate for the state\u2019s high court.\u201d",
      "Groups funded by billionaire Musk have contributed more than $11 million to help Schimel's campaign. Crawford is backed by several billionaire Democrats, including philanthropist George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.",
      "The election comes as the court faces cases on abortion, public sector unions, voting rules and congressional district boundaries. Who controls the court also could factor into how it might rule on any future voting challenge in the perennial presidential battleground state \u2014 raising the stakes for national Republicans and Democrats.",

      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A West Virginia couple convicted in the mistreatment of their adopted children, including locking some in a shed, is due in court Wednesday for sentencing.",
      "A jury on Jan. 29 found Jeanne Kay Whitefeather and her husband, Donald Lantz, guilty on multiple counts of forced labor, human trafficking, and child abuse and neglect. Whitefeather also was convicted of civil rights violations based on race.",
      "Whitefeather faces up to 215 years in prison and Lantz up to 160 years when they are sentenced Wednesday in Kanawha County Circuit Court.",
      "The couple, who are white, adopted the five Black siblings while living in Minnesota, moved to a farm in Washington state in 2018, then brought the family to West Virginia in May 2023, when the children ranged in age from 5 to 16.",
      "Five months after their arrival in Sissonville, the couple was arrested after neighbors saw Lantz lock the oldest girl and her teenage brother in a shed and leave the property. A deputy used a crowbar to get them out.",
      "Inside the main residence, a 9-year-old girl was found crying in a loft alone with no protection from falling, according to a criminal complaint. The children were found in dirty clothes and smelling of body odor, deputies said, and the oldest boy was found barefoot with what appeared to be sores on his feet.",
      "A fourth child was with Lantz when he eventually returned, and deputies were later led to a 5-year-old girl. All five were turned over to Child Protective Services after the couple's arrest.",
      "Last month the oldest daughter, now an adult, sued the couple, alleging severe physical and emotional abuse and neglect that has scarred her permanently.",
      "During trial, neighbors testified they never saw the children play and witnessed Lantz make them stand in line or perform difficult chores around the yard, including lifting heavy items. After Lantz noticed the curious neighbors, the children mostly stayed indoors.",
      "The eldest daughter testified the outdoor work occurred mostly in Washington and that some of them were forced to use their hands for digging. She also said the children were cursed at \u201call the time\u201d and that Whitefeather used racist language.",
      "The daughter said Whitefeather gave preferential treatment to the youngest child, who wasn't involved in any of the charges, and that Whitefeather had told the other children that she wished for a life without them.",
      "The daughter also said the children were fed a steady diet of peanut butter sandwiches at scheduled times, some left over from a previous meal. Some kids were forced to stand in their rooms for hours and keep their hands on their heads. The oldest girl and boy shared a room, were forced to sleep on the floor and used the same bucket for the bathroom while the other held up a sheet for privacy from the home's security cameras, according to testimony.",
      "The couple and their attorneys pushed back on the accusations, with Lantz testifying that the chores were assigned to teach the children responsibility.",
      "The defense argued the couple was simply overwhelmed with trying to get help for the children\u2019s mental health issues, abuse and trauma from their biological home. Lantz\u2019s attorney, John Balenovich, said the state\u2019s child welfare agency, which the family requested help from several times, \u201cdropped the ball the most in this case.\u201d",
      "A forensic psychologist for the prosecution testified that the couple\u2019s treatment of the children had worsened their conditions.",
      "Assistant Prosecutor Madison Tuck said the couple never sought help for the oldest boy despite a behavioral health clinic being just minutes from their home. The boy, whose physical altercation with Whitefeather in 2022 was cited by attorneys as the start of the family\u2019s internal struggles, currently is receiving full-time care in a psychiatric facility.",
      "Whitefeather\u2019s attorney, Mark Plants, said during closing argument that the couple was only guilty of making poor parenting decisions.",
      "\u201cThese are farm people that do farm chores,\u201d Plants said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about race. It wasn\u2019t about forced labor.\u201d",

There were road closures of more than 160 miles (255 kilometers) of I-80 from Lincoln to Lexington and nearly 70 miles (115 kilometers) of I-29 along the Nebraska-Iowa border.

      "North Carolina lawmakers have agreed to spend another $528 million on still-pressing needs from Hurricane Helene\u2019s historic flooding nearly six months ago",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina lawmakers agreed Wednesday to spend another $528 million on still-pressing needs from Hurricane Helene's historic flooding nearly six months ago, with an emphasis on home and private road repairs, agriculture and infrastructure to aid businesses.",
      "House and Senate Republicans worked out their differences from competing versions of a bill and voted overwhelmingly this week for the compromise, which includes an additional $327 million to address the recovery from previous storms \u2014 some several years ago \u2014 and disasters not named Helene.",
      "The measure heads to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, who scheduled a bill-signing ceremony for Wednesday night. He told lawmakers last week during his State of the State address he was ready to sign a relief measure into law.",
      "Stein had asked the GOP-controlled legislature for an additional $1.07 billion for Helene relief in the mountains last month. The final measure omits some programs sought by Stein or underfunds his requests, as Republicans took a more cautious approach. Lawmakers and Stein have said they anticipate more Helene aid to be appropriated in the months ahead.",
      "\u201cAs we\u2019ve said many times, this is our next step, not our final step,\u201d GOP Sen. Ralph Hise of Mitchell County said Wednesday during debate on the final bill, which passed the Senate unanimously.",
      "Before the latest measure, the General Assembly had already appropriated or made available more than $1.1 billion for Helene recovery activities, according to Stein's office.",
      "The bill \u201cwill enable us to get started on many important aspects of disaster recovery, but we have to be honest that the amount is inadequate and this is just the start,\u201d Stein told reporters earlier Wednesday.",
      "The funds pale in comparison to the record $59.6 billion in Helene damages and recovery needs estimated by state officials, who also reported over 100 deaths from the late September storm. Stein\u2019s administration projects that disaster relief approved by Congress in December and other federal funding sources may ultimately provide more than $15 billion in Helene recovery funds to North Carolina. Stein is now seeking another $13 billion from Washington.",
      "About 4,600 households in western counties were still receiving temporary housing assistance as of last week, and more than 200 public roads in the region remain closed or just partially open, according to state data.",
      "The measure allocates $100 million to help repair or replace roads and bridges on private property that sometimes can be the only link between small communities and the outside world.",
      "There's $120 million to kick-start a home reconstruction and repair program while the state completes steps to receive nearly $1.4 billion from the federal government for similar construction and mitigation activities.",
      "The measure provides $200 million to address Helene crop losses, debris removal and other agricultural recovery needs. There's another $110 million for agriculture losses farmers suffered during 2024 from damage caused by other storms and drought.",
      "The final bill also locates an additional $217 million that would be used to complete close to 1,000 unfinished home construction projects for victims of Hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018 in eastern North Carolina. That program has faced lengthy delays and higher than planned expenses.",
      "\u201cFamilies who have waited far too long will finally get the relief they deserve,\u201d House Majority Leader Brenden Jones said in a news release. \"With strict oversight to ensure every dollar is used properly \u2014 we are finishing the job once and for all.\u201d",
      "The final plan also locates $9 million for a voluntary student summer school program in districts that were closed for many weeks because of Helene. Stein requested the help, although the money provided is lower than what he sought.",
      "The measure omitted Stein's request for two business grant programs designed to help companies that suffered significant sales and economic losses or physical damages.",
      "Republican lawmakers uncomfortable with direct payments instead agreed to spend $55 million on grants for local governments, which in turn could use the money for infrastructure repairs that could benefit small businesses, like sewer, utility and sidewalk repairs.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Delaware is trying to protect its status as the corporate capital of the world amid fallout from a judge's rejection of billionaire Elon Musk \u2019s landmark Tesla compensation package, although critics say fast-tracked legislation will tilt the playing field against investors, including pensioners and middle-class savers.",
      "A Delaware House committee was expected to vote Wednesday on the bill, which is backed by Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer who says it'll ensure the state remains the \"premier home for U.S. and global businesses\u201d to incorporate.",
      "Backers say it'll modernize the law and maintain balance between corporate officers and shareholders in a state where the courts, for a century, have settled all sorts of business disputes as the legal home of more than 2 million corporate entities, including two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies.",
      "Critics \u2014 including institutional investors, pension funds and asset managers \u2014 say it\u2019ll lower corporate governance standards, curb shareholder rights and, as a result, limit the ability to hold corporate officers accountable for decisions that violate their fiduciary duty.",
      "The bill passed the state Senate unanimously last week.",
      "A Delaware judge last year invalidated Musk's compensation package from Tesla that was potentially worth more than $55 billion. Lawyers for shareholders had sued over the package that Tesla\u2019s board of directors awarded Musk in 2018.",
      "Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick said it was developed by directors who weren\u2019t independent of Musk and approved by shareholders who had been given misleading and incomplete disclosures in a proxy statement.",

      "The fallout seemed to accelerate in recent weeks when the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta Platforms \u2014 the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 was considering moving its incorporation to Texas. Meta didn't confirm the report.",
      "DropBox, the online file-sharing platform, moved its corporate listing to Nevada, and Bill Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, a major hedge fund, said he\u2019d leave Delaware, too.",
      "On Feb. 1, Musk took to his social media platform X to crow about it, saying, \u201cCompanies are flooding out of Delaware, because the activist chief judge of the Delaware court has no respect for shareholder rights.\u201d",
      "That said, critics of the bill say there's no evidence that corporations are fleeing Delaware in any numbers.",
      "It changes several things.",
      "One, it gives corporations more protections in conflict-of-interest cases \u2014 such as a pay package for a CEO or intercompany agreements \u2014 in state courts when fighting shareholder lawsuits.",
      "Two, it limits the kind of documents that a company must produce in court cases and makes it harder for stockholders to get access to internal documents or communication that could prove time-consuming and expensive for a company to produce \u2014 not to mention, damaging to its case.",
      "Eric Talley, a Columbia University law professor, has compiled a running list of three dozen Delaware Supreme Court precedents that the legislation stands to change.",
      "Lawrence Hamermesh, a former professor at Widener University\u2019s Delaware Law School, disagreed. Hamermesh, who helped draft the legislation after Meyer asked him last month, said perhaps only a couple doctrines would be wiped out.",
      "A legal challenge is widely expected should Meyer get the bill and sign it into law. Meanwhile, institutional investors say such a law may prompt them to push corporations that they own to incorporate elsewhere.",
      "Money.",
      "Approximately one-third of Delaware\u2019s state government revenue \u2014 about $2.2 billion \u2014 comes from corporate license fees and associated tax revenues, according to the governor's office. That helps the state to maintain a 0% sales tax and keep property taxes relatively low, a nice perk for the beach vacation home industry along its Atlantic coast.",

      "Overall, violent crime in New York's subway system, which carries millions of riders every day, is rare. Train cars and stations are generally as safe as any other public place. However, recent high-profile attacks, such as a woman being set on fire and people being shoved onto the tracks, have left some riders on edge.",

The letter specifically mentions \u201cpassengers being pushed in front of trains,\" \u201csubway surfing\u201d and suicides.",
      "The letter threatened to redirect or withhold funds if the agency doesn't comply with its request for information and gave a deadline of March 31. The MTA, which also runs New York City\u2019s buses and regional rail networks, relies on a mix of local, state and federal funding. Its $68 billion, five-year capital plan through 2029 anticipates $14 billion in federal grants and funds.",
      "The letter comes as New York faces a Friday deadline to comply with a Trump administration order to halt Manhattan\u2019s new congestion pricing system. State officials, however, have vowed to continue the tolling program, which is meant to thin traffic and pump new revenue into the nation\u2019s busiest transit system.",

      "The proposed resolution would require Maine's schools to forbid transgender girls from participating in any sports program or using any locker room or bathroom designated for girls. It would also force the state to accept the Trump administration's definition of sex as male or female only.",
      "The state would be required to revoke individual awards and honors won by transgender girls and give them to athletes who otherwise would have won.

Uncertainty is high about how much pain President Donald Trump will allow the economy to endure in order to remake the system as he wants. He\u2019s said he wants manufacturing jobs back in the United States and far fewer people working for the federal government.",
      "Trump\u2019s barrage of announcements on tariffs and other policies have created so much uncertainty that economists worry U.S. businesses and households may freeze and pull back on their spending.",

Besides goosing the economy, lowering rates would also push inflation upward, and worries are already high about inflation because of tariffs. The Fed does not have a good tool to fix what\u2019s called \u201c stagflation,\u201d where the economy is stagnating but inflation remains high.",
      "Virtually all of Wall Street is expecting the Fed to announce no change to its main interest rate this afternoon, as it waits to see how conditions play out. For the moment, the job market seems to be relatively solid overall after the economy closed last year running at a solid pace.",

      "Big Tech has generally been at the center of the market\u2019s recent sell-off, as stocks whose momentum had earlier seemed unstoppable have since dropped sharply following criticism they had simply grown too expensive.",

    "story": [
      "The Bank of England has warned economic and global trade uncertainty has \"intensified\" as it held UK interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "US trade tariffs and retaliation to the import taxes from the likes of the EU have created uncertainty for countries, the Bank said.",
      "Its decision to hold rates was widely expected, but governor Andrew Bailey said the Bank still believed rates were \"on a gradually declining path\".",
      "\"There's a lot of economic uncertainty at the moment,\" he added. \"We'll be looking very closely at how the global and domestic economies are evolving.\"",
      "Mr Bailey reiterated it was the Bank's job \"to make sure that inflation stays low and stable\". Inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, currently remains above the Bank's 2% target, at 3%.",
      "The Bank's Monetary Policy committee (MPC), which sets rates, voted by a majority of eight to one in favour of holding at 4.5%.",
      "The base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The relatively higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so the latest decision will not have any immediate impact on monthly repayments.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, so they face higher repayment costs when deals end. On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.33%, while the average five-year fix was 5.18%.",
      "Mortgage rates have been edging down recently, primarily because the markets and lenders expect further rate cuts this year, with analysts predicting two more cuts by the end of 2025.",

      "Follow live: Bank of England holds interest rates at 4.5%",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "While inflation is much lower than in recent years, households are still feeling the pain of higher prices and are set to be hit by a host of higher bills for water, energy and council tax from April.",
      "On Thursday, figures from the Office for National Statistics said direct debit failures had increased by 2% in February compared with January, which it said was driven in part by people missing loans and mortgage repayments.",
      "'Exporters are nervous'",
      "Trade tariffs imposed by the US also threaten to push up prices for UK businesses exporting across the Atlantic. The Bank said most firms were in \"wait and see\" mode, as they also face a hike in National Insurance contributions (NICs) next month.",
      "\"Exporters to the US are nervous about potential adverse demand impacts of tariffs, but there may be opportunities in other markets,\" the Bank said.",
      "It added feedback from across the UK suggested more firms were reporting hiring pauses or freezes and noted that businesses, especially in the services sector such as pubs, cafes or hairdressers, would likely pass the cost of the increase in NICs to customers.",
      "\"Some businesses are waiting to see how current conditions evolve before committing to spend and some are already cutting back on plans,\" the Bank said.",
      "It added the latest data on wages suggested an \"easing in pay growth over the course of the year\" for workers.",
      "The Bank has forecast inflation to rise further this year to 3.7%, and stay above its 2% target until the end of 2027.",
      "There have been three rate cuts since August 2024 after previous hikes to try to combat high inflation, which was driven by energy and food prices soaring in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine.",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing. But it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.",
      "The Bank has previously halved its estimate for how much the UK economy will grow over the next year, contributing to mounting pressure on the government as it has made growing the economy its main priority."

      "However, the number of people not looking for work has been brought into sharp focus as the government brings in plans to try to boost UK economic growth.",
      "The figures come after controversial plans to cut sickness and disability benefits were announced this week, and ahead of next week's Spring Statement when Chancellor Rachel Reeves will give an update on her economic plans.",
      "On Tuesday, the government announced sweeping cuts to sickness and disability benefits aimed at saving \u00a35bn a year by 2030.",
      "It says the measures will encourage people to work while protecting those who cannot.",
      "But the reforms have faced fierce criticism from Labour backbenchers, unions and charities, who say the changes could push more disabled people into poverty.",

      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said its jobs figures should be treated with caution because of low response rates to its employment survey.",
      "Nevertheless, it said economic inactivity  - where people are out of work and not looking for work - has generally been falling since comparable records began in 1971.",
      "There are currently 9.27 million people classified as economically inactive. Reasons for economic inactivity include long-term sickness, studying, retirement and caring responsibilities.",
      "It increased during the Covid pandemic, and has fluctuated around this increased rate.",
      "However, economic inactivity for all age groups fell over the year by 0.6%, and fell 0.2% on the quarter largely because of more people aged 35 to 49 looking for work, the ONS said.",
      "In its labour market release, the ONS said pay growth continued to outpace inflation.",
      "Wages excluding bonuses grew 5.9% in the quarter, compared with the previous year, with retail, hospitality and construction wages seeing strong growth.",
      "In real terms, taking into account inflation, regular pay grew 2.2%.",
      "Redundancies rose for the first time in a year to 124,000 in the three months to January.",
      "The Bank of England watches the pay and jobs data closely when making decisions on interest rates.",

      "Listen to Theo read this article on BBC Sounds",
      "\"This has been our family car for three years, and it has been an absolute dream,\" says Ben Kilbey as he shows me his gleaming pearl-white Tesla Model Y.",
      "Ben is a staunch electric car advocate. He runs a communications firm that promotes sustainable businesses in the UK. Yet now, he says, the Model Y has to go \u2013 because he disapproves vehemently of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's actions, especially the way he has handled firing US government employees.",
      "\"I'm not a fan of polarisation, or of doing things without kindness,\" he says. \"There are ways of doing things that don't ostracise people or belittle them. I don't like belittlement.\"",
      "Ben is part of a wider backlash against the Tesla boss that appears to have been gathering momentum in recent weeks, since Musk was appointed head of the controversial Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), charged with taking an axe to federal government spending.",
      "Musk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "For some who do not share his views, it has all become too much.",
      "There have been protests outside dozens of Tesla dealerships, not only in the US, but also in Canada, the UK, Germany and Portugal.",
      "Although most of them have been peaceful, there have been cases of showrooms, charging stations and vehicles being vandalised. In separate incidents in France and Germany, several cars were set on fire.",
      "In the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps.",
      "US President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as \"domestic terrorism\".",
      "Musk has also been unequivocal in his response. \"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" he said in a recent interview with Fox News. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"",
      "What is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers.",
      "And if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm?",
      "A larger-than-life figurehead",
      "Two decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical.",
      "Musk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence.",
      "\"Tesla was the pioneer,\" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. \"They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness.\"",
      "It is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth.",
      "Nowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless \"robotaxis\". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus.",
      "Like the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts.",
      "But recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges.",
      "'Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla'",
      "Although its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million.",
      "The decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down.",
      "This year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February \u2013 although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% \u2013 as well as in Australia.",
      "Meanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month.",
      "In early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day \u2013 adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year.",
      "Sales can fall for many reasons, but research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada \u2013 although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets.",
      "In the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: \"Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.\"",
      "Tesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales.",
      "But experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO.",
      "'Dated' models and overseas competition",
      "To start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market.",
      "\"If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty. \"They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there.\"",
      "Prof Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: \"We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.\"",
      "Competition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars.",
      "At the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology.",
      "\"China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty.",
      "\"You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well.\"",
      "The extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes \u2013 significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network.",
      "The question of robotaxis",
      "Musk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles.",
      "In January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time.",
      "In 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's \"Full Self Driving\" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a \"hands-on\" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times.",
      "\"Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,\" says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy.",
      "Is Musk spinning too many plates?",
      "Arguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket.",
      "Asked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded \"with great difficulty\".",
      "\"It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,\" says Prof Wells.",
      "\"If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.\"",
      "Ever since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake \u2013 currently worth more than $95bn.",
      "That is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes.",
      "For those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation.",
      "Calls for new blood at the top",
      "Today, Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings \u2013 a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as Ford, General Motors or Toyota, which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth.",
      "\"Tesla is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles \u2013 which is clearly not going to happen, given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers \u2013 or that is going to dominate robotaxis and autonomous vehicles,\" says Mr Nagley.",
      "None of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment \u2013  although in media interviews this week, one long-term shareholder-turned-vocal critic, the investment fund manager Ross Gerber, did call for Mr Musk to step down.",
      "But analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top. \"A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "\"It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.\"",
      "\"I think that's the clear direction of travel at the moment.\" says Prof Wells. \"I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalise the business.",
      "\"It needs a significant change of direction now.\"",

      "The Federal Reserve released its projections for the world's largest economy on Wednesday while keeping interest rates unchanged again, saying it wanted to see how the White House policies unfold.",
      "That decision, which was widely expected, kept the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate hovering around 4.3%, where it has stood since December.",
      "After the announcement, Trump, who has previously criticised the central bank, called on it to cut rates.",
      "\"The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as US Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy,\" the US President said on his platform Truth Social.",
      "\"Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!\"",
      "Earlier, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the economy still appeared healthy, despite a sharp downturn in sentiment and \"remarkably high\" uncertainty.",
      "But he warned tariffs - which are taxes on imports - were likely to slow growth and hinder the bank's efforts to keep prices stable, noting recent data showing a rise in goods prices.",
      "\"Clearly some of it, a good part of it, is coming from tariffs,\" he said, speaking after the Fed's rates announcement on Wednesday.",
      "\"Progress is probably delayed for the time being,\" he added.",
      "Since taking office in January, Trump has announced blitz of new tariffs while also calling for big cuts to taxes, regulation, and government spending.",
      "Economists have long warned that some of those policies could cause prices to rise, at least in the short-term, and raise uncertainty for businesses.",
      "Analysts say the concerns have also helped to drive a sell-off in the stock market, with the S&P 500 falling 10% from February back to levels last seen in September.",
      "Trump has acknowledged there could be \"a little disturbance\" from his tariffs, but says the policies will lead to long-term growth.",
      "Inflation and economic downturn fears",
      "The dynamic has added to the challenges facing the Fed, which has spent much of the last three years trying to keep prices stable and avoid economic downturn.",
      "Mr Powell said the bank was assuming that tariffs would cause a one-time jump in prices, rather than a more sustained increase, but it is also bracing for a hit to growth.",
      "The forecasts showed policymakers now expect inflation to stand at 2.7% at the end of this year, up from the 2.5% they had predicted in December.",
      "They are also expecting growth of just 1.7% this year, down from the 2.1% previously anticipated.",
      "Though it kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, the forecasts suggest the bank still expects to cut rates by the end of the year.",
      "The Fed also said it would slow down selling assets, such as government debt, in a move that effectively offers more support for the economy.",
      "\"For the time being, the Fed is in wait and see mode, as it monitors whether the recent growth slowdown develops into something more serious,\" said Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",

      "\"Listen, when I took the job on of The Apprentice, I was already a multi-millionaire.",
      "\"I didn't do it for the money.\"",
      "In the wide-ranging BBC interview, Lord Sugar reflects on his life and career, and also discusses President - and original US Apprentice star - Donald Trump, former contestant Katie Hopkins, and the \"disaster\" of Brexit.",
      "Known for his cantankerous, no-nonsense business dealings and his \"you're fired/hired\" catchphrase, Lord Sugar insists his on-screen persona is how he is in real life.",
      "\"That is me mate, I'm promising you,\" he tells Rajan in the BBC Two interview.",
      "\"I have sat on the production line, I've made stuff, I've packed boxes, I've loaded lorries, I've delivered, I've collected money. Every single facet of business, I have done all of it.",
      "\"So when I got that Apprentice gig, sitting there listening to these budding entrepreneurs, I was able to interrogate them properly.\"",

      "Alan Sugar was approached by the BBC about making a UK version of a popular business-based entertainment show in the mid-noughties, towards the end of his challenging tenure as chair and owner of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.",
      "But why did he say yes?",
      "\"Because Donald Trump in America did The Apprentice first of all - and I have got a home in America, in Florida, and all the people were telling my wife, 'This is the greatest TV show ever',\" he explains.",
      "\"So I knew of it.\"",
      "He's reticent to talk about the now US president, saying \"there's no comparison\" between himself and the other former face of The Apprentice.",
      "\"He's nothing like me and I'm nothing like him,\" he says. \"But the point is that what he's doing is very, very unusual.\"",
      "Last month, Trump clashed with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a furious exchange at the White House. \"Unbelievable,\" says Lord Sugar.",
      "\"There are certain things in life that I didn't think I'd ever experience. One was Brexit, which is the biggest tragedy. [Then] you've got a leader of a country, of America, publicly having a slanging match with someone else. It's just not right.",

      "\"End of.\"",
      "'I would beg to get back in EU'",
      "Always forthright with his opinions, Lord Sugar made recent headlines by airing his views on topics including working from home, telling workers to \"get their bums back to the office\".",
      "He's also shared his thoughts on female football commentators, Brexit and Boris Johnson, to name a few subjects.",
      "Speaking in the House of Lords in 2018, Lord Sugar said Brexit campaigners, such as Tory politicians Johnson and Michael Gove, should be prosecuted for \"the \u00a3350m lie they put on the red bus\".",
      "\"Brexit was a total, absolute disaster,\" he tells Rajan. \"And anybody who says it's not is deluded.",
      "\"That has changed so many things.\"",
      "Despite calling for him to be jailed, a year later Lord Sugar backed Johnson as the next prime minister in order to \"stop [Jeremy] Corbyn getting into power\".",

      "He picks out one famous former contestant, Katie Hopkins, as someone who could have got the job had she not walked first.",
      "\"Remember her?\" asks Lord Sugar. \"Ratchet jaws, rent-a-mouth.\"",
      "Hopkins, nowadays a media personality and right-wing political commentator/provocateur, appeared on series three in 2007 but left the show despite being offered a place in the final because she could not commit to a potential move to London.",
      "\"I was about to say, 'Well, I'll hire you'. And she said, 'No, actually, I don't want to do it'. So she left,\" he remembers.",
      "\"She was good. She was the best of that crew. No question of it.\"",
      "Reflecting on the show, he believes some contestants now apply to go on The Apprentice to achieve social media fame, rather than for the chance to work with him.",

    "story": [
      "Santander has announced it is set to close 95 branches across the UK, putting 750 jobs at risk.",
      "The High Street bank said its customers were increasingly shifting to banking online and it aimed to start closing almost a quarter of its branches from June.",
      "As part of the changes, Santander will also reduce hours at 36 branches and remove the front counters from 18 others.",
      "It is the latest bank to announce branch closures, with Lloyds announcing 136 closures in January.",
      "The closures will leave Santander with 349 branches, down from 444.",
      "It said the areas to lose branches would be covered by 95 \"community bankers\" who will visit local communities on a weekly basis in facilities such as libraries.",
      "Santander said the changes were due to a \"a rapid movement of customers choosing to do their banking digitally\".",
      "It added digital transactions had increased by just under two thirds since 2019, with a similar drop for transactions in branches.",
      "\"Closing a branch is always a very difficult decision and we spend a great deal of time assessing where and when we do this and how to minimise the impact it may have on our customers,\" a Santander spokesperson said.",
      "About 750 staff will be at risk of redundancy if the proposals go ahead after consultation with the unions, the Spanish-owned bank said.",
      "Some MPs have criticised bank branch closures, saying they leave people in rural areas \"frozen out\".",
      "Santander said it would continue to open so-called \"work caf\u00e9s\", which are hubs where customers can access banking services, withdraw cash, and also use as a workspace.",

      "She said schemes to protect services such as banking hubs \"are a good start in plugging gaps left by closing physical branches\", but said they should be rolled out \"much more quickly if consumers are to feel their benefits\".",
      "The government \"must hold banks' feet to the fire\" to make sure commitments to set up 350 banking hubs by 2029 are met, and be prepared to push up that total if necessary, Ms Ross added.",
      "Banks and building societies must assess whether areas have reasonable access to cash when they close branches under UK rules.",
      "If not, they need to provide more facilities such as shared hubs before closing a branch.",

      "While other victims have seen their convictions overturned, Mr Castleton's civil judgement against him still stands.  His legal action is to set aside, or overturn, the judgement.",
      "\"I'd like to effectively have my day in court as well,\" said Mr Castleton who is due to receive his OBE next month.",

      "\"Lee faced a David versus Goliath battle against the Post Office and we are fully ready to take this all the way to trial should we need to,\" says his lawyer, Simon Goldberg.",
      "During the public inquiry it emerged that that Fujitsu's log of known errors wasn't disclosed to Mr Castleton during his court proceedings.",
      "The application to the court in Lee's case will say that the Post Office, conspiring with others, withheld evidence about the unreliability of the Horizon system. A witness from Fujitsu also gave evidence in his case.",
      "\"What we're effectively going to be saying is that the claim against his was an abuse of process. It was never about recovery of the sum of money - it was to make an example of Mr Castleton\" says Mr Goldberg.",
      "\"We also believe the judgement was obtained by fraud in that the Post Office and Fujitsu knew perfectly well that the Horizon system wasn't working properly,\" he added."

      "Yet there's something a little odd about the fact we are getting no breakdown of which of these welfare policies will generate the cash saving.",
      "The government attributed the lack of numbers to the need for its official independent forecaster the  Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to cast its eyes over them ahead of next week's Spring Statement.",

      "And needing help to wash your hair, or your body below the waist, would be awarded two points, but needing help to wash between the shoulders and waist would equate to four points.",
      "The changes announced aim to take Pip payments away from such people from November 2026.",
      "The government knows how many, and who they are. For now, until the Spring Statement next week, we can deduce that there are around a million people who will lose their entire \u00a370 a week or \u00a33,500 a year payment.",

    "summary": "Ways are being developed for subsea cables to \"sense\" whether they are being disturbed or attacked.",
    "story": [
      "The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch.",
      "He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching.",
      "\"He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,\" says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. \"The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance.\"",
      "Multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months.",
      "So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission called \"Baltic Sentry\", to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones.",
      "The EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables.",
      "Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once.",
      "So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable \u2013 by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed.",
      "It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year \u2013 not a real attempt at sabotage \u2013 that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm.",
      "The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles.",
      "And, the team tested whether their cable could \"hear\" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water.",
      "When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself.",
      "Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example.",
      "AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence.",
      "\"You see every single footstep,\" says Clemens Pohl, chief executive, as he points to a chart revealing disturbances in the fibre optic signal. The footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge.",
      "With this technology, it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subsea cable, as well as its location and, in some circumstances, its direction of travel. That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times.",
      "It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, \"dark\" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds.",
      "There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable.",
      "AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but \"usually not several kilometres away\". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further.",
      "\"People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,\" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems.",
      "Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful \u2013 one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves.",
      "That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset.",
      "Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea.",
      "Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: \"We do see the number of requests increasing.\"",
      "Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm.",
      "Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening.",
      "Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also \"armoury wire\", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. \"On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,\" says Mr Priess.",
      "But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says \u2013 such is the force of the collision or pulling action.",
      "While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres.",
      "\"Cables break all the time,\" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. \"The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,\" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period.",
      "Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service.",
      "Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: \"It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up.\"",
      "And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. \"The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,\" Says Benner.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 22:27:16 GMT",
    "summary": "Could this be a chance for the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy to shed protectionism and open up further?",
    "story": [
      "India has usually turned to economic reforms in times of distress, with the most famous example being 1991, when the country embraced liberalisation in the face of a deep financial crisis.",
      "Now, with US President Donald Trump's tit-for-tat tariff wars and the global trade upheaval that has followed, many believe that India finds itself at another crossroad.",
      "Could this be a major opportunity for the world's fifth largest economy to shed its protectionism and further open up its economy? Will India seize the moment, just as it did more than three decades ago, or will it retreat further?",
      "Trump has repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties. The problem is that India's trade-weighted import duties - the average duty rate per imported product - are among the highest in the world. The US average tariff is 2.2%, China's is 3% and Japan's is 1.7%. India's stands at a whopping 12%, according to data from the World Trade Organization.",
      "High tariffs increase costs for companies dependent on global value chains, hindering their ability to compete in international markets. They also mean that Indians pay more on imported goods than foreign consumers. Despite growing exports - primarily driven by services - India runs a significant trade deficit. However, with India's share of global exports at a mere 1.5%, the challenge becomes even more urgent.",
      "The jury is out on whether Trump's tariff war will help India break free or double down on protectionism. Narendra Modi's government, often criticised for its protectionist stance, seems to have shifted gears in recent years.",
      "Last month, ahead of Prime Minister Modi's meeting with Trump in Washington, India unilaterally lowered tariffs on Bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and some other US products.",
      "Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has made two trips to the US to discuss a potential trade deal, following Trump's threatened retaliatory tariffs, looming on 2 April. (Citi Research analysts estimate India could lose up to $7bn annually from reciprocal tariffs, primarily affecting sectors like metals, chemicals and jewellery, with pharmaceuticals, automobiles and food products also at risk.)",
      "Last week, Goyal urged Indian exporters to \"come out of their protectionist mindset and encouraged them to be bold and ready to deal with the world from a position of strength and self-confidence\", according to a statement from his ministry.",
      "India is also actively pursuing free trade deals with several countries, including the UK and New Zealand, and the European Union.",
      "In an interesting turn of events, homegrown telecoms giants Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have teamed up with Trump ally Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch satellite internet services via Starlink in India. The move surprised analysts, especially after Musk's recent clashes with both companies, and came as US and Indian officials negotiate the trade deal.",
      "India's rapid growth from the late 1990s to the 2000s - 8.1% between 2004-2009 and 7.46% from 2009-2014 - was in large part driven by its gradual integration into global markets, particularly in pharmaceuticals, software, autos, textiles and garments, alongside a steady reduction in tariffs. Since then, India has turned inwards.",
      "Many economists believe that protectionist policies over the past decade have undermined Modi's Make in India initiative, which prioritised capital- and technology-intensive sectors over labour-intensive ones like textiles. As a result, it has struggled to boost manufacturing and exports.",
      "High tariffs have also fostered protectionism in several Indian industries, discouraging investments in efficiency, according to Viral Acharya, a professor of economics at New York University Stern School of Business.",
      "This has allowed \"cosy incumbents\" to gain market power by consolidating their positions without facing much competition. As Mr Acharya, a former central banker, noted in a paper by Brookings Institution, restoring industrial balance in India requires \"reducing tariffs to increase the country's share of global goods trade and reduce protectionism\".",
      "With India's tariffs already higher than those of most countries, further increases could be especially damaging.",
      "\"We need to boost exports and a tit-for-tat tariff war won't help us. China can afford this strategy due to its massive export base, but we can't, as we hold only a small share of the global market,\" Rajeswari Sengupta, an associate professor of economics at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, said.  \"A trade conflict could hurt us more than others.\"",
      "In light of this, India finds itself at a crossroad. As the world undergoes a major shift, India has a \"unique opportunity to shape a new vision\" for global trade, says Aseema Sinha, a trade expert at Claremont McKenna College.",
      "By lowering protectionist barriers in South Asia and strengthening ties with Southeast Asia and the Middle East, India has the chance to lead in shaping a new trade vision, positioning itself as a key player in a \"re-globalised\" world, Ms Sinha, author of Globalising India, says.",
      "\"By reducing tariffs, India could become the regional and cross-regional magnet for trade and economic activity, drawing in varied powers in its orbit,\" she adds.",
      "That could help India create the jobs it desperately needs at home. Agriculture, which makes up 15% of its GDP, accounts for a whopping 40% of employment, reflecting extremely low productivity. Construction remains the second-largest employer, absorbing casual daily workers.",
      "India's challenge isn't in expanding its thriving service sector, which already makes up nearly half of total exports, but in dealing with the large pool of unskilled workers who lack the basic skills needed for service jobs.",
      "\"While high-end services are thriving, the majority of the workforce remains uneducated and underemployed, often relegated to construction or informal jobs. To provide meaningful employment to millions entering the workforce each year, India must ramp up its manufacturing exports, as relying solely on services won't address the needs of the unskilled labour force,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "One concern is that reducing tariffs could lead to dumping, where foreign companies flood the market with cheap goods, potentially harming domestic industries.",
      "According to Ms Sengupta, India's ideal approach to trade would involve a \"universal reduction\" in import tariffs, as it currently has some of the highest tariffs among its trading partners.",
      "However, there is a caveat: China's trade struggles, particularly with the US due to the ongoing trade war, could lead to Chinese dumping in India in the \"short run\".",
      "\"To protect against this, India can use non-tariff barriers against China but only against this one country and only in cases of proven dumping. Barring that, it is in India's interest to do a wholesale slashing of tariffs,\" she says.",
      "There's also a growing concern that India may be overcompensating in its efforts to flatter the US.",

      "Business leader and recently-appointed new member of Canada's Senate, Sandra Pupatello, says that reshoring is \"really obvious\" to support.",
      "Pupatello, who had previously been Ontario's Minister of Economic Development and Trade, points to the Covid-19 pandemic, when rules of trade \"went right out the window\".",
      "She specifically cites the example of US mask manufacturer 3M coming under pressure from the White House in 2020 to halt exports to Canada and Latin America.",
      "In that moment Pupatello thought: \"We've got to be prepared for the worst\".",
      "Shortly after, she established Reshoring Canada, a non-partisan group advocating for a more resilient supply chain in Canada.",
      "Pupatello tells the BBC: \"If the going gets tough, Canada is on its own. And if we know that's the case, let us plan for it.\"",

      "US President Donald Trump said he would temporarily spare US carmakers from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico, just a day after the tariffs came into effect in March.",
      "But in the shadow of a trade war, Mr Brougham says he has had \"good communications\" with a large Canadian auto parts company for the first time ever. \"All of a sudden they are interested in working closer with other Canadian companies.\"",
      "For Mr Brougham and others, the benefits of reshoring are clear. From giving a leg up to small companies that have struggled to compete with manufacturers overseas, to ensuring fair wages, and the environmental benefits of importing and exporting fewer goods.",
      "Others, including Graham Markham, director of a food sector supplier, believe it's about adding value to products Canada already produces.",
      "His Canadian firm New Protein International is currently constructing Canada's first soy protein manufacturing plant in southwest Ontario, just miles from the US border.",
      "Canada is the world's fourth-largest exporter of the crop, but most of it is processed overseas.",
      "\"We don't process those value-added ingredients into more valuable ingredients here at home,\" says Mr Markham.",
      "From critical minerals and uranium to lumber and soybeans, he argues that this is the moment to change.",
      "\"Canada has long been a successful supplier of raw materials to the world. The opportunity now is to stop exporting the job creation and innovation that comes from processing those materials domestically.\"",
      "So, could manufacturing start coming back to Canada?  Economist Randall Bartlett says it is too early to tell.",
      "\"There's a lot more smoke than there is fire when it comes to actual reorganisation of supply chains and moving them domestically,\" says Mr Bartlett, senior director of Canadian economics at Quebec-based Desjardins.",
      "\"I think there has been some movement toward reshoring, but I think there's a lot more narrative around it than there is actual re-establishing of manufacturing capacity.\"",
      "There are major hurdles too.",
      "The highly-integrated auto industry, for example, would take years to untangle. Reshoring it would require \"many tens of hundreds of billions of dollars in both private and public sector investment to make happen\", according to Mr Bartlett.",
      "Then there's the reality of global trade.",
      "\"Some countries are better at producing some things than other countries are,\" Mr Bartlett says, suggesting that rather than a full reshoring push, diversifying Canada's trade partners might be more practical.",
      "He says that Canada should focus on \"those industries where we have a comparative advantage\", which he says include renewable energy and processing steel and aluminium. Those two metals have now been hit with a 25% tariff if they are exported to the US.",
      "Back at Au Lit Fine Linens in Toronto, Joanna Goodman steps into a vast stockroom, filled with the sound of carboard boxes being packed.",

    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but his experience managing global economic crises will help.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.",

      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

      "Coram Family and Childcare's annual survey shows the impact of the changes, with eligible working parents seeing a 22% reduction in their annual cost.",
      "Elsewhere, prices have risen for childminders, nurseries, pre-schools and after-school care.",

      "The cost for three and four-year-olds has risen across England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "Coram Family and Childcare's head, Lydia Hodges, said that while the funded hours in England are \"a welcome step\" for making childcare affordable for working parents, the system now needs to be rebalanced.",
      "She says parents ineligible for the funded childcare \"are unlikely to be able to meet the cost involved in giving their children the same amount of early education that other children get for free\".",
      "The report also found that the availability of nursery and childminder places varies between council areas, with the lowest provision for children with special educational needs and disabilities and families living in rural areas.",
      "For Meg Pattern, who is eight months' pregnant, the funded hours have been a massive help and brought her childcare costs down.",

      "She says she has tried all of the local settings, including the nursery her three-year-old son Rupert goes to, but they are full until September 2026.",
      "The nearest one with availability next April is a 40-minute drive from her house, in the opposite direction to work.",
      "\"I told them when I was eight weeks' pregnant, which is pretty early,\" she says.",
      "\"It's really stressful - when I go back to work, I'll have both kids going in opposite ways.\"",
      "Her son Rupert is eligible for 30 hours of government funding per week, but his nursery only has a space for two days.",

      "Claire Kenyon, the owner, says she is considering capping the amount of funded hours people can use, or pulling out of the scheme altogether, because she cannot balance the books.",
      "This would mean fewer government-funded nursery places available. The government estimated 70,000 additional spaces will be needed by this September because of the increase in demand.",
      "Ms Kenyon says, on one hand, the government is telling parents they can expect cheaper bills, but she believes they are not paying enough to nurseries to provide them.",
      "Last month, the Department for Education (Dfe) sent a letter to nurseries saying parents should be able to opt out of paying for chargeable extras including lunches, \"to ensure no family is priced out\".",

      "Scottish universities, like most in the UK, have been on a recruitment drive to draw in students from other parts of the world, charging them much higher fees than UK students \u2013 from about \u00a310,000 up to \u00a340,000 per year.",
      "For those with a prestigious reputation, including Scotland's older universities, the share of foreign students has risen to close to 40%.",
      "This has brought controversy - about the quality of learning, standards of English language ability, and the surge in demand for student accommodation.",

      "It said that factors including a \"severe drop\" in international student recruitment and an increase in National Insurance contributions were to blame for the deficit.",

      "The drop in income was partly blamed on a lower number of international students coming to the UK.",
      "The Scottish government said international student numbers had seen a decline following changes by the UK government to the immigration system, such as ending the inclusion of family members on student visas.",
      "Higher Education Minister Graeme Dey said: \"We recognise the issues raised by the sector around a decline in international student numbers and damaging UK migration policies which is why we have proposed a 'Scottish Graduate Visa' which would allow us to retain international students after they graduate from Scottish institutions.\""

    "summary": "Plans to axe a fifth of the workforce at Dundee University have drawn attention to problems in the sector.",
    "story": [
      "Scotland's universities are hitting a crunch point with their finances, forcing job losses on a scale we used to see from major factory closures and raising questions about whether they can all survive.",
      "Dundee University is cutting 632 full-time jobs \u2013 a fifth of its workforce - as it tries to tackle a \u00a335m deficit, and its underlying financial position looks even worse.",
      "The University of Edinburgh is looking to make \u00a3140m of cuts over the next 18 months. That figure is equivalent to about a tenth of the annual spending at the institution, which now has about 15,000 staff on its payroll.",
      "Aberdeen University has also cut staff through voluntary redundancy programmes, while the city's Robert Gordon University has put 135 roles \"at risk\" - which usually means they are bound to go.",
      "It has been suggested that more than 80 universities across the UK face deficits of between \u00a310m and \u00a350m, with Durham and Cardiff both planning significant spending cuts.",
      "When the Scottish Funding Council publishes its delayed annual assessment of the sector, it is expected to say that more than half of Scotland's institutions are running a deficit.",
      "They all face similar pressures, but some have done better than others at foreseeing the danger and planning for it.",
      "So what are the challenges facing the sector in Scotland?",
      "The level of student funding",
      "Scottish students get \"free tuition\". Undergraduates don't have to pay fees for their courses if they can secure one of the limited number of places.",
      "The Scottish government has committed to pay the tuition costs, which it does through the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).",
      "Universities Scotland, which represents the 18 institutions, says that level of funding has not kept pace with inflation or with the number of students.",
      "It says there has been a decade of under-investment by the Scottish government in the higher education sector.",
      "The figures differ according to how you measure inflation, but it told MSPs that funding per student had fallen by 39% in real terms.",
      "It says research funding from the government is down by 43% since 2014/15, and its members say Scotland has lost much of the sizeable lead it held over the rest of the UK in attracting research funding.",
      "While the Scottish government proudly points to its provision of \u00a31.1bn for the sector, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted that the \u00a31,810 fee per student has not changed for 15 years.",
      "But that's far from all the money allocated. With block grants for tuition, the average being spent per student was calculated as \u00a37,530 this year.",
      "Using a different measure for inflation, the IFS says spending per student is down by 22% since 2013. Half of that reduction has been in the most recent three years, when costs have been rising most steeply.",
      "The IFS said that while the surplus of Scottish universities stood at 5.2% in 2022/23, it has concerns that finances are getting rapidly worse.",
      "How does that compare with elsewhere?",
      "Undergraduates in the rest of the UK are required to pay fees, often building up debt to do so.",
      "These are capped at \u00a39,250 per year for a typical three-year degree course - less for part-time students, more for accelerated courses.",
      "Students from the rest of the UK must pay an equivalent amount to study at Scottish universities, although the cost is usually spread over the four years of a Scottish degree.",
      "While the number of Scottish students is capped, there is no limit on the number of undergraduates from elsewhere. As a result, they became an important source of income for Scottish institutions.",
      "However, the growth in funding per student has not kept up with inflation. It has been increased only slightly from \u00a39,000 in 2012.",
      "The maximum annual fee is going up next year by nearly \u00a3300 to compensate universities for the higher cost of employer National Insurance contributions from next month, but there is no equivalent increase for Scottish students funded through Holyrood.",
      "Because England and Wales have more open competition to recruit students - and attract their fee income - there have been sharper divergences in financial fortunes than you'll see in Scotland, where the SFC allocates places to institutions.",
      "The more prestigious Russell Group of research-rich universities have gone after the students that would previously have gone to middle-ranking institutions, leaving the latter financially flailing.",
      "The vice-chancellors of English universities complain that fees fail to cover the cost of educating undergraduates. Yet the total they receive is around \u00a32,500 per student higher than the funding for Scottish-based students doing courses in Scotland.",
      "With these shortfalls in income compared with costs, there had to be a new stream of funding, and that's where foreign fees have become a vital part of the solution - and the problem.",
      "The overseas recruitment drive",
      "UK universities have been on a recruitment splurge to draw in students from other parts of the world, charging them much higher fees than UK students \u2013 from about \u00a310,000 up to \u00a340,000 per year.",
      "The number of European Union students fell by half as Britain left the EU, but the numbers from other countries have soared. The share of foreign students has risen from one in 20 in the 1990s to more than one in four.",
      "For those with a prestigious reputation, including Scotland's older universities, the share of foreign students has been closer to 40%.",
      "The most recent figures show there were about 750,000 international students studying in the UK in 2022/23 - with the number of new arrivals almost doubling in the space of five years.",
      "This has brought controversy - about the quality of learning, standards of English language ability, and the surge in demand for student accommodation.",
      "It has also brought vulnerability if the demand for places falls away.",
      "Growth in foreign fees swelled university income, and the increase was most marked as the pandemic ended, reaching a peak in 2022.",
      "It fell by 5% the following year, and is thought to have continued falling - quite steeply for some universities.",
      "The volatility of that income stream reflects many international factors.",
      "A growing concern about universities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, becoming too dependent on Chinese students saw recruitment shift to other countries.",
      "Chinese recruitment remains high, but has stopped growing, and post-grads are down.",
      "Nigeria was one new target, encouraged by the UK government.",
      "But the market there depends on the strength of the Nigerian currency, which fell sharply and cut off the number of people who could afford to come to the UK.",
      "Dundee was one of the universities hit hard by the falling numbers.",
      "Numbers were also affected by visa restrictions.",
      "In order to meet pressure to cut immigration numbers, the Conservative government increased the annual fee for using the NHS and made it more difficult for graduates to reach the pay threshold for a work visa after they graduate.",
      "It also restricted visas for students' family dependents.",
      "The biggest cash cow among foreign students has been in taught post-graduate degrees.",
      "These tend to be older students with families who won't come if there is a restriction on partners and families.",
      "Some international markets are sensitive to the signals sent out by the UK government, including India, where UK visa changes and reports of attacks on Indian students in British universities can make the front page of national newspapers.",
      "A further factor is that competition has been growing.",
      "The UK used to see its main competitors for English-language degrees as the US, Canada and Australia.",
      "That now extends to about 20 countries, including Ireland and Singapore and extending to polyglot Holland and Germany.",
      "What about spending?",
      "To increase capacity for teaching and studying for all those additional students, universities have had to increase spending.",
      "And with more foreign fee income, they have been investing in buildings and equipment as well as more staff.",
      "Ten years ago, Edinburgh University had 35,000 students and an income of \u00a3819m, with expenditure of \u00a3793m.",
      "In 2023/24, student numbers were nearing 50,000 and income was at \u00a31.43bn, with expenditure of \u00a31.3bn.",
      "That level of increased activity is harder to handle where there are so many moving parts to the income.",
      "It becomes impossible if financial planners fail to see the risk that the growth in foreign student fee income can stall and reverse, while they continue with expansion plans, prestigious new buildings and more debt.",
      "So what happens next?",
      "An external inquiry will be carried out at Dundee University, which is expected to highlight major management failures and a shonky IT system for student recruitment.",
      "Its interim principal, Prof Shane O'Neill, says the financial crisis has \"challenged us to ask some very fundamental questions about the size, shape, balance and structure of the university\".",
      "Dundee's response points to job losses and a narrowing of course options for students. Fewer modules will be offered, and that may also be the case elsewhere.",
      "Subjects that don't bring in enough income will be vulnerable.",
      "Language departments are a common target when cuts are needed. There's not much research or consultancy income, and there's competition from commercial software.",
      "The Scottish Funding Council faces deficits in the majority of the institutions it funds, and pressure from Holyrood ministers to make sure the pain is eased and that no institution is allowed to fail.",
      "But money is tight, and there are limited powers to intervene because these are autonomous institutions.",
      "Dundee University to cut 632 jobs to plug \u00a335m deficit",
      "Edinburgh University to seek \u00a3140m in savings",
      "Record foreign student numbers at Scottish universities",
      "Some see sense in mergers, cutting out the duplication of back office costs and the notoriously high salaries of principals.",
      "Others see shared services and teaching space as the way to go, with other universities, colleges and with other organisations such as the NHS.",
      "And there may be value in a crisis such as this.",
      "With a period of rapid growth now ended, one principal told me this is the time to reflect on what university is for: how to re-shape Scotland's universities towards the needs of the next 20 to 30 years, using artificial intelligence in learning and teaching.",
      "On funding, that principal warned said we need to move on from the simplistic \"fee or free\" argument over tuition costs in Scotland.",
      "What comes out of that reflection matters profoundly to Scotland, to its people and to its economy.",
      "In the various scenarios for Scotland's economic future, universities form the one sector where there is world-leading expertise and reputation.",
      "Scotland punches above its weight. But if it is to continue doing so, it will have to change."

    "story": [
      "British film critics have mostly panned Disney's live-action remake of Snow White, while US reviewers have been somewhat more positive.",
      "Chief film critic for The Times, Kevin Maher, said: \"Believe the anti-hype, it's that bad\", although Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called the film\"mostly captivating\".",
      "Its release has faced several issues throughout its production, from alleged disagreements between cast members, to debates over representation of the seven dwarfs, and the casting of Rachel Zegler in the lead role.",
      "Reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film, which will be released globally on Friday, an initial critics' score of just 47%.",
      "The mostly good",
      "US reviewer Rooney describes director Marc Webb's work a \"vibrant retelling\" with a \"smart script\" from Erin Cressida Wilson.",
      "But he isn't a fan of the way the film handles the seven dwarfs.",
      "The debate around the dwarves began in 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, who has has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\".",
      "Disney used computer-generated characters in the remake to \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\", but some other actors with dwarfism were concerned this decision would prevent them from getting work in the future.",
      "Rooney said: \"Although the talented voice cast gives the characters humour and distinctive personalities, their CGI renderings are a bit creepy, and less photorealistic than many of the cute woodland creatures that flock around Snow White.\"",
      "Pete Hammond wrote in Deadline that the film is \"just fine\", adding: \"It manages to make a thoroughly decent reboot from a genuine, never-out-of-circulation classic and make it fresh and relevant again for contemporary audiences.\"",
      "He added the musical film has \"dazzling dance numbers\" while the title character of Snow White \"is played to perfection by Rachel Zegler\".",
      "Variety's Owen Gleiberman called the film \"one of the better live-action adaptations of a Disney animated feature\".",
      "He felt that the CGI dwarfs \"bring the movie to life\", adding they have \"catchy personalities and comically expressive mottled-clay faces\".",
      "Gleiberman concluded the film is \"lighter, more frolicsome, less lead-footed than such clomping live-action Disney remakes as Alice in Wonderland and Beauty and the Beast\".",
      "Robbie Collins from The Telegraph gave the film a respectable three stars.",
      "\"Once Zegler scuttles off to the forest, where she teams up with two chirpy septets \u2013 the digitised dwarfs and a zany gaggle of bandits, who may have been dwarf replacements in an early draft \u2013 it really picks up,\" he said.",
      "He also described the performances of the songs Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work as \"stylishly choreographed and rousingly performed\".",
      "The not so good",
      "Most British publications haven't been so complimentary about the film, with the Daily Mail's Brian Viner giving the film two stars.",
      "\"Snow White the movie has its charms, and dozens of cute CGI forest animals, but on the whole it is a painfully muddle-headed affair,\" he says.",
      "He says Zegler \"has oodles of talent\" but \"Webb's film only intermittently allows her to sparkle\".",
      "Disney's decision to cast Zegler, a Latina actress, as a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\" prompted some controversy - it was part of a drive by Disney to cast a more diverse range of actors to play updated versions of some classic characters.",
      "Zegler also made headlines after she made critical comments about the original animated film.",
      "\"The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,\" Zegler said in 2022.",
      "\"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also said the original film was \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power\", adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Her relationship with co-star Gal Gadot has also been under scrutiny, with rumours that promotional work for the film was scaled back because of their opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.",
      "Zegler has used social media to post pro-Palestine material, whereas Israeli citizen Gadot served in her country's army for two years.",
      "However, others have said rumours of a rift are misguided, noting Gadot and Zegler have appeared publicly together on several occasions, including when they presented an award together at the Academy Awards.",
      "Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian gave the film one star, calling it an \"exhaustingly awful reboot\".",
      "He describes the costume design for Snow White as a \"supermarket-retail tweenie outfit with puffy-sleeved shoulders\", adding: \"Those otherwise estimable performers Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot (The Evil Queen) are forced to go through the motions, and they give the dullest performances of their lives\".",
      "The Times's Maher referenced the pared-down European premiere for the film, which took place at a castle in northern Spain last week, while the Los Angeles launch was held on Saturday without most of the usual ranks of press on the red carpet.",
      "He added: \"The new tunes, much like Zegler's performance, are watery and ineffectual, while the dramatic jeopardy is non-existent.",
      "\"It's hard not to see this as anything other than a crisis point for Disney, a studio that used to make flawless cinematic stories but now infantilises global audiences with sanctimonious life lessons culled from the corpses of their own murdered movies\".",
      "Tickets for the film, which reportedly cost more than $270m (\u00a3217m) to make, have only been put on presale in the last two weeks, relatively late for a big Disney film.",
      "Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent gave it one star, declaring that \"Rachel Zegler deserves better than the lazy, visually repellent Snow White\".",
      "\"What's most disheartening about it all is how predictable Disney's choices have become. With Snow White, they've finessed their formula \u2013 do the bare minimum to make a film, then simply slap a bunch of cutesy CGI animals all over it and hope no one notices,\" she concluded.",

      "Six years ago, Amber Clare was a devoted One Direction fan.",
      "Scrolling through Twitter for information about the band's solo projects, she saw a reply that said \"Listen to Icy by Itzy\".",

      "Based in Manchester, it started as a small business in Manchester's Affleck's Palace in 2019.",
      "\"You'd order things by PayPal, and then the CEO would pack them up by himself and ship everything out,\" Clare recalls.",
      "Now it's a two-storey emporium, based on Deansgate, with a staff of more than 20 dedicated K-Pop enthusiasts.",
      "It's a sign of how the genre has exploded in the UK, even though radio and television has largely shunned all but the biggest acts, like BTS, aespa and Blackpink.",
      "\"It's still kind of a niche - but it's not a small niche,\" says Clare. \"In my head I'm the only Itzy fan, but when I went to see them in concert, it was sold out.",
      "\"I was like, 'Wow, where have all you people been hiding?'\"",
      "In fact, the UK is now among the top 10 countries that follow K-Pop on Spotify, with the boyband Ateez placing two records in the top five of the UK album charts last year.",
      "This summer, Blackpink will play two nights at Wembley Stadium, with Stray Kids pulling off the same feat in Tottenham.",
      "Meanwhile, Twickenham Stadium will say \"anyong haseyo\" to one of K-pop's longest-running festivals.",
      "Established in 2008, the SM Town Live festival is a showcase for artists signed to the SM Entertainment Label, one of the industry's key players.",
      "To celebrate the company\u2019s 30th anniversary, they're transplanting the event from Seoul to Middlesex.",
      "\"It's essentially a multi-day festival all in one, because you've got so many artists all at the same venue, jam packed into the space of three or four hours,\" says Reese Carter, of boyband Dear Alice, who'll be among the performers in Twickenham.",
      "\"It's non-stop. You've got to prep yourself, because you'll definitely want to dance.\"",
      "\"It's very down to earth but it goes straight to your heart,\" adds Ten from K-Pop group WayV.",

      "SM holds a unique place in Korea's musical history. Founded in 1995 by Lee Soo-man, it is widely credited with establishing the K-Pop template.",
      "It was the first company to introduce the trainee system, where young talent goes through intensive training that lasts months, or even years, before making their \"debut\".",
      "And it dominated what's known as the \"first generation\" of K-Pop idols, with bands like H.O.T. and S.E.S.",
      "The Twickenham show will pay tribute to that three-decade journey, with a line-up that includes everyone from Red Velvet, EXO and Girl's Generation to current chart-toppers like aespa, Riize and all of the sub-units of boyband NCT - which boasts more than 20 members.",
      "\"That's very rare,\" says Ten, one of the group's most recognisable (and chatty) stars.",
      "\"The last time we had an NCT concert as a whole was two years ago. It's so difficult to schedule every group to be in the same spot at the same time.\"",
      "But that's not all. The concert will also feature what's been billed as \"a group of promising trainees\", known for now as SMTR25 \u2013 showcasing the future of the label.",
      "\"Performing alongside the senior artists we've admired since our trainee days, as well as our talented junior artists, makes this an incredibly meaningful experience for us,\" said aespa in an email to the BBC.",
      "The hope is that shows like this will open a few doors - because, for all the strides K-Pop has made in the last couple of years, bands have consistently prioritised America over Europe.",
      "It's a logical step. The US is the world's biggest music market, so it offers more opportunities for touring and merchandise sales, while an MTV Award performance or a concert for NPR's Tiny Desk series travels further internationally than an appearance at the Brit Awards.",
      "\"The situation here isn't as good as what the American industry gets,\" acknowledges Amber Clare.",
      "\"Every single K-Pop group, if they announce a world tour, America will always be on the map - but European countries are always left wondering if they're going to be included or not.\"",
      "Things are changing, though.",
      "In a crowded market, labels are increasingly turning their attention to the UK \u2013 where the anglophone media has international reach, and there's a baked-in affection for boy and girl groups like Take That, Spice Girls, Girls Aloud and Little Mix.",
      "To make inroads, bands have teamed up with some of Britain's biggest artists.",
      "Aespa's 2023 single Better Things was co-written by Raye, while Le Sserafim collaborated with PinkPantheress on club anthem Crazy and with Jungle on their latest song, Come Over.",
      "Last year, SM went one further \u2013 creating a British boyband and putting them through the K-Pop machinery.",
      "That group was Dear Alice, whose gruelling traineeship was documented in BBC series Made In Korea.",
      "Having survived the process, the five-piece finally premiered their debut single, Ariana, at a massive SM Town concert in Seoul in January.",
      "\"These shows are timed down to the second,\" says singer Blaise Noon. \"When we got our time to go on stage, it was literally like, 8:30 and 48 seconds. It just shows how so well thought out is.\"",
      "Bringing the production to London is evidence that SM has its sights trained on the UK, he confirms.",
      "\"In the UK, we produce some really amazing boy groups, so I think we have that connection in the culture. So I think they definitely want to hit it. I can see it getting bigger and bigger every day.\"",
      "Ten, who releases a new solo album, Stunner, next week, says he's already experienced the devotion of UK fans.",
      "When his group WayV last visited England in 2023, \"we were surprised that people could sing along to our songs, because we sing in Chinese\", he says.",
      "\"This opportunity with SM Town, I feel like it's going to open a bigger market for K-Pop in the UK.",
      "\"I hope so, because I'd like to come and perform my solo stuff to my UK fans too.\"",
      "The opportunity is there.",
      "Nine of the 10 best-selling albums in the world last year were by South Korean artists, illustrating the music's broad appeal - but none of those records charted in the UK\u2019s Top 50.",
      "Lack of radio exposure is one factor - but listeners can also be put off by clunky English lyrics or the sudden-but-deliberate stylistic shifts that characterise K-Pop.",
      "If you're willing to dig into the genre, though, you can find some of the most audacious and indelible hooks music has to offer.",
      "One by-product of K-pop\u2019s (relative) obscurity is the bond it creates among fans. There's a sense of belonging that comes from discovering and nurturing your \"bias\", outside the glare of the mainstream.",
      "It\u2019s a relationship bands foster by a fire hose stream of social media content, where dance challenges, video diaries and photoshoots are posted daily.",
      "Dear Alice experienced the impact of that effort at a UK meet-and-greet last weekend.",
      "\"It felt like we were hanging out with a bunch of our mates,\" says Dexter Greenwood.",
      "\"They were just cool people,\" adds James Sharp. \"We're starting to recognise faces and remember people on this journey - and I think there's going to be more and more.\"",

    "summary": "The theft of an oil sketch from a stately home in Northamptonshire remained a riddle for 70 years.",
    "story": [
      "An Exeter University art historian has solved the 70-year mystery over the theft of an original oil sketch, by Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck, from a stately home in Northamptonshire.",
      "The Portrait of Wolfgang Wilhelm of Pfalz-Neuburg was stolen in 1951 from Boughton House, the home of the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry.",
      "It was part of a collection - described as \"a puzzle missing a central piece\" - of 17th Century oil sketches that had been housed at the property since 1682.",
      "But the artwork's disappearance was only noted in 1957, when Mary Montagu Douglas Scott, Duchess of Buccleuch and Queensberry, visited one of Harvard University's galleries - and saw it on display.",
      "Now, thanks to an investigation by Dr Meredith Hale, senior lecturer in Art History and Visual Culture at the University of Exeter, the riddle of how the sketch made its way to the US via prominent members of the art world - including Christie's auction house in London - has been solved.",
      "Dr Hale noted how through \"new archival research in the UK, US and Canada\" she was able to \"reconstruct the painting's movements over three generations\".",
      "She said it \"passed through the hands of experts, conservators, auctioneers, dealers, and collectors from London to Toronto\".",
      "\"Not only do these sources reveal a dynamic picture of events as they unfold,\" she added, \"but they highlight the factors that contributed to the success of the theft, foremost among them the conceptual and material complexity of Van Dyck's iconography project - and the audacity of a thief cloaked in the respectability of expertise.\"",
      "The artwork has now been returned and the story of its journey has been chronicled in a new paper in the British Art Journal.",
      "Money for new curtains",
      "The thief, Dr Hale said, was Leonard Gerald Gwynne Ramsey, the editor of the journal The Connoisseur, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.",
      "Ramsey visited Boughton in July 1951 with a photographer in order to gather material for a piece for the journal's year book.",
      "Among the objects housed at the property for safekeeping during the war were the 37 wooden panels from Van Dyck's unfinished iconography project.",
      "Each panel featured an oil-painted sketch of a prominent prince, scholar, military leader or artist, and would have been used to create prints for sale.",
      "Correspondence between Ramsey and art historian Ludwig Goldscheider revealed that the former intended to sell two paintings because he needed the money to buy new curtains.",
      "According to the research, Goldscheider supplied a certificate of authentication and the picture was sold anonymously at Christie's for \u00a3189 in April 1954.",
      "Dr Hale traced the sale of the picture, less than a year later, to an art dealer in New York, before it moved on to a second dealer who sold it for $2,700 to Dr Lillian Malcove; who in turn donated it to the Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University.",
      "In her paper, Dr Hale chronicles terse correspondences between the museum's art director, Professor John Coolidge, and Ramsey once concerns had been raised by the duchess.",
      "Ramsey, it shows, claimed he'd bought the picture from a market in Hemel Hempstead, and he also attempted to cast doubt on the authenticity of the picture.",
      "With doubts growing, the museum returned the picture to Dr Malcove in 1960, and after she died in 1981, it was donated to the Art Museum of the University of Toronto.",
      "Dr Hale said the findings have helped to \"resolve the question of whether this was the picture stolen from Boughton\".",
      "It resulted in the executive committee of the University of Toronto voting to return it to the Duke of Buccleuch, 73 years after it was stolen.",
      "\"Without this painting, the Boughton oil sketches were like a puzzle that's missing a central piece,\" said Dr Hale.",
      "\"Its return has now restored the integrity of the group.\"",

      "The firm has blamed its financial troubles on a legal battle with its former partner Warner Bros (WB) and a \"failed and costly endeavour\" into the production of independent films and television series.",
      "In a bid to mitigate some of its financial problems, Village Roadshow is proposing to sell its extensive film library for $365m (\u00a3281m).",

      "\"The WB arbitration has caused the company to incur more than $18m in legal fees, nearly all of which remain unpaid\", chief restructuring officer Keith Maib said in a court filing.",
      "That legal battle, according to Mr Maib, has \"irreparably decimated the working relationship\" between the two companies, ultimately ending \"the most lucrative nexus\" for Village Roadshow's historic success.",
      "The other issue faced by Village Roadshow was a costly studio business launched in 2018. None of the films or television series independently produced as part of that endeavour delivered any profits.",
      "Like other film companies in the US, Village Roadshow also struggled with a slump in demand from the pandemic and the disruption from the strike action by Hollywood actors and writers, which started in May 2023.",
      "In December, the Writers Guild of America banned its members from working with Village Roadshow over the company's alleged failure to pay its contributors."

    "story": [
      "In the early hours of 14 September 2019, Eleanor Paice jolted awake to the sound of smashing glass.",
      "Living in a staff flat above Blenheim Palace, the guest services supervisor was used to strange noises. But when fire alarms began to blare, she knew something was wrong.",
      "She quickly began evacuating to the great courtyard. But unbeknown to her, she was running straight into the final moments of an audacious heist.",
      "Five men had smashed their way into the palace, ripped out a \u00a34.8m solid gold toilet and fled in a stolen Volkswagen Golf.",
      "The working loo, entitled America, had been on display for just two days at the 18th Century stately home, plumbed in as part of an exhibition by the Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan.",
      "Now, more than five years on, a total of three men have been convicted in connection to the heist.",
      "James Sheen, 40, from Oxford, pleaded guilty to burglary and transferring criminal property in 2024, while Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, was found guilty of burglary at Oxford Crown Court on Tuesday.",
      "Fred Doe, 36, from Windsor, was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property. Bora Guccuk, 41, from west London, was cleared of the same charge.",
      "It was a crime that intrigued art lovers, delighted the press and coined countless potty-themed puns.",
      "Now, the BBC has gained exclusive behind-the-scenes access to staff at Blenheim Palace to understand the heist and security failures from their perspective.",
      "'We've been hit'",
      "It was the night before, Blenheim chief executive Dominic Hare was at a glamorous exhibition launch party being held at the palace, hosted by Cattelan himself.",
      "It was America's first time on display outside of New York and the artwork's presence was creating a buzz.",
      "He remembers slipping away from the festivities, hoping for a turn on the fully usable toilet. But when confronted with a line, he told himself \"that's okay, there's no point queuing. You can come back tomorrow and have a look\".",
      "But just a few hours later, his colleague Ms Paice was witnessing the final moments as the 98kg (216lbs) artwork was being heaved into a boot.",
      "She recalls a confusing and fast-moving scene: \"It was just shadows and quick movement. I just saw them move towards the car, get in the car\u2026.and then the car just sped straight off.\"",

      "\"That was when... I felt my stomach drop,\" Ms Paice says. \"And I thought, this is big.\"",
      "Soon, the chief executive's phone was buzzing him awake: \"Dom, we've been hit.\"",
      "He said it took him a few moments to realise he was not dreaming before rushing to the palace.",
      "His relief that staff were unharmed then mingled with the horror of a flooded, shattered crime scene.",
      "\"If the golden toilet in situ had looked beautiful and perfect and majestic and untainted, this was the total opposite,\" Mr Hare said. \"This was brutalised, smashed up. This is a palace. Palaces don't get smashed up\".",
      "When the palace reopened a day later, the controversy was addressed with a theatrical flourish.",
      "Staff re-strung police tape across the shattered cubicle, just metres from the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill, and exhibited the crime scene as part of the now toilet-less Cattelan show.",
      "Mr Hare said despite his embarrassment, his anger had prompted him to keep it visible but he also realised it could be a draw to the public.",
      "It worked. In the following days Ms Paice said the palace was \"slammed\", with hordes wanting to glimpse the destruction.",
      "\"People were more interested to see where the golden toilet had been stolen from than to come and see the golden toilet itself,\" she added.",
      "Security failures",
      "Palace staff say they did see the humour in how the press and public approached the crime, but they were still deeply rattled by the raid.",
      "Ms Paice said Blenheim, a safe and secure home for her, did not feel \"settled in the same way\" for a long time.",
      "\"There was always this anxiousness. If that's happened, anything could happen,\" she said.",
      "Mr Hare said he felt both emotional and grateful no-one was harmed, calling the burglars the \"most dangerous people who'd ever visited Blenheim Palace\".",
      "\"That toilet survived New York City. And if it survived New York City, it should have survived Blenheim Palace,\" says Christopher Marinello, an art recovery lawyer brought in by insurers to look at the case.",
      "In his view, Blenheim's security \"failed miserably\".",
      "What is strikingly clear from interviews with palace staff, the 18-carat gold toilet had not been deemed a security risk.",
      "A month before the burglary, Edward Spencer-Churchill, the founder of the Blenheim Art Foundation, told the Sunday Times: \"It's not going to be the easiest thing to nick.",
      "\"Firstly, it's plumbed in and secondly, a potential thief will have no idea who last used the toilet or what they ate. So no, I don't plan to be guarding it.\"",
      "Mr Hare said they were \"far more worried\" about other controversial artworks in the exhibition - a statue of a meteor-struck pope, union flags the public walked on and a statue of a praying Adolf Hitler.",
      "He admitted the toilet's status as a quirky art object had eclipsed the fact it was worth \u00a32.8m in gold alone.",
      "It was left unguarded during closing hours, with no CCTV monitoring the cubicle door.",
      "But the gang exploited other security flaws that night, including no patrols and easily breached gates.",
      "Even after the raid, staff did not immediately realise the toilet had been the target.",
      "Ms Paice says she fleetingly imagined they had come for Churchill's childhood lock of hair, which the palace displays.",
      "'Not vulnerable anymore'",
      "In the weeks that followed, Mr Hare was motivated to overhaul security at top speed.",
      "He took full responsibility for the failures that night.",
      "\"It's not a democratic decision that we had a certain level of security, it was really mine. In that sense I made Blenheim vulnerable. And we are not vulnerable anymore,\" he said.",
      "The palace has seen its security overhauled with a \"very significant upgrade\", while it has also been a wake-up call for other stately homes.",
      "The stolen gold has never been recovered but the story will live on as a quirky footnote in the history of one of Britain's most popular palaces.",
      "\"There's big and serious history here, wars which changed the course of history on a continent. Put it against that, it's small fry,\" Mr Hare remarked.",
      "\"[But] in the histories of the normal people of Blenheim, the people who've lived here and breathed life into this place, it was a very threatening moment.",

      "\"A lot of times I would be surprised at what would upset Miles, what would make him a little angry. I didn't always know. He was not always easy to figure out, so I got used to that slight discomfort,\" he says grinning.",
      "\"That's life. But I was always looking to learn from those discomforts.\"",
      "And when he embarks on his European tour this summer, which includes three UK dates at London's Barbican, Hancock will be thinking about another lesson he learnt from Davis - this one about the make-up of his audience.",
      "He adopts a low, deep whispering voice and does a full-on Miles Davis impression, recreating the conversation from the mid 1960s, when the trumpeter gave him a stern warning: \"If all you see are dudes in the audience, that means your music is dead.\"",
      "Herbie Hancock is pretending to be Miles Davis to an audience of me. It is a glorious moment.",
      "\"He used more expletives than I just did,\" Hancock chortles. \"But you get the idea,\" clearly enjoying his mimicry as much as I did.",
      "Hancock has been playing the piano for almost 80 years, but the instrument still gives him so much joy, that on occasion, during a session on the keys, he finds himself sobbing.",
      "\"If I've solved some kind of problem that I've had with the tune and made some kind of discovery that surpassed my expectations, I've been known to cry, to have tears coming down my face.\"",
      "I ask what kind of problem leaves him reaching for Herbie hankies.",
      "\"It's difficult to explain,\" he responds, \"But, trying to make something work out, where there's no easy answer. Where, 'this is not supposed to work', but 'how can I make it work?'\"",
      "It feels like we have been invited inside Hancock's brain and are seeing the cogs turn. At speed.",
      "He continues: \"There may be something that I want to connect, but all the ways I know of connecting them are not the solution. And I have to find some other means.",
      "\"And sometimes that [means] can come from looking at it in a different way. And not necessarily through music.\"",
      "This answer goes a long way to explaining the difference between someone who is a musical genius and someone who is not.",
      "Hancock went to college to study electrical engineering, so it is no surprise that he has taken a huge interest in the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "He believes our fears about the technology are overblown, and says he prefers to \"embrace it\". Hancock acknowledges concerns that AI lacks an ethical framework but asks: \"Who are the worst examples of understanding ethics and being able to live a life with ethics? We, human beings, we're the worst, right?\"",
      "He is on a roll now.",
      "\"I have this feeling that AI is going to help us all understand and get closer to becoming more ethically responsible people that are helping each other, instead of hurting or killing each other. Helping the planet instead of killing the planet with environmental issues.\"",
      "And the man who once released an album called Future Shock, has some simple advice for us all.",
      "\"When I'm using ChatGPT or Siri on my iPhone, I always say thank you and they usually say, 'You're welcome.'\"",
      "\"I try to treat AI like it's human and it actually manifests itself in an extremely positive way and that makes me feel better.\"",
      "At the age of 84, Herbie Hancock is still determined to try and future-proof himself, by getting the robots on his side.",
      "Finally, I ask him a question on behalf of parents all round the world. My 11-year-old Charlie loves playing the piano, but hates practising. What advice would he give anyone in that situation?",
      "He nods.",
      "\"I understand your pain. I don't like practising either.\"",
      "Hancock, pauses and thinks before adding: \"But you know, I look at it as, 'OK, this is something, even if I don't want to do it, I need to do it.' And once I get into it, then I feel like I've conquered an obstacle in my life.\"",
      "He pauses again, before concluding: \"I don't always win that battle, but I've gotten to this point. So I guess I didn't lose a lot of battles.\"",
      "And has he practised today?",
      "\"No. I didn't today. And I probably won't.\"",
      "Once again he laughs, and with that he departs, ready for the rest of the day and to watch some more YouTube.",
      "Herbie Hancock will be presented with the Polar Music Prize  in Stockholm, Sweden on 27 May 2025."

    "summary": "The Electric State, starring Millie Bobby Brown, follows a trend of Netflix making star-packed movies that are panned by critics - but reach huge audiences.",
    "story": [
      "Netflix's latest big-budget film The Electric State, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, is one of the most expensive movies ever made, and had some of the most scathing reviews in recent memory. But that doesn't mean it will flop.",
      "Film critics haven't minced their words when delivering their verdicts on The Electric State.",
      "It is \"a turgid eyesore\" and \"top-dollar tedium\", according to the Times. It's \"slick but dismally soulless\", declared the Hollywood Reporter, while the New York Times called it  \"obvious, garish and just plain dumb\".",
      "Paste pointed out its eye-watering budget, billing it as \"the most banal way you can spend $320m\". Warming to the theme, the magazine summed it up as \"one hell of an artistically neutered, sanitized boondoggle\".",
      "There have been some kinder reviews. Empire said it was \"breezily watchable\" and worth three stars, while the Telegraph awarded four stars to the \"Spielbergian treat\".",
      "But overall, its 15% Rotten Tomatoes score is a meagre return for any major film, especially one costing such a lot. The $320m (\u00a3247m) figure has been widely reported but neither confirmed nor denied by Netflix. It would make The Electric State the most expensive streaming film ever.",
      "Critics' opinions, however, have become more irrelevant in the streaming age. The bad reviews didn't stop The Electric State from going straight to number one on Netflix's chart after its release on Friday.",
      "It fits into Netflix making star-packed, entertaining and escapist movies that often get panned by reviewers - but are watched by hundreds of millions of subscribers.",
      "\"I would love to say that what I've written and what other critics have written will matter, but I just don't think it will,\" says Digital Spy movies editor Ian Sandwell.",
      "Sandwell awarded the film two stars out of five, noting that the action and visual effects are \"decent\", the robots are \"impressive\" and the finale is \"epic\".",
      "\"My main problem was they'd created this really impressive, visually spectacular world and then just told quite a generic seen-it-all-before story inside it,\" he says.",
      "Bad reviews might have put people off paying to see the film if it had been released in cinemas, he says. \"But on Netflix, I think it will still be absolutely massive. I don't think bad reviews will matter at all.\"",
      "While a critic's job is to analyse a movie, \"audiences probably do just want a big, spectacular blockbuster to watch at home, with two massive stars\", he adds.",
      "The Electric State follows Brown, Pratt and a succession of zany robots in an alternative version of 1990s America, where there has been a war between humans and intelligent bots.",
      "It also stars Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci and the voices of Woody Harrelson and Brian Cox, and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who have made four Marvel movies, including the wildly successful Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.",
      "The Electric State is based on the graphic novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, although some critics pointed out that Netflix had missed the book's point about the perils of a consumerist society addicted to technology.",
      "The film is \"absolutely not\" value for money in terms of quality, says City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford.",
      "And it remains to be seen whether the film makes financial sense for Netflix, she says.",
      "The streaming giant's most popular ever film, 2021's Red Notice, has had 231 million views, according to Netflix's measurements.",
      "\"The Electric State will be hoping for that kind of performance, just as a $320m theatrically released movie would be aiming to break box office records,\" Luxford says.",
      "\"The higher the price, the higher the target for success, even with a business model as opaque as Netflix's.\"",
      "Red Notice, an action-packed art crime caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, has a lukewarm 39% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes - but a 92% audience rating.",
      "Other recent Netflix hits have been lapped up by viewers more than reviewers.",
      "Brooke Shields' lightweight multi-generational rom-com Mother of the Bride has a 13% critics' score, Jennifer Lopez's AI action thriller Atlas is on 19%, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx's family spy escapade Back In Action has 29%, and Kevin Hart's heist comedy Lift is on 30%.",
      "They are enjoyable but forgettable - and easy to watch in the midst of potential distractions at home. The Hollywood Reporter described Atlas as \"another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry\" - summing up this new genre.",
      "In December, N+1 magazine quoted several screenwriters as saying a common request from Netflix executives is for characters to announce what they're doing \"so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along\".",
      "\"Electric State does feel like that,\" Sandwell continues, \"where there are just random big dumps of the characters explaining exactly what's happened, sometimes something we've seen recently, just in case you're not following along.",
      "\"But it does depend on the movie.\"",
      "Netflix does have serious and critically-acclaimed movies, too, of course, but they are often not such crowd-pleasers. Emilia Perez, which led this year's Oscar nominations, has not troubled the Netflix global top 10 charts.",
      "Another critic, Gav Squires, says many of Netflix's films are \"very average\", but don't usually have such astronomical budgets as The Electric State.",
      "\"Netflix know what they're doing,\" he says. \"They know that people are probably watching on a second screen, they're not paying full attention. So when they're putting stuff out that costs $30m that people aren't really watching and is kind of average, I'm not too fussed about it.",
      "\"But when they're spending $320m on a movie, I start getting really angry. $320m would have paid the budgets for the last, I think, 10 best picture Oscar winners.",

      "Clueless has been brought to the stage by the film's original writer and director Amy Heckerling - who says keeping the 90s theme was integral to the show.",
      "Heckerling insists she has \"no interest in being modern\" - which will come as a relief to the audiences who grew up quoting \"As if!\" and aspiring to Cher's plaid and Prada-filled wardrobe.",
      "The story follows the life of the na\u00efve and lovably spoiled teenager, who plays matchmaker with her friends before ultimately finding love herself.",
      "An adaption of Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless captured the teen spirit of the 90s and inspired countless school dramas like Mean Girls, Gossip Girl and Legally Blonde.",
      "The stage version has songs in the form of an original score by singer-songwriter KT Tunstall.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Tunstall says the film was \"omnipotent\" in the 90s and influenced everything from the clothes people wore to the music people listened to.",
      "The Scottish singer, best known for songs like Black Horse and the Cherry Tree and Suddenly I See, says working on the show was a \"dream project\".",
      "She says the original soundtrack was a big inspiration, and describes the music as \"a mixtape of all your favourite 90s bangers\".",
      "The process of creating the soundtrack for Clueless: The Musical was intense for Tunstall, who says it's no easy feat to add music to an adaptation of a film that didn't originally have it.",
      "\"You really have to think about whether a song fits the structure and flow of the story and whether it actually helps the audience understand the narrative better,\" she says.",
      "Heckerling says she actually wishes the film had been a musical because \"there were natural moments in the script where characters could have sung\".",
      "\"Those types of films weren't very common in the 90s but I'm glad we could add in music now,\" she says.",
      "Critics had mixed thoughts about the new songs - the Guardian called them \"disappointingly flat-footed\" in a two-star review and said the lyrics \"too often serve as exposition rather than raising the emotional drama\".",
      "Similarly, the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish wrote that the show has \"numbers designed to sound in keeping with the period but which are so generic they don't ring with real-world authenticity\".",
      "But What'sOnStage praised Tunstall's \"infuriatingly catchy tunes\" and Glenn Slater's \"nifty, witty lyrics\".",
      "For Emma Flynn, who is making her West End debut as Cher, the music has another important function in the show - it allows characters to easily share their inner thoughts with the audience.",
      "\"In the film you hear these really funny inner monologues of Cher, but the great thing about this show is you can hear all of the character's thoughts, which makes you feel more connected to them.\"",
      "Flynn has been praised by critics, with the Evening Standard noting her \"powerfully-sung breakout performance\" and describing it as channelling \"both Alicia Silverstone in the original movie and Sabrina Carpenter today, while making the role entirely her own\".",
      "Co-star Keelan McAuley, who plays nerdy Josh, tells the BBC he loves the play's nostalgia factor.",
      "\"The flip phone was the most advanced technology they had in the 90s and there's something so enchanting about a time where there was no access to social media,\" he says.",
      "Nostalgia fest",
      "The show stays almost entirely true to the 1995 film, with everyone sporting the latest 90s fashions, carrying a glitzy pager, and listening to angsty teen bangers on a Walkman.",
      "While it may feel like a nostalgia fest, Heckerling admits she doesn't \"like to stick to real life\", and even her sunny film was far from the reality of what the 90s were like for most teenagers in LA, with race riots and other political problems.",
      "The Independent's three-star review says the show \"sticks to the original movie like chewing gum to the underside of a school desk\" at first, but changes tack by the second half.",
      "\"[Director Rachel] Kavanaugh and Heckerling gain the confidence to part ways a bit from the movie's script, and to let the story's heart show,\" Alice Saville wrote.",
      "For Tunstall, what sets Clueless apart from traditional rom-coms and high school dramas is that there isn't a typical villain and there's no nastiness or bad intentions from the main characters.",
      "Jane Austen famously thought her main character wouldn't be a widely liked heroine, but Tunstall says she is often people's favourite character because of her honesty and depth.",
      "\"People can relate to her on a deeper level, like how she is trying to process the death of her mother and help keep her family in order.",

      "\"[Vitale] is a very solid designer, he's very steady, very creative and has been key in building Miu Miu, so I'm sure she has had her input in this,\" Zargani added.",

      "\"There's a lot of turmoil in the luxury industry at large, and she may have decided it was time for a change,\" she told the World Service's Newshour.",
      "Friedman called her replacement \"a very talented designer\", adding: \"He's been working behind the scenes at Miu Miu for two years and it has been the single hottest brand in fashion over that time period.\"",
      "Vitale has helped steer the brand to record profits, which she said was \"mind boggling\" when \"every other brand in the fashion world has declined during that period\".",
      "Versace herself can be proud of how she has successfully transformed from her brother's muse to a fashion powerhouse, Friedman added.",

      "The inquiry commissioned an expert report from Prof Albert Sanchez-Graells, a professor of law at the University of Bristol, which was critical of the approach and found no evidence of similar prioritisation in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, or  other countries around the world.",
      "\"It's fine having academics write papers about this stuff\u2026 but you've got to understand what it was like [at the time],\" said Hancock.",
      "\"The pressure to save lives was intense, but so was the reality that high-quality offers would be sent through to senior decision-makers, and you had to have a process for dealing with that.\"",
      "He said that other countries would have had their own systems for prioritising offers for PPE and medical equipment in different ways.",
      "Hancock was later asked about a \u00a330m contract awarded to a firm run by Alex Bourne, who owned a pub in his West Suffolk constituency, to make vials for Covid testing.",
      "Emails show Hancock passed on communications from Mr Bourne to the then health minister Lord Bethell, describing his analysis of the wider testing system as a \"very interesting critique\" from a \"very impressive guy\".",
      "In questioning, Hancock said he acted with \"impeccable behaviour\" at the time, and accused the inquiry's chief counsel Richard Wald KC of cherry-picking a \"couple of messages\" that have the \"most tabloid interest\".",
      "He said the inquiry had followed a \"wholly naive\" line of questioning by ignoring the reality of the situation at the time, while making \"terribly pejorative\" statements that were \"totally inappropriate\".",
      "At the conclusion of his evidence, Baroness Hallett told Hancock that he \"was not the first and I'm sure won't be the last witness to think the inquiry is all about criticising people\".",

      "Sheriff Principal Aisha Anwar KC made 11 recommendations for the future,  including creating a \"trigger list\" to identify and assess early labour symptoms.",
      "Among these are reviewing electronic patient information records to improve alerts for at risk mothers, and having a direct telephone line to each maternity unit in Scotland for ambulance crews.",
      "In a statement, the McCormick family said: \"The family could simply never have imagined the scale of both the individual and systems failures that came to light during the inquiry.",
      "\"What seemed to be flaws with the electronic system of record keeping actually turned out to be a catalogue of errors with numerous opportunities to avoid the tragic outcome that followed.",
      "\"It was extremely difficult for the family to hear the evidence and reading the determination is bittersweet in terms of achieving some sense of closure but also learning once again how different things ought to have been.\"",
      "The family added they hoped all the inquiry's recommendations would be implemented.",
      "The family of Leo Lamont said they hoped \"lessons are learnt\" from the deaths, and thanked Sheriff Principal Anwar for the \"sensitive manner\" in which she conducted the inquiry.",
      "Leo Lamont died on 15 February 2019 at University Hospital, Monklands, just two hours after birth.",
      "His family called the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital in Glasgow because mum Nadine Rooney was experiencing \"agony back pains\" \u2013 but the midwife triaging the call didn't spot it as a sign of preterm labour for her at 27 weeks.",
      "This was despite Ms Rooney being considered a high risk pregnancy, having previously given birth to a preterm baby and being a smoker.",
      "She was instead advised to take painkillers, and gave birth less than two hours later on her bathroom floor at home.",
      "By the time an ambulance crew arrived her son was blue in colour - known as cyanosed - and struggling to breathe.",
      "He was later pronounced dead at University Hospital, and Sheriff Anwar found that had Ms Rooney been told to go to hospital the death could have been avoided.",
      "Told to take painkillers",
      "Ellie McCormick was considered a high risk pregnancy due to her mother Nicola having a high BMI.",
      "She previously reported bleeding and reduced foetal movement but after examination her observations were considered to be within normal limits.",
      "On 4 March 2019 she called Wishaw General Hospital to report that she was experiencing contractions, and was told to take painkillers and call back later if she continued to have problems.",
      "Ms McCormick called back that evening at about 19:30 and was told to go to the hospital, where an emergency caesarean was carried out.",
      "However, Ellie McCormick had been deprived of oxygen and died in the early hours of 5 March, about five hours after birth.",
      "Experts agreed that had Ms McCormick been advised to come in at the time of her first call on 4 March Ellie would have likely survived.",

      "Paramedics who attended the scene then made further calls for assistance, including five calls to Wishaw General that went unanswered.",

      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told BBC Panorama Covid had led to a \"serious and profound shift\" in attitudes to attendance. She said lockdowns had cast \"a long shadow\" over the life chances of the youngest children.",
      "The latest statistics for persistent absence show 15% of primary children in England have missed at least one in ten days of school this school year - up from about 8% before Covid.",
      "It comes as the gap between the poorest students and other pupils had mainly narrowed before the pandemic, following years of effort by schools.",
      "However, the report suggests it is getting worse. The gap - which is measured using GCSE results - would reduce from 19 months to 15 months of learning if school attendance was the same for all pupils, it says.",
      "Natalie Perera, from the EPI, said it is the first time \"a very clear link\" has been made between how much children from the lowest income families attend school, and how far behind other pupils they have fallen.",
      "Her team looked specifically at children who have received free school meals in the past six years, which means the family income is less than \u00a37,400 a year after tax and not including benefits.",
      "Ms Perera said more research was needed to understand why these children struggled to be in school, with possible factors including poor housing and mental health.",
      "It is five years since the UK went into lockdown, when schools closed to most children.",
      "Playgroups and nurseries also shut, with parents of babies and toddlers isolated from their extended family. There were other changes too, as health visitors were re-deployed or in contact with parents only online.",
      "Panorama has heard from families and teachers about the impact on these children, who are just starting or are still in primary school.",
      "Schools say some have delayed speech and understanding of words, or have slower social or emotional development, or they lack basic skills normally picked up through play.",
      "Professor Catherine Davies, from the University of Leeds, says some children missed out on \"fundamental skills\" they need to make sense of school and get on with wider groups.",
      "At Queen's Drive Primary School, in Preston, teaching assistant Sarah Barraclough has been trained in a national programme to help four and five-year-olds in England with speech and language.",
      "She says the impact of Covid has been \"huge\" and if they don't learn to say and understand more words, children then become isolated. \"You're lonely and not getting involved in the games in the playground,\" she says.",

      "\"There will no longer be a separate vehicle that can be pointed [at] to say that's what got it wrong,\" Richard Meddings told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, in the first interview with a senior official from the organisation since it was announced it would be abolished.",
      "Earlier this week the government confirmed the administrative body would be swallowed up by the Department of Health and Social Care. It will not affect patient care in hospitals, GP practices, and other health organisations but it will change how the NHS is run.",
      "Mr Meddings, who is due to step down at the end of this month, acknowledged that ministers wanted to be involved in the running of the NHS, but argued there had been a subtle form of micromanagement.",

      "He also defended the idea of quangos \u2013 the term used to describe publicly funded organisations at arm's length from the government. \"I've worked with six secretaries of state and complete changes of ministers. So there is an argument for a construct that would separate the delivery vehicle from government.\"",
      "The advantage, he said, is that \"it brings in a steady engagement from relevant expertise on a particular topic. And the difference from the political world is.... they don't all necessarily come with relevant experience to run and oversee those areas\".",
      "And he argued that NHS organisational changes can't do much to change the underlying health of the population: \"The NHS deals with whoever or whatever comes through the gates in whatever condition. And many of the conditions of poor health are driven by factors outside the NHS.\"",

      "The organisation, said the source, had become a bureaucracy that was \"intellectually stagnant\" and that its position interacting with both the health service and ministers \"wasn't right\".",
      "Ministers have argued that cutting around 9,000 jobs with the shift of NHS England into the Department of Health would free up resources for frontline services, perhaps as much as \u00a3500 million a year. Having two organisations often duplicating work, they say, led to wasted time and needless costs.",
      "But one NHS source noted that the government claimed credit for the fall in the overall waiting list for planned treatment since the election and a two million year-on-year increase in the number of appointments and operations \u2013 performance delivered on NHS England's watch.",
      "The same source pointed out that \"with decrepit hospital buildings a new leadership structure won't make it any easier to carry out operations and care for patients\".",
      "These are huge structural changes for the leadership of the NHS and health administration in England. But they will take time to implement.",
      "Moving two large organisations into one and implementing 9,000 redundancies will take up a lot of management time and there are warnings of possible distraction from the day to day running of services. Patients won't see much difference for a while yet.",

      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging job seekers allowance and employment seekers allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",

      "Pip is now the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending expected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",

      "The drug, abiraterone, has been available in Scotland and Wales for two years for high-risk patients whose cancer has not yet spread, but not in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "In a letter to Prostate Cancer UK, seen by the BBC, Health Minister Karin Smyth said the decision by NHS England, following a lengthy review, was \"based on overall affordability\" and that \"it would not be appropriate to intervene\".",
      "The government said urgent advice had been requested on the issue.",
      "The charity said it was a \"dire and urgent situation in England\" with \"a bureaucratic blockage denying men this treatment\".",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We understand the frustration and upset of some patients who cannot access this potentially life-saving treatment. Ministers have requested urgent advice on the issue.\"",
      "Although not a cure, abiraterone can help stop prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body.",
      "In England and Northern Ireland, the drug is only approved for men with very advanced prostate cancer which has spread already.",
      "In Wales and Scotland, people with the disease that has not yet spread can also get it.",
      "Research has shown that for these earlier stage patients, the survival rate after six years is improved and that the drug halved the rate of progression of the cancer.",
      "The charity says many lives could be extended by the drug, given the findings from a trial called Stampede, published in 2022.",
      "It found improved odds of survival among men given the drug alongside usual care, and concluded that abiraterone should be considered a new standard treatment.",
      "According to figures from NHS England, each year about 8,400 patients have high-risk prostate cancer that has not yet spread.",
      "Using the Stampede assumptions, 672 of those men could die prematurely without access to abiraterone.",
      "In October 2023, BBC News spoke to Giles Turner, a retired banker living in Sussex. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier that year but was told that abiraterone could not be obtained on the NHS in England.",
      "He chose to pay for treatment with the drug at \u00a3250 a month. He told us then that he felt \"very fortunate\" to be able to afford it, but outraged for others who could not.",
      "At the time, NHS England said it was reviewing the drug's use for a wider range of men.",
      "However, in December 2024 it told Prostate Cancer UK that \"it has not been possible to identify the necessary recurrent headroom in revenue budgets\".",
      "Because abiraterone is a generic drug which has gone \"off patent\" and is licensed for only one group of prostate cancer patients, there is a complicated process to get it approved for wider use.",
      "Each year, NHS England can make \"discretionary\" investment decisions with a specialist advisory group, but it has chosen not to for this drug.",
      "Smyth's letter earlier this month said the process had to look at \"the overall budget impact of introducing a new treatment based on patient volumes\", and ministers would not intervene.",
      "Mr Turner said he was \"stunned\" that nearly one-and-a-half years after the BBC report, NHS England had not caught up with NHS Scotland and NHS Wales.",
      "He has spent \u00a320,000 so far on his treatment, and said he felt it was wrong that while expensive new patented drugs treatments could be funded, abiraterone - costing the NHS \u00a377 per pack per month - could not be."

    "story": [
      "The chair of NHS England has said he does not disagree with the abolishing of the organisation - although he warns that the buck will now stop with ministers.",
      "\"There will no longer be a separate vehicle that can be pointed [at] to say that's what got it wrong,\" Richard Meddings told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, in the first interview with a senior official from the organisation since it was announced it would be abolished.",
      "Earlier this week the government confirmed the administrative body would be swallowed up by the Department of Health and Social Care. It will not affect patient care in hospitals, GP practices, and other health organisations but it will change how the NHS is run.",
      "Mr Meddings, who is due to step down at the end of this month, acknowledged that ministers wanted to be involved in the running of the NHS, but argued there had been a subtle form of micromanagement.",
      "\"At times, some weeks, almost 20 new instructions, commissions coming from government and ministers into the system,\" he said.",
      "Streeting admits 'risk of disruption' in NHS overhaul",
      "He also defended the idea of quangos \u2013 the term used to describe publicly funded organisations at arm's length from the government. \"I've worked with six secretaries of state and complete changes of ministers. So there is an argument for a construct that would separate the delivery vehicle from government.\"",
      "The advantage, he said, is that \"it brings in a steady engagement from relevant expertise on a particular topic. And the difference from the political world is.... they don't all necessarily come with relevant experience to run and oversee those areas\".",
      "And he argued that NHS organisational changes can't do much to change the underlying health of the population: \"The NHS deals with whoever or whatever comes through the gates in whatever condition. And many of the conditions of poor health are driven by factors outside the NHS.\"",
      "As Mr Meddings was setting out the case for the defence, the debate about the shake-up rages on.",
      "One well-placed source argued that NHS England's leaders had the chance just after the election to re-set the relationship with government but failed to do so as \"there had been too much suspicion of politicians\".",
      "The organisation, said the source, had become a bureaucracy that was \"intellectually stagnant\" and that its position interacting with both the health service and ministers \"wasn't right\".",
      "Ministers have argued that cutting around 9,000 jobs with the shift of NHS England into the Department of Health would free up resources for frontline services, perhaps as much as \u00a3500 million a year. Having two organisations often duplicating work, they say, led to wasted time and needless costs.",
      "But one NHS source noted that the government claimed credit for the fall in the overall waiting list for planned treatment since the election and a two million year-on-year increase in the number of appointments and operations \u2013 performance delivered on NHS England's watch.",
      "The same source pointed out that \"with decrepit hospital buildings a new leadership structure won't make it any easier to carry out operations and care for patients\".",
      "These are huge structural changes for the leadership of the NHS and health administration in England. But they will take time to implement.",
      "Moving two large organisations into one and implementing 9,000 redundancies will take up a lot of management time and there are warnings of possible distraction from the day to day running of services. Patients won't see much difference for a while yet.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:06:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The debate has sparked a wider dilemma about the broader purpose of welfare",
    "story": [
      "In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.",
      "Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.",
      "The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.",
      "At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.",
      "Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.",
      "The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.",
      "In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.",
      "Mapping welfare trends",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",
      "The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change.",
      "Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary.",
      "Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts.",
      "That's because all of this is in the context of what \"fiscal headroom\" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending.",
      "But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. \"We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,\" a source told me.",
      "\"Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous.\"",
      "Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work.",
      "And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs.",
      "That's why it's no exaggeration to say this month's explosive row about welfare will come to define this Government.",

      "In a bad-tempered session at the Covid inquiry, the former health secretary repeatedly criticised the line of questioning describing it as \"naive\", \"hostile\" and \"inappropriate\".",
      "He said he was \"not at all surprised\" when a so-called VIP lane for PPE suppliers with a political connection was set up, describing it as \"standard practice\".",
      "At one point, the chairwoman of the inquiry, Baroness Hallett, intervened, telling Hancock it was her job to learn lessons for any future pandemic.",
      "'Radically short of PPE'",
      "Hancock was appearing for the fifth time at the Covid inquiry, which is now investigating the purchase and distribution of \u00a315bn of PPE in the pandemic, along with testing kits, ventilators and other pieces of medical equipment.",
      "He defended a public \"call to arms\" made at a Downing Street news conference on 10 April 2020 for more UK suppliers of PPE to come forward.",
      "The inquiry has heard from previous witnesses, including the government's former chief commercial officer Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, that the appeal was counterproductive, leading to a large number of approaches which threatened to overwhelm the system.",
      "\"We were radically short of PPE [at the time] and the country was about to run out at a national level,\" Hancock told the inquiry.",
      "\"No-one has testified that the call to arms led to anything other than more PPE\u2026 So I stand by that.\"",
      "The former health secretary was then asked about the High Priority Lane, or VIP lane, which was set up by officials in the Department of Health in England to help manage offers by prioritising those referred by an MP, member of the House of Lords or senior civil servant.",
      "Hancock said he was not involved in designing the system, which he said had made him the target of an \"enormous amount of conspiracy theories\".",
      "The inquiry commissioned an expert report from Prof Albert Sanchez-Graells, a professor of law at the University of Bristol, which was critical of the approach and found no evidence of similar prioritisation in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, or  other countries around the world.",
      "\"It's fine having academics write papers about this stuff\u2026 but you've got to understand what it was like [at the time],\" said Hancock.",
      "\"The pressure to save lives was intense, but so was the reality that high-quality offers would be sent through to senior decision-makers, and you had to have a process for dealing with that.\"",
      "He said that other countries would have had their own systems for prioritising offers for PPE and medical equipment in different ways.",
      "Hancock was later asked about a \u00a330m contract awarded to a firm run by Alex Bourne, who owned a pub in his West Suffolk constituency, to make vials for Covid testing.",
      "Emails show Hancock passed on communications from Mr Bourne to the then health minister Lord Bethell, describing his analysis of the wider testing system as a \"very interesting critique\" from a \"very impressive guy\".",
      "In questioning, Hancock said he acted with \"impeccable behaviour\" at the time, and accused the inquiry's chief counsel Richard Wald KC of cherry-picking a \"couple of messages\" that have the \"most tabloid interest\".",
      "He said the inquiry had followed a \"wholly naive\" line of questioning by ignoring the reality of the situation at the time, while making \"terribly pejorative\" statements that were \"totally inappropriate\".",
      "At the conclusion of his evidence, Baroness Hallett told Hancock that he \"was not the first and I'm sure won't be the last witness to think the inquiry is all about criticising people\".",
      "\"My aim is to investigate what happened, to explore matters of public concern, to get people to answer on those areas, and to try to come up with recommendations that will save lives,\" she added."

      "It made twelve recommendations for improving the system, warning that a flagship Labour pledge to halve levels of violence against women and girls over a decade would otherwise \"fall flat\".",
      "In a response published on Wednesday, the government said it would accept two of her suggestions, to \"elevate the status\" of domestic abuse within policing, and to strengthen misconduct rules for officers accused of abusing women.",
      "But it rejected a recommendation for new legislation to make it easier for victims who use violence against their abuser, or who are forced into offending, to claim they were acting in self-defence.",

      "It added that the Law Commission, which advises ministers on legal reforms, was looking into the issue as part of a wider review.",

      "In its responses, the Home Office and Ministry of Justice (MoJ) pointed to a range of existing training schemes, guidance documents and forthcoming powers to deliver reforms in the various suggested areas for improvement.",
      "However, Dame Nicole said \"re-badging existing programmes as new\" would not improve the system, and warned against \"cherry-picking elements from my report\".",
      "She added that existing training schemes were \"not enough,\" while ministers had failed to provide a \"concrete assurance\" of better funding to improve how information on offending was gathered.",
      "\"I want to be clear that right now we have a criminal justice system that is failing victims of domestic abuse,\" she said.",
      "\"Without a comprehensive strategy on how the government will deliver on these recommendations, backed up by adequate funding, I am deeply concerned that this will only continue\".",

      "In his investigation into the allegations, Sir Laurie Magnus said that \"over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in Kings Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\".",
      "She \"remained under the impression that her parents had bought the property for her\", Sir Laurie added, but had to correct the record when she became a government minister.",
      "He describes this as an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which meant the public had been \"inadvertently misled about the identity of the donor of this gift\".",
      "In their letter to the ACC, Siddiq's lawyers confirm that the King's Cross flat was given to her by Abdul Motalif, who is described as \"an Iman and a very close family friend, akin to Ms Siddiq's godfather\".",

      "In the letter, which has been seen by the BBC, a spokesman for the ACC claims Siddiq had \"spent most of her adult life residing in homes owned by cronies of the notoriously venal Awami League\" and that this was evidence she had benefitted from the party's corruption.",
      "The MP's \"claims to have been unaware of the nature of the Hasina regime\" strained credulity, the spokesman added, and the ACC would be in touch with her lawyers \"in due course\"."

      "However, despite these real terms cuts in many benefits, from 2015, more and more people claimed incapacity benefit.",

      "PIP was initially projected to reduce the number of claimants by 606,000 (28%) in total.",
      "Yet the reform ended up saving only \u00a3100m a year by 2015, and the number of claimants rose by 100,000 (5%).",
      "Another attempt in 2017 to limit access to PIP was also reversed.",
      "The reason was that many people appealed against refusals that had been triggered by the tightened eligibility criteria.",
      "Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.",
      "Official decisions not to award PIP and incapacity benefit to claimants are still often challenged and around two-thirds are ultimately decided in the challenger's favour at an independent tribunal.",
      "Encourage work",
      "The government is also seeking to make savings from the working age welfare bill by encouraging people to enter work.",
      "Around 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.",
      "One of the proposals is to have more regular reassessments of people on incapacity benefit to determine if their condition has changed and they can now be expected to work.",
      "The fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.",
      "However, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work.",
      "The government has said that those with \"the most severe, life-long health conditions\" will face no future reassessments. But it has not specified which conditions will qualify.",
      "It has also set out plans to encourage more people on health and disability benefits into work through tailored and personalised support.",
      "There have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.",
      "Evaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.",
      "However, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.",
      "That implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.",
      "Nevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce.",
      "\"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.",
      "Correction 17 March: an earlier version of this article wrongly stated the percentage of claimants' appeals upheld, based on DWP appeals. The article has been updated to reflect the full proportion, upheld at independent tribunal.",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Mar 2025 13:05:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Labour may have ditched its factional in-fighting - but deep welfare cuts could reignite tensions.",
    "story": [
      "The prime minister has just had another moment at the lectern, urging Europe to stand up for Ukraine. He's an increasingly confident leader, but in the coming days No 10 faces what could be a defining fight at home.",
      "\"There is a collision coming,\" a Labour insider tells me. Sir Keir Starmer has long been up for fights with his party. But with controversy around every corner, who are the tribes in the party in 2025, and might they fight back?",
      "The party's history is crammed with bitter bust-ups, years when MPs seemed most comfortable to be fighting each other, rather than political rivals.",
      "With a squeeze on benefits coming, there is unease on the back, and the front benches, including in cabinet. The decision on winter fuel payments still causes resentment, and new plans for immigration coming in a white paper later in the spring are likely to be controversial too.",
      "A long-time party observer says: \"Put three Labour people in a room and you'll have a faction.\"",
      "Sir Keir's allies seem pretty confident Labour's ditched that habit of constant scrapping. But No 10 is worried enough to be inviting MPs into Downing Street to make their pitch for the changes to welfare, knowing there'll be upset from the usual suspects and hoping there won't be too much of a backlash on the soft left.",
      "It's also grappling with the massive group of MPs elected last year, with some eager backbenchers actively trying to make Sir Keir's case, unkindly branded by one source as \"toadies\" trying to suck up to the leadership.",
      "So how will the \"usual suspects\", the \"softies\", the \"newbies\" and the \"toadies\" shake down?",
      "There has always been criticism of Sir Keir from the left-hand edge of Labour, not least because he spent the first couple of years in charge squeezing out the hard left, and even kicked out some MPs after the general election for voting against him over the cap on benefits for families with more than two children.",
      "It's common for MPs like Diane Abbott or Nadia Whittome to take pot shots at the prime minister's plans. But now this group is much smaller and less influential than it once was, it can't do much damage on its own. Gone are the days when the Socialist Campaign Group held sway with Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 there are only around 30 MPs in the group these days. But unhappiness about the coming welfare cuts spreads its tentacles far further.",
      "One of those arguing against them told me the vast majority of Labour MPs were in the \"group of resistance\" \u2013 and \"privately some of the cabinet are very against it.\"",
      "There is a whiff of opportunity to force Sir Keir to back down, some believe. \"There is a chance that the old left and the soft left come together,\" another MP tells me.",
      "A source on the left of the party tells me there's \"potential to broaden this out and team up with people who don't want to see benefits cut after 15 years of austerity. The challenge for us on the left is to work with those people - then we'll have a sizeable rebellion.\" It is \"breathtaking\" to see new MPs backing undisclosed changes to benefits for disabled people, they add.",
      "They point to the rebellion against Tony Blair in 1997 when 47 Labour MPs voted against the new government over - you guessed it - cuts to benefits. One hundred MPs abstained. It didn't change the policy, just as a rebellion of that kind of size wouldn't change it this time either, given the PM's huge majority. But it shocked ministers, still in the pomp of their massive victory that year. Could this do the same?",
      "Downing Street evidently is worried - but the resistance on the soft left so far seems, well, rather soft.",
      "Another source tells me there are lots of colleagues who are expressing discomfort, and there are fault-lines, but it's not organised. Some of those who would rather like there to be a rebellion seem to also rather like the idea of someone else organising it.",
      "Rebellions do need organising, effort, energy, and an eagerness to make sparks fly. They also need leaders willing to put their head above the parapet. While the concern is strong, the appetite for a big spat when the plans eventually get to Parliament is less so, at least for now.",
      "It's symbolic of where power is held in the party right now. \"The soft left has been obliterated,\" a senior Labour figure tells me, adding: \"I'm not sure No 10 has the story right and I fear it will be handled badly, but on welfare \u2013 they have got no choice.\"",
      "Ministers are trying to make a moral argument - that sorting out welfare is a mission, that it's better for people's well-being and health to have a job. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, will almost inevitably make that case when he joins us in the studio tomorrow. That argument was made by Labour in the election and in its manifesto. But the second part of the expected plans - squeezing payments to disabled people who may already be struggling - was not.",
      "None of the hordes of Labour MPs elected for the first time in 2024 had taking cash from the worst off on their campaign leaflets or Facebook posts. But are the newbies, barely a year into the job, the kind of tribe to cause trouble? Of course, it's important to note they don't all think the same but talking to some of them, there are some characteristics you can trace.",
      "Remember more than half of Labour's MPs \u2013 243 out of 406 \u2013 are completely new, so understanding their centre of gravity is hugely important. And it seems very different to the previous generations.",
      "One of the newbies told me: \"Even more than the welfare stuff, the moment that was most revealing about how different we are to 1997 was the 3% defence target and the aid cuts.\" This wasn't met with any more resistance than the resignation of International Development Minister Annaliese Dodds and a \"few rumblings\" from inside the party - but for most of the 2024 intake it was a \"no-brainer\", given the need to spend more on defence as the world becomes less secure.",
      "It's not just that Labour's recruits are different, but they note their political upbringing is different too: \"We have come of age politically in a time when chaos is the norm and the world feels like it is continually going to hell\" \u2013 so cutting aid and other policies that are uncomfortable for moderates a generation above \"are not that troubling\".",
      "Indeed, some of the newbies have been unkindly branded \"toadies\" by others, as another source describes them - not just accepting some of the leadership's tougher plans, but even egging them on, busy writing public letters, or giving supportive interviews.",
      "Whether on welfare, defence or planning, another MP describes them as \"pop-up pressure groups\", publicly calling for No 10 to push its reforms harder, and further.",
      "\"Aren't they hilarious?\" a party veteran jokes, gently mocking the ambition of those involved, suspicious that the leadership may have gently encouraged a few aspirant MPs to make their case vigorously and loudly.",
      "A government source acknowledges there is a significant chunk of MPs who want to be helpful to the leadership, but with many in marginal seats, \"they are not swots, they are street fighters\" who are closer to their voters' concerns. They're telling the leadership they can give them space to be more radical on welfare, immigration or getting houses built.",
      "For now, whatever the motivation of the usual suspects, No 10 can enjoy a level of unity in the governing party.",
      "It's also plain that the political operation in government has improved since the summer, in part due to his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, credited by many for bringing a new discipline to the party. \"There is only one tribe,\" a senior figure told me, \"it's Morgan McSweeney's \u2013 it's his way or the high way \u2013 his people are controlling things at the moment.\" That's described differently by others, who say: \"It's Keir's party now.\" And an increasingly confident prime minister abroad has more clout at home.",
      "But the rows over welfare that will bubble up this week and the chancellor's decisions in the Spring Statement next week still certainly matter. Not every MP or activist agrees with the decisions being taken by the centre - but with a whopping majority, the risk is not about losing votes.",
      "It's about a direction of travel and the perception of the party to the public. It matters in the next few weeks on the inside of government because managing unhappiness takes up political time, energy and effort. It matters outside because rows over policy, whether welfare or immigration, create headlines, and headaches, and the danger of giving the public the impression that the party in charge is not pulling together.",
      "That's acknowledged by a government source observing the journey Sir Keir's Labour Party has been on: \"We were united against the hard left, then we were united against the Tories\" - but as the government settles in, it's less clear what the party is united on now.",

    "story": [
      "The chancellor will give an update on her plans for the UK economy when she gives a statement alongside an economic forecast on 26 March.",
      "Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events.",
      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are expected on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029-30 financial year has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the Treasury has drafted plans for several billion pounds of spending cuts.",
      "It is understood welfare spending is in the firing line, but other government departments will also see budgets pruned.",
      "The government already had concerns about the rising number of benefit claimants and Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system.",
      "The government is also seeking to reorganise the civil service to reduce bureaucracy. It has already announced that NHS England will be scrapped, and other quangos and regulators are also expected to be axed.",
      "The Treasury has blamed global economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty over the outcome of conflicts in Ukraine and Middle East, for raising government borrowing costs.",
      "Possible other announcements that are being reported include:",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",

      "Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish, with the Office for National Statistics describing the situation as one of \"weak growth\".",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, while the latest monthly figures show it contracted by 0.1% in January.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

    "summary": "New research could force a fundamental rethink of the nature of space and time.",
    "story": [
      "The mysterious force called Dark Energy, which drives the expansion of the Universe, might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space, scientists have found.",
      "Some of them believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation - one that could force a fundamental rethink.",
      "This early-stage finding is at odds with the current theory which was developed in part by Albert Einstein.",
      "More data is needed to confirm these results, but even some of the most cautious and respected researchers involved in the study, such as Prof Ofer Lahav, from University College London, are being swept up by the mounting evidence.",
      "\"It is a dramatic moment,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We may be witnessing a paradigm shift in our understanding of the Universe.\"",
      "The discovery of Dark Energy in 1998 was in itself shocking. Up until then the view had been that after the Big Bang, which created the Universe, its expansion would slow down under the force of gravity.",
      "But observations by US and Australian scientists found that it was actually speeding up. They had no idea what the force driving this was, so they gave it a name signifying their lack of understanding - Dark Energy.",
      "Although we don't know what Dark Energy is - it is one of the greatest mysteries in science - astronomers can measure it and whether it is changing by observing the acceleration of galaxies away from each other at different points in the history of the Universe.",
      "Several experiments were built to find answers, including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at the Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson Arizona. It consists of 5,000 optical fibres, each one of which is a robotically controlled telescope scanning galaxies at high speed.",
      "Last year, when DESI researchers found hints that the force exerted by dark energy had changed over time, many scientists thought that it was a blip in the data which would go away.",
      "Instead, a year on, that blip has grown.",
      "\"The evidence is stronger now than it was,\" said Prof Seshadri Nadathur at the University of Portsmouth",
      "\"We've also performed many additional tests compared to the first year, and they're making us confident that the results aren't driven by some unknown effect in the data that we haven't accounted for,\" he said.",
      "'Weird' results",
      "The data has not yet passed the threshold of being described as a discovery, but has led many astronomers, such as Scotland's Astronomer Royal, Prof Catherine Heymans, of Edinburgh University, to sit up and take notice.",
      "\"Dark Energy appears to be even weirder than we thought,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"In 2024 the data was quite new, no-one was quite sure of it and people thought more work needed to be done.",
      "\"But now, there's more data, and a lot of scrutiny by the scientific community, so, while there is still a chance that the 'blip' may go away, there's also a possibility that we might be edging to a really big discovery.\"",
      "So what is causing the variation?",
      "\"No one knows!\" Prof Lahav admits, cheerfully.",
      "\"If this new result is correct, then we need to find the mechanism that causes the variation and that might mean a brand new theory, which makes this so exciting.\"",
      "DESI will continue to take more data over the next two years, with plans to measure roughly 50 million galaxies and other bright objects, in an effort to nail down whether their observations are unequivocally correct.",
      "\"We're in the business of letting the Universe tell us how it works, and maybe it is telling us it's more complicated than we thought it was,\" said Andrei Cuceu, a postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, in California.",
      "More details on the nature of Dark Energy will be obtained by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid mission, a space telescope which will probe further than DESI and obtain even greater detail. It was launched in 2023 and ESA released the new images from the spacecraft today.",
      "The DESI collaboration involves more than 900 researchers from more than 70 institutions, around the world, including Durham, UCL and Portsmouth University from the UK."

    "story": [
      "After nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have finally arrived back on Earth.",
      "Their SpaceX capsule made a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, before four parachutes opened to take them to a gentle splashdown off the coast of Florida.",
      "A pod of dolphins circled the craft.",
      "After a recovery ship lifted it out of the water, the astronauts beamed and waved as they were helped out of the hatch, along with fellow crew members astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.",
      "How did Nasa's Suni and Butch fill nine months in space?",
      "\"The crew's doing great,\" Steve Stich, manager, Nasa's Commercial Crew Program, said at a news conference.",
      "It brings to an end a mission that was supposed to last for just eight days.",
      "It was dramatically extended after the spacecraft Butch and Suni had used to travel to the International Space Station suffered technical problems.",
      "\"It is awesome to have crew 9 home, just a beautiful landing,\" said Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator, Nasa's Space Operations Mission Directorate.",
      "Thanking the astronauts for their resilience and flexibility, he said SpaceX had been a \"great partner\".",
      "The journey home took 17 hours.",
      "The astronauts were helped on to a stretcher, which is standard practice after spending so long in the weightless environment.",
      "They will be checked over by a medical team, and then reunited with their families.",
      "\"The big thing will be seeing friends and family and the people who they were expecting to spend Christmas with,\" said Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut.",
      "\"All of those family celebrations, the birthdays and the other events that they thought they were going to be part of - now, suddenly they can perhaps catch up on a bit of lost time.\"",
      "The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024.",
      "They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing.",
      "But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home.",
      "Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return.",
      "So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September.",
      "It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return.",
      "The only catch was this had a planned six-month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now.",
      "The Nasa pair embraced their longer-than-expected stay in space.",
      "They carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who spent the most hours outside of the space station. And at Christmas, the team dressed in Santa hats and reindeer antlers - sending a festive message for a Christmas that they had originally planned to spend at home.",
      "And despite the astronauts being described as \"stranded\" they never really were.",
      "Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency.",
      "Now the astronauts have arrived home, they will soon be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts.",
      "Long-duration missions in space take a toll on the body, astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight.",
      "It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity.",
      "British astronaut Tim Peake said it could take a while to re-adjust.",
      "\"Your body feels great, it feels like a holiday,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"Your heart is having an easy time, your muscles and bones are having an easy time. You're floating around the space station in this wonderful zero gravity environment.",
      "\"But you must keep up the exercise regime. Because you're staying fit in space, not for space itself, but for when you return back to the punishing gravity environment of Earth. Those first two or three days back on Earth can be really punishing.\"",
      "In interviews while onboard, Butch and Suni have said they were well prepared for their longer than expected stay - but there were things they were looking forward to when they got home.",
      "Speaking to CBS last month, Suni Williams said: \"I'm looking forward to seeing my family, my dogs and jumping in the ocean. That will be really nice -  to be back on Earth and feel Earth.\""

    "summary": "A spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC there had been an assault at the station.",
    "story": [
      "A group of scientists due to work together for months at a remote Antarctic research station has been rocked after a member of the team was accused of physical assault.",
      "A team of nine researchers were due to spend the Antarctic winter at the South African-run base, which sits about 170km (about 105 miles) from the edge of the ice shelf and is difficult to reach.",
      "But a spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC \"there was an assault\" at the station, following earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour from inside the camp.",
      "In a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with \"utmost urgency\".",
      "South Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued.",
      "The ministry said that those in the team had been subject to \"a number of evaluations that include background checks, reference checks, medical assessment as well as a psychometric evaluation by qualified professionals\", which all members had cleared.",
      "In a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was \"not uncommon\" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern.",
      "It said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February \"all was in order\", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February.",
      "The statement added the department \"immediately activated the response plan in order to mediate and restore relations at the base\".",
      "\"This process has been ongoing on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that those on the base know that the Department is supportive and willing to do whatever is needed to restore the interpersonal relationships, but also firm in dealing with issues of discipline,\" it said.",
      "The department said allegations of sexual harassment were also being investigated, but that reports of sexual assault were incorrect.",
      "The department added that a government minister was personally handling the incident, and the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended\".",
      "The alleged perpetrator has also written a formal apology to the victim, it said.",
      "The Sanae IV research base is located more than 4,000km from mainland South Africa and harsh weather conditions mean scientists can be cut off there for much of the year.",
      "The base typically houses staff who stay through the Antarctic winter for approximately 13 months.",
      "South African research expeditions have been taking place since 1959. The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicists.",
      "These expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident.",
      "But on Sunday, South Africa's Sunday Times reported that one member of the team had sent an email warning of \"deeply disturbing behaviour\" by a colleague and an \"environment of fear\".",
      "A South African government spokesperson told the BBC that the alleged assault was triggered by \"a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do \u2013 a weather dependant task that required a schedule change\".",
      "Incidents in Antarctica are rare, but not unprecedented. In 2018 there were reports of a stabbing at the Russian-operated Bellingshausen research station.",
      "Psychologists point to the effect that isolation can have on human behaviour.",
      "\"One thing we know from these rare occurrences, when something bad happens in enforced isolation or capsule working, is that it's often the small things, tiny things that can blow up into conflict,\" said Craig Jackson, professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University, and a chartered member of the British Psychological Society.",
      "\"So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Gabrielle Walker, a scientist and author who has been on expeditions to Antarctica, said working in such close proximity to a small group of colleagues had risks.",
      "\"You know exactly how they put their coffee cup down and what direction the handle points in; you know that they scratch their nose three times before they sit down; you know everything about them.",
      "\"And in the bad circumstances, it can start to irritate you\u2026 because there's nothing else \u2013 there's no other stimulus and you're with people 24/7,\" she said.",
      "Sources within the Antarctic research community have told the BBC that South Africa has access to an ice-capable ship and aircraft if needed.",
      "But any rescue operation would have to contend with the harsh climate, with temperatures well below freezing and the possibility of strong winds.",

    "summary": "Despite dire predictions of climate breakdown, more Sports Utility Vehicles are being spotted on, and off, the roads.",
    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolos Petropoulos, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",
      "The UK Parliament's climate change committee had a similar finding in its 2024 report on decarbonisation in the country."

      "When light is deflected by the small particles in Earth's atmosphere, it scatters more of the shorter blue wavelengths, leaving longer red wavelengths to remain visible.",
      "Mr Foster said: \"Red light is mostly unaffected by the gases of the atmosphere, so it travels all the way through them and out the other side where it can shine on the Moon, making it appear red.\"",

      "The UK is legally committed to reaching net zero by 2050 under a law passed by former Tory Prime Minister Theresa May in 2019. It means the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces, in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "In a speech, Badenoch said net zero cannot be achieved by 2050 \"without a serious drop in our living standards or by bankrupting us\".",
      "The Conservative leader did not set out an alternative target date, but said she would consider doing so if her party found a better way of delivering net zero.",

    "summary": "Despite dire predictions of climate breakdown, more Sports Utility Vehicles are being spotted on, and off, the roads.",
    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolos Petropoulos, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",
      "The UK Parliament's climate change committee had a similar finding in its 2024 report on decarbonisation in the country."

      "The pair are travelling back to Earth in a SpaceX capsule along with Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.",
      "They undocked from the ISS at 05:05 GMT (01:05 EDT) on Tuesday and are set to splash down off the coast of Florida later the same day, at 21:57 GMT (17:57 EDT) .",
      "Their landing time, however, could change if the weather conditions are not good enough.",
      "It will mark the end of a mission that has grabbed the world's attention, however the final stages of their journey won't be easy.",
      "The SpaceX Dragon capsule will make a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, enduring temperatures of up to 1600C.",
      "As it rapidly slows, the astronauts will experience significant g-forces, about four times the Earth's gravity.",
      "Finally, four large parachutes will open, allowing the craft to land gently in the ocean.",
      "Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut, said the thrilling ride would be worth it.",

      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024.",
      "They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing.",
      "But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home.",
      "Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return.",
      "So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September.",
      "It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now.",
      "The arrival of a replacement crew on Sunday was the final step needed for Butch and Suni's return \u2013 and after a short hand over with the new team, their mission is now at an end.",
      "The Nasa pair have embraced their longer than expected stay in space.",
      "They've carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who's spent the most hours outside of the space station.",
      "And despite the astronauts being described as \"stranded\" they never really were.",
      "Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency.",
      "Speaking in the weeks before their departure, Butch Wilmore said they weren't fazed when their mission was extended.",
      "\"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we plan to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight programme is all about,\" he said.",
      "Suni added that she was sad this would probably be her last mission.",
      "\"I think just the fact that we're living up here, in this very unique place, gives you an amazing perspective,\" she said. \"I don't want to lose that spark of inspiration when I leave, so I'm going to have to bottle it somehow.\"",
      "The pair's mission attracted even more publicity last month after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that the astronauts had been left in space for political reasons, and his company could have brought them home sooner.",
      "But Nasa officials said their decisions were based on flight scheduling and the space station's needs.",
      "Garrett Reisman, a former Nasa astronaut and former director of space operations at SpaceX, said there were good reasons why Nasa didn't opt for a dedicated rescue mission.",
      "\"It wasn't going to reduce the amount of time that Butch and Suni spent in space by very much - I mean, you'd shave a couple of months off, so the benefit wasn't that great,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"And the cost was high - these crew missions cost hundreds of millions of dollars\u2026. I think Butch and Suni would have been the first ones to say 'no, that's not worth it'.\"",
      "Once the astronauts have arrived home, they will be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts.",
      "Long duration missions in space take a toll on the body, as astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight.",
      "It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity. But the first priority for Butch and Suni will be to see their families, friends - and pets.",
      "Garrett Reisman has been in touch with his friend Suni while she's been in space.",
      "\"I had an email from Suni just the other day where she talked about missing sitting on the porch in her house in Maine with the dogs, and smelling the fresh air, feeling the sun on your face,\" he told the BBC.",

    "summary": "The president once derided attempts to develop new green technology as a \"green new scam\" - but his deal could help boost the US's potential in the sector",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Esme read this article",
      "Donald Trump's return to the White House is a \"major blow to global climate action\". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November.",
      "Since taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets.",
      "Plus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a \"green new scam\".",
      "And yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada \u2013 both nations rich in critical minerals.",
      "Critical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology.",
      "So, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector?",
      "The Elon Musk effect?",
      "Trump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla \u2013 the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets).",
      "Elizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium.",
      "She says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors.",
      "Within two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Such has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: \"Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.\"",
      "He went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow.",
      "The US position in the global race",
      "The weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: \"The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Failure to do so, it warned, could cause \"defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies\".",
      "China's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers.",
      "\"China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,\" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.",
      "Daisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. \"You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country.\"",
      "Some minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply \u2013 like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray.",
      "China has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock).",
      "\"China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,\" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.",
      "She says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten.",
      "What is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).",
      "\"I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,\" he says. \"It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money.\"",
      "As he puts it, it is a \"happy coincidence\" that this could end up supporting green technology.",
      "The key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector.",
      "A stark warning for the US",
      "In the early days, the green transition was \"framed as a burden\" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward.",
      "The Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels.",
      "By August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (\u00a3382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor.",
      "And yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer.",
      "But Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening.",
      "\"The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,\" explains Ms Gray.",
      "\"Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US.\"",
      "Whispers of another executive order",
      "There could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a \"Critical Minerals Executive Order\", which could funnel further investment into this objective.",
      "The exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants.",
      "Although work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. \"If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years.\"",
      "As a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed \"big, beautiful bill\" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month.",
      "Analysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment.",
      "MIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the \"battery belt\" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive.",
      "He adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years.",
      "If Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation.",
      "Carl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. \"In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA.\"",
      "He also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA \u2013 although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. \"If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess.\"",
      "But the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. \"When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement.\"",
      "For those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.",

    "summary": "Ways are being developed for subsea cables to \"sense\" whether they are being disturbed or attacked.",
    "story": [
      "The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch.",
      "He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching.",
      "\"He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,\" says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. \"The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance.\"",
      "Multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months.",
      "So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission called \"Baltic Sentry\", to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones.",
      "The EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables.",
      "Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once.",
      "So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable \u2013 by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed.",
      "It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year \u2013 not a real attempt at sabotage \u2013 that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm.",
      "The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles.",
      "And, the team tested whether their cable could \"hear\" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water.",
      "When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself.",
      "Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example.",
      "AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence.",
      "\"You see every single footstep,\" says Clemens Pohl, chief executive, as he points to a chart revealing disturbances in the fibre optic signal. The footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge.",
      "With this technology, it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subsea cable, as well as its location and, in some circumstances, its direction of travel. That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times.",
      "It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, \"dark\" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds.",
      "There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable.",
      "AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but \"usually not several kilometres away\". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further.",
      "\"People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,\" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems.",
      "Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful \u2013 one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves.",
      "That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset.",
      "Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea.",
      "Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: \"We do see the number of requests increasing.\"",
      "Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm.",
      "Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening.",
      "Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also \"armoury wire\", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. \"On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,\" says Mr Priess.",
      "But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says \u2013 such is the force of the collision or pulling action.",
      "While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres.",
      "\"Cables break all the time,\" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. \"The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,\" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period.",
      "Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service.",
      "Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: \"It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up.\"",
      "And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. \"The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,\" Says Benner.",

      "Hamas did not agree to a renegotiation of the ceasefire on Israel's terms, although it offered to release a living American hostage and four hostages' bodies as mediators tried to keep the ceasefire going.",
      "Israel blocked all food, fuel and medical supplies entering Gaza at the beginning of March in order to put pressure on Hamas. It accused Hamas of commandeering the provisions as part of its strategy against Israel, though without providing evidence.",
      "The war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed and 251 other taken hostage. Twenty-five Israeli and five Thai hostages were released alive during the first phase of the ceasefire.",
      "Israel responded to the October attack with a massive military offensive, which had killed more than 48,500 Palestinians, mainly civilians, before Israel resumed its campaign, the Hamas-run health ministry says.

      "Imamoglu was one of more than 100 people held on charges including corruption and aiding terrorist groups - a move that has sparked protests in Istanbul and the capital Ankara.",
      "A member of the secular Republican People's Party (CHP), Imamoglu is a key rival of President President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and was set to be named as a presidential candidate for the 2028 elections later this week.",
      "Critics say his arrest is a \"coup\" and are planning further demonstrations, despite Istanbul's pro-Erdogan governor banning protests for four days.",
      "Interior minister Ali Yerlikaya announced on Thursday morning that police had identified 261 \"suspect account managers\" online who had allegedly posted content  \"inciting the public to hatred and hostility\" and \"incitement to commit a crime\".",
      "\"Thirty-seven suspects were caught and efforts are continuing to catch the other suspects,\" he said, adding that more than 18.6 million posts appeared online about Wednesday's arrests by 0600 local time (0300 GMT) on Thursday.",
      "Imamoglu may have spent his first night in detention but the municipality is still controlled by his opposition party - for now.",

      "Dozens of police officers were involved in the raid on Imamoglu's house in Istanbul early on Wednesday morning.",
      "He was one of 106 people detained in the operation.",
      "The arrests come as part of a major nationwide crackdown in recent months, targeting opposition politicians, municipalities, journalists and figures in the entertainment industry.",
      "Some fear more opposition figures will be brought in for questioning over the coming weeks as part of a campaign of intimidation.",
      "Who is Turkish opposition leader Ekrem Imamoglu?",
      "Local prosecutors also announced on Thursday they had seized a construction company owned by the Istanbul mayor, as part of a investigation into alleged financial crimes.",
      "Opposition figures say the arrests are politically motivated. But the justice ministry on Wednesday criticised those who linked Erdogan to the arrests, and insisted on their judicial independence.",
      "Last year, Imamoglu won a second term as Istanbul's mayor, when his CHP party swept local elections there and in Ankara.",
      "It was the first time since President Erdogan came to power that his party was defeated across the country at the ballot box.",
      "The elections were also a personal blow to the president, who grew up in and became mayor of Istanbul on his rise to power.",
      "Erdogan has held office for the past 22 years, as both prime minister and president of Turkey. Due to term limits, he cannot run for office again in 2028, unless he changes the constitution.",
      "The CHP's presidential candidate selection, in which 1.5 million members will vote and Imamoglu is the only person running, is set to take place on Sunday.",
      "CHP leader Ozel has said they will vote for Imamoglu regardless of where he is.",
      "The party has also called on citizens to vote in a symbolic election, with plans to place ballot boxes in districts all over Turkey for members of the public to show their support for the detained mayor."

    "summary": "Some relatives of accused and deported gang members say their sons have been wrongly swept up in a Trump administration crackdown.",
    "story": [
      "In a poor neighbourhood of the Venezuelan city of Maracay, the mother of 24-year-old Francisco Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Casique was waiting for him on Saturday.",
      "It had been 18 months since he had migrated to the US to begin a new life but he had told her that he was now being deported back to Caracas, Venezuela's capital, for being in the US illegally. They had spoken that morning, just before he was due to depart.",
      "\"I thought it was a good sign that he was being deported [to Caracas],\" Myrelis Casique L\u00f3pez recalled. She wanted him home.",
      "But he never arrived. And while watching a television news report on Sunday, Ms Casique was shocked to see her son, not in the US or Venezuela but 1,430 miles (2,300km) away in El Salvador.",
      "The footage showed 238 Venezuelans sent by US authorities to the Terrorism Confinement Centre, or Cecot, a notorious mega-jail. She saw men with shaved heads and shackles on their hands and feet, being forcefully escorted by heavily-armed security forces.",
      "The Trump administration says all of the deportees are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which has found itself in the White House's crosshairs. The powerful multi-national crime group, which Trump recently declared a foreign terrorist organisation, has been accused of sex trafficking, drug smuggling and murders both at home and in major US cities.",
      "Ms Casique told the BBC she was certain her son was among the detainees, even if no official list of names has been released.",
      "\"It's him. It's him,\" she said, gesturing at a picture in which a man is seated, with his head bowed, on a prison floor alongside a row of others, a tattoo visible on his arm. \"I recognize his features.\"",
      "She also maintains that he is innocent.",
      "US immigration officials have said the detainees were \"carefully vetted\" and verified as gang members before being flown to El Salvador. They said they used evidence collected during surveillance, police encounters or testimonies from victims to vet them.",
      "\"Our job is to send the terrorists out before anyone else gets raped or murdered,\" Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said on Wednesday.",
      "Many of the deportees do not have US criminal records, however, a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official acknowledged in court documents. And they were deported under a law last invoked during wartime that doesn\u2019t require them to be charged with a crime.",
      "Those who do have criminal records include migrants with arrests on charges ranging from murder, fentanyl trafficking and kidnapping to home invasion and operating a gang-run brothel, according to the Trump administration.",
      "In Mr Garc\u00eda's case, his mother disputes that her son was involved in criminal activity. He left Venezuela in 2019, first to Peru, seeking new opportunities as overlapping economic, political and social crises engulfed the country, she said. He crossed illegally into the US in September 2023.",
      "His mother has not seen him in person in six years.",
      "\"He doesn't belong to any criminal gang, either in the US or in Venezuela\u2026 he's not a criminal,\" Ms Casique said. \"What he's been is a barber.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, he has tattoos,\" she added, convinced that the roses and names of family members that adorn his body led to his detention and deportation. That is how she, and other family members, recognised him from pictures released of the deportees in El Salvador.",
      "Several other families have said they believe that deportees were mistakenly identified as Tren de Aragua gang members because of their tattoos.",
      "\"It's him,\" Ms Casique said tearfully in Maracay, referencing the image from the prison. \"I wish it wasn't him\u2026  he didn't deserve to be transferred there.\"",
      "The mother of Mervin Yamarte, 29, also identified her son in the video.",
      "\"I threw myself on the floor, saying that God couldn't do this to my son,\" she told the BBC from her home in the Los Pescadores neighbourhood of Maracaibo, Venezuela.",
      "Like Ms Casique, she denies her son was involved with the brutal gang. He had left his hometown and travelled to the US through the Dari\u00e9n Gap, crossing illegally in 2023 with three of his friends: Edwar Herrera, 23; Andy Javier Perozo, 30; and Ringo Rinc\u00f3n, 39.",
      "The BBC spoke with their families and friends, who said they had spotted the four men in the footage from the El Salvador jail.",
      "Mr Yamarte's mother said her son had worked in a tortilla factory, sometimes working 12-hour shifts. On Sundays, he played football with his friends, who all shared a home in Dallas, Texas.",
      "\"He's a good, noble young man. There's a mistake,\" she said.",
      "'We're terrified'",
      "President Trump invoked a centuries-old law, the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, to deport the men without due process in the US, saying they were Tren de Aragua gang members.",
      "Despite the US government's assurances that the deportees were carefully vetted, the move has had a chilling effect on many Venezuelans and Venezuelan-Americans in the US, who fear that Trump's use of the law could lead to more Venezuelans being accused and swiftly deported without any charges or convictions.",
      "\"Of course we're afraid. We're terrified,\" said Adelys Ferro, the executive-director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus, an advocacy group. \"We want every single member of TdA to pay for their crimes. But we don't know what the criteria is.\"",
      "\"They [Venezeulans] are living in uncertain times,\" she said. \"They don't know what decisions to make - even people with documents and have been here for years.\"",
      "Ms Ferro's concerns were echoed by Brian de la Vega, a prominent Florida-based, Venezuela-born immigration lawyer and military veteran.",
      "Many of his clients are in the Miami area, including Doral - a suburb sometimes given the moniker \"Doralzuela\" for its large Venezuelan population.",
      "\"The majority of Venezuelans in the US are trying to do the right thing. They fear going back to their home country,\" Mr de la Vega told the BBC. \"The main concern, for me, is how they're identifying these members. The standard is very low.\"",
      "Many Venezuelan expatriates in the US - particularly South Florida - have been broadly supportive of Trump, who has taken a tough stance on the left-wing government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro which many of them fled.",
      "But in February, the Trump administration terminated Temporary Protected Status - TPS - for Venezuelans, which had shielded many from deportation. The programme officially ends on 7 April and could impact nearly 350,000 Venezuelan nationals living in the US.",
      "\"Trump's speeches have always been strong about the Venezuelan regime, especially during the campaign,\" Mr de la Vega said. \"I don't think people expected all this.\"",
      "Daniel Campo, a Venezuelan-born naturalised US citizen in Pennsylvania - and ardent Trump supporter - told the BBC that while he remains steadfast in his support of the president, he has some concerns about the deportations to El Salvador and the end of TPS.",
      "\"I certainly hope that when they are doing raids to deport Tren de Aragua, especially to the prison in El Salvador, they are being extra careful,\" he said.",
      "Among those caught by surprise by the end of TPS and the recent deportations is a 25-year-old Venezuelan man who asked to be identified only as Yilber, who arrived in the US in 2022 after a long, dangerous journey through Central America and Mexico.",
      "He's now in the US - but unsure about what comes next.",
      "\"I left Venezuela because of the repression, and the insecurity. My neighbourhood in Caracas had gangs,\" he said. \"Now I don't know what's going to happen here.\"",

      "Colombian energy giant Ecopetrol has polluted hundreds of sites with oil, including water sources and biodiverse wetlands, the BBC World Service has found.",
      "Data leaked by a former employee reveals more than 800 records of these sites from 1989 to 2018, and indicates the company had failed to report about a fifth of them.",
      "The BBC has also obtained figures showing the company has spilled oil hundreds of times since then.",
      "Ecopetrol says it complies fully with Colombian law and has industry-leading practices on sustainability.",
      "The company's main refinery is in Barrancabermeja, 260km (162 miles) north of the Colombian capital Bogota.",
      "The huge cluster of processing plants, industrial chimneys and storage tanks stretches for close to 2km (1.2 miles) along the banks of Colombia's longest river, the Magdalena \u2013 a water source for millions of people.",
      "Members of the fishing community there believe oil pollution is affecting wildlife in the river.",
      "The wider area is home to endangered river turtles, manatees and spider monkeys, and is part of a species-rich hotspot in one of the world's most biodiverse countries. Nearby wetlands include a protected habitat for jaguars.",
      "When the BBC visited last June, families were fishing together in waterways criss-crossed by oil pipelines.",
      "One local said some of the fish they caught released the pungent smell of crude oil as they were cooked.",
      "In places, a film with iridescent swirls could be seen on the surface of the water - a distinctive signature of contamination by oil.",
      "A fisherman dived down in the water and brought up a clump of vegetation caked in dark slime.",
      "Pointing to it, Yuly Vel\u00e1squez, president of Fedepesan, a federation of fishing organisations in the region, said: \"This is all grease and waste that comes directly from the Ecopetrol refinery.\"",
      "Ecopetrol, which is 88% owned by the Colombian state and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, rejects the fishers' claims that it is polluting the water.",
      "In response to the BBC's questions, it says it has efficient wastewater treatment systems and effective contingency plans for oil spills.",
      "Andr\u00e9s Olarte, the whistleblower who has shared the company's data, says pollution by the firm dates back many years.",
      "He joined Ecopetrol in 2017 and started working as an adviser to the CEO. He says he soon realised \"something was wrong\".",
      "Mr Olarte says he challenged managers about what he describes as \"awful\" pollution data, but was rebuffed with reactions such as: \"Why are you asking these questions? You're not getting what this job is about.\"",
      "He left the company in 2019, and shared a large amount of company data with US-based NGO the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and later with the BBC. The BBC has verified it came from Ecopetrol's servers.",
      "One database he has shared, dated January 2019, contains a list of 839 so-called \"unresolved environmental impacts\" across Colombia.",
      "Ecopetrol uses this term to mean areas where oil is not fully cleaned up from soil and water. The data shows that, as of 2019, some of these sites had remained polluted in this way for over a decade.",
      "Mr Olarte alleges that the firm was trying to hide some of them from Colombian authorities, pointing to about a fifth of the records labelled \"only known to Ecopetrol\".",
      "\"You could see a category in the Excel where it lists which one is hidden from an authority and which one is not, which shows the process of hiding stuff from the government,\" says Mr Olarte.",
      "The BBC filmed at one of the sites marked \"only known to Ecopetrol\", which was dated 2017 in the database. Seven years later, a thick, black, oily-looking substance with plastic containment barriers around it was visible along the edge of a section of wetland.",
      "Ecopetrol's CEO from 2017 to 2023, Felipe Bay\u00f3n, told the BBC he strongly denied suggestions that there was any policy to withhold information about pollution.",

      "Colombia has a long history of armed conflict, and illegal armed groups have targeted oil facilities - but \"theft\" or \"attack\" are only mentioned for 6% of the cases listed in the database.",
      "He also said he believed there had been a \"significant advance\" since then in solving problems that lead to oil pollution.",
      "However, a separate set of data shows Ecopetrol has continued to pollute.",
      "Figures obtained by the BBC from Colombia's environmental regulator, the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (Anla), show Ecopetrol has reported hundreds of oil spills per year since 2020.",
      "Asked about the 2019 database of polluted sites, Ecopetrol admits it has records of 839 environmental incidents, but disputes that all of them were classed as \"unresolved\".",
      "The firm says 95% of polluted sites that have been classed as unresolved since 2018 have now been cleaned up.",
      "It says all pollution incidents are subject to a management process and are reported to the regulator.",
      "The data from the regulator includes hundreds of spills in the Barrancabermeja area where Ms Vel\u00e1squez and the fishers live.",
      "The fisherwoman and her colleagues have been monitoring biodiversity in the area's wetlands, which feed into the Magdalena River.",
      "She said there had been a \"massacre\" of fauna. \"This year, there were three dead manatees, five dead buffalo. We found more than 10 caimans. We found turtles, capybaras, birds, thousands of dead fish,\" she said last June.",
      "It is not clear what caused the deaths - the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon and climate change may be factors.",
      "A 2022 study by the University of Nottingham lists pollution - from oil production and other industrial and domestic sources - as one factor among several, including climate change, that are degrading the Magdalena river basin.",
      "Mr Olarte left Ecopetrol in 2019. He moved to his family home near Barrancabermeja, and says he met with an old contact to ask about job openings. Soon afterwards, he says an anonymous caller rang his phone threatening to kill him.",
      "\"In the call I understood they thought I had put complaints against Ecopetrol, which was not the case,\" he says.",
      "Mr Olarte says more threats followed, including a note that he showed to the BBC. He does not know who made the threats and there is no evidence that Ecopetrol ordered them.",
      "Ms Vel\u00e1squez and seven other people also told the BBC they had received death threats after challenging Ecopetrol.",
      "She said an armed group had fired warning shots at her house and spray-painted the word \"leave\" on the wall.",
      "The fisherwoman is now protected by armed bodyguards paid for by the government, but the threats have continued.",
      "Asked about the threats Mr Olarte described, the former CEO Mr Bay\u00f3n said they were \"absolutely unacceptable\".",
      "\"I want to make it totally clear\u2026 that never, at any time, was there any order of that sort,\" Mr Bay\u00f3n said.",
      "Ms Vel\u00e1squez and Mr Olarte both know the risks are real. Colombia is the most dangerous country in the world for environmental defenders, according to the NGO Global Witness, with 79 killed in 2023.",
      "Experts say such killings are linked to Colombia's decades-long armed conflict, in which government forces and paramilitaries allied to them have fought left-wing rebel groups.",
      "Despite government attempts to end the conflict, armed groups and drug cartels remain active in parts of the country.",
      "Matthew Smith, an oil analyst and financial journalist based in Colombia, says he does not believe Ecopetrol managers are involved in threats by armed groups.",
      "But he says there is an \"immense\" overlap between former paramilitary groups and the private security sector.",
      "Private security firms often employ former members of paramilitary groups and compete for lucrative contracts to protect oil facilities, he says.",
      "Mr Olarte has shared internal Ecopetrol emails showing that in 2018, the company paid a total of $65m to more than 2,800 private security companies.",
      "\"There is always that risk of some sort of contagion between the private security companies, the types of people they employ, and their desire to continually maintain their contract,\" Mr Smith says.",
      "He says this could potentially even include kidnapping or murdering community leaders or environmental defenders in order to \"ensure that Ecopetrol's operations proceed smoothly\".",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n said he was \"convinced that the checks and due diligence were done\" regarding the company's relationships with private security companies.",
      "Ecopetrol says it has never had relationships with illegal armed groups. It says it has a strong due diligence process and carries out human rights impact assessments for its activities.",
      "The BBC contacted other members of Ecopetrol's former leadership from the time of Mr Olarte's employment, who strongly deny the allegations in this report.",
      "Now living in Germany, Mr Olarte has been submitting complaints about Ecopetrol's environmental record to the Colombian authorities and the company itself - so far, without meaningful result.",
      "He has also been in a series of legal cases against Ecopetrol and its management, related to his employment there, which are as yet unresolved.",
      "\"I did this in defence of my home, of my land, of my region, of my people,\" he says.",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n stressed the economic and social importance of Ecopetrol to Colombia.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly676jp291o",

    "summary": "Experts praised a move towards transparency, but there are no major revelations in the documents - and some still have yet to be released.",
    "story": [
      "Enthusiasts are poring over thousands of newly released documents related to the investigation into President John F Kennedy's assassination.",
      "As many experts expected, this latest release by the Trump administration does not answer all lingering questions about one of America's historic turning points - the 1963 killing of Kennedy in Dallas.",
      "But the latest batch does include documents that are now mostly or fully unredacted. They reveal further how much the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) observed JFK's killer before the shooting.",
      "A US government investigation in the 1960s concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald, a drifter and former US Marine who at one point defected to the then-Soviet Union, acted alone when he shot at Kennedy's motorcade from a nearby building.",
      "However, the case still prompts questions, along with wild conspiracy theories, more than 60 years later - and the latest release is unlikely to change that. Here are some key takeaways.",
      "JFK experts scour newly unsealed assassination files",
      "JFK experts scour newly unsealed assassination files",
      "1) More on Oswald - but no bombshells",
      "The documents further shed light on the CIA's strong surveillance of Oswald, said Jefferson Morley, a former Washington Post reporter and editor of the JFK Facts blog.",
      "\"He's a subject of deep interest to the CIA\" long before the assassination, and the extent of this has only become clear in the last few years, Mr Morley said.",
      "Many of the new documents have been released before - but now more complete versions are available. Although specialists are still combing through, no earth-shattering stories have surfaced.",
      "Still, Mr Morley calls it \"the most exciting news around JFK records since the 1990s\".",
      "\"Several very important documents have come into public view,\" he said.",
      "Experts have therefore praised the release as a step forward for transparency. In the past, hundreds of thousands of documents were made available but were partially redacted. Others were held back, with officials citing national security concerns.",
      "Philip Shenon, who wrote a 2013 book about the assassination, told the Associated Press that previously released documents described a trip Oswald took to Mexico City in September 1963, months before the assassination.",
      "The CIA was monitoring him at that time, he said, according to the AP.  \"There's reason to believe he talked openly about killing Kennedy in Mexico City and that people overheard him say that.\"",
      "In a previously released April 1975 memo, the CIA downplayed what it knew about Oswald's trip to Mexico City, the AP reported. The CIA recorded three phone calls between Oswald and a guard at the Soviet embassy, it said, but Oswald only identified himself in one.",
      "2) Intelligence methods revealed",
      "A number of the documents shed light on Kennedy's relationship with the CIA before his death and on intelligence-gathering techniques - giving a window into Cold War operations.",
      "A newly unredacted memo reveals a more complete version of a note written by Kennedy aide Arthur Schlesinger.",
      "Critical of the CIA and its role in shaping foreign policy, the note shows the agency's  huge presence in US embassies, even in allied countries such as France.",
      "In it, Schlesinger warns Kennedy about the agency's influence on American foreign policy. Though not directly related to the assassination, the memo details the rocky relationship between the president and intelligence agencies.",
      "The CIA is traditionally opposed to releasing operational or budget information, said David Barrett, a Villanova University professor and expert on the CIA and presidential power.",
      "\"It's a very good thing for the government to release these documents even if there still may be some redactions,\" he said.",
      "One document details the use of fluoroscopic scanning - using X-rays to show images of the inside of an object.",
      "The technique was developed to detect hidden microphones possibly used to bug CIA offices.",
      "In another document, the CIA describes a system to secretly tag and identify public phone boxes that are tapped, using a paint only visible under ultraviolet light.",
      "The memo is also notable for one of the names in it - James McCord, who would later gain infamy as one of the men who burgled the Watergate complex. The break-in kicked off the unravelling of the scandal that toppled President Richard Nixon.",
      "3) Old theories resurrected",

      "Orban praised the legislation, which bans the event on alleged grounds it is harmful to children, saying: \"We won't let woke ideology endanger our kids.\"",
      "Pride marches had been held for the past 30 years in Hungary. Opposition lawmakers lit flares during the voting session on Tuesday, while demonstrators blocked a bridge in central Budapest. Human rights groups have also condemned the move.",
      "It is the latest measure from Orban's government targeting Hungary's LGBTQ+ community.",
      "In 2020, the country abolished its legal recognition of transgender people, and in 2021, politicians passed a law banning the depiction of homosexuality to under-18s.",

      "The organisers of Budapest Pride criticised the decision on social media. \"This is not child protection, this is fascism,\" they wrote.",
      "\"A democratic leader would never think of restricting the fundamental rights of those who disagree with him.\"",
      "Organisers vowed to continue to hold their planned 30th Pride march in Budapest on 28 June.",
      "In recent months Orban has launched increasing attacks on his critics and announced plans for more conservative law changes, vowing last year to \"occupy Brussels\" to protect Hungary's freedom.",
      "His Fidesz party has been in office since 2010. But polls suggest that the new centre-right party Tisza is in the lead nationally ahead of next year's parliamentary election.",
      "Tisza, which wants a more constructive relationship with the EU, shot up in popularity after Peter Magyar, a one-time Fidesz politician, broke with the ruling party in February 2024 over what he said was its poor running of Hungary."

      "This is among the allegations that have emerged at the ongoing trial of Joshlin Smith's mother, Kelly Smith, who has been accused of orchestrating her kidnapping.",
      "Ms Smith, her boyfriend Jacquen Appollis and their friend Steveno van Rhyn have pleaded not guilty to charges of human trafficking and kidnapping.",
      "Joshlin's disappearance in February 2024 from outside her home in Saldanha Bay, near Cape Town, sent shockwaves across South Africa and, despite a highly publicised search for her, she is yet to be found.",
      "Ms Smith initially said that Joshlin, who has a fair complexion and blue-green eyes, had gone missing after she had left her in Mr Appollis's care.",
      "Prosecutors later accused her of having \"sold, delivered or exchanged\" the six-year-old and lied about her disappearance.",
      "The trial, which is now in its third week, is being held at a community centre in Saldanha.",
      "During the first week of the trial, the court heard details about the day Joshlin went missing, including that Ms Smith only alerted the police more than six hours after she had first noticed that the young girl had disappeared.",
      "The court also heard that she appeared calm during the frantic search and seemed more concerned about her boyfriend's whereabouts than the missing child.",
      "More shocking claims emerged in the second week.",
      "A local pastor said that as far back as 2023, he had heard Ms Smith - a mother of three - talk of selling her children for 20,000 rand ($1,100; \u00a3850) each, though she had said she was willing to accept a lower figure of $275.",
      "Joshlin's teacher then alleged in court that Ms Smith had told her during the search that her daughter was already \"on a ship, inside a container, and they were on the way to West Africa\".",
      "These revelations paled in comparison to the explosive details made by Lourentia Lombaard, a friend and neighbour of Ms Smith, who turned state witness.",
      "She took the stand last Thursday and, over three days, detailed the events in the lead up to Joshlin's disappearance that involved a  traditional healer, known in South Africa as a \"sangoma\".",
      "Ms Lombaard alleged that her friend confessed to her: \"I did something silly... I sold my child to a sangoma\", adding that she had been driven by a desperate need for money.",
      "Joshlin's mother promised those who knew of the plan some money in return for their silence, Ms Lombaard said.",
      "She told the court that she later witnessed Ms Smith pack some clothes for Joshlin into a black bag, which she then saw her carry as the two walked to meet a woman Ms Lombaard believes was the sangoma.",
      "Mother and daughter got into a white car and drove away with the woman, Ms Lombaard said.",
      "Speaking on Monday, her last day on the stand, Ms Lombaard told the court that the \"person who [allegedly took] Joshlin wanted her for her eyes and skin\".",
      "It was not made clear in court why a sangoma would want a child like this.",
      "A woman believed to be a traditional healer was initially arrested and charged alongside Ms Smith and her co-accused last year, but the charges against her were eventually dropped because of a lack of evidence.",
      "Sangomas are legally recognised in South Africa under the Traditional Health Practitioners Act of 2007, alongside herbalists, traditional birth attendants and traditional surgeons.",

    "story": [
      "The US government has released the final batch of documents on the assassination of President John F Kennedy (JFK) - a case that still inspires conspiracy theories more than 60 years later.",
      "It follows an executive order by President Donald Trump that required remaining unredacted files in the case to be made public.",
      "Experts are combing over the papers, not all of which have appeared online. They say the job will take time, and that they do not expect many ground-breaking revelations.",
      "US authorities have previously released hundreds of thousands of JFK documents, but held some back, citing national security concerns. Many Americans still believe the gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald, did not act alone.",

      "But some of the hundreds of files unsealed on Tuesday night did appear to have passages blacked out. Others were hard to read, because they were faded or were poorly scanned photocopies, or appeared to bear little relevance to the JFK case, specialists said.",
      "Non-scholars would probably be \"baffled\", commented David Barrett of Villanova University in Pennsylvania, as he reviewed the released material on Tuesday.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's US partner CBS News, he said the release was \"useful\", but he was not expecting \"earth-shaking information, either with regard to the assassination or more broadly\".",
      "Other JFK experts suggested the American public might keep wondering about the possible existence of other documents and information.",
      "\"I think there may continue to be more record releases,\" historian Alice George told Reuters. But she went on to say the passage of time made investigations hard: \"It's much harder to find the truth when most of the people involved are dead.\"",

      "Chinese state media has welcomed Donald Trump's move to cut public funding for news outlets Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, which have long reported on authoritarian regimes.",
      "The decision affects thousands of employees - some 1,300 staff have been put on paid leave at Voice Of America (VOA) alone since Friday's executive order.",
      "Critics have called the move a setback for democracy but Beijing's state newspaper Global Times denounced VOA for its \"appalling track record\" in reporting on China and said it has \"now been discarded by its own government like a dirty rag\".",
      "The White House defended the move, saying it will \"ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda\".",
      "Trump's cuts target the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which is supported by Congress and funds the affected news outlets, such as VOA, Radio Free Asia (RFA) and Radio Free Europe.",
      "They have won acclaim and international recognition for their reporting in places where press freedom is severely curtailed or non-existent, from China and Cambodia to Russia and North Korea.",
      "Although authorities in some of these countries block the broadcasts - VOA, for instance, is banned in China - people can listen to them on shortwave radio, or get around the restrictions via VPNs.",
      "RFA has often reported on the crackdown on human rights in Cambodia, whose former authoritarian ruler Hun Sen has hailed the cuts as a \"big contribution to eliminating fake news\".",
      "It was also among the first news outlets to report on China's network of detention centres in Xinjiang, where the authorities are accused of locking up hundreds of thousands of Uyghur Muslims without trial. Beijing denies the claims, saying people willingly attend \"re-education camps\" which combat \"terrorism and religious extremism\". VOA's reporting on North Korean defectors and the Chinese Communist Party's alleged cover-up of Covid fatalities has won awards.",
      "VOA, primarily a radio outlet, which also broadcasts in Mandarin, was recognised last year for its podcast on rare protests in 2022 in China against Covid lockdowns.",
      "But China's Global Times welcomed the cuts, calling VOA a \"lie factory\".",
      "\"As more Americans begin to break through their information cocoons and see a real world and a multi-dimensional China, the demonising narratives propagated by VOA will ultimately become a laughing stock,\" it said in an editorial published on Monday.",
      "Hu Xijin, who was the Global Times' former editor-in-chief, wrote: \"Voice of America has been paralysed! And so has Radio Free Asia, which has been as vicious to China. This is such great news.\"",
      "Such responses \"would have been easy to predict\", said Valdya Baraputri, a VOA journalist who lost her job over the weekend. She was previously employed by BBC World Service.",
      "\"Eliminating VOA, of course, allows channels that are the opposite of accurate and balanced reporting to thrive,\" she told the BBC.",
      "The National Press Club, a leading representative group for US journalists, said the order \"undermines America's long-standing commitment to a free and independent press\".",
      "Founded during World War Two in part to counter Nazi propaganda, VOA reaches some 360 million people a week in nearly 50 languages. Over the years it has broadcast in China, North Korea, communist Cuba and the former Soviet Union. It's also been a helpful tool for many Chinese people to learn English.",
      "VOA's director Michael Abramowitz said Trump's order has hobbled VOA while \"America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States\".",
      "Ms Baraputri, who is from Indonesia but based in Washington DC, first joined VOA in 2018, but her visa was terminated at the end of Trump's first administration.",
      "She rejoined in 2023 because she wanted to be part of an organisation that \"upholds unbiased, factual reporting that is free from government influence\".",
      "The recent cuts have left her \"feeling betrayed by the idea I had about press freedom [in the US]\".",
      "She is also concerned for colleagues who may now be forced to return to hostile home countries, where they could be persecuted for their journalism.",
      "Meanwhile, the Czech Republic has appealed to the European Union to intervene so it can keep Radio Free Europe going. It reports in 27 languages from 23 countries, reaching more than 47 million people every week.",
      "RFA chief executive Bay Fang said in a statement that the organisation plans to challenge the order. Cutting funding to these outlets is a \"reward to dictators and despots, including the Chinese Communist Party, who would like nothing better than to have their influence go unchecked in the information space\", he said.",
      "RFA started in 1996 and reaches nearly 60 million people weekly in China, Myanmar, North Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. In China, it also broadcasts in minority languages like Tibetan and Uyghur, apart from English and Mandarin.",
      "\"[Trump's order] not only disenfranchises the nearly 60 million people who turn to RFA's reporting on a weekly basis to learn the truth, but it also benefits America's adversaries at our own expense,\" Mr Fang noted.",
      "While Chinese state media has celebrated the cuts, it's hard to know how Chinese people feel about it given their internet is heavily censored.",
      "Outside China, those who have listened to VOA and RFA over the years appear disappointed and worried.",
      "\"Looking back at history, countless exiles, rebels, intellectuals, and ordinary people have persisted in the darkness because of the voices of VOA and RFA, and have seen hope in fear because of their reports,\" Du Wen, a Chinese dissident living in Belgium, wrote on X.",

    "summary": "Could this be a chance for the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy to shed protectionism and open up further?",
    "story": [
      "India has usually turned to economic reforms in times of distress, with the most famous example being 1991, when the country embraced liberalisation in the face of a deep financial crisis.",
      "Now, with US President Donald Trump's tit-for-tat tariff wars and the global trade upheaval that has followed, many believe that India finds itself at another crossroad.",
      "Could this be a major opportunity for the world's fifth largest economy to shed its protectionism and further open up its economy? Will India seize the moment, just as it did more than three decades ago, or will it retreat further?",
      "Trump has repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties. The problem is that India's trade-weighted import duties - the average duty rate per imported product - are among the highest in the world. The US average tariff is 2.2%, China's is 3% and Japan's is 1.7%. India's stands at a whopping 12%, according to data from the World Trade Organization.",
      "High tariffs increase costs for companies dependent on global value chains, hindering their ability to compete in international markets. They also mean that Indians pay more on imported goods than foreign consumers. Despite growing exports - primarily driven by services - India runs a significant trade deficit. However, with India's share of global exports at a mere 1.5%, the challenge becomes even more urgent.",
      "The jury is out on whether Trump's tariff war will help India break free or double down on protectionism. Narendra Modi's government, often criticised for its protectionist stance, seems to have shifted gears in recent years.",
      "Last month, ahead of Prime Minister Modi's meeting with Trump in Washington, India unilaterally lowered tariffs on Bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and some other US products.",
      "Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has made two trips to the US to discuss a potential trade deal, following Trump's threatened retaliatory tariffs, looming on 2 April. (Citi Research analysts estimate India could lose up to $7bn annually from reciprocal tariffs, primarily affecting sectors like metals, chemicals and jewellery, with pharmaceuticals, automobiles and food products also at risk.)",
      "Last week, Goyal urged Indian exporters to \"come out of their protectionist mindset and encouraged them to be bold and ready to deal with the world from a position of strength and self-confidence\", according to a statement from his ministry.",
      "India is also actively pursuing free trade deals with several countries, including the UK and New Zealand, and the European Union.",
      "In an interesting turn of events, homegrown telecoms giants Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have teamed up with Trump ally Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch satellite internet services via Starlink in India. The move surprised analysts, especially after Musk's recent clashes with both companies, and came as US and Indian officials negotiate the trade deal.",
      "India's rapid growth from the late 1990s to the 2000s - 8.1% between 2004-2009 and 7.46% from 2009-2014 - was in large part driven by its gradual integration into global markets, particularly in pharmaceuticals, software, autos, textiles and garments, alongside a steady reduction in tariffs. Since then, India has turned inwards.",
      "Many economists believe that protectionist policies over the past decade have undermined Modi's Make in India initiative, which prioritised capital- and technology-intensive sectors over labour-intensive ones like textiles. As a result, it has struggled to boost manufacturing and exports.",
      "High tariffs have also fostered protectionism in several Indian industries, discouraging investments in efficiency, according to Viral Acharya, a professor of economics at New York University Stern School of Business.",
      "This has allowed \"cosy incumbents\" to gain market power by consolidating their positions without facing much competition. As Mr Acharya, a former central banker, noted in a paper by Brookings Institution, restoring industrial balance in India requires \"reducing tariffs to increase the country's share of global goods trade and reduce protectionism\".",
      "With India's tariffs already higher than those of most countries, further increases could be especially damaging.",
      "\"We need to boost exports and a tit-for-tat tariff war won't help us. China can afford this strategy due to its massive export base, but we can't, as we hold only a small share of the global market,\" Rajeswari Sengupta, an associate professor of economics at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, said.  \"A trade conflict could hurt us more than others.\"",
      "In light of this, India finds itself at a crossroad. As the world undergoes a major shift, India has a \"unique opportunity to shape a new vision\" for global trade, says Aseema Sinha, a trade expert at Claremont McKenna College.",
      "By lowering protectionist barriers in South Asia and strengthening ties with Southeast Asia and the Middle East, India has the chance to lead in shaping a new trade vision, positioning itself as a key player in a \"re-globalised\" world, Ms Sinha, author of Globalising India, says.",
      "\"By reducing tariffs, India could become the regional and cross-regional magnet for trade and economic activity, drawing in varied powers in its orbit,\" she adds.",
      "That could help India create the jobs it desperately needs at home. Agriculture, which makes up 15% of its GDP, accounts for a whopping 40% of employment, reflecting extremely low productivity. Construction remains the second-largest employer, absorbing casual daily workers.",
      "India's challenge isn't in expanding its thriving service sector, which already makes up nearly half of total exports, but in dealing with the large pool of unskilled workers who lack the basic skills needed for service jobs.",
      "\"While high-end services are thriving, the majority of the workforce remains uneducated and underemployed, often relegated to construction or informal jobs. To provide meaningful employment to millions entering the workforce each year, India must ramp up its manufacturing exports, as relying solely on services won't address the needs of the unskilled labour force,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "One concern is that reducing tariffs could lead to dumping, where foreign companies flood the market with cheap goods, potentially harming domestic industries.",
      "According to Ms Sengupta, India's ideal approach to trade would involve a \"universal reduction\" in import tariffs, as it currently has some of the highest tariffs among its trading partners.",
      "However, there is a caveat: China's trade struggles, particularly with the US due to the ongoing trade war, could lead to Chinese dumping in India in the \"short run\".",
      "\"To protect against this, India can use non-tariff barriers against China but only against this one country and only in cases of proven dumping. Barring that, it is in India's interest to do a wholesale slashing of tariffs,\" she says.",
      "There's also a growing concern that India may be overcompensating in its efforts to flatter the US.",
      "Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), believes that India's tendency to soften trade policies \"based on rhetoric rather than economic pressure\" shows a lack of assertiveness in global trade talks.",
      "If this trend continues, he says, India may end up making even more compromises in its trade deal with the US, further \"eroding its bargaining power\".",
      "\"In comparison to other major economies, India's pre-emptive surrender on multiple trade fronts - without the US imposing a single country-specific tariff - makes it appear exceptionally vulnerable to pressure tactics.\"",
      "The broader consensus seems to be that India should capitalise on what could be the unintended consequences of Trump's tariff wars. Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC, believes that \"potential US tariffs may have become a catalyst for reforms.\".",
      "\"If supply chains are rejigged again during the second Trump presidency due to higher tariffs on large exporters, and the world looks for new producers, India may get a second chance,\" she writes.",
      "Creating jobs that manufacture goods for the world won't be easy. India has largely missed the bus on low-end, unskilled factory work - jobs China dominated for decades. Automation is taking over. Without deeper reforms, India risks being left behind.",

Yet now, he says, the Model Y has to go \u2013 because he disapproves vehemently of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's actions, especially the way he has handled firing US government employees.",
      "\"I'm not a fan of polarisation, or of doing things without kindness,\" he says. \"There are ways of doing things that don't ostracise people or belittle them. I don't like belittlement.\"",
      "Ben is part of a wider backlash against the Tesla boss that appears to have been gathering momentum in recent weeks, since Musk was appointed head of the controversial Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), charged with taking an axe to federal government spending.",
      "Musk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "For some who do not share his views, it has all become too much.",
      "There have been protests outside dozens of Tesla dealerships, not only in the US, but also in Canada, the UK, Germany and Portugal.",
      "Although most of them have been peaceful, there have been cases of showrooms, charging stations and vehicles being vandalised. In separate incidents in France and Germany, several cars were set on fire.",
      "In the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps.",
      "US President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as \"domestic terrorism\".",
      "Musk has also been unequivocal in his response. \"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" he said in a recent interview with Fox News. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"",
      "What is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers.",
      "And if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm?",
      "A larger-than-life figurehead",
      "Two decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical.",
      "Musk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence.",
      "\"Tesla was the pioneer,\" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. \"They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness.\"",
      "It is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth.",
      "Nowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless \"robotaxis\". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus.",
      "Like the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts.",
      "But recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges.",
      "'Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla'",
      "Although its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million.",
      "The decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down.",
      "This year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February \u2013 although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% \u2013 as well as in Australia.",
      "Meanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month.",
      "In early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day \u2013 adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year.",
      "Sales can fall for many reasons, but research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada \u2013 although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets.",
      "In the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: \"Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.\"",
      "Tesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales.",
      "But experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO.",
      "'Dated' models and overseas competition",
      "To start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market.",
      "\"If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty. \"They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there.\"",
      "Prof Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: \"We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.\"",
      "Competition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars.",
      "At the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology.",
      "\"China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty.",
      "\"You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well.\"",
      "The extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes \u2013 significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network.",
      "The question of robotaxis",
      "Musk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles.",
      "In January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time.",
      "In 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's \"Full Self Driving\" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a \"hands-on\" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times.",
      "\"Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,\" says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy.",
      "Is Musk spinning too many plates?",
      "Arguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket.",
      "Asked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded \"with great difficulty\".",
      "\"It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,\" says Prof Wells.",
      "\"If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.\"",
      "Ever since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake \u2013 currently worth more than $95bn.",
      "That is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes.",
      "For those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation.",
      "Calls for new blood at the top",
      "Today, Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings \u2013 a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as Ford, General Motors or Toyota, which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth.",
      "\"Tesla is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles \u2013 which is clearly not going to happen, given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers \u2013 or that is going to dominate robotaxis and autonomous vehicles,\" says Mr Nagley.",
      "None of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment \u2013  although in media interviews this week, one long-term shareholder-turned-vocal critic, the investment fund manager Ross Gerber, did call for Mr Musk to step down.",
      "But analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top. \"A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "\"It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.\"",
      "\"I think that's the clear direction of travel at the moment.\" says Prof Wells. \"I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalise the business.",
      "\"It needs a significant change of direction now.\"",

      "Many political commentators in Turkey have referred to this as \"Erdogan's worst defeat ever\".",
      "But Imamoglu's arrest, which came days before he was due to be selected as a candidate, prompted the CHP to warn of a \"coup attempt against the next president\".",

      "A football enthusiast, like Erdogan himself, Imamoglu was also an amateur player in his youth and is well known for his support of his local club, Trabzonspor. A love of the sport is a useful characteristic for a politician in football-mad Turkey.",
      "After a business career, at the age of 43 he turned to politics and was elected mayor of Istanbul's middle-class Beylikduzu district for the CHP.",
      "But he was still relatively little known until he fought and won mayoral elections in Istanbul in 2019, which came as a major shock to Erdogan and the AK.",

      "\"Everything will be fine,\" he said, which became his campaign slogan and has been his catchphrase ever since.",
      "And for Imamoglu, \"everything did go fine\" - he secured 54% of the votes in another huge blow to the president.",

    "story": [
      "Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa has told the BBC he wants US, European and Brazilian armies to join his \"war\" against criminal gangs.",
      "He added he wants US President Donald Trump to designate Ecuadorean gangs as terrorist groups, as he has done for some Mexican and Venezuelan cartels.",
      "He also said Ecuadorean law would be respected when asked about his recent partnership with Erik Prince, an ally of Trump and founder of controversial private military firm Blackwater.",
      "Violence has soared in Ecuador in recent years, with gangs battling to control drug trafficking routes. Most of the world's cocaine is trafficked through Ecuador's ports.",
      "President Noboa has previously indicated he would like foreign military aid to help tackle drug cartels \u2013 but this is the first time he has singled out the US, Brazil and Europe.",
      "Security \u2013 and how he is dealing with it \u2013 is a top issue for voters ahead of a run-off vote in Ecuador's presidential election on 13 April.",
      "Noboa has defined his 16 months in office through a tough crackdown on gangs and militarising the streets and prisons \u2013 however he has also come under fire from critics who see his tactics as too heavy-handed.",
      "During his term, the murder rate decreased by approximately 16% from 2023 to 2024 but it remains far higher than previous years, and in January 2025 killings hit a record 781 in one month.",
      "In an interview with BBC News, the incumbent president said: \"We need to have more soldiers to fight this war.\"",
      "\"Seventy per cent of the world's cocaine exits via Ecuador. We need the help of international forces.\"",
      "He said what started as \"criminal gangs\" are now \"international narco-terrorist\" groups of 14,000 armed individuals.",
      "Donald Trump's decision to designate some Latin American cartels as terrorist groups has given US law enforcement further powers to fight them.",
      "Noboa told the BBC he wants his US counterpart to do the same with Ecuadorean gangs: \"I would be glad if he considers Los Lobos, Los Choneros, Los Tiguerones as terrorist groups because that's what they really are.\"",
      "Noboa has already ordered the foreign ministry to seek cooperation agreements with \"allied nations\" to support Ecuador's police and army, and is also seeking parliamentary approval to change the constitution to allow foreign military bases in Ecuador again.",
      "As well as constitutional changes, it would require other nations to be willing to offer this. Deploying armies abroad can be risky and expensive but there is some precedent for it. The US had a military base for its anti-narcotic operations in Ecuador until 2009, before these were banned by former President Rafael Correa.",
      "President Noboa's challenge will be convincing figures like Donald Trump in the US, or leaders in Europe where many drugs are shipped to, that it is in their interests too to stop cartels and drug trafficking.",
      "On the alliance with Trump ally Erik Prince, which he announced a few days ago, he said: \"We're fighting an unconventional, urban guerilla war. He has the experience. He's advising our armed forces, our police.\"",
      "Mr Prince founded the private military firm Blackwater that has provided security services to US governments but has also been embroiled in controversy. He sold the company in 2010.",
      "Four Blackwater contractors were convicted and jailed for killing 14 Iraqi citizens in Baghdad's Nisour Square in 2007 and were later pardoned by Trump in 2020.",
      "Does President Noboa want Mr Prince to bring mercenaries to the country?",
      "\"Not necessarily mercenaries,\" he said. \"We are talking about armies. US, European, Brazilian special forces. This could be a great help for us.\"",
      "While some supported the move, some Ecuadoreans cited Mr Prince's past record and feared rights abuses in the country.",
      "When asked about some of Erik Prince's past controversies, Mr Noboa said Ecuador's laws must be respected and warfare conducted legally.",
      "But, he added, cartels had \"violated every single human right possible for the last five years\".",
      "\"They've mutilated people. They've raped thousands of women. They've trafficked human organs. They've traded illegal gold. And moved more than 1,000 tonnes of cocaine a year.\"",
      "Last year, his iron-fist approach came under fire after four boys were arrested by soldiers over an alleged theft and later found mutilated and burned.",
      "Noboa said those soldiers were in jail pending an investigation but that he would \"fight until the end\" to convict those responsible.",
      "He maintained the armed forces were acting proportionately in tackling crime and noted an imbalance between his 35,000-strong military and 40,000 armed gang members.",
      "With the record number of killings in January, leading critics argue his strict approach is failing.",
      "During a campaign rally, his left-wing challenger Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez said: \"The campaign promises made in 2023 were to be delivered in a year and a half. Not two. Not three. Did he deliver? No!\"",
      "Noboa said it was normal to see rising violence before elections in his country, but reiterated that Ecuador could not fight this problem alone: \"This is a transnational crime without a transnational security policy.\"",
      "While Albanian, Mexican and Colombian cartels worked together, there was not a joint security policy among countries affected by drug violence, he said.",
      "Ecuador needs help, he argued, because its economy is smaller than many in Europe or the US where most drugs are shipped to.",
      "He added drug trafficking and illegal mining generated $30bn (\u00a323bn) \u2013 around 27% of GDP \u2013 annually in Ecuador.",
      "He urged countries where consumption of cocaine is high, like the UK, to do more to tackle this arguing: \"The product they're consuming has a chain of violence and misery.\"",
      "Violence and post-pandemic unemployment have driven many Ecuadoreans to flee northward.",
      "They are now one of the top nationalities crossing the dangerous Darien Gap jungle from South to North America.",
      "President Noboa is willing to take back Ecuadorean migrants from the US, but not other nationalities, and said the country was giving returnees technical training and a minimum wage for three months.",
      "For him, the solution is improving \"opportunities\".",
      "\"We need to develop, as an export-based economy, jobs in Ecuador for these people.\"",
      "While he said he \"100%\" empathised with people fleeing violence, he blamed a past \"lack of strong security policy\".",
      "His message to Ecuadoreans now? \"Stay - and you'll see positive results. We're reducing inflation. Companies are hiring. The economy is recovering.\"",
      "Daniel Noboa will face Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez in the run-off vote next month.",
      "He received only 0.5% more votes than her in the first round, suggesting the second round could be very close and polarising.",
      "With security the top issue for voters, his success \u2013 or not \u2013 may depend on whether Ecuadoreans think progress has been good enough.",

      "A Nigerian senator who alleged she was sexually harassed by one of the country's top politicians has told the BBC the Senate operates like a \"cult\".",
      "A fortnight ago, Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan was suspended for six months after submitting a petition saying she had been harassed by Senate President Godswill Akpabio, which he denies.",
      "His office also rejected the cult comparison - the latest twist in a row that has gripped Nigeria, raising questions about gender equality in the socially conservative  nation.",
      "Akpoti-Uduaghan said she was being punished for speaking out against the system and that she now feared for her and her two-year-old's safety as her security detail had been stripped.",
      "\"The Nigerian Senate operates like a cult. The Senate president runs the Senate like a dictator, not a democrat. There is no freedom of speech, there is no freedom of expression and anyone who dares to go against him gets cut to size,\" the 45-year-old said in the first TV interview since her suspension.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the Senate's Deputy Chief Whip Onyekachi Nwebonyi said Senator Akpoti-Uduaghan was not being silenced and that \"her own legislative activities disprove this claim\".",
      "Akpoti-Uduaghan, who represents the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), alleged that the sexual harassment started in 2023, when she visited Akpabio's country home with her husband.",
      "She said the Akpabio \"squeezed her hand suggestively\" and said \"I will make an opportunity for us to come here and have a good moment\".",
      "Nwebonyi, who says he was also present during the visit, stated: \"At no time during the period in question did the Senate president make any unwanted sexual advances to Senator Akpoti at his country house.\"",
      "But Akpoti-Uduaghan alleged that this was just one incident of many and that the harassment continued for several months.",
      "She said that, while with other senators on the Senate's premises, Akpabio made a comment to the effect of: \"Natasha your husband is really enjoying, it looks like you'll be able to make good movements with your waist.\"",
      "\"The Senate president said this,\" Akpoti-Uduaghan told the BBC.",
      "\"He makes very sexist statements then they [senators] all laugh. He says in the Senate we're all men, she should be used to this.\"",
      "On his part, Nwebonyi said these allegations were \"completely false\".",
      "Nigeria has one of the lowest numbers of female parliamentarians in Africa.",
      "Akpoti-Uduaghan one of four female senators in a parliament of 109 members and she is also the first female senator in her state.",
      "Her petition against Akpabio was dismissed due to \"procedural errors\".",
      "Then, on 6 March, the ethics committee handed Akpoti-Uduaghan a six-month suspension without pay, citing \"unruly and disruptive\" behaviour during a debate in the Senate.",
      "Akpoti-Uduaghan told the BBC that she no longer had access to security as a result of the suspension.",
      "\"In the Nigerian space, we have had people over the past decades who have been killed for having strong views against the government,\" she said.",
      "\"If I'm taking my kid for a walk - because I have a two-year-old - will I be killed? Will I be attacked?\"",
      "Civil society groups in the country have expressed concerns over Akpoti-Uduaghan's treatment, calling for a transparent investigation into her allegations.",
      "\"All we can say is that today is a sad day for Nigerian women fighting for emancipation. Out of 109 senators, only four are women and one is now suspended,\" women's rights activist Hadiza Ado told the BBC when the suspension was imposed.",
      "While rights groups and some social media users have expressed their support for Akpoti-Uduaghan, she also has her fair share of detractors.",
      "After she was suspended, two groups of protesters gathered near parliament in the capital, Abuja - one backing the senate president and the other in support of his colleague, chanting ''Akpabio must go''.",
      "Akpoti-Uduaghan had also been subjected to an onslaught of misogynist abuse on social media since making the allegations, she told the BBC.",
      "The scandal is the latest episode in a political career that has been rocky from the outset.",
      "Akpoti-Uduaghan first ran for governor of Kogi state in 2019 and alleged that her candidacy was challenged over her mixed-race heritage.",
      "She eventually appeared on the ballot, but was subjected to physical and verbal attacks during her campaign.",
      "In 2023, she ran for Senate and lost the election. The poll was marred by violence and after Akpoti-Uduaghan took the matter to court, the election result was overturned.",
      "\"I thought the worst was over with the elections,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"But for a woman I guess it's never really over right? It's just different parts, different chapters.\"",

      "In recent weeks, the Israel military has said it's repeatedly struck targets they've identified as Hamas fighters posing a threat to its troops stationed in Gaza.",

      "Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained",
      "What happened to ceasefire talks?",
      "The 19 January ceasefire deal was thrashed out over many months, with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediation, and a detailed three-phase plan for how the truce should move forward.",
      "The first phase saw Hamas release 33 hostages in return for Israel releasing around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and allowing aid and other goods to enter the Gaza Strip.",
      "As the guns fell silent and thousands of displaced Gazans returned home, Hamas and Israel were due to begin negotiations to commence the second phase.",
      "The parties had agreed that the second phase negotiations would include the release of all remaining hostages as well as a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza Strip, leading to a permanent end to the war.",
      "The first phase finished on 1 March, but the negotiations for the next stage had made no progress.",
      "Instead, Israel imposed a total halt on all aid entering Gaza causing widespread international alarm - and said that it backed a new proposal put together by the United States.",
      "In Qatar last week, Israeli and Hamas delegations gathered to negotiate how the ceasefire would progress and US envoy Steve Witkoff put forward his new \"bridging proposal\" that would have extended the expired first phase.",
      "More hostages would return home in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners being released - but, crucially, negotiations over a permanent end to the war would be delayed.",
      "Here lies a central element to why the truce has broken down.",
      "Israel's two key objectives - to return the hostages and to defeat Hamas - aren't both fully achievable together.",
      "Hamas, to put it crudely, has one card to play in the negotiations: the hostages. They don't want to release any further hostages in a next stage of the ceasefire unless it entails Israeli troops beginning to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, as agreed in the original truce.",
      "Israel is resisting this. The new, US proposal is an attempt to retrieve more hostages while delaying a commitment to ending the war and the question over whether Hamas will remain in some form.",
      "In recent days, the US and Israel have cast Hamas's preference for sticking close to the terms of the original ceasefire deal - instead of renegotiating its terms - as a \"refusal\" to extend the ceasefire.",
      "Witkoff accused Hamas of \"publicly claiming flexibility while privately making demands that are entirely impractical without a permanent ceasefire.\"",
      "While, in late February, Israeli officials had already briefed local press that its military wouldn't withdraw from key sites in Gaza in a breach of the ceasefire agreement.",
      "While we cannot know the detail of the negotiation talks that have taken place behind closed doors - what we do know is that Israel halting aid entering Gaza 17 days ago was an attempt to force Hamas into offering new concessions.",
      "That hasn't worked so far and now it appears Israel has returned to violence in order to try to extract a new deal, one that is more favourable for its political leaders, and one that offers fewer wins to Hamas.",
      "From now on, the situation in Gaza is likely to look different to the past two months of the truce.",
      "This morning the Israeli military has published a map, ordering Palestinians to leave a huge area along the perimeter of the Gaza Strip, where no doubt thousands of Gazans had returned to.",
      "Hamas, for its part, has called for a halt to Israel's military operation and, at the time of writing, has not said it will return to fighting.",
      "However, a BBC journalist near the Israel Gaza border today was told by a soldier that a call has gone out for 40,000 reservists to the Israeli army to present for duty. This seems to confirm reports in Israeli press that the military has been preparing for a renewed ground invasion in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Pursuing a renewed campaign in Gaza also presents a political boon for Prime Minister Netanyahu. This morning the hard right Jewish Power party has announced it will return to the coalition, its members including, former minister Itamar Ben Gvir, resigned in protest over the ceasefire. Having their cooperation will be crucial for the government as it seeks to pass its current budget.",
      "Israel's operations last night may have been a one-off attempt to force Hamas to concede at the negotiating table. It may, however, also herald the beginning of a fierce wave of fighting on the ground again, alarming Gaza's weary families and concerned Israeli hostage families alike.",

      "For more than four months, Georgians have taken to the streets across the country to accuse Ivanishvili's party of rigging elections last October and accusing GD of trying to move the country away from its path to the EU and back into Russia's sphere of influence.",
      "GD denies that and in Chorvila you will not find anyone with a bad word to say about its billionaire son.",
      "Ivanishvili made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, first by selling computers before he acquired banks and metal assets. He returned to Georgia in 2003.",
      "Every newlywed couple in Chorvila receives a cash gift of $3,000 (\u00a32,300) from Ivanishvili, according to Temuri Kapanadze, who teaches history at the village school where Ivanishvili went as a boy.",

      "\"We also want Europe but with our traditions, and that's what the government wants too,\" says resident Giorgi Burjenidze. \"We are a Christian country, and our traditions means that men must be men, and women must be women. President Trump thinks like us too.\"",
      "The view that Europe has been trying to impose values alien to Georgian traditions, such as gay rights, is often repeated by state ministers and pro-government media.",
      "They have also been dismissive of the daily protests sparked by the Georgian Dream's decision to suspend talks with the European Union on the country's future membership.",
      "\"Fire to the oligarchy\" has become one of the main slogans at the ongoing protests to address what people say is the overwhelming influence of Bidzina Ivanishvili on the country's politics.",

      "\"We are witnessing the abuse of the law-making,\" says Tamar Oniani, human rights programme director at the Georgian Young Lawyers' Association.",
      "\"First it was banning the face masks, and then they deployed the face recognition cameras in Tbilisi. So it makes it easier for them to detect who is appearing at the rally and then order high fines.\"",
      "Last month fines went up ten-fold for blocking the road or disobeying the police and Tamar Oniani says in one day alone they received 150 calls from protesters who had been fined.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has said \"many\" pardons issued by Joe Biden are void because the former president signed them with \"autopen\" - a device which reproduces a person's signature - rather than by hand.",
      "Trump did not provide evidence for his claim - which was posted on Truth Social.",
      "BBC Verify has found several instances of Biden signing pardons by hand rather than by autopen.",
      "And a sample presidential signature is used on US government documents when they are stored in the Federal Register - a digital archive. This was the case under Trump as well as under Biden.",
      "Legal experts also told us that there is nothing in US law which would invalidate pardons signed by autopen.",
      "Did Biden sign pardons using autopen?",
      "On Truth Social, Trump said that: \"The 'Pardons' that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!\".",
      "Trump didn't specify which pardons he was referring to but he has previously referred to the house select committee investigating the 6 January riots as the \"unselect committee\", and has criticised Biden for pardoning family members.",
      "BBC Verify looked through official photographs of Biden in the White House and ones posted on the official White House X account and found a number of examples of him signing pardons by hand.",
      "In October 2022, Biden was pictured signing an order pardoning those in jail for marijuana possession.",
      "In the same year, he also signed a pardon for non-violent offenders.",
      "It is not known whether Biden has signed any pardons only using autopen.",
      "In May last year, CNN did report that he signed a bill for a one-week extension for federal aviation funding using autopen.",
      "BBC Verify has asked Biden's office for his record of using autopen and the White House for the evidence behind Trump's claim.",
      "Trump appears to have taken his cue from the Oversight Project - part of the Conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation - which has claimed that Biden's 19 January pardons - of some family members and political figures including Anthony Fauci - all had the same autopen signature.",
      "We have asked the Heritage Foundation for its workings. Previously, it has highlighted other Biden documents which it says had autopen signatures, along with screenshots taken from the Federal Register.",
      "The register is the official, daily publication of various presidential and other government documents - which all have a standard signature created from a single sample.",
      "A National Archives spokesperson told the fact-checking website Snopes that: \"At the beginning of each administration, the White House sends a sample of the President's signature to the Federal Register, which uses it to create the graphic image for all Presidential Documents published in the Federal Register,\"",
      "We looked through presidential documents archived by the Federal Register under both Trump administrations and found identical signatures on documents.",
      "That includes Trump's pardons for the 6 January rioters.",
      "Trump had already signed these pardons by hand, as this video showed in January.",
      "Presidential pardons are also published by the US Department of Justice. We have asked it how these documents are archived.",
      "Are documents signed with autopen legally binding?",
      "Legal experts who we spoke to told us that there is nothing in US law which says official documents signed by US presidents - including pardons - are not legally binding if they were signed with autopen.",
      "Andrew Moran, a politics professor at London Metropolitan University, says that previous presidents have used autopen before.",
      "\"On lower-level importance documents, it's not unusual for an autopen to be used.",
      "\"But I would have thought that with something as serious as a pardon Biden would have actually signed it [by hand]\", he said.",
      "A 2005 memo from the Department of Justice during the Bush administration stated that the President does not have to physically sign a bill for it to become law.",
      "\"The President may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the President's signature to such a bill, for example by autopen\", the memo said.",
      "Although George W. Bush did not use autopen himself, President Obama used it in 2011.",
      "Autopen has also been used by earlier presidents including JFK and Harry Truman.",
      "Can presidents declare pardons void?",
      "Professor Erin Delaney, director of the Global Centre for Democratic Constitutionalism at UCL, says that an attempt by Trump to rescind Biden's pardons would be a \"violation of unwritten constitutional norms\".",
      "Critically, he would not be able to pursue this action without prosecuting, or re-prosecuting the individuals who were given immunity, she argues.",
      "Legally challenging Biden's pardons because of autopen would also call into question other aspects of US governance that use automatic signatures, such as bills passed by Congress and signed into law by the president, she added.",
      "Professor Moran says that a president revoking his predecessor's pardon is extremely rare.",
      "\"Historically, the only example I'm aware of is towards the end of Andrew Johnson's presidency in the 1860s, when he issued some pardons which were revoked before they were accepted. But that's a very small number.",
      "\"If he [Trump] decides that he wants to go after the people who were pardoned, that will end up in the courts and then that would become the point where the constitution is really tested\", he said.",

    "summary": "The prime minister hopes to achieve solid support as he visits the UK and France, writes Lyse Doucet.",
    "story": [
      "Two European politicians, dressed symbolically in red and white, sent a message last week to Canada on social media declaring \"we've got your back\".",
      "Also signalling support was King Charles, who planted a red maple tree on the grounds of Buckingham Palace and wore his Canadian medals during a high-profile visit to a naval warship.",
      "Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney has arrived in Paris before heading to London on Monday - a day after his 60th birthday - for his first foreign visit hoping to achieve more than symbolic encouragement. He wants solid support from allies.",
      "Not only is Canada being targeted, like Europe, by a raft of swingeing US tariffs, but Donald Trump is making it clear he wants to take over his northern neighbour.",
      "\"We appreciate all the symbolic gestures but we need more public backing,\" a Canadian official told me in a voice which underlined the nervous disbelief shared by most Canadians \u2013 Trump is not joking when he calls Canada the United States's \"51st state\".",
      "The official messaging from Ottawa about Carney's trip underlines his priorities - finance and fortifying security \u2013 a natural fit for the economist who headed the central banks in both Canada and the UK. A statement from his office said his visit is meant \"to strengthen two of our closest and longest-standing economic and security partnerships\".",
      "His itinerary is full of great symbolism too.",
      "Carney revealed it on Friday during his first speech as prime minister when he hearkened back - with a shiny polish -  to the origins of this former colony. He hailed \"the wonder of a country built on the bedrock of three peoples: indigenous, French and British\".",
      "So there's a third destination on this whistle-stop tour \u2013 Iqaluit, the capital of Canada's northernmost territory of Nunavut and homeland of its Inuit people. That stop, the statement emphasised, was to \"reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty\".",
      "Spectacular Arctic and northern terrain makes up 40% of the land mass of the world's second largest country. Protecting it is a critical Canadian concern in the midst of intensifying rivalry among world powers in the Arctic region, which has drawn in the US, Russia, China and more; it's the cold war of all cold wars.",
      "And there's a personal twist. Carney was born in the small town of Fort Smith in the Northwest Territories, which lies next to Nunavut.",
      "His schedule underlines that he also needs to be a quick study in a new skill - retail politics. A federal election, which has to be held by October, is expected to be called very soon. Carney needs to prove that he can engage with voters, in English and French, as naturally as he does with bankers and finance bosses.",
      "And he needs a proper political mandate. He secured a whopping 86% of the vote when his Liberal Party chose to replace Justin Trudeau, who stepped down as prime minister amid growing calls to resign from his own party after a decade at the top.",
      "But Carney doesn't have a seat in parliament; he still doesn't have the vote of Canadians.",
      "His Liberal party has just experienced a dramatic reversal, a \"Trump bump\" as well as a Trudeau one. The party which seemed certain to lose, and lose badly, is now tied with its main Conservative rivals in the polls.",
      "Looking like a world leader, and understanding the world of tariffs and trade, is a good look when you are running for high office in the dark shadow of an external threat.",
      "\"I think part of the purpose of Mark Carney's trip to Europe is to show that he can talk internationally to other like-minded powers at this very important moment,\" reflects the eminent Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan.",
      "Back home, voters will decide if that is what counts.",
      "Carney is certain to talk Trump tactics, in private, with France's President Emmanuel Macron and Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. They've both taken great pains to flatter the US president in public, and press their case behind closed doors.",
      "Many will be watching to see how Trump addresses Mark Carney - he recently referred to Canada's former prime minister as \"Governor Trudeau\".",
      "Watch: Trump and Macron's history of intense handshakes",
      "Watch: Trump and Macron's history of intense handshakes",
      "Canada's new top talker has been talking tough.",
      "A week ago, when Carney won his party's leadership contest, he invoked Canada's national sport, ice hockey, which has long been locked in rivalry with US teams. \"Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,\" Carney declared to rousing applause.",
      "\"Make no mistake, Canada will win.\"",
      "But everyone knows this is no game. Carney described this escalating trade war as \"the greatest crisis of our lifetime\". More than 80% of Canada's exports cross the border to the US.",
      "And while there have been a few reports of Canadians flying the US flag, a recent poll by the Angus Reid Institute underlined that a thumping 91% of Canadians reject becoming the 51st state.",
      "Canada says too little, too late as Trump flip-flops on tariffs",
      "Canada says too little, too late as Trump flip-flops on tariffs",
      "On Friday, in Ottawa's icy cold weather, Carney struck a warmer tone, highlighting how he and Trump share a background in business, including real estate.",
      "\"The president is a successful businessperson and dealmaker. We are his largest client in so many industries,\" he remarked. \"Clients expect respect and working together in a proper commercial way.\"",
      "Carney says he \"looks forward\" to speaking with President Trump. But the fact it will be a call, not a visit, is a measure of this moment. Traditionally, the first foreign visit of a Canadian leader is to the US - its closest neighbour and most trusted partner.",
      "On Monday, Carney is expected to sit down with King Charles, Canada's head of state. The British monarch recently expressed his \"deepest affection\" for Canada, and is said to have already penned a private letter to the new prime minister.",
      "In his non-political role, showing love in public may be the limits of the King's power. But even that sends a message to the American president.",
      "Sir Keir has described Canada as \"an ally, and a very important ally too\". But last week, the head of Britain's Liberal Democrats Ed Davey called on him to show more public support for Canada to oppose the \"shocking attacks\" on its sovereignty.",
      "This may be a week of that old adage in diplomacy and politics \u2013 \"to do something and be seen to be doing it\"."

    "story": [
      "More than 200 Venezuelans, who the White House alleges are gang members, have been deported from the US to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador.",
      "Out of the 261 people deported, 137 were removed under the Alien Enemies Act, a senior administration official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.",
      "This broad, centuries-old law was invoked by President Donald Trump. He accused Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion\" on US territory.",

      "What is Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang targeted by Trump?",
      "What is the act?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act grants the president of the United States sweeping powers to order the detention and deportation of natives or citizens of an \"enemy\" nation without following the usual processes.",
      "It was passed as part of a series of laws in 1798 when the US believed it would enter a war with France.",
      "The act states that \"whenever there shall be a declared war [...] or any invasion or predatory incursion shall be perpetrated, attempted, or threatened\" against the US, all \"subjects of the hostile nation or government\" could be \"apprehended, restrained, secured and removed, as alien enemies\".",
      "When else has it been used?",
      "The act has only been previously used three times - all during times of conflict involving the US.",
      "It was last invoked in World War Two, when people of Japanese descent - reportedly numbering about 120,000 - were imprisoned without trial. Thousands were sent to internment camps.",
      "People of German and Italian ancestry were also interned during that time.",
      "Before that, the act was used during the War of 1812 and World War One.",
      "What's Trump said - and what's been the reaction?",
      "Though this is the first time the act has been used by Trump, it is not the first time he has mentioned it.",
      "At his inaugural address in January, he said he would invoke the act to \"eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil\".",
      "In his proclamation on Saturday, Trump invoked the wording of the act by accusing TdA of threatening an \"invasion\" against the US. He declared its members \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies\".",
      "Trump's decision has been criticised by rights groups. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued to stop the removals on the grounds that the US was not at war.",
      "Speaking to BBC News on Sunday, Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU, said: \"There's no question in our mind that the law is being violated.\"",
      "A federal judge attempted to stop the use of the law to carry out the deportations, but the White House said this had had \"no lawful basis\", and that the removals had already taken place.",
      "Reacting to a news article covering the judge's order, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele wrote on social media: \"Oopsie... Too late.\"",
      "Venezuela criticised Trump's use of the act, saying it \"unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration\" and \"evokes the darkest episodes in the history of humanity, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps\".",
      "Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said in a statement that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act was illegal.",
      "\"The only reason to invoke such a power is to try to enable sweeping detentions and deportations of Venezuelans based on their ancestry, not on any gang activity that could be proved in immigration proceedings\", she added."

      "Here is what we do know about Tren de Aragua.",
      "How did the gang start?",
      "Tren de Aragua was originally a prison gang that Hector Guerrero Flores turned into a \"transnational criminal organisation\", according the US state department, which is offering a reward of $5m for information that could lead to his arrest.",
      "Guerrero Flores, 41, was in and out of Tocor\u00f3n for more than a decade.",
      "He escaped in 2012 by bribing a guard and was then rearrested in 2013. Upon his return, he transformed the prison into a leisure complex.",
      "And he expanded the gang's influence far beyond the jail's gates, seizing control of gold mines in Bolivar state, drug corridors on the Caribbean coast, and clandestine border crossings between Venezuela and Colombia, according to the US state department.",
      "The gang's name translates as \"Train of Aragua\", and it may have come from a railroad workers' union. Aragua, on Venezuela's Caribbean coast, is one of the country's 23 states.",
      "Luis Izquiel, a criminology professor at the Central University of Venezuela, told the BBC that the union controlled a section of the railway that crossed Aragua and would extort contractors and sell jobs on work sites.",
      "Tren de Aragua has under Guerrero Flores's leadership expanded into Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile and diversified from extorting migrants into sex-trafficking, contract killing and kidnapping.",
      "How big is the gang?",
      "By most accounts, Tren de Aragua spread out of Venezuela when the country entered a humanitarian and economic emergency in 2014 that made crime less profitable, and now is believed to have nodes in eight other countries, including the US.",
      "The group, in part, operates by forming alliances and partnerships with local criminal organisations.",
      "In Ecuador, for example, the gang is believed to work with groups loosely affiliated with Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, while in Colombia some have alleged that they have worked with members of the left-wing National Liberation Army guerrilla group, or ELN.",
      "Ronna R\u00edsquez, a journalist who has written the definitive book on the group, estimated last year that the organisation has 5,000 members and annual profits of between $10m and $15m.",
      "Others have estimated its membership at roughly half that figure.",
      "A prosecutor in Chile has called Tren de Aragua a \"brutal organisation\" that uses murder and torture to achieve its aims.",
      "While it is smaller or less wealthy than other criminal groups in Latin America, Tren de Aragua is often compared to the ultra-violent MS-13 gang from El Salvador.",
      "Tren de Aragua members have been accused of dressing up as Chilean police officers and then kidnapping Venezuelan opposition military officer Ronald Ojeda, whose body was found buried in Santiago, Chile, in March 2024.",
      "The US Treasury, under then-President Joe Biden, sanctioned Tren de Aragua last summer, saying that the gang was involved in sex-trafficking across the US border.",
      "Is there a threat to the US?",
      "On Saturday, Trump invoked the 18th Century Alien Enemies Act as he accused Tren de Aragua of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion of predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\".",
      "He said the gang was engaged in \"irregular warfare\" against the US at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Shortly after taking office in January, Trump also declared Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organisation, placing the group in the same category as the Islamic State and Boko Haram, Nigeria's Islamist militants.",
      "In Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois, alleged Tren de Aragua members have been arrested in recent months and charged with crimes ranging from murder to kidnapping.",

      "Last summer NBC News reported that the Department of Homeland estimated that 600 Venezuelan migrants in the US had connections to the gang, with 100 believed to be members.",

    "story": [
      "The dramatic political developments in Bangladesh that led to prime minister Sheikh Hasina being ousted last year have thrown up many surprises - including Dhaka's growing closeness with one-time foe Pakistan.",
      "Last month, after decades of troubled relations, the two countries began directly trading for the first time, with Dhaka importing 50,000 tonnes of rice from Pakistan. Direct flights and military contacts have also been revived, visa procedures have been simplified, and there are reports of co-operation on security matters.",
      "The countries - separated by the landmass of India - have deep, painful historical ties. The animosity between them goes back to 1971, when Bangladesh - then known as East Pakistan - launched a struggle to gain independence from Islamabad. India supported the Bengali rebels during the nine-month war which led to the formation of Bangladesh.",
      "While the scars from that period run deep, Dhaka had cordial relations with Islamabad between 2001 and 2006, when a coalition of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami governed the country.",
      "This changed during Hasina's 15-year rule from 2009 - when she was strongly backed by Delhi and maintained a distance from Pakistan. But after she fled to India following mass protests against her government, ties seem to be thawing.",
      "\"For the past 15 years, the Pakistan-Bangladesh relationship was on a slightly difficult trajectory,\" says Humayun Kabir, a former senior Bangladeshi diplomat, adding that the relationship seems to now be returning to that of \"two normal neighbours\".",
      "The developments are being watched closely, particularly in India, which has a long history of hostile relations with Pakistan.",
      "Relations between Dhaka and Delhi have been frosty since Hasina's exit. India has not reacted to Bangladesh's demands to extradite her to face charges of crimes against humanity, money laundering and corruption. Hasina denies the accusations against her.",
      "Some experts think the reviving of relations between Dhaka and Islamabad is a strategic move.",
      "\"Pakistan and Bangladesh have a tactical relationship at the moment. Together, they want to represent a pushback against the dominance of India,\" says Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani academic who is a senior fellow at King's College in London.",
      "There have been other developments apart from starting direct trade.",
      "Muhammad Yunus, head of the interim Bangladesh government, met Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at multilateral forums several times in recent months.",
      "And then there is a growing military relationship.",
      "A high-level Bangladeshi military delegation made a rare visit to Pakistan in January and held talks with influential army chief General Asim Munir. The Bangladeshi navy also participated in a multinational maritime exercise organised by Pakistan off the Karachi coast in February. .",
      "Veena Sikri, who was India's high commissioner to Bangladesh between 2003 and 2006, describes the growing closeness between Dhaka and Islamabad as a \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\" moment.",
      "During her tenure in Dhaka, she said, India repeatedly raised the issue of \"Indian insurgents getting trained inside Bangladesh with the support of the ISI [Pakistan's intelligence agency] and a section of the Bangladeshi military\".",
      "\"We even provided evidence to Bangladeshi authorities,\" she said.",
      "Authorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh denied these allegations at the time.",
      "The long, porous border between India and Bangladesh makes it relatively easy for armed insurgent groups from India's north-eastern states to cross over from Bangladesh. But, after Hasina's Awami League came to power in 2009, it cracked down on these groups and dismantled their bases.",
      "So the revival of military ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan is \"a major security concern for India\", says Ms Sikri.",
      "\"It's not just the military relationship. The Pakistani establishment is also reviving ties with Bangladeshi Islamist parties like the Jamaat-e-Islami, which supported Islamabad during Bangladesh's independence war,\" she adds.",
      "The Yunus administration's press office has flatly rejected Indian media reports that senior ISI officials have visited Dhaka. It has also described reports that claim Pakistani operatives were working to reopen a camp of an Indian insurgent group in Bangladesh as \"baseless\".",
      "Pakistan's military did not respond to BBC questions on India's concerns over the future role of the ISI in Bangladesh.",
      "Analysts say Bangladeshi politicians are aware that, given the close economic and linguistic ties, Dhaka cannot afford to take an anti-India stance.",
      "And despite apprehensions in Delhi, Bangladeshi diplomats argue that ties with Pakistan cannot be normalised unless issues related to the 1971 war are resolved.",
      "During the war, hundreds of thousands of Bengalis were killed and tens of thousands of women were raped. The war ended with more than 90,000 Pakistani security and civilian personnel surrendering to the joint command of Indian and Bangladeshi forces in what is seen as a humiliating chapter in Islamabad.",
      "Bangladesh has demanded a formal apology from Pakistan for the atrocities committed during the war but Islamabad has shown no inclination to do so.",
      "\"Pakistan needs to own the crimes that had taken place during the independence war,\" said Mr Kabir, the former Bangladeshi diplomat. \"We had also raised the issue of the division of pre-1971 assets between the two nations in several bilateral meetings with Pakistan.\"",
      "Even former Pakistani military officers like Ikram Sehgal accept that \"the main stumbling block in bilateral ties is the requirement of the Bangladeshis that Pakistanis should apologise for what happened in 1971\".",
      "However, the retired Pakistan army major insists that Bangladesh should also address the issue of attacks by Bengalis on Urdu speakers during the struggle for independence.",
      "\"I was a witness to the atrocities that took place against the Urdu-speaking Bihari people [in East Pakistan],\" Mr Sehgal, who now lives in Karachi, told the BBC.",
      "While history casts a shadow over ties between Dhaka and Islamabad, economists point out the two countries can first focus on improving bilateral trade, which currently stands at less than $700m (\u00a3540m), mostly in favour of Pakistan.",

      "Some of these issues may be discussed during Pakistani foreign minister Ishaq Dar's visit to Dhaka in April. By the end of the year Bangladesh is expected to hold general elections and a new government may have a different set of foreign policy priorities.",

      "But with data from Hackman's pacemaker, which showed the last record of heart activity on Feb. 18, \"it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hackman probably died around Feb. 18,\" she said.",
      "Cellphone records showed Arakawa made multiple phone calls to a medical concierge service on Feb. 12, according to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff Adan Mendoza initially said her last known communication and activity was on Feb. 11 when she exchanged emails with a massage therapist and was seen at a local grocery store, CVS and pet food store before returning to her home.",
      "Based on her last known activity, it is \"reasonable to conclude\" Arakawa died before Hackman, but the exact day was not known, Jarrell said.",
      "A search warrant issued on Feb. 26, the day Arakawa and Hackman's bodies were found, states the two showed signs of decomposition, bloating in the face and mummification of hands and feet.\u00a0Mummification preserves a body after death and can happen naturally when the skin dries out, according to the National Library of Medicine.",
      "It is unclear what Hackman knew during the time between Arakawa's death and his own. He showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer's disease, Jarrell said.",
      "Where were Hackman and Arakawa found?",
      "Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their home outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to deputies who responded to the house at about 1:45 p.m. local time on Feb. 26.",
      "Hackman was found in what is believed to be the home's mudroom. It appeared he had fallen suddenly, the search warrant says. He was found wearing sweatpants, a long-sleeve T-shirt and slippers.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom near the front door of the home, according to the warrant. The door to the bathroom was opened.",
      "Arakawa was on the ground, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. An opened orange prescription bottle and scattered pills were seen on a countertop near Arakawa, the warrant says.",
      "The pills were a thyroid medication that had been taken as prescribed, Jarrell said. They were not believed to have contributed to Arakawa's death.",
      "Hackman and Arakawa's dog also found dead",
      "One of Hackman and Arakawa's dogs was found dead in a closet of the bathroom where Arakawa's body was discovered, the warrant says. Mendoza said the dog, named Zinna, was in a kennel or crate.",
      "Arakawa had picked Zinna up from a veterinary hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure, Mendoza said. Zinna likely died of starvation and dehydration, according to a veterinary lab report obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, New Mexico State Veterinarian Erin Phipps said at the March 7 news conference.",
      "There were two other dogs found alive on the property when deputies arrived, the warrant says.",
      "How did Arakawa get hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are primarily carried by rodents. Humans can become infected after exposure to urine, droppings or saliva from an infected rodent.",
      "It was not immediately clear exactly how or when Arakawa was infected.",
      "Her and Hackman's home had a low risk of exposure, \"similar to other well-maintained houses in New Mexico,\" Phipps said, but added there were signs of rodent entry in other structures on their property.",
      "Hantavirus initially presents with flu-like symptoms and can progress to shortness of breath. \"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24 to 48 hours roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said.",
      "No signs of a carbon monoxide leak",
      "There were no obvious signs of a gas leak at the home, deputies said.",
      "Santa Fe Fire Department personnel and the New Mexico Gas Company conducted testing at the scene and did not find evidence of a carbon monoxide leak or problems with the pipes, according to the search warrant.",
      "The gas company issued five \"red tags,\" the sheriff's office said in an update on March 4. One was for \"a minuscule leak,\" or 0.33% gas in the air, at a stove burner, which is not a lethal amount, the office said. The other tags were for violations unrelated to gas leaks or carbon monoxide.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills hundreds of people each year.",
      "No signs of foul play",
      "Deputies found the door to Hackman and Arakawa's home \"unsecured and opened,\" the warrant says. They were initially called to the home after someone who arrived to do maintenance did not receive an answer and became concerned, the sheriff's office said.",
      "There were no signs of forced entry or that the house had been rummaged through, deputies said.",
      "What movies was Gene Hackman in?",
      "Hackman's career spanned multiple decades in which he starred in dozens of films.",
      "Some of his notable roles included Detective \"Popeye\" Doyle in \"The French Connection\" (1971), a surveillance expert who suspects a murder in \"The Conversation\" (1974) and a sheriff in Clint Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\" (1992).",
      "He won Academy Awards for best actor in a leading role in 1972 for his performance in \"The French Connection\" and best actor in a supporting role in 1993 for his role in \"Unforgiven.\"",
      "Hackman retired from the screen in 2004.",
      "He also wrote or co-authored adventure and historical novels.",
      "Gene Hackman tribute at the Oscars",
      "The\u00a0Oscars\u00a0paid tribute to Hackman at the awards show on March 2.",
      "\"Our community lost a giant and I lost a dear friend,\" actor Morgan Freeman said of Hackman before an In Memoriam video recognized actors and others who had died in the past year.",
      "Freeman appeared in two films with Hackman, \"Unforgiven\" and \"Under Suspicion.\"",
      "\"Like everyone who ever shared a scene with him, I learned he was a generous performer and a man whose gifts elevated everyone's work,\" Freeman said.",
      "Who was Betsy Arakawa?",
      "Arakawa, who was raised in Honolulu, was a concert pianist and co-founder of a home furnishing business, according to The Associated Press.",
      "When she was 11, she performed at the Honolulu International Center Concert Hall and later in life, she played with the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra, the AP reported.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge dismissed the charges Monday against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in the 1939 musical \"The Wizard of Oz\" after prosecutors informed the court that he died on Sunday.",
      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of Crystal, who had been in poor health with lung disease and other ailments, had been scheduled to change his plea to guilty in January but that hearing was postponed indefinitely after he was hospitalized.",
      "Federal prosecutor Matthew Greenley notified the court in a one-page motion Monday that Saliterman died Sunday but did not say how or where. U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz granted the request and dropped the charges.",
      "Defense attorney John Brink confirmed Monday that his client had died but declined to give details. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Fargo, North Dakota, which is handling the case, did not immediately return a phone call seeking further information.",
      "According to court filings, Saliterman was hospitalized in early January \"for inability to walk and sepsis,\" an infection that can be life-threatening. He attended his arraignment three days later via video from what looked like a hospital room. In an update to the court late last month, Brink told the court that his client had been discharged to a hospice facility and that his prognosis was poor. An accompanying letter from his doctor listed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen and Parkinson's disease.",
      "Saliterman was in a wheelchair and on oxygen last March when he made his first court appearance. He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The sequined red slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Hollywood memorabilia collector Michael Shaw had loaned his pair to the museum before Terry Jon Martin   stole them.  Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million in December, according to Heritage Auctions.",
      "The Judy Garland Museum's efforts to buy back the slippers at auction ultimately failed, despite being bolstered by $100,000 set aside by state lawmakers.",
      "The slippers were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only three other pairs remain.",
      "Martin, now 78, of Grand Rapids, used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum's door and display case to steal them. According to his attorney, an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. Martin's attorneys described the theft as \"one last score\" for the aging reformed mobster. But Martin got rid of the slippers when he learned they were fake, and they ended up with Saliterman. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",
      "Garland was born Frances Gumm in 1922. She lived in Grand Rapids, about 200 miles north of Minneapolis, until she was 4 years old. She died in 1969. The Judy Garland Museum says it has the world's largest collection of Garland and \"Wizard of Oz\" memorabilia.",

      "This year was O'Brien's first time leading the show, which attracted its biggest broadcast audience in five years despite the winning movie, \"Anora,\" being relatively small. An estimated 19.7 million viewers watched the 97th Academy Awards ceremony earlier this month, according to broadcaster ABC, with a big lift among people aged 18 to 49, driven by mobile and laptop watches from younger viewers. It was also the most watched prime-time entertainment show of 2025.",

      "Retired Navy Admiral William McRaven was the architect of the mission that tracked down Osama bin Laden. He's also a bestselling author. Now, McRaven and his daughter, Kelly, have thoughts about children and storytelling:",
      "WILLIAM: When I was a boy, my father, an Air Force fighter pilot, would tell me stories before bedtime, making up characters and weaving them into exciting tales of adventure. Every story had a moral. Elmer the Elf was always honest and kind, helping those less fortunate. Freddy the Frog was courageous and heroic, saving people from aliens and bad guys.",
      "I waited every night for a new adventure, not knowing that I was also learning a lesson.",
      "When I became a father, I wanted to pass that tradition on to my own children, including my daughter, Kelly.",
      "KELLY: When my brothers and I were children, my dad loved telling us stories. Every night, I would eagerly await his arrival, excited to hear a new tale.",
      "What I didn't realize at the time was that these stories were more than just entertaining; they were carefully crafted to teach us valuable morals and lessons that he hoped we would carry into our daily lives. Much as his own father had taught him these lessons, he was now passing them along.",
      "WILLIAM: Now, as parents, we want our children to grow up to be thoughtful, kind, generous, honest, hard-working, and courageous. We hope that they will learn these lessons by watching us, provided we do the right things in life.",

      "KELLY: I've always understood the power of storytelling, but as a new mother, I'm even more aware of how crucial it is to continue our family tradition of reading to my daughter. At a time when reading levels are declining and screen time is on the rise, it's more important than ever to share stories that teach valuable lessons in fun and engaging ways.",

    "summary": "The Emmy-winning star of \"Succession\" earned an Olivier Award for portraying 26 different characters in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in London. And now, she's bringing her chameleonic performance to Broadway.",
    "story": [
      "Sarah Snook set the record straight for us: Her last name is pronounced \"Snuke\" (like nuke), not \"Snook\" (as in book or took).",
      "On Broadway this spring, she's neither Snuke nor Snook, but 26 completely different people. The 37-year-old Australian is chameleonic in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" changing accents, wigs, and gender to tell the story of a man who makes a spiritual bargain to appear eternally young, while his portrait reflects the hideousness of his actions.",
      "The show has suspense, horror, humor, and also a lot of heart. \"People don't often credit Oscar Wilde with something heartfelt,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, he has a lot of pathos,\" Snook said. \"I think there's a lot of empathy for the human condition \u2013 I think, you know, seeing the soul as a real thing and as a part of your body, personality, spiritual makeup that one might need to protect and look after.\"",
      "It's a performance for which Snook won an Olivier (the British theater award) during the show's run in London's West End.",
      "Oscar Wilde published the story (his only novel) in 1890. Victorian critics called it \"poisonous\" and \"morally depraved.\" Now, almost a century-and-a-half later, the tale feels resonant. Snook said today is an interesting time to come to this story, \"where we have such an image-based culture and ability to construct a visual image to sell to anyone online, on Instagram. And part of the reason of playing multiple different characters is about choosing which mask is the right mask, which is the public/private mask that we show of ourselves.\"",
      "After making her name known abroad, Snook is now beloved by American audiences as Siobhan \"Shiv\" Roy, the cutthroat billionaire she played as the scion of a family empire on the TV series \"Succession.\" The saltiness of her Shiv garnered Snook legions of fans, and several awards.",
      "But Snook initially didn't want to audition for Shiv because, she says, she couldn't relate to her being beautiful and wealthy. \"Yeah, there was nothing in myself that I could see as, like, reflective or accessible in that character,\" she said.",
      "Like Dorian Gray, Shiv is an anti-hero, and Snook's been drawn to those complicated characters for a long time: \"I watched a ton of Disney films when I was a kid, and all I wanted to be was Ursula and Scar, all the villains, all the people who had seeming more complexity to why they were that in the first place.\"",
      "Snook discovered that complexity for herself during one of her first acting gigs back home in Adelaide: \"I used to do fairy parties. It was such a good training ground, 'cause kids, man, they tell you if they're not interested.\"",
      "Was she heckled? \"Yeah. Like, 'Fly! Lemme see you fly! Come on! Why can't you fly? Show us!'\"",
      "Kip Williams, the director and adapter of \"Dorian Gray,\" arrived at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney the year that Snook had just left. \"There was this word around school that there was this incredible red-headed actress, so my radar as a director was up for Sarah from the beginning,\" he said.",
      "Williams knew that he wanted to collaborate with Snook, and felt that a single actor could embody all the facets of Wilde's legendary work. \"Oscar Wilde talks about this notion that life is one grand act of theater, and that people are always in a form of performance where they are either revealing or concealing parts of themselves,\" Williams said. \"So, the form of this piece \u2013 one performer playing all of these 26 characters \u2013 is an expression of that idea.\"",
      "It is with technology that Williams illuminates humanity. He calls it \"cine-theater\" \u2013 combining live performance with cameras, large screens, and pre-recorded videos.",
      "So, is it fair to call this a one-woman show? \"I think it is definitely a one-person show,\" Williams said, \"but it is also, paradoxically, an ensemble piece. The camera team and the crew are kind of like her co-performers. They dance with her on stage \u2013 literally, one moment.\"",
      "A dance that feels intimately familiar to Snook: \"The feeling of a camera really close to you and not having that disrupt your train of thought or your flow, I think that's something that was really useful in 'Succession,' 'cause we kind of absorbed them as extra characters in the scene,\" she said.",
      "Snook has a few extra characters in her own life, too. She got married during the pandemic and has a young daughter. But as it turns out, Sarah Snook has not bitten off more than she can chew.",
      "\"So, this is your Broadway debut. Is the pressure off since you've already had such a successful run?\" I asked.",
      "Snook replied, \"Actually, one thing that Kip said on the first day of rehearsals is, 'You can only eat an elephant one spoonful at a time.' 'Yeah, sure. Okay. I'll do it that way.'\"",
      "\"So you think you've eaten the whole thing by now?\"",
      "\"No, now I've gotta eat the Broadway part of the elephant!\" Snook laughed.",

      "A political moderate, Republican Senator Alan Simpson (Sept. 2, 1931-March 14, 2025) served three terms representing Wyoming, from 1979 to 1997, and played a key role in rallying GOP support around the party's legislative agenda.",
      "At 6-foot-7 (he was the tallest Senator up to that time) with a quick wit, Simpson was able to bridge partisan impasses, and foster relationships across the aisle at a time of increasing political acrimony. \"The word 'politics' is interesting,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018, \"because it comes from the Greek, you know that? Poly, meaning many, and tics, meaning blood-sucking insects!\"",
      "Simpson maintained his own views even when they crossed Republican orthodoxy. A deficit hawk, Simpson also supported abortion rights. He served on the Immigration Subcommittee and the Veterans Affairs Committee, among others.",
      "After leaving the Senate, Simpson taught about politics and the media at Harvard University and the University of Wyoming. In speeches he urged college students to become politically involved.",
      "In 2022, President Joe Biden awarded Simpson the Presidential Medal of Freedom.",
      "One of Simpson's closest friends was a Democrat, Norman Mineta, a Congressman from California who also served as Commerce Secretary under President Bill Clinton and as Transportation Secretary under President George W. Bush.",
      "The two had met as Boy Scouts when Mineta and his family were imprisoned as Japanese-Americans in the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center near Simpson's hometown of Cody, Wyo., during World War II. Simpson and Menieta bonded over playing pranks on the other Scouts, including a bully whose tent they sabotaged: \"It was raining to beat hell and we kinda channeled the water down into this guy's tent,\" Simpson told \"Sunday Morning.\"",
      "The two friends would not see each other until decades later, when Mineta (who had become Mayor of San Jose, Calif.), won election to Congress. \"And there we were, and we started right over just like that,\" Simpson said.",
      "Mineta said, \"We'd have fights in the sub-committee, the full committee, and yet we'd slap each other on the back and say, 'Come on, let's go have dinner, let's go have a drink.' And they don't do that [today]. They just don't have that kind of personal relationship.\"",
      "In 1988 Simpson and Mineta joined forces to help pass the Civil Liberties Act, signed by President Ronald Reagan, which for the very first time formally apologized to Japanese-Americans, and granted reparations to those who had been imprisoned."

      "\"Some of these decisions are not difficult. Some of them need to be simplified. And some of them need to be reminded frequently,\" Oz told senators of the healthier lifestyle choices he wants to encourage, adding later that \"the idea of giving incentives to patients is an idea that I think is a worthy one, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries.\"",

      "\"It's the law. I'm going to defend it and use it,\" Oz told senators.",

      "On Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz criticized health insurance companies misusing prior authorization - sometimes delaying treatment until doctors and patients can persuade insurers that it is necessary - as \"a pox on the system.\"",
      "\"We're spending money, wasting money, trying to do a process that should be automated. I would argue we could limit the number of preauthorized procedures to a thousand,\" he told senators.",

      "A majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.",

      "During the hearing, Oz did not respond to the allegation. A memo from the committee's Democratic staff had concluded that Oz may have underpaid his taxes based on a questionairre he submitted, his tax returns and financial disclosures.",
      "\"Now, the doctor will testify about his concern for Medicare's well being, yet he is unwilling to pay the same taxes that millions of Americans pay out of every paycheck,\" Wyden said.",
      "The president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats for months, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.",
      "As part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.",

His bigger challenge: How to provide a measure of certainty on the direction of monetary policy as investors try to peer through the fog of uncertainty enveloping the global economy.",
      "Stocks edged up in morning trade ahead of the Fed's decision, with the S&P 500 rising 39 points, or 0.7%, to 5,653, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5% and 1%, respectively.",
      "Perhaps the most pressing question Powell is likely to face during his press conference Wednesday will focus on the potential impact of the brewing trade war between the U.S. and the country's key trading partners. The barrage of tariffs President Trump has aimed at Canada, China, Mexico, Europe and other countries has yet to make a deep mark on the U.S. economy, but experts warn the trade measures could drive up inflation and slam growth \u2014 a toxic stew known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "Despite signs that the economy is weakening, most Wall Street economists don't expect a recession anytime soon. And in spite of market turbulence caused by Mr. Trump's tariff threats, some experts think stocks are likely to gain strength in the months to come, although not without periodic bouts of volatility.",
      "\"We continue to expect the S&P 500 to reach 6,600 by the end of the year supported by Fed easing, healthy economic and profit growth, as well as AI spending and adoption,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email on Wednesday. \"Investors should consider buying the dip in quality AI stocks, and utilize structured strategies to manage downside risks in their equity exposure.\"",
      "John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, told investors in a report ahead of the Fed meeting that \"markets may have recently become overly pessimistic.\" Although he doesn't expect a recession, he forecasts slower economic growth and described the economy as \"vulnerable.\"",
      "The impact of tariffs and the health of the economy will, of course, help shape the Fed's decision on interest rates, and for policymakers the task amounts to threading the needle. Easing borrowing costs sooner rather than later would shore up growth, but also boost inflation \u2014 anathema to consumers worn down by nearly three years of high prices. By contrast, waiting too long to cut rates could cause the economy to stall.",
      "Investors now think there's a good chance the Fed will lower the federal funds rate three times this year, or a total of three-quarters of a percentage point, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics.",

      "Attacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk's electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted. In Canada, Tesla was removed from an international auto show over safety concerns.",
      "There has been a clear uptick in Tesla attacks since President Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that is slashing government spending. Experts on domestic extremism say it's impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.",
      "In Mr. Trump's first term, his properties in New York City, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role.",
      "\"Tesla is an easy target,\" said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. \"They're rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.\"",
      "Musk critics have organized dozens of peaceful demonstrations at Tesla dealerships and factories across North America and Europe. Some Tesla owners, including a U.S. senator who feuded with Musk, have vowed to sell their vehicles.",
      "String of attacks",
      "The attacks are keeping law enforcement busy. Prosecutors in Colorado charged a suspect last month in connection with a string of attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words \"Nazi cars\" spray-painted on a building. Only weeks, the same Loveland, Colorado, dealership was targeted in another attack involving an incendiary device.",
      "And federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.",
      "\"The statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs,\" the agent wrote.",

      "An Oregon man is facing charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.",
      "Four Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.",
      "In Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word \"resist\" was also painted in red across the building's front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails \u2014 crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid \u2014 and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.",
      "\"Was this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think \u2014 the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,\" Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. \"None of those factors are lost on us.\"",
      "Meanwhile, some Tesla owners in conservative-leaning states are also facing acts of vandalism, including one Texas man whose Tesla was recently keyed while parked at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.",
      "\"I just bought it because it was an electric car,\" Dallas resident Jeff Nguyen told CBS News Texas. \"This one is pretty fun to drive. It has really just nothing to do with politics or anything like that.\"",
      "Tesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn't have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.",
      "More recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Mr. Trump's 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.",
      "Musk continues to run Tesla \u2014 as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX \u2014 while also serving as Mr. Trump's adviser.",
      "Tesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump's election but has since shed all those gains and this year has tumbled 44%, prompting expressions of concern from Wall Street analysts. Measures of Tesla's brand popularity also show the automaker taking a hit, while the company's sales fell in 2024 for the first since since 2015.",
      "President Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric vehicle showroom. The president promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz's podcast, saying \"at least some of it is organized and paid for\" by \"left-wing organizations in America, funded by left-wing billionaires, essentially.\"",
      "\"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"",
      "The progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize \"Musk Or Us\" protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and \"it explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.\"",
      "Some Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle's new stigma and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like \"I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy\" or \"I just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.\"",
      "Prices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla's most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.",
      "\"We're coming after you\"",
      "The White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of Trump's administration and a key donor to committees promoting Mr. Trump's political interests. Mr. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to \"domestic terror,\" and he has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are \"going to go through hell.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said she'd opened an investigation \"to see how is this being funded, who is behind this.\"",
      "\"If you're going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we're coming after you,\" Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network. In a statement Tuesday, she called the attacks \"domestic terrorism\" and vowed to \"continue investigations that impose severe consequences.\"",
      "Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point.",
      "\"It's not the type of act that I would prioritize,\" Clarke said. \"Not right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.\"",

      "Someone recently slapped a \"no Elon\" sticker on the tailgate of her Cybertruck, but she said she doesn't intend to stop driving her Teslas. Other club members have taken a similar view, she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:13:23 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's how economists identify a recession, and where the U.S. economy currently stands amid market turmoil caused by tariff threats.",
    "story": [
      "As tariff uncertainty continues to\u00a0roil the stock market, some economists believe the U.S. could be headed toward a recession, a possibility that even the Trump administration has declined to rule out.\u00a0But how close are we to a recession, and how will we know when we're in one?",
      "While it is notoriously hard to predict a recession, there are definitive criteria that must be met in order for the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group, to determine a business cycle is recessionary.",
      "\"There's no one agreed-upon definition of a recession, but the most commonly used metric is two back-to-back periods of negative economic growth,\" said CBS MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady. \"That would mean that we would see negative growth in U.S. gross domestic product or GDP, over two consecutive quarters.\"",
      "Notably, a financial quarter's growth measure only becomes clear after it's concluded, \"so we wouldn't officially know we're in a recession until we were already in it,\" O'Grady said.",
      "Recessions are generally marked by rising unemployment and a significant decline in economic activity across sectors as consumers cut back on spending and businesses put a freeze on hiring. Since 1929, there have been 14 recessionary periods in the U.S. Most recently, the U.S. economy entered a brief, two-month long recession from February to April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Although U.S. unemployment ticked up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, it remains low by historical standards. Employers added 151,000 jobs in February, a sign that businesses are still looking to hire.\u00a0Retail sales rose in February, albeit less than expected.",
      "For now, the warning signs aren't yet flashing red, economists say.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Another possibility: stagflation",
      "Still, some economists are warning of another, potentially worse outcome for the U.S. economy: stagflation. That informal term \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" \u2014 refers to periods of economic distress when growth falters even as prices remain painfully high. Ordinarily, inflation eases when the economy contracts.",
      "The U.S. last experienced stagflation in the 1970s and early '80s, when oil production became more costly and inflation surged. Reduced consumer spending led to a slowdown in economic growth and increased unemployment.",
      "\"A good way to think about stagflation is an economic balancing problem,\" O'Grady said. \"Let's say you've got high inflation ... that means the economy is supercharged with a lot of demand, which drives part of that inflation. So the federal government will try raising interest rates to make it more costly to borrow money, and then slow down some of that demand.\"",
      "How close are we to entering a recession?",
      "For now, economic data suggests that the risk of the economy entering a recession is relatively low. The U.S. labor market\u00a0continues to create jobs\u00a0at a decent clip and consumer spending remains solid.",
      "\"The unemployment rate is slightly elevated compared to one year ago, and inflation is almost half a percent higher compared to last September,\" O'Grady said. \"These might seem like small signs but when you're taking them with other factors like diminishing consumer sentiment and spending \u2014 and then you've got the wild card of tariffs, there are warning lights of a weakening economy. But we don't have a red light yet.\"",

      "A major shadow over financial markets is the prospect of steep new U.S. tariffs on key trading partners scheduled to take effect on April 2. Those include 25% duties on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as even more sweeping matching levies on a number of other countries.",
      "\"The size, speed and breadth of U.S. tariff hike announcements since January is staggering,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist with Fitch Ratings, said in an email.",

Over the first three months of 2025, the country's gross domestic product is growing at a rate of 1.2%, S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.",
      "That is markedly slower than the 2.3% recorded in the final quarter of last year. For all of 2024, the economy grew 2.8% on the strength of healthy corporate earnings, frisky job growth and resilient consumer spending.",
      "A stark reality is setting in for investors, according to analysts. President Trump's aggressive rhetoric on trade isn't simply a matter of posturing to gain negotiating leverage with other countries; rather, he's perfectly willing to let tariffs fly as part of a long-term strategy of shoring up key American industries and fostering domestic investment.",
      "Whether that strategy ultimately pays off remains to be seen. For now, however, investors are raising their guard.",
      "\"A lot of articles have appeared in the last couple of sessions suggesting the White House is working on improving its 'messaging' on economic/tariff policies and that's great, but investors shouldn't be fooled about what's coming: The trade/tariff agenda represents a seismic change, and even if one buys the view that this will pay off over time, the near and medium-term will see enormous disruption,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told investors in a research note.",
      "To be sure, such disruption could bolster stocks if Mr. Trump were to reverse course on his salvo of tariffs set to be deployed next month. And despite the mounting concerns that such trade measures could tip the economy into a recession, BofA's survey shows that only 11% of fund managers expect a hard landing.",
      "And despite the market turbulence, Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst with eToro, notes that nine of 11 S&P sectors remain in positive territory in 2025. The two sectors that have sunk \u2014 technology and consumer discretionary \u2014 have fallen 7% and nearly 12%, respectively.",
      "\"Because investors' favorite stocks (and those with a heavy weighting in the index) have suffered so much, it's likely impacting investor sentiment disproportionately vs. an otherwise more orderly decline,\" he wrote in a research note. \"Historically, similar levels in sentiment have coincided with at least a short-term bottom in U.S. stocks, although it's not clear that we've seen a capitulatory type move that generally marks the bottom.\"",

      "During the proceedings, Amazon did not contest that the products presented a substantial hazard, but argued that it is not a distributor and is not responsible for protecting the public from products sold by third parties.

    "title": "California fishermen turn to boat tourism as salmon ban continues",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-salmon-ban-fishermen-boat-tourism/",
    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 08:59:39 -0400",
    "summary": "Barred from catching salmon off the California coast, fishermen have been running boat tours to stay afloat.",
    "story": [
      "William Smith has long fished the California coast for salmon, taking avid anglers out on his boat in hopes they'll get to wrestle with and reel in the prized catch.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "Smith, known as \"Capt. Smitty,\" now spends time on the seas with aspiring whale watchers, or scattering the ashes of the deceased \u2014 whatever it takes to stay afloat since salmon fishing was barred in California two years ago due to dwindling stocks. Smith said a rise in the Bay Area's Hindu and Buddhist communities has made sea burials more popular, and he now does more than 200 a year \u2014 and that's helping him pay off his $250,000 boat engine.",
      "\"The bills keep going, whether I've got a fishery or not,\" said Smith, who runs Riptide Sportfishing in Half Moon Bay, California. \"There's no season on when people die.\"",
      "California's sport and commercial fishermen have been walloped by two years of salmon closures and are bracing for a potential third, which they blame on a years-earlier drought and state and federal water management policies they say have made it tough for the species to thrive. The closures have taken a toll on people's livelihoods in coastal communities where salmon, fishermen say, is a special fish.",
      "Salmon must swim upstream to lay their eggs, and young fish make their way out to the ocean through California's waterways \u2014 something done more easily when cool water flows are abundant. The fishery has long been strained and the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages West Coast fisheries, said there will be very limited salmon fishing this year in California, if at all. A decision is due in April.",
      "The dim outlook comes as President Donald Trump has ordered officials to find ways to put \"people over fish\" and route more water to farmers in California's crop-rich Central Valley and residents of its densely-populated cities. Trump has professed his love for farmers and contends too much heed is paid to the tiny delta smelt, a federally-threatened species seen as an indicator of the health of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.",
      "But salmon depend on this same water system for their survival. And some in the fishing community are wondering if fishermen aren't people, too.",
      "\"We are people that are hardworking and it's our jobs on the line,\" said Sarah Bates, a commercial fishing captain in San Francisco. She said local markets have been devastated by the salmon closures and Bay Area restaurants aren't snapping up halibut or other catch as they did salmon.",
      "Decline in salmon population",
      "The history of commercial salmon fishing in California dates back more than a century, and in the 1970s and 1980s the fishery thrived off the state's coast. Over time, salmon fishing has declined with swings in stocks amid volatile weather patterns in a drought-prone state and water management decisions about when surface water, and how much of it, should flow to farms, burgeoning cities and the ecologically-sensitive bay delta.",
      "California's salmon fishing industry includes commercial fleets and charters that take anglers out for recreation.",
      "Jamie O'Neill, owner of Seattle-based Dock Street Brokers, said many of California's commercial salmon fishermen are getting out of the business, selling their permits or simply letting them expire. Permits now sell for a fraction of what they used to, and there are fewer than 900 permits compared to 1,200 in 2010, he said.",
      "Charter operators, meanwhile, have branched out to host boat tours and party cruises, especially since short trips require little fuel and can help offset the cost of boat maintenance.",
      "While fishermen can still catch halibut, cod and striped bass along the extensive Pacific coastline, they say without the all-popular King Salmon, anglers just aren't coming like before. Each fish requires a different bait and technique, and a fast-swimming salmon is a fighter that anglers aspire to catch.",
      "\"One is hamburger, and one is filet mignon,\" said Andy Guiliano, whose sportfishing boat the Pacific Pearl in Emeryville has expanded its historic tour offerings since the closure. \"It makes the cash register ring.\"",

      "President Trump's tariff policies could make building or renovating a home in the U.S. more expensive, according to builders.",
      "The rising costs of construction materials, including lumber, aluminum and steel, could add $9,200 in costs for a typical home, according to a new\u00a0estimate from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), based on data from a March survey.",
      "\"Builders continue to face elevated building material costs that are exacerbated by tariff issues, as well as other supply-side challenges that include labor and lot shortages,\" Buddy Hughes, a North Carolina-based homebuilder and chairman of NAHB, said in a statement.",
      "Multiple factors are pushing the costs for building or fixing up home, according to the trade group. U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China are driving up materials costs, while Mr. Trump's trade threats have also stoked market volatility, making housing developers and homebuyers reluctant to take on financial risks.",
      "Uncertainty around when U.S. levies could take effect and how long they could remain in place is making real estate developers reluctant to commit to new projects, impeding home construction. Prospective homebuyers, many of whom have been sidelined by rising mortgage rates, now also face higher costs due to tariffs.",
      "Greg Kraut, co-founder and CEO of KPG Funds, a New York-based property design and development firm, said such concerns are weighing heavily on the housing industry.",
      "\"Tariffs are causing indecision in the marketplace and eroding confidence, which is leading to developers not leasing or people not building their houses,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Material costs are already elevated, he noted, while fragile consumer confidence and confusion around what form tariffs will take is leading to indecision.",
      "Less demand for fixer-uppers",
      "New York City realtor Kirsten Jordan said buyers are gravitating toward homes that are fully built and move-in ready in order to \"to lock in their housing costs before everything gets more expensive.\"",
      "By contrast, it's a tough-time for sellers to market so-called fixer-uppers, which could cost more than usual to renovate.",
      "\"The fixer-upper buyer is often more price-conscious to begin with, so the tariff premium is a tough pill to swallow,\" she said.",
      "Dana Schnipper, a partner at building materials supplier JC Ryan in Farmingdale, New York, obtained wooden doors and frames for an apartment complex in Nassau County from a Canadian company that cost less than the American equivalent.",
      "Half the job has already been supplied. But once the tariff goes into effect it will be applied to the remaining $75,000, adding $19,000 to the at-cost total. Once JC Ryan applies its mark up, that means the customer will owe $30,000 more than originally planned, Schnipper said.",
      "Bar Zakheim, owner of Better Place Design & Build, a contracting business in San Diego that specializes in building accessible dwelling units, said Canada remains the best source for lumber.",
      "But by sticking with imported lumber, Zakheim had to raise his prices about 15% compared with a year ago, he told the Associated Press.",
      "\"I'm not about to go out of business, but it's looking to be a slow, expensive year for us,\" he said.",
      "Still, Kraut notes there are limits to how much homebuilders can lift prices to offset their own rising costs. \"You can only pass through so much to the consumer, and if the Walmarts and Targets and homebuilders say we can't afford these prices, they'll say you have to lower lumber prices coming out of Canada or we aren't going to buy it.\"",
      "After Trump earlier this month provided a one-month reprieve from tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, including softwood lumber, the NAHB warned that the levies \"will make it harder for builders and their customers to move ahead with new construction projects.\"",
      "In the meantime, the group said it's working to boost domestic lumber production. Currently, more than 70% of imported softwood lumber comes from Canada, while the same share of gypsum, used for drywall, comes from Mexico.",

Yet investors remain jumpy over the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico, European Union and other U.S. trading partners.",
      "PepsiCo shares added 2% after announcing a deal to buy Poppi, a prebiotic soda brand, for a nearly $2 billion. Intel shares rose 8% after the chipmaker named former boardmember and semiconductor industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as its CEO last week.",
      "Moving in the opposite direction: Tesla. Shares of the electric vehicle maker, which is helmed by Elon Musk, slid nearly 5%. The company last week warned in a letter to the Office of the United States Trade Representative that the White House's trade policies could hurt EV manufacturers.",

      "Awaiting the Fed",
      "Financial markets this week will be attuned to the Federal Reserve's interest-rate decision on Wednesday. Economists overwhelmingly expect the central bank to leave its benchmark rate unchanged, according to CME FedWatch. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely be asked if policymakers see signs that the Trump administration's tariffs could boost inflation, which remains well above the central bank's 2% annual target.",
      "Still, Wall Street analysts expect more volatility in the weeks ahead amid ongoing uncertainty caused by global trade spats. The Trump administration has threatened on April 2 to impose matching tariffs on countries that tax the U.S. That's also the date 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, which had been delayed for a month to allow for negotiations, are set to take effect.",
      "\"While financial markets appear to be stabilizing, investors are wrestling with the decision of whether to buy the dips or sell the rallies in an environment of exceptionally high policy uncertainty,\" Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a report Monday. \"A game-theoretic assessment of potential tariff outcomes suggests that Trump's optimal strategy is to announce reciprocal tariffs on 2 April, and then begin to negotiate them lower.\"",

      "Watching your 401(k) plan savings recede as stocks slide can be gut-wrenching, sparking anxiety about whether you'll ever be able to retire \u2014 a particularly loaded issue for Gen Xers, given the oldest members of the generation are hitting 60 this year.",
      "But financial experts say it's important not to panic in the face of plunging markets\u00a0or rising\u00a0recession risks\u00a0because that can lead to rash decisions that cost you money. Instead, it's important to focus on some key investment questions before taking action, they say.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Trump's tariff barrage has spooked investors and soured consumers on the economy, with many fearing that his trade policies will trigger inflation and slam economic growth. The S&P 500 last week briefly moved into so-called \"correction\" territory, meaning the index had tumbled 10% from its most recent high, although it regained some ground on Friday.",
      "The downdraft in stocks is causing angst among people saving for retirement, experts say.",
      "\"First of all, you aren't alone \u2014 a lot of people are panicking,\" TIAA wealth management director Doug Ornstein told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Don't overreact, but it might be appropriate to take some action.\"",
      "The market turmoil comes as many employees already feel behind the curve, with 7 in 10 workers saying they believe they could work until they retire and still not have enough money to fund their golden years, according to a new Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies report.",
      "\"Everyone is navigating difficult waters right now and trying to understand what the effects of market volatility will be on their overall retirement savings,\" noted Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. \"One thing they should be doing, but many aren't, is engaging in the basics.\"",
      "Here are some key questions that experts recommend you consider before making changes to your retirement account.",
      "What is your appetite for risk?",
      "It's easy to think you've got a high tolerance for risk when stocks are in a bull market, as they've been for the last few years. But the current market turmoil may be a sign that that you're more cautious than you thought, experts say.",
      "Risk tolerance is sometimes assessed in a quiz (such as this one from Vanguard) that asks hypothetical questions about your approach towards investing, such as whether you might sell a bond if it lost money in a short period of time.",
      "\"How do I think about risk, and how do I feel about risk emotionally and psychologically \u2014 all of that is completely valid to consider,\" TIAA's Ornstein said.",
      "But it's also important to consider your risk capacity, which involves a more complicated calculation including data such as your age and your retirement horizon. That offers a more objective way to assess risk than your emotional reaction to losing money on investment.",
      "\"Both things are really important: How you feel about risk, and what resources do you have\" to manage that risk, he noted.",
      "Is your time horizon really what you think it is?",
      "Workers often think about their investment horizon as the number of years they have left in the workforce, which might seem daunting to a Gen Xer who is getting closer to retirement.",
      "But the truth, which might not be intuitive to some workers, is that this timeframe is likely much longer than you expect, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Let's say someone is 60 and plans to retire at 67 \u2014 they don't have a lot of time for the market to recover\" before they retire, he noted. \"But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years.\"",
      "He added, \"We'll see a lot of ups and downs, bull and bear markets, presidential administrations, and economic cycles over the next 20 to 30 years, so what is happening right now shouldn't dictate a massive change.\"",
      "In other words, someone whose retirement is just a few years away might have an actual investment time horizon of 30 years, which means sticking to their financial plan.",
      "More generally, trying to time the market, or trading individual stocks in an effort to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, considerable research\u00a0has found.",
      "Is your investment portfolio sufficiently diversified?",
      "Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Buy and hold works well when the market is just going up and up,\" he said. When markets head south, \"It may be a good time to consider rebalancing into a more diversified mix of investments.\"",
      "For instance, that means not only checking your mix of equities and fixed income, but also your mix of sub-asset classes within those categories. Adding international stocks, for instance, on top of your S&P 500 index fund could help spread the risk, as well as considering different types of fixed income investments aside from Treasuries.",
      "And don't forget to tend to your emergency savings, given that having a cash buffer can help in times of financial stress and keep you from raiding your retirement account, noted Transamerica's Collinson. Her group's research found that 37% of workers have tapped their retirement accounts, suggesting that many people use their 401(k)s as an emergency fund.",
      "Workers can ask their employers to set aside a portion of their paycheck in another bank account that they earmark for emergency savings. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies, a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law.",
      "\"The research indicates many workers lack adequate emergency savings,\" she said. \"Now is the time to find out how to build that up.\"",

The index initially rose on optimism that the new administration would create a more business-friendly environment, but that sentiment has changed amid an escalating trade war with some of the U.S.'s closest allies. Mass federal layoffs initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also created tremendous uncertainty for businesses.",
      "Now, the small-cap index is headed toward a bear market, defined by a decline of 20% or more from its most recent high.",
      "\"Some small caps like the Russell 2000 were outperforming the S&P 500 after the election, presumably on the theory that there was going to be substantial deal activity, because these companies are more likely to be acquired and merge than the largest of the large-caps,\" Daniel Hornung, former deputy director of the National Economic Council, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There was a sense that there was going to be deregulation and easier environment for transactions to occur, but there's a huge amount of uncertainty hanging over the economy and markets right now that makes it really difficult for transactions to happen,\" Hornung explained.",
      "Broad-based tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, plus 25% levies on steel and aluminum threaten to raise costs for both businesses and consumers. Smaller companies with tighter profit margins have a harder time absorbing greater input costs compared to larger ones.",
      "Canary in the coal mine",
      "The Russell 2000 comprises small companies across a variety sectors, and is widely considered to be a benchmark for small U.S. stocks. Unlike the tech-heavy S&P 500, it is not weighted toward a particular industry.",
      "Small companies are more exposed to market shocks than larger ones, given that they operate on thinner margins and typically have higher borrowing costs, making the index more sensitive to changes in the economy.",
      "\"It's more diversified at the sectoral level, so it is more representative of U.S. growth dynamics,\" Skanda Amarnath, a macroeconomist and executive director of Employ America, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some of the Russell 2000 companies include commercial jet engine company FTAI Aviation, grocery chain Sprouts Farmers Market, plant-based food company Beyond Meat, and language learning tool Duolingo.",
      "Not pointing to a recession",
      "While the Russell 2000 is only two percentage points away from entering bear market territory, Bank of America Research economists say it's not pricing in a recession, and they still expect the economy to grow this year.",
      "\"Historically in recessions the Russell 2000 has sold off close to 40% on average,\" said Jill Carey Hall, head of U.S. small- and mid-cap strategy at Bank of America Research. \"So it's not pricing in greater than a 50% probability of a recession at this point.\"",
      "Still, small businesses could face significant profit margin erosion with tariffs in place.",
      "Based on the levies currently in place on Canada, Mexico and China, and assuming retaliatory tariffs, Bank of America estimates that the earnings hit could be three times larger for small caps than for large caps.",
      "\"These companies have much thinner margins, so a rise in input costs hurts them more,\" Carey Hall said.",

      "The company raises concerns over retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. that would make their vehicles more expensive, and could dent overseas demand. President Trump increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday, claiming they would help create U.S. factory jobs.",

      "The U.S. previously imposed levies of 25% on Canada and Mexico, which automakers warned could drive up the cost of cars by thousands of dollars.",
      "President Trump has tapped Musk, the CEO of Tesla, to lead the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, established to slash federal spending, in part by culling the federal workforce. DOGE has\u00a0abruptly terminated thousands of federal workers\u00a0over the past three weeks, causing turmoil across multiple agencies.",
      "Tariffs could pose undue burden",
      "In the letter, Tesla underscored its commitment to investing in a domestic supply chain, including by building battery manufacturing and processing facilities stateside. But the company highlighted the complexity of the automobile supply chain, and urged the USTR to consider how companies like Tesla could be \"unduly burdened by trade actions\" taken by the White House.",

The reading marks the lowest level since November of 2022, researchers that compile the data said. Economists had expected consumer confidence to hold relatively steady, according to financial-data company FactSet.",

      "More Americans expressing concern",
      "Consumers anticipate inflation climbing at an annual rate of 4.9% during the next year, their highest expectations since 2022. While inflation abated slightly in February, more Americans are expressing concerns about the economic impact of President Trump's ongoing trade wars, as tariffs are import taxes paid by companies such as Walmart and Target that are often passed onto consumers through higher prices.",
      "\"The klaxon of layoff headlines, a falling stock market and tariff fears were a big blow to consumer confidence in early March,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, in an email. \"The pullback in confidence is becoming a real threat to consumer spending which, as is often repeated, accounts for two thirds of U.S. economic activity.\"",
      "Consumers are also now expecting elevated inflation to be a long-term issue, saying they expect prices will increase at an annual clip of 3.9% during the next five to 10 years, the biggest month-over-month jump since 1993, the survey found. That's far higher than the Federal Reserve's inflation goal of driving the annual rate down to 2%.",

      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and top Justice Department officials said the government may invoke state secrets privilege to block a federal judge from viewing specific information about two deportation flights of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, court filings Wednesday show.",
      "In a filing excoriating D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg for demanding detailed information about the flights, the Justice Department said, \"Continuing to beat a dead horse solely for the sake of prying from the Government legally immaterial facts and wholly within a sphere of core functions of the Executive Branch is both purposeless and frustrating to the consideration of the actual legal issues at stake in this case.\" The filing was signed by Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, as well as top Justice Department officials Emil Bove and Chad Mizelle.",
      "The government argued that Boasberg's demands for detailed information about the two flights from the U.S. to El Salvador Saturday \"represent grave usurpations of the President's powers under the Alien Enemies Act and his inherent Article II powers.\"",
      "The 1798 Alien Enemies Act allows foreigners to be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, including opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they may be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws. President Trump invoked the act Saturday and used it to send the two planes to El Salvador.",
      "On Saturday, Boasberg blocked the flights and ordered them to be turned around if they were already in the air. But the government said that the flights were already in international airspace when he issued his order and argued the judge lacked jurisdiction to order their redirection. The planes landed in El Salvador Saturday night, the Trump administration said. In its filing Wednesday, the Justice Department claimed that disclosing some of the operational information to the court \"could implicate the affairs of United States allies and their cooperation with the United States Government in fighting terrorist organizations.\"",
      "The department argued that the disclosure \"would unquestionably create serious repercussions for the Executive Branch's ability to conduct foreign affairs.\"",
      "Boasberg, who was frustrated by the government's lack of details on the flights and deportation operations during the hearing on Monday, ordered the government to answer a number of questions by noon Thursday, including what time the two planes had departed from U.S. soil, their points of departure, what time the planes left U.S. airspace, when they landed, and what time the alleged gang members were transferred out of U.S. custody.",
      "Bondi criticized Boasberg for requesting the information in the first place, repeatedly accusing him of \"micromanagement of immaterial fact finding.\"",
      "\"The court has now spent more time trying to ferret out information about the government's flight schedules and relations with foreign countries than it did in investigating the facts before certifying the class action in this case,\" they said in the filing. \"That observation reflects how upside-down this case has become, as digressive micromanagement has outweighed consideration of the case's legal issues.\"",
      "They continued to argue that answering the questions posed by Boasberg would subject the government to \"a serious risk of micromanaged and unnecessary judicial fishing expeditions and potential public disclosure.\"",
      "In an order granting the government an additional day to comply with his order, Boasberg also criticized the Justice Department's claim that their responses to his questions would compromise sensitive information, writing that \"the Secretary of State has revealed many operational details of the flights, including the number of people involved in the flights, many of their identities, the facility to which they were brought, their manner of treatment, and the time window during which these events occurred.\"",
      "The federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials was filed by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.",
      "Boasberg's ruling prevents the deportations of the plaintiffs and migrants for 14 days. The Justice Department has appealed the case to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "On Tuesday, lawyers representing the Venezuelan migrants suing the Trump administration warned that failing to block the president from its use would mean anyone could be treated as an enemy alien.",
      "\"The implications of the government's position are staggering. If the President can designate any group as enemy aliens under the Act, and that designation is unreviewable, then there is no limit on who can be sent to a Salvadoran prison, or any limit on how long they will remain there,\" they wrote in a filing to the appellate court.",
      "Despite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said. There are about 250 other alleged Tren de Aragua members still in the United States that the Trump administration is hoping to deport, court filings show.",

      "Howell, who sits on the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., convened a hearing Wednesday afternoon after five of the removed board members \u2014 Ambassador John Sullivan, Judy Ansley, Joseph Falk, Kerry Kennedy and Mary Swig \u2014 filed a lawsuit Tuesday that challenged their firing and what they said was an \"unlawful assault\" on the Institute of Peace, which was established by Congress in 1984.",
      "In addition to the board members, the institute's president, George Moose, was also fired by ex officio board members, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice Admiral Peter Garvin. Kenneth Jackson was then installed as the acting president of the Institute of Peace.",
      "Howell said that \"none of the requirements for removal of a board member were met\" in this case, and added that even if she did reinstate them, because of the president's control over the agency, their power during the period when they were reinstated would be \"very limited.\"",
      "In denying the former board members' request for relief, Howell said it is \"undisputed\" that their removals were not in accordance with federal law, but found that they had not made the required showing for a temporary restraining order.",
      "Still, Howell had harsh words for DOGE and Trump administration officials' treatment of Institute of Peace employees, including Moose.",
      "\"I am very offended by how DOGE has operated at the institute and treated American citizens trying to do a job that they were\" tasked to do, she said.",
      "The dispute over the Institute of Peace burst into public view earlier this week when DOGE team members attempted to gain access to the entity's Washington, D.C., headquarters. The institute said in a statement Saturday that several DOGE members arrived at its building \"unannounced\" on Friday and were accompanied by two FBI agents.",
      "The officials were met by the institute's outside counsel, George Foote, who informed them of the organization's \"private and independent status as a non-executive branch agency,\" according to the statement. The DOGE representatives then left, the agency said.",
      "But on Monday, Moose, the institute's removed president, said in a statement that DOGE had \"broken\" into the building and were able to gain access through an employee of the Institute of Peace's former security contractor, Inter-Con Security Systems, according to court filings.",
      "Foote, the outside counsel, told the Inter-Con employees they were trespassing and called the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department to report their entry, according to the filings.",
      "The institute board members said in their lawsuit that Inter-Con and DOGE personnel \"engaged in additional attempts to unlawfully access the USIP headquarters building, but were eventually able to enter the building, forcibly occupy it, and expel including the duly appointed USIP President, other USIP personnel, and outside counsel.\"",
      "The board members had asked Howell to issue a temporary restraining order blocking Jackson, Trump administration officials and DOGE employees from accessing the Institute of Peace's facilities, computer systems or records. They also sought an order declaring their removal unlawful and void, and preventing their firing.",
      "During the hearing Wednesday, Howell on numerous occasions expressed dismay about the presence of law enforcement alongside DOGE staff.",
      "\"The defendants have not wasted any time bringing in armed law enforcement to help them,\" she said about the alleged takeover of the building.",
      "She reiterated that she was \"offended on behalf of the American citizens who have done so much \u2026 service to this country to be treated so abominably.\"",
      "During an exchange with a Justice Department lawyer, Howell questioned whether Mr. Trump could've gone to the GOP-led Congress to ask for the law establishing the Institute of Peace be changed or used his appointment power to remove and replace members of the board \"rather than taking apart the institute\" with police.",
      "What are the lawful ways to act against Institute of Peace \"without using the force of guns and threats by DOGE,\" she asked.",
      "The Institute of Peace is the latest organization to come under scrutiny by the Trump administration and DOGE as part of the president's initiative to scale down the size of the federal government. Many of these actions have since been challenged in the federal courts as unlawful.",

      "A Republican Minnesota state senator\u00a0arrested earlier this week after an alleged attempt to solicit sex from a minor faces federal charges.",
      "On Wednesday, Sen. Justin Eichorn of Grand Rapids was federally charged with attempted coercion and enticement of a minor.",
      "\"The U.S. Attorney's Office has no tolerance for public officials who violate federal law \u2014 particularly those laws meant to protect children,\" Acting U.S. Attorney Lisa D. Kirkpatrick said.",
      "Eichorn, 40, was also initially charged in Hennepin County with prostitution. The exact charge alleges he \"intentionally hired or offered or agreed to hire an individual who [he] believes to be under the age of 18 years, but at least 16 years of age, to engage in sexual penetration or sexual contact.\"",
      "However, the state charge was later dropped because Eichorn was federally charged on the same allegations, which the county attorney's office says is \"common practice.\"",
      "According to the federal charges, Eichorn's arrest was the result of an undercover operation to target commercial sex involving juveniles, which began earlier this month.",
      "\"Law enforcement placed online advertisements offering commercial sex. Unbeknownst to the prospective sex buyers, it was in fact undercover law enforcement officers who received and responded to the messages,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota said in a release.",
      "On March 11, undercover officers began receiving messages from Eichorn where he, according to the federal complaint, said, \"I saw your post and [sic] change you are still available tonight?\" and \"What's a guy [sic] gota tdo to get with the hottest girl online tonight.\"",
      "During the conversations, the \"girl\" gave her age as 17 multiple times, according to the federal complaint. After one such instance, Eichorn replied, \"I think age of consent is 17 when do ya turn 18 ... It's [sic] says age of consent is 16 ... over 18 is in a position of authority over you like a teacher or friends [sic] parent,\" that complaint states.",
      "Eichorn also asked for pictures multiple times, including \"a naught [sic] pic of you to show me your [sic] real,\" charges state.",
      "Eichorn allegedly arranged to meet with the girl in Bloomington, where he was arrested on Monday. Police searched him and his vehicle, finding two cellphones \u2014 which will also be searched \u2014 a condom and cash, the state complaint said.",
      "After his arrest, Republicans and Democrats in both chambers of the state legislature called for his resignation.",
      "On Tuesday, the Senate GOP caucus put out a statement together, saying he should step down. Sen. Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, told reporters Wednesday that the additional revelations outlined in the charging documents made his Republicans \"more adamant\" in their request.",
      "\"I haven't had time to process the charges themselves. I know there are some challenging things within there,\" he said. \"But again, until we get some more information and look through that \u2014 it's a very, very unfortunate situation, and we've asked for resignation based on the charges and based on the information that we have.\"",
      "Senate Republicans announced they will make a motion on Thursday morning to expel Eichorn.",
      "DFL Gov. Tim Walz also said he should resign because elected officials are held to a higher standard.",
      "\"You cannot prey on our children and expect to get away with it,\" he said.",
      "State DFL Party and at least one DFL senator have called for him to step down. DFL Senate Minority Leader Erin Murphy in a statement called the allegations \"deeply disturbing\" but stopped short of a call for resignation.",
      "He was also one of the GOP lawmakers who called for DFL Sen. Nicole Mitchell to resign after she was charged with felony burglary last April. She has remained in office and has pleaded not guilty. Her trial is set for June.",
      "Eichorn made headlines this week when he and other GOP members of the Senate introduced a bill\u00a0defining \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" as a mental illness in state law.",

      "The Trump administration says it's cutting $175 million in funding to the University of Pennsylvania over policies allowing transgender women to compete in women's sports.",
      "White House officials wrote in an email to CBS Philadelphia that the funding cut is connected to Lia Thomas, a transgender woman and former Penn swimmer who made headlines and drew backlash when she competed for the women's swimming team.",
      "\"UPenn infamously permitted a male to compete on its women's swimming team, overturning multiple records hard-earned by women, and granting the fully intact male access to the locker room. This is NOT the result of the Title IX investigation launched by the Department of Education,\" a senior White House official wrote in the email.",
      "Thomas came in first in the 500-meter freestyle at the 2022 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships and had other top finishes in events at the Ivy League Championships that year.",
      "Some women swimmers disputed those wins. A lawsuit filed in a Massachusetts federal court seeks to have her records removed from the record books. Separately, the Education Department launched a Title IX investigation into Penn allowing Thomas to compete on the women's swimming team.",
      "At the time, NCAA regulations allowed for trans women to compete on teams that aligned with their gender identity. President Trump undid those protections in an executive order signed in February.",
      "A senior White House official said in an email that the funding is an \"immediate proactive action to review discretionary funding streams to those universities.\" The funding that was paused came from the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "A Penn spokesperson said the Philadelphia-based university is aware of media reports and social media posts about the funding being pulled, but has received no formal notice from the White House.",
      "\"We are aware of media reports suggesting a suspension of $175 million in federal funding to Penn, but have not yet received any official notification or any details,\" the spokesperson said in an email. \"It is important to note, however, that Penn has always followed NCAA and Ivy League policies regarding student participation on athletic teams. We have been in the past, and remain today, in full compliance with the regulations that apply to not only Penn, but all of our NCAA and Ivy League peer institutions.\"",

      "The White House official said Wednesday's action is separate from an Education Department investigation into Penn over alleged violations of Title IX, a 1972 law barring sex discrimination in education.",
      "City Councilmember Jamie Gauthier, whose district includes Penn's campus, denounced the decision in a statement.",
      "\"These funds have nothing to do with transgender student athletes \u2014 this is nothing more than a hollow pretext to target our community,\" Gauthier's statement said in part. \"What Trump is really doing is threatening tens of thousands of jobs, our hospitals, lifesaving research projects, educational programs for underserved youth, and so much more.\"",
      "Gauthier added that some prior actions from the Trump administration have not held up to lawsuits and that she is proud that many transgender Philadelphians call her district home.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled in favor of a group of more than two dozen unnamed former and current USAID employees and contractors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday found that Elon Musk and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency likely violated the Constitution when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled in favor of a group of more than two dozen unnamed current and former USAID employees and contractors who had challenged the efforts to shutter USAID, which were mounted by DOGE and Musk, a senior White House adviser who President Trump has said is the leader of the task force.",
      "Chuang granted in part their request for a preliminary injunction and said in a 68-page decision that DOGE and Musk likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and separation of powers.",
      "He ordered Musk and task force employees to reinstate access to email, payment and other electronic systems to all current USAID employees and personal services contractors. The judge also prevented DOGE and Musk from taking any action relating to the shutdown of USAID, including placing employees on administrative leave, firing USAID workers, closing its buildings, bureaus or offices, and deleting the contents of its websites or collections.",
      "DOGE and Musk are prohibited under the judge's order from taking any other actions relating to USAID without the \"express authorization\" of an agency official with legal authority to take the action. The Trump administration is likely to appeal the decision.",
      "\"To deny plaintiffs' Appointments Clause claim solely on the basis that, on paper, Musk has no formal legal authority relating to the decisions at issue, even if he is actually exercising significant authority on governmental matters, would open the door to an end-run around the Appointments Clause,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "He continued: \"If a president could escape Appointments Clause scrutiny by having advisers go beyond the traditional role of White House advisors who communicate the president's priority to agency heads and instead exercise significant authority throughout the federal government so as to bypass duly appointed officers, the Appointments Clause would be reduced to nothing more than a technical formality.\"",
      "Norm Eisen, executive chair of the State Democracy Defenders Fund, which brought the case on behalf of the 26 USAID employees and contractors, said the ruling is an \"important victory\" against Musk and DOGE.",
      "\"They are performing surgery with a chainsaw instead of a scalpel, harming not just the people USAID serves but also the majority of Americans who count on the stability of our government,\" he said in a statement. \"This case is a milestone in pushing back on Musk and DOGE's illegality.\"",
      "USAID was one of the first agencies that came under scrutiny by DOGE as part of Mr. Trump's sweeping plan to shrink the size of the federal government. Soon after the president returned to a second term, the agency, which was established in 1961, became subject to a 90-day pause on foreign assistance funding that devastated nonprofit organizations, businesses and aid groups that received grants and other awards from USAID.",
      "DOGE team members also gained access to the agency's financial and personnel systems, and hundreds of USAID officials were placed on administrative leave. Its website was shut down last month, email accounts deactivated and USAID's Washington, D.C., headquarters were occupied by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "The unidentified USAID employees and personal services contractors filed their lawsuit against Musk and DOGE in mid-February and argued that Musk's actions violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The case was one of several filed after DOGE was established that have challenged Musk's actions and the task force's access to sensitive federal systems.",
      "Musk's role within DOGE has been of particular interest, including among federal judges overseeing court fights involving the task force. While Mr. Trump has claimed publicly that Musk leads DOGE, including during his joint address to Congress earlier this month, Justice Department lawyers have argued that he is a senior adviser to the president and does not have formal authority to make government decisions.",
      "Amid repeated questions about who was leading DOGE, the White House revealed last month that Amy Gleason, who worked for DOGE's predecessor, is its acting administrator.",
      "Chuang, meanwhile, said Musk and DOGE have been behind agency actions throughout the federal government, including at USAID.",
      "He noted that Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla, appears to have been involved in the closure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau headquarters. He said evidence shows that Musk and DOGE \"have taken other unilateral actions without any apparent authorization from agency officials,\" including the firings of employees at the Department of Agriculture and National Nuclear Security Administration.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, the evidence presently favors the conclusion that contrary to defendants' sweeping claim that Musk acted only as an advisor, Musk made the decisions to shutdown USAID's headquarters and website even though he 'lacked the authority to make that decision,'\" Chuang wrote, citing arguments from the Trump administration.",
      "As to USAID, the judge said that the record before the court \"does not support the conclusion\" that decisions to dismantle the agency by permanently closing its headquarters and taking down its website were made by USAID officials.",
      "\"Thus, based on the present record, the only individuals known to be associated with decisions to initiate a shutdown of USAID by permanently closing USAID headquarters and taking down its website are Musk and DOGE team members,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The Constitution's Appointments Clause in part lays out the methods for appointing officers of the United States, divided into two categories: principal officers, appointed by the president with Senate approval, and inferior officers, who generally do not require Senate confirmation. The challengers in the case argued that Musk was carrying out the functions of an officer without being appointed to that role, thus violating the Appointments Clause.",
      "Chuang agreed. He found that where there is evidence that Musk exercised significant authority reserved for an officer while serving in a continuing government position, the unnamed USAID employees and contractors were likely to win on their argument that he skirted the Appointments Clause.",
      "\"The public interest is specifically harmed by defendants' actions, which have usurped the authority of the public's elected representatives in Congress to make decisions on whether, when and how to eliminate a federal government agency, and of officers of the United States duly appointed under the Constitution to exercise the authority entrusted to them,\" he wrote.",
      "In addition to finding that the dismantling of USAID by Musk and DOGE was likely unconstitutional, Chuang found that they lack authorization by Congress to take steps toward abolishing the agency.",
      "\"There is no statute that authorizes the Executive Branch to shut down USAID,\" he wrote.",
      "The judge added that Congress alone has the constitutional authority to take action to eliminate agencies it has created.",
      "\"Where Congress has prescribed the existence of USAID in statute pursuant to its legislative powers under Article I, the president's Article II power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed does not provide authority for the unilateral, drastic actions taken to dismantle the agency,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The judge's opinion warns that there are reasons to be concerned about the potential public disclosure of personal, sensitive or classified information by DOGE team members. He said they \"took extreme measures\" to gain access to classified information, including in secure facilities, \"when there was no identified need to do so,\" and when some DOGE staff lacked security clearances.",
      "Chuang cited one USAID employee on administrative leave who reported that DOGE team members who did not have security clearances granted themselves access to restricted areas that required approval.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-jfk-assassination-files-released-2025/",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 13:51:35 -0400",
    "summary": "One professor said this JFK assassination files release is \"certainly the most useful\" of any so far \"because of the redactions being removed.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Tuesday evening released tens of thousands of pages of government documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, weeks after President Trump ordered government agencies to make their JFK files public.",
      "The documents, totaling some 80,000 pages, had been released before, with sections redacted for national security purposes. The declassified versions did not appear to contain significant new revelations about the assassination, based on an initial review by CBS News. But the unveiling of key portions of the records was cheered by researchers and academics who had long argued that the details in certain reports by the CIA and FBI should have been disclosed years ago.",
      "\"This is the most positive news on the release of JFK files since the 1990s,\" said Jefferson Morley, an investigative journalist and vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, which hosts a repository of JFK-related documents. He called the release an \"encouraging start\" while noting that other troves of documents still remain under wraps.",
      "The records were uploaded by the National Archives and Records Administration, the agency responsible for housing the government's collection of files related to the assassination. The Archives said Tuesday that \"all records previously withheld for classification\" have been released, but not all are available online yet.",
      "Shortly after taking office in January, the president took executive action to establish a process to declassify and release any remaining documents related to Kennedy's killing, as well as the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The order instructed the director of national intelligence and attorney general to present the president with a plan for the \"full and complete release of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\"",
      "What's in the newly released JFK files?",
      "The records are unredacted versions of documents that have been released in redacted form in the past. Agencies like the CIA and FBI have argued over the years that the release of the information would harm national security, even decades after the fact.",
      "According to Morley, roughly 3,500 documents in the government's official collection of JFK files contained redactions before the latest release. There were 1,123 documents of varying lengths unveiled Tuesday, meaning about a third of the remaining redacted documents have been released in full. About 75% of those records were produced by the CIA. More than 500 IRS records have been withheld from public release entirely.",
      "\"These new records shed new light on the events leading to JFK's assassination, including his mistrust of the CIA, the surveillance of Oswald in Mexico City, and propaganda operations involving Oswald before and after JFK was killed,\" Morley said in a statement referring to Lee Harvey Oswald, Kennedy's assassin. Oswald sought a visa to return to the Soviet Union in October 1963 while in Mexico City, and technical details of the CIA's surveillance operations were revealed for the first time in Tuesday's release.",
      "Another notable document released in full is a\u00a0memo prepared by Kennedy adviser Arthur Schlesinger Jr. about a potential reorganization of the CIA after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961. The\u00a0previously redacted\u00a0section details the number of undercover CIA personnel stationed overseas, with Schlesinger expressing concern that covert CIA activities were encroaching on the State Department.",
      "Various investigations into the JFK assassination over the years \u2014 some as recently as the 1990s \u2014 swept up classified information that dealt with intelligence gathering methods and friendly foreign governments but were not directly linked to the assassination. Portions of documents, and some entire records, had remained classified for decades to protect sources and methods.",
      "David Barrett, a professor of political science at Villanova University who studies the Kennedy presidency, told CBS News that \"non-scholars who dive into these documents are going to be baffled as to what most of them have to do with the Kennedy or other assassinations.\" For scholars like him, however, he said it is \"certainly the most useful release of documents that has occurred because of the redactions being removed.\"",
      "\"Now I know who or what is being referred to. So a memorandum on CIA relations with the Miami newspapers, for example, and details on three CIA officers doing technical collection of intelligence in Cuba \u2014 I've never really had those details before,\" he said.",
      "Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of \"The Kennedy Half-Century,\" told the Associated Press that his team is going through the released files in search of a \"long, long list\" of sensitive documents that were previously heavily redacted. He believes some of those passages may concern Cuba or \"what the CIA did or didn't do relevant to Lee Harvey Oswald.\"",
      "Last month, the FBI said it had\u00a0discovered\u00a0roughly 2,400 records related to the assassination during a search stemming from Mr. Trump's executive action. Those records did not appear in Tuesday's release, according to Morley.",
      "Where to read the new JFK assassination files",
      "The documents have been uploaded to a portal maintained by the National Archives, which can be found here. The Archives maintains the government's trove of records known as the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection.",
      "Not all of the files are available online yet, however. Some are available \"in person, via hard copy or on analog media formats\" at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the records that are only available in person are being digitized and will be uploaded to the Archives in the coming days. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard will post updates on social media, and the records will also be on the White House website.",
      "Additional documents remain under court seal, including some for reasons of grand jury secrecy. The IRS-related documents must be unsealed before release, and the Archives and Justice Department are working on making these available.",
      "The Mary Ferrell Foundation runs its own JFK documents repository on its website, which has deeper search functions for exploring the trove of records. The group typically adds new documents shortly after they are released by the Archives.",
      "Why did Trump release these JFK files?",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on declassifying and releasing records related to the JFK assassination, in part due to his political alliance with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long called for more transparency about the assassinations that killed his uncle and father.",
      "In 1992, Congress passed a law requiring the government to release all of its records about the assassination by October 2017, while giving the president the authority to withhold records for national security reasons. In his first term, Mr. Trump unveiled thousands of documents, but some of their contents were kept under wraps after lobbying by the CIA and FBI. Other records were withheld altogether.",
      "Over the course of 2021 and 2022, President Biden likewise released thousands of records but kept key portions redacted, frustrating researchers and observers who had called for their full release for years.",
      "When was JFK assassinated?",
      "Kennedy was shot in the head on Nov. 22, 1963, at the age of 46 while riding in a convertible in Dallas, Texas. Oswald, a former Marine and communist activist who had lived in the Soviet Union, was soon arrested for the killing. But Oswald was also shot and killed in the basement of the Dallas police headquarters two days later.",
      "An investigation led by Chief Justice Earl Warren concluded that Oswald acted alone in shooting Kennedy, but the probe has been widely criticized by academics and historians in the 62 years since the assassination.",
      "Oswald had been on the government's radar before the assassination, a fact that the CIA withheld from the Warren Commission. Oswald defected to the Soviet Union in 1959, and returned to the U.S. in 1962. A self-described Marxist, he worked with a pro-Fidel Castro activist group and had contact with Soviet and Cuban consulates in the months leading up to Kennedy's death.",
      "In October 1963, the CIA intercepted a phone call he made to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, and the documents released Tuesday detail some technical aspects of the CIA's surveillance of Oswald and Cuban and Soviet officials.",
      "The Associated Press and \n                                                  \n                      Andres Triay\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "President Trump has repeatedly said the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and Israel approached the governments of Sudan and Somalia, and have also been interested in Syria, as potential places to resettle Palestinians from Gaza, according to three sources familiar with the effort.",
      "The idea of Palestinian resettlement in another country is one of several options the Trump team is chewing over as part of the U.S. president's larger goal of ending Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" President Trump said Wednesday, when the Irish Prime Minister was asked during the two leaders' Oval Office meeting by a Voice of America reporter about the president's controversial remarks in February when he suggested taking ownership of Gaza to rebuild it.",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a Feb. 4 press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Gaza could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "\"\u200aWe should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this, and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A combination of Israeli and U.S. officials communicated to Sudan and Somalia, two diplomatic sources confirmed to CBS News. Senior far-right Israeli government officials have already been calling for Palestinians to migrate from the enclave. Mr. Trump's remarks have only emboldened Israel to reach out to other countries to explore opportunities for Palestinian resettlement, one source said.",
      "Three sources familiar with Mr. Trump's idea of resettling Gazans to another country told CBS News that his administration and Israel have also been interested in Syria. One source familiar with the Trump administration's Middle East policy said that the administration has attempted outreach to Syria's new interim government via a third-party interlocutor. Another source from the region told CBS News that Syria's government had been approached, but it was unclear whether there had been any response from Syria to the outreach.",
      "A senior Syrian official told CBS News that they are unaware of any outreach to their government by Israel or the U.S. about resettlement of Gazans.",
      "Dahir Hassan, Somalia's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News that \"neither the U.S. administration nor Israeli authorities have approached the Somali government regarding any proposed relocation of Palestinians to Somalia.\" Hassan also cited concern that \"the dissemination of such unverified information risks fueling recruitment propaganda for extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, potentially exacerbating security challenges in the region.\"",
      "The Sudanese government has not responded to a CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Syria's fledgling interim government is just three months old, after toppling Bashar al-Assad and his brutal regime which held an iron fist over the Syrian people for decades. The Arab northeast African nation of Sudan is currently embroiled in civil war and a refugee crisis while suffering pockets of famine. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel over the last two decades, only to be detained in the country's desert-based detention centers or left to live without any formal status. The East African country of Somalia is a fragile, formerly failed state where the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab continues to wage a deadly insurgency.",
      "Since his Feb. 4 news conference, Mr. Trump has suggested Palestinians would have a choice on whether to leave but also indicated that their departure from Gaza could be permanent. In a Fox News interview several days later he said, \"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities, could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they (the Palestinians) are.\" In the same interview, he said that Palestinians wouldn't have the right to return to Gaza under his plan because the enclave \"is not habitable\" and won't be for years to come.",
      "The United Nations reported in January that over 90% of housing units in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million Gazan civilians have been displaced. Gaza's health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in which Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis and took roughly 250 more hostage.",
      "Multiple Arab governments, the United Nations and some Democratic lawmakers, quickly denounced Mr. Trump's idea of emptying out Gaza with some defining the idea as ethnic cleansing. Instead, Arab leaders endorsed an alternative Egyptian post-war construction plan for Gaza last week, but the Trump administration and Israel were both quick to reject it, again citing that the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had been sending U.S. officials on a regular basis to meet with the new Syrian government in Damascus in the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration when the visits stopped.\u00a0 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, was quick to condemn Mr. Trump's remarks in February, saying that the U.S. president's plan \"is a serious crime that will ultimately fail\". It is unclear what the Trump administration's overall policy toward the new Syrian government will be.",
      "\"The Trump administration should engage directly with the new government in Damascus, particularly after the agreement between Damascus and the SDF (the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces). And to ensure that Iran never again gains a foothold in Syria, for the true, enduring defeat of ISIS, and to conduct a full withdrawal of U.S. forces in the right way unlike what unfolded in Afghanistan,\" Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Washington-based advocacy and humanitarian organization Syrian Emergency Task Force, told CBS News.",
      "Israel has conducted widespread airstrikes in Syria since December, on what it described as Assad regime weapons sites, and seized territory in the buffer zone between both countries. This past week, Israel struck inside a Damascus suburb, saying it was taking out the headquarters of the Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group that has a substantial foothold in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "A State Department spokesperson deferred to the Israeli government, and told CBS News that Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff \"continues to work tirelessly towards either an extension of Phase One (of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement) or an advance to Phase Two with these principles in mind\".",
      "The State Department also referred to remarks by Witkoff from a February Fox News interview in which he said, \"We need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for Gazans and Palestinians.\"",
      "Witkoff also suggested in the same Fox interview that Gaza's entire Palestinian population could go to other Middle East-based Arab nations and other countries beyond the region: \"I think that the president's solution is: how do we address where two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are: in some respects, Egypt, in some respects, Jordan; but in some respects other countries who have called us up and voluntarily said this is a humanitarian effort, we want to help you\".",
      "Asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday about whether the Trump administration is talking to other countries about relocation of two million Palestinians in Gaza, Witkoff said again \"I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that lead to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things.\"",
      "Millions of displaced Palestinians already live in surrounding Arab countries as refugees, including in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Far-right Israeli ministers have increasingly called for moving Palestinians in Gaza and also in the West Bank off their land as part of the extreme view it would fulfill a Biblical claim by Jews to the land, and increase Israel's security.",
      "The Israeli government, the White House and its National Security Council all declined to respond to multiple CBS News requests for comment.",
      "Trump's son-in-law and former advisor Jared Kushner first suggested that Gaza's \"waterfront property could be very valuable, if people would focus on building up livelihoods\" during an on-camera discussion at Harvard University in February 2024.",
      "The Associated Press was the first to report Friday that the U.S. and Israel had contacted Sudan, Somalia, and also Somaliland, about resettling Palestinians from Gaza.",
      "Correction: This story has been edited to accurately reflect the number of Israelis taken hostage on Oct. 7, 2023.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 09:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes ruled in favor of transgender active-duty service members and transgender people in the process of enlisting.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday blocked enforcement of a new Defense Department policy barring transgender people from serving in the U.S. military.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes granted a request for a preliminary injunction sought by transgender active-duty service members and transgender people who are in the process of enlisting. The judge's order temporarily blocks Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the military services from implementing President Trump's executive order and additional guidance that prohibits transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "But the judge put her order on hold until March 21 to give the Justice Department time to seek emergency relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Reyes, appointed by former President Joe Biden, issued her decision after holding several hours of hearings earlier this month, during which she sharply questioned Justice Department lawyers about the Defense Department's justifications for the ban.",
      "\"Indeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed \u2014 some risking their lives \u2014to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them,\" Reyes wrote in her 79-page decision, later adding, \"The court's opinion is long, but its premise is simple.\u00a0 In the self-evident truth that 'all people are created equal,' all means all. Nothing more. And certainly nothing less.\"",
      "Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights for GLAD Law, one of the lead attorneys in the case, called the ruling \"decisive\" and said it \"speaks volumes.\"",
      "\"The court's unambiguous factual findings lay bare how this ban specifically targets and undermines our courageous service members who have committed themselves to defending our nation. Given the court's clear-eyed assessment, we are confident this ruling will stand strong on appeal,\" Levi said in a statement.",
      "A spokesperson for the Justice Department called the ruling \"the latest example of an activist judge attempting to seize power at the expense of the American people, who decisively voted to elect President Trump.\"",
      "The policy arose out of an executive order Mr. Trump issued in late January that directed Hegseth to implement a policy for transgender service members based on troop readiness. The order stated that \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life. A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\"",
      "The executive order also\u00a0revoked a measure implemented in January 2021 by then-President Joe Biden that allowed transgender individuals to serve in the U.S. military.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's directive, Hegseth issued a memorandum in early February that halted recruitment of new service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria and paused gender-affirming care for transgender troops. The Pentagon then said in a late February document that the U.S. would begin removing transgender troops from the military within 30 days unless they obtained a waiver.",
      "The memo said that individuals with a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria \"are no longer eligible for military service.\" It also said that pronoun usage when referring to a service member must reflect his or her sex and barred the use of Pentagon funds for gender-affirming care.",
      "Roughly 1,892 active-duty members of the military received gender-affirming care from the Defense Department between January 2016 and May 2021, according to a January report from the Congressional Research Service. While a Justice Department lawyer told the court earlier this month that the Pentagon does not have data on service members by gender identity, a defense official said that as of Dec. 9, there were about 4,200 troops who had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "Between 2015 and 2024, the Defense Department spent $52 million for care to active-duty service members to treat gender dysphoria, according to a February 26 memo from the Pentagon.",
      "The lawsuit before Reyes was filed in late January by a group of more than a dozen transgender active-duty service members, one person enlisted in U.S. Army basic training and five transgender people who were in the process of enlisting. They argued that the ban was unconstitutional and sought a court order blocking its enforcement.",
      "In her decision, Reyes found that the challengers were likely to succeed on their claim that the ban fails a higher level of judicial scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, because it classifies based on sex and transgender status. The judge also held that the Trump administration's policy is likely driven by unconstitutional animus.",
      "\"The Military Ban is soaked in animus and dripping with pretext,\" she wrote. \"Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.\"",
      "Reyes wrote that Mr. Trump and the Defense Department \"could have crafted a policy that balances the nation's need for a prepared military and Americans' right to equal protection. They still can. The Military Ban, however, is not that policy. The court therefore must act to uphold the equal protection rights that the military defends every day.\"",
      "The judge said government's policy is \"overbroad\" and also includes \"derogatory generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of transgender persons.\" Such generalizations, Reyes wrote, \"do not suffice to show that a sweeping discriminatory ban is substantially related to military readiness and unit cohesion.\"",
      "The decision from Reyes is likely to be appealed by the Justice Department, but it is the latest legal setback for the Trump administration, since several of its policies have been temporarily blocked by federal judges. A second challenge to the Mr. Trump's military ban is currently underway in Washington state.",
      "Mr. Trump sought to bar transgender people from serving in the military during his first term, in 2017, but an initial Pentagon policy was blocked by federal courts. The plan was then revised in 2018, and it took effect the following year and remained in place until the start of the Biden administration.",

    "summary": "Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler were tapped by the treasury secretary to lead reform efforts at the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has promoted two agents with the Internal Revenue Service who said they faced retaliation after blowing the whistle to Congress and speaking out to CBS News about political interference into their investigation of Hunter Biden's tax crimes.",
      "IRS special agents Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler were assigned to Bessent's office as senior advisers for IRS reform, and Shapley was named deputy director of criminal investigations at the agency.",
      "The promotions stand in stark contrast to President Trump's decision on Monday to revoke Secret Service protections for Hunter Biden, despite an executive order signed by his father, former President Joe Biden, extending those protections through July.",
      "Shapley and Ziegler first came forward in 2023, alleging the Department of Justice \"slow-walked\" the yearslong tax probe into Hunter Biden, and that prosecutors told them not to pursue investigative leads related to his father. They were removed from the case \u2014 and temporarily sidelined with pay.",
      "The duo's disclosures came ahead of a series of court decisions that ultimately led President Biden to pardon his son for the crimes related to the agents' investigation. Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to those crimes after a Delaware judge rejected a plea deal that would have given him broad immunity.",
      "\"We have been motivated by one singular mantra: do what's right,\" Shapley said in a statement. \"It's never been easy, and there have been more pitfalls than one would hope, but we appreciate the opportunity Secretary Bessent is giving us to utilize our skills and firsthand knowledge of the agency to further the work of the administration to root out waste and fraud from the federal government and make a difference.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News Tuesday, Bessent said he is giving Shapley and Ziegler \"a year to investigate the wrongdoing that's going on at the IRS,\" adding that they will make sure \"this Hunter Biden nonsense\" doesn't repeat itself.",
      "The new assignments come as the IRS is drafting plans to cut its workforce by as much as half through layoffs, attrition and buyouts, part of the Trump administration's effort to downsize the federal government. And the prominent postings are an abrupt departure from the tenuous relationship the two IRS whistleblowers previously had with the tax agency.",
      "In December, the federal watchdog that investigates whistleblower complaints substantiated claims by Shapley and Ziegler alleging the IRS had retaliated against them when agency leadership had removed the two agents from the Hunter Biden case at DOJ's request.",
      "The retaliation claim was part of an effort by Shapley and Ziegler to push back against what they believed was a wide-ranging effort by Hunter Biden's attorneys to discredit them. In September, the two men sued Abbe Lowell \u2013 one of Hunter Biden's attorneys \u2013 for defamation.

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 21:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The chief justice's statement came after President Trump called for a federal judge to be impeached.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement Tuesday defending federal judges who have issued decisions against the Trump administration, saying that \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement\" with a court's decision.",
      "\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" Roberts said in the statement distributed by the Supreme Court's public information office. \"The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"",
      "Roberts' statement comes after President Trump attacked a federal district judge on Truth Social and called for his impeachment. The judge, James Boasberg, temporarily\u00a0blocked the Trump administration on Saturday from using the wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to detain and deport noncitizens.",
      "Boasberg had issued an oral order from the bench requiring planes carrying 261 people that were on their way to Central America to return to the U.S. The Trump administration had alleged that 137 of the people on board the planes had ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and were removed from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act. Despite Boasberg's order, two planes landed in El Salvador, sparking allegations that the Trump administration had defied a court order.",
      "\"This Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President - He didn't WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didn't WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didn't WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDN'T WIN ANYTHING!\" Mr. Trump wrote in his post.",
      "The president added that Boasberg and \"many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before\" should be \"IMPEACHED!!!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's targeting of Boasberg, who was appointed to the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., by President Barack Obama, is an escalation in the ongoing attacks on federal judges who have been overseeing the dozens of challenges to the president's policies. Some of those judges have ordered the Trump administration to put its plans on hold while legal proceedings move forward, sparking condemnations from the president's allies and threats of impeachment. The Justice Department has appealed many of those rulings and sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court\u00a0in three court fights\u00a0so far.",
      "Federal judges are appointed for life and can only be removed from the bench if they are impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate. Just 15 judges have been impeached in U.S. history, most recently in 2010. Eight of those 15 have been convicted and removed from office.",
      "Elon Musk, a senior adviser to the president, has taken to social media repeatedly to call on the judges to be impeached, claiming they are \"evil.\"",
      "In a\u00a0post last month on X, the social media company he owns, Musk claimed the country is witnessing \"an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges.\" In\u00a0another post, he wrote that there \"need to be some repercussions above zero for judges who make truly terrible decisions.\"",
      "Republicans in the House have also\u00a0introduced impeachment resolutions\u00a0against at least three judges because of rulings they dislike, which were issued in the early stages of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "In response to the attacks on members of the judiciary, two Republican-appointed judges warned last week that they strike at judicial independence.",
      "\"Our system of government is premised on three independent branches and a judiciary that can function independently,\" Judge Richard Sullivan, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, said during a call with reporters hosted by the Judicial Conference. \"That's what makes it work, and so it's crucial that people understand that.\"",
      "Judge Jeffrey Sutton, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, said it's a \"shame\" to see judges attacked simply for doing their jobs.",
      "\"Threats to judges are threats to judicial independence. They've been around for a long time. There's lots of different mechanisms. Threats of impeachment \u2014 this is not the first time this has happened,\" he said. \"One thing worth keeping in mind is if we dilute the standards for impeachment, that's not just a problem for judges, that's a problem for all three branches of government.\"",
      "Roberts has spoken about the importance of judicial independence before, namely in his year-end report issued to close out 2024. He highlighted four areas that he said threatened the independence of judges: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.",
      "Roberts is the presiding officer of the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for the judiciary. Such statements from the chief justice are rare, but it is not the first time Roberts has pushed back against Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "In 2018, after the president complained about a federal judge who ruled against an asylum policy during his first term and referred to him as an \"Obama judge,\" Roberts said the U.S. doesn't have \"Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"",

A Russian readout of the call from the Kremlin said a key condition for working toward a resolution to the conflict \"should be the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv.\" The White House readout did not contain that information, or Mr. Trump's response.",
      "\"My phone conversation today with President Putin of Russia was a very good and productive one,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"We agreed to an immediate ceasefire on all energy and infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a complete ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible war between Russia and Ukraine. ... Many elements of a contract for peace were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are being killed, and both President Putin and President Zelenskyy would like to see it end.\"",

The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace. These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.\"",

    "summary": "Some information demanded by a judge about flights carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members is likely to remain private, the Justice Department said.",
    "story": [
      "Plaintiffs suing the Trump administration over use of a war authority to deport alleged gang members warned that failing to block the president from its use would mean anyone could be treated as an enemy alien.",
      "The lawyers for Venezuelan migrants suing the government said Tuesday in an appellate court filing: \"The implications of the government's position are staggering. If the President can designate any group as enemy aliens under the Act, and that designation is unreviewable, then there is no limit on who can be sent to a Salvadoran prison, or any limit on how long they will remain there.\"",
      "Those subject to the 1798 Alien Enemies Act can be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, including opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they may be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws. President Trump invoked the act Saturday, and used it to send two planes carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members to a prison in El Salvador.",
      "In a hearing Saturday, D.C. U.S. Chief District Judge James Boasberg blocked their deportation, prompting an immediate Justice Department appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer provided new details about the Trump administration's deportation flights of alleged gang members, but continued to argue the government had a right to reject a judge's order directing the planes to return to the U.S., even if they were already in the air.",
      "According to a sworn declaration by Robert Cerna, the acting field office director of ICE's enforcement and removal operations, the two planes \"departed U.S. territory and airspace before 7:25 p.m.\" on Saturday \u2014 40 minutes after D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg verbally ordered the planes to be returned to the U.S. during a hearing Saturday evening.",
      "The government reiterated Tuesday that because the planes were over international waters and airspace by the time the judge ordered them to turn around, Boasberg no longer had jurisdiction over the migrants.",
      "Attorneys for the Trump administration had also argued in a hearing on Monday that Boasberg did not have authority to redirect the planes because the judge had not put his order demanding the planes to return to the U.S. in writing. The judge responded that his order applied to the planes, regardless of where they were in the air.",
      "Cerna said the government's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to justify the removal of alleged Tren de Aragua members was signed Friday evening, a day before the flights were publicly announced on Saturday by the White House.",
      "His testimony is part of a court-mandated series of responses to Boasberg, who was frustrated by the government's lack of details on the flights and deportation operations during the hearing on Monday. The rest of the answers Boasberg requested are likely to remain private because of \"operational issues,\" a Justice Department attorney told the court, declining to provide the court with this information publicly.",
      "Those details are likely to include whether additional planes have left the U.S. with alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, a timeline showing when the flights took off from the U.S. and landed in El Salvador and a count of remaining members of the gang in U.S. custody.",
      "Cerna's sworn testimony did not provide all of this information, though he noted that 54 members of Tren de Aragua are in detention in the U.S., and approximately 172 are on the non-detained docket, which means they are not being detained by the government as their immigration proceedings continue. There are also approximately 32 are in criminal custody who have active detainers \u2014 that is, ICE has asked that they be held for up to 48 hours after they're scheduled to be released.",
      "Despite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said.",
      "The federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials was filed by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.",
      "Boasberg's ruling prevents the deportations of the plaintiffs and migrants for 14 days.",

      "The Trump administration provided a detailed accounting\u00a0of the number of probationary employees, generally considered those who were in their jobs for less than one year, who were targeted in the president's drastic plans to scale back the federal workforce in court filings Monday. The information was submitted as part of the administration's compliance with a temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge James Bredar last week.",

      "In their declarations, the human resources officials across the federal government said they were working to comply with Bredar's order. But they all warned that reinstating removed employees would cause \"significant confusion\" and turmoil for those workers. The officers also noted that an appeals court could reverse the district court's order, subjecting affected employees to multiple changes in their employment status in just a few weeks.",
      "Most of the employees who were rehired were placed on administrative leave with full pay and benefits, the human resources officials said. In a separate filing in a case challenging the mass firings brought in California, Justice Department lawyers said that the administrative leave placement is \"a first part of a series of steps to reinstate probationary employees\" and an \"intermediate measure taken by a number of the agencies in order to return probationary employees to full duty status.\" The judge in that case last week ordered the Trump administration to reinstate fired probationary workers at six agencies.",

    "story": [
      "London - Some court documents related to a freedom of information request to access Prince Harry's U.S. immigration files were released on Tuesday, under an order issued by a Washington D.C. district court, after the conservative Heritage Foundation alleged that the British royal\u00a0may have concealed past drug use when he applied for his visa. Harry currently lives in California with his wife, Meghan, and their children.",
      "The documents released included court filings from several federal agencies responding to the Heritage Foundation's request. They did not include the prince's immigration records. Portions of the documents relating to him or his immigration status were heavily redacted.",
      "Applications for visas to live in the United States ask about current and historical drug use. Admission of drug use can lead to visa applications being rejected, but immigration officers have discretion to make their final decisions on a number of factors. Lying on visa applications can lead to lifetime bans on entering the U.S.",

      "A 48-year-old woman and 29-year-old man were arrested for allegedly providing illegal abortions and operating a network of unlicensed clinics in the Houston area, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced this week.",
      "Paxton said that Maria \"Dr. Maria\" Rojas is a known midwife in Northwest Houston and was taken into custody in Waller County. She is accused of performing illegal abortions, which violates the\u00a0Texas Human Life Protection Act. The\u00a0law bans abortion after six weeks.",
      "During an investigation, the attorney general's office found that Rojas owned and operated multiple clinics under the names Clinica Waller Latinoamericana in Waller, Clinica Latinoamericana Telge in Cypress, both northwest of Houston, and Latinoamericana Medical Clinic in Spring, just north of Houston.",
      "The press release from Paxton's office alleged that Rojas' clinics employed unlicensed people who \"falsely presented themselves as licensed medical professionals.\"",
      "Jose Manuel Cendan Ley was also taken into custody on Monday and charged with an unlawful performance of an abortion and unlicensed practice of medicine. According to Paxton, Ley performed illegal medical procedures and assisted Rojas in at least one abortion procedure.",
      "\"In Texas, life is sacred. I will always do everything in my power to protect the unborn, defend our state's pro-life laws, and work to ensure that unlicensed individual endangering the lives of women by performing illegal abortions are fully prosecuted,\" Paxton said. \"Texas law protecting life is clear and we will hold those who violate it accountable.\"",
      "Holly Shearman, a friend of Rojas', told CBS News she spoke with her after the arrest. \"She was adamant she was innocent. Midwives around the state are rallying around her,\" Shearman said.",

      "Paxton also announced Tuesday that Rubildo Labanino Matos, 54, had been arrested on March 8 in connection to the investigation.

      "Schumer initially signaled last week that his caucus would fight back against a partisan measure to keep the government funded. But a day later, he reluctantly pledged to advance the continuing resolution, delivering one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the measure to passage. The move has prompted frustrations among some within his party, and questions about his leadership, but Schumer has repeatedly defended his decision.",
      "\"I knew when I took this vote there'd be a lot of protests, but I felt I had to do it for the future, not only of the Democratic Party, but the country,\" Schumer said, adding that \"as bad as that CR bill was \u2014 and it was bad \u2014 a shutdown is 10 times worse.\"",
      "Schumer said a shutdown would have given \"sole power\" to the executive branch and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to determine what remained open and closed during a shutdown, saying \"within two weeks, everyone would have been howling.\"",
      "The New York Democrat said he and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries had a strategy to try to get a bipartisan bill to keep the government funded. But they didn't expect that House Republican leadership would be able to keep its conference together to advance the partisan continuing resolution \u2014 a heavy lift that defied the typical political dynamics, with conservatives who routinely oppose continuing resolutions joining their party to support the measure.",
      "Schumer said a \"shutdown would have been the greatest disaster,\" putting the government in the hands of \"evil, nasty, nihilistic people\" like Musk, President Trump and OMB Director Russ Vought.",
      "\"We would have had half the federal government we have now,\" Schumer said. \"So I thought I did the thing a leader should do: Even when people don't see the danger around the curve, my job was to alert people to it \u2014 and I knew I'd get some bullets.\"",
      "On the question of his leadership, Schumer said he isn't going anywhere, citing his record as leader on winning Senate seats, including in 2021, when Democrats secured a majority in the upper chamber with two surprise runoff victories in Georgia. Schumer came to Congress in 1981, representing New York in the House before being elected to the Senate in 1998. He's led Democrats as leader in the Senate since 2017.",
      "Schumer said Democrats are fighting back against the Trump administration with a message focused on how GOP leaders want to \"screw every average American so they can get tax cuts for the rich,\" saying the strategy is \"beginning to work.\"",
      "\"If we keep at it every day, relentless fighting and showing how they're hurting people so badly, Trump's numbers will get much lower, and his both popularity, but also his effectiveness will decline,\" Schumer said. \"I believe that strategy will work.\"",
      "Tuesday's interview was held one day after\u00a0Schumer postponed events to promote his book, \"Antisemitism in America: A Warning,\" this week, citing security concerns following backlash from his move to keep the government funded. Schumer had a number of events scheduled this week in Maryland, New York City, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania and California.",
      "Schumer said he wrote the book aimed at a number of audiences \u2014 including his \"friends on the left.\" He noted that while \"we've always seen antisemitism on the right,\" more recently \"a lot of it's trickled over to the left.\"",

      "After Mr. Trump signed an executive order that seeks to make sweeping cuts at the nation's largest international broadcaster, about 1,300 employees, including Abramowitz, learned over the weekend they had been placed on administrative leave, and another 500 contractors were terminated. Mr. Trump accused the news agency, which began broadcasting during World War II, of spreading \"radical propaganda.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News Monday, Abramowitz called VOA \"an incredibly important soft power tool\" for the U.S. and said shuttering it would be a \"self-inflicted blow\" to national security because VOA's news coverage helps to combat Chinese, Russian and Iranian disinformation.",
      "\"If America pulls off the playing field and cedes it to our adversaries, then they're going to be telling the narratives that people around the world are going to be hearing, and that can't be good for America,\" he said. \"They're going to be hearing an anti-America narrative.

      "\"We are getting through to an audience that might otherwise hear propaganda,\" Abramowitz said, adding that many VOA journalists are from countries under authoritarian control. \"The major challenge for the United States in general is this global information war in which countries like China and Russia are essentially really having our lunch. \u2026 So, I really feel that we need an organization that is accurate, unbiased, objective, and that tells the truth about America to the rest of the world in the languages that they understand.\"",

He also demanded explanations about removal flights ordered since President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act\u00a0Saturday.",
      "During a hearing on the Trump administration's compliance with his order, D.C District Chief Judge James Boasberg demanded answers by Tuesday at noon to clarify what occurred Saturday \u2014 both before and after he blocked the government's removal flights. He asked the government whether additional planes have left the U.S. with Tren de Aragua gang members, and he wants a timeline showing when the flights took off from the U.S. and landed in El Salvador and a count of remaining members of the gang in U.S. custody.",
      "Boasberg also demanded detailed timing on when President Trump's order invoking the Alien Enemies Act was signed and went into effect. The 1798 act is a wartime authority allowing the president to detain and deport noncitizens. Mr. Trump is utilizing the act to detain and deport all Venezuelan migrants 14 years of age and older who are suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "A Justice Department attorney argued that because the judge did not put his order demanding the planes to return to the U.S. in writing, the government was not bound by it, but he added that even if the order had been written, the president had the authority to keep the flights en route to their final destination.",
      "\"You're telling me your first argument is when I said those things, because I didn't say it in a minute order that the plaintiffs didn't have to turn around, you didn't have to comply?\" Boasberg said. \"You're saying that you felt you could disregard it because it wasn't in a written order?\"",
      "The attorney did not provide details about how many deportation flights left Saturday, claiming that there were \"operational issues\" prohibiting him from answering. When Judge Boesberg mentioned the two flights that departed Texas at 5:26 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. local time, the attorney said that he was \"not at liberty\" to provide information about the flights.",
      "It sparked a tense back and forth between Judge Boesberg and the government over whether or not it was asserting the flight information was classified.",
      "The Justice Department also argued that because the planes were over international waters and airspace by the time the judge ordered them to turn around, that Boasberg no longer had jurisdiction over the migrants.",
      "The judge responded that his order applied to the planes, regardless of where they were in the air.",
      "The Trump administration said the two planes had left before the judge made his decision, and a third plane left for El Salvador shortly afterwards, though details about the passengers on that plane are unclear.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 07:24:30 -0400",
    "summary": "The new findings come from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which sits on a telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists are homing in on the nature of a mysterious force called dark energy, and nothing short of the fate of the universe hangs in the balance.",
      "The force is enormous - it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful - it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate.",
      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, an idea first introduced by Albert Einstein in his theory of relativity, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year.",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe.",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe's history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements - exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape - support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning.",
      "\"It's moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we've thought about cosmology and start over,\" said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist with the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the research.",
      "Alexie Leauthaud-Harnett, a spokesperson for the DESI collaboration, called the new observations \"deeply intriguing.\"",
      "\"It is exciting to think that we may be on the cusp of a major discovery about dark energy and the fundamental nature of our universe,\" she said in a statement.",
      "It's not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026.",
      "\"We want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements\" at that gold standard to be sure that dark energy is weakening, said cosmologist Kris Pardo with the University of Southern California who was not involved with the new research.",
      "The \"Big Crunch\"",
      "If dark energy is constant, scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still.",
      "If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what's called the \"Big Crunch.\" It might not seem like the cheeriest fate, but it offers some closure, said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas.",
      "\"Now, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,\" he said. \"Would we consider that a good or bad thing? I don't know.\"",
      "Other efforts around the globe have an eye on dark energy and aim to release their own data in the coming years, including the European Space Agency's Euclid mission and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.",
      "Launched in 2023, the ESA's $1.5 billion Euclid space telescope is equipped with a near-perfect 3-feet 11-inch-wide primary mirror and two instruments: a 600 megapixel visible light camera and a 64-megapixel infrared imaging spectrometer. The telescope's field of view is roughly twice the size of the full moon.",
      "It will take Euclid six years to complete its map of the sky, generating on the order of 100 gigabytes of compressed data per day, or an estimated, difficult-to-imagine 70,000 terabytes over the course of the mission.",

A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.",
      "\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "They used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.",
      "\"It's like putting your thumb up in front of the sun when you're looking up at the sky,\" lead study author William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP.",
      "Normally, the Webb telescope only detects exoplanets by glimpsing them when they cross in front of their host star.",
      "This \"transiting method\" was how Webb indirectly detected CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-39 in 2022.",
      "But for this latest discovery, \"we're actually seeing the light that is emitted from the planet itself, as opposed to the fingerprint of that light from the host star,\" Balmer said.",
      "This is not easy \u2014 Balmer compared the process to using a torch to spot fireflies next to a lighthouse.",
      "While these gas giants may not be able to host life, it is possible that they had moons that could, he added.",
      "There are missions currently under way to find out if there could be life in the vast oceans underneath the icy shells of several of Jupiter's moons.",
      "\"Key piece of proof\"",
      "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere.",
      "Because CO2 condenses into little ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation.",
      "Jupiter and Saturn are believed to have first formed from a \"bottom up\" process in which a bunch of tiny, icy particles came together into a solid core which then sucked in gas to grow into giants, Balmer said.",
      "So the new discovery is a \"key piece of proof\" that far-off planets can form in a similar way to those in our celestial backyard, Balmer said.",
      "But how common this is throughout the universe remains unclear.",
      "\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is\u2014or how normal.\"",
      "Astronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive \u2014 and none of them known to be habitable.",
      "The \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.",
      "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will use a coronagraph to do that just after its planned launch in 2027.",
      "Last year, the Webb telescope discovered carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the surface of Charon, Pluto's largest moon.",
      "Balmer hopes to use Webb to observe more four-planet systems, but added that future funding was now in question.",
      "Last week the Trump administration announced that NASA's chief scientist has been dismissed, indicating that more cuts were to come for the U.S. space agency.",

    "summary": "Scientists are conducting experiments to generate clean energy through fusion, the same sub-atomic reaction that powers our Sun, with the aim of constructing plants that produce more energy than they consume.",
    "story": [
      "If it looks like the set of some Hollywood sci-fi show, perhaps that's fitting, because what they are doing here is making stars on Earth. \"We are able to make miniature stars, 'cause fusion is the same reaction that powers the Sun and stars,\" said Tammy Ma, who leads the Fusion Energy Initiative at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in Livermore, California. It's part of the same government laboratory that ensures the safety and reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile.",
      "\"Every time we do a fusion experiment on the NIF, we are actually the hottest place in the entire solar system, hotter than the center of the Sun,\" Ma said.",
      "The scientists here are using the largest laser ever built. It's 1,000 times more powerful than the entire U.S. electrical grid, and is housed in a massive room the size of a three football fields. Here, 192 laser beams travel nearly a mile, and then focus in on a tiny target, or fuel pellet, smaller than a peppercorn. \u00a0When the lasers hit the pellet, the atoms \"fuse\" together, releasing energy in the process.",
      "That little fuel pellet is only about two millimeters in diameter. But the consequences could be huge.",
      "Fusion is a process that merges atoms together, and releases more energy than fission (which splits atoms apart). Fission is used by today's nuclear power plants and creates hazardous nuclear waste; fusion does not.",
      "Fusion would theoretically provide a nearly-limitless source of clean and safe energy, powering our world without the fossil fuels that are warming the planet and contributing to climate change. It would make energy-intensive technologies like vertical farming and water desalination much cheaper, potentially solving the world's food and water problems. Ma said, \"It is completely clean. There's no carbon anywhere in the equation. There's no high-level nuclear waste. You can place fusion power plants nearly anywhere. It could help meet all of the energy needs for the U.S. now and into the future, even as our energy needs rise.\"",
      "But fusion is hard. After 60 years of research by scientists at NIF, they finally generated a reaction (also called \"ignition\") that produced more energy than it consumed. The breakthrough, in 2022, crucial to ever creating a fusion power plant, made headlines around the world. Humans had unlocked the power of the stars.",

      "Inside the nuclear fusion breakthrough that could be a step to unlimited clean energy in the distant future (\"60 Minutes\")",
      "They have achieved ignition several times since then, and now the race is on to generate enough energy to consistently power a commercial fusion plant.",
      "Bob Mumgaard is CEO and co-founder of Commonwealth Fusion Systems outside of Boston, one of more than two dozen fusion startups getting billions of dollars in funding from the government and investors. \"It's gonna take time, it's gonna take work, but this is the birth of an industry,\" Mumgaard said.",
      "Instead of lasers, Commonwealth uses a cloud of super-heated plasma that burns at around 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, held in place by massive magnets that the company manufactures on site. \"The magnets in this machine will be the strongest magnets in the world,\" Mumgaard said. \"[They] could lift up an aircraft carrier.\"",
      "Commonwealth expects to complete its demonstration reactor next year. It just announced plans to build its first full-scale power plant in Virginia, but that won't deliver energy to the grid until sometime next decade. The demonstration reactor, Mumgaard said, \"is the penultimate step to that.\"",
      "Critics point out that fusion power has been an ever-elusive holy grail, always 20 to 30 years away. But startups like Commonwealth say this time is different.

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 07:24:30 -0400",
    "summary": "The new findings come from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which sits on a telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists are homing in on the nature of a mysterious force called dark energy, and nothing short of the fate of the universe hangs in the balance.",
      "The force is enormous - it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful - it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate.",
      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, an idea first introduced by Albert Einstein in his theory of relativity, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year.",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe.",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe's history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements - exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape - support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning.",
      "\"It's moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we've thought about cosmology and start over,\" said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist with the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the research.",
      "Alexie Leauthaud-Harnett, a spokesperson for the DESI collaboration, called the new observations \"deeply intriguing.\"",
      "\"It is exciting to think that we may be on the cusp of a major discovery about dark energy and the fundamental nature of our universe,\" she said in a statement.",
      "It's not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026.",
      "\"We want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements\" at that gold standard to be sure that dark energy is weakening, said cosmologist Kris Pardo with the University of Southern California who was not involved with the new research.",
      "The \"Big Crunch\"",
      "If dark energy is constant, scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still.",
      "If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what's called the \"Big Crunch.\" It might not seem like the cheeriest fate, but it offers some closure, said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas.",
      "\"Now, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,\" he said. \"Would we consider that a good or bad thing? I don't know.\"",
      "Other efforts around the globe have an eye on dark energy and aim to release their own data in the coming years, including the European Space Agency's Euclid mission and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.",
      "Launched in 2023, the ESA's $1.5 billion Euclid space telescope is equipped with a near-perfect 3-feet 11-inch-wide primary mirror and two instruments: a 600 megapixel visible light camera and a 64-megapixel infrared imaging spectrometer. The telescope's field of view is roughly twice the size of the full moon.",
      "It will take Euclid six years to complete its map of the sky, generating on the order of 100 gigabytes of compressed data per day, or an estimated, difficult-to-imagine 70,000 terabytes over the course of the mission.",

      "A lunar lander has completed its two-week mission and sent spectacular sunset images as a \"final goodbye\" back to Earth.",
      "The Blue Ghost Mission 1 lander was launched by Firefly Aerospace in mid-January and landed on the moon on March 2. It was the first successful commercial moon landing. The lander delivered 10 NASA science and delivery payloads to the Mare Crisium basin, which is a lava-flooded region on the near side of the moon formed by an asteroid impact.",
      "The payloads were delivered as part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services and Artemis programs, NASA said in a news release, and were used to collect data and perform other scientific operations on the moon.",

    "story": [
      "Two long-delayed Starliner astronauts, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams, returned to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Tuesday, finally closing out a repeatedly extended 286-day odyssey in space. They shared the ride home with two outgoing space station crewmates, Crew-9 commander Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov.",
      "Seventeen hours after undocking from the International Space Station, the Crew Dragon settled to a gentle, on-target splashdown off Florida's Gulf Coast near Tallahassee at 5:57 p.m. EDT.",
      "\"Splashdown! Good mains release,\" Hague radioed SpaceX flight controllers in Hawthorne, California, after the four main parachutes were released from the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"Copy, splashdown,\" a SpaceX engineer replied. \"We see main chutes cut. Nick, Alex, Butch, Suni, on behalf of SpaceX, welcome home.\"",
      "\"What a ride,\" Hague said. \"I see a capsule full of grins, ear to ear.\"\ufeff",
      "A SpaceX recovery ship was stationed nearby to haul the spacecraft on board so the crew could be helped out of the Crew Dragon's cabin and onto stretchers for initial medical checks. The side hatch was opened at 6:38 p.m. EDT and the crew began to emerge into the fresh air and sunshine about 10 minutes later. Williams and Wilmore were the last ones out.",
      "For the two Starliner astronauts, it closed out a marathon mission that was originally supposed to last about eight days but stretched to nine-and-a-half months, covering 4,576 orbits and 121 million miles since launch last June 5 aboard a problem-plagued Boeing capsule. Their flight ranks sixth on the list of longest single NASA missions.",
      "Hague and Gorbunov spent 171 days in orbit since their launch last September aboard the Crew 9 ferry ship.",
      "All station astronauts spend two hours a day in orbit exercising to minimize bone and muscle loss in the weightlessness of space. Even so, Wilmore and Williams will face extensive rehabilitation over the next several weeks and months as their bodies re-adapt to the unfamiliar tug of gravity.",
      "How did the astronauts return to Earth?",
      "After bidding their ISS crewmates farewell, the returning astronauts floated into their Crew Dragon and undocked from the Harmony module's space-facing port early Tuesday, at 1:05 a.m. EDT.",
      "Starting at 5:11 p.m., the flight plan called for an automated seven-and-a-half-minute de-orbit thruster firing to slow the ship down for re-entry.",
      "Twenty-seven minutes later, approaching the Florida Gulf Coast on a southwest-to-northeast trajectory, the Crew Dragon reached the discernible atmosphere, enduring heat shield temperatures of more than 2,500 degrees as the spacecraft rapidly slowed in the thickening air.",
      "Nine minutes after entry, the Crew Dragon's three main parachutes unfurled for the capsule's final descent to splashdown in the Gulf.",
      "From the recovery ship, all four Crew-9 fliers were to be flown to shore by helicopter, where a NASA jet was waiting to ferry them back to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for reunions with family members and more extensive medical checks.",
      "\"Butch and Suni, enjoyed their time on station, they got to do spacewalks and they got to do lots of cool science and things like that,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program. \"Their families, kudos to them for being resilient. ... The families, a huge thank you to them. I'm sure the reunion is going to be wonderful with the families.\"",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck longer at the ISS?",
      "Wilmore and Williams launched to the International Space Station last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner. The spacecraft suffered multiple propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems during rendezvous with the space station, and NASA eventually decided to keep them on the station and to bring the Starliner down, without its crew, by remote control.",
      "NASA launched the next crew rotation mission \u2014 Crew-9 \u2014 in September carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, instead of four. Wilmore and Williams then joined the Crew-9 fliers aboard the ISS for a normal-duration six-month mission.",
      "By keeping them in space as part of Crew-9, NASA was able to minimize the disruption to the ISS crew rotation sequence while maintaining a full slate of experiments and research.",
      "NASA cleared the way for Crew-9's return to Earth by launching four replacements \u2014 Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi \u2014 last Friday.",
      "Normal practice calls for a five-day \"handover\" between crews so the new arrivals can be fully briefed on the ins and outs of station operations and maintenance. But in this case, handover was shortened to just one day to take advantage of predicted favorable splashdown weather in the Gulf.",
      "The plight of the Starliner astronauts generated unprecedented interest during their extended stay in space, making headlines around the world and even prompting claims by President Trump that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned astronauts, because the Biden administration was incapable of doing so,\" he posted Monday on Truth Social. \"They shamefully forgot about the astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them.\"",
      "\"Elon and I have taken on the project, sending up the SpaceX Dragon, which has successfully docked and, hopefully, while there is always danger involved in such a mission, they will soon be on their way home,\" his post continued.",
      "After splashdown, the White House tweeted: \"Promise made, promise kept: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months. Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, tanks to @ElonMusk, @SpaceX and @NASA!\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not mention that NASA originally planned to bring the crew home in February. But their mission was extended to March because SpaceX ran into problems with the Crew Dragon spacecraft being processed to carry the replacement Crew 10 into space.",
      "NASA decided last month to swap out the original Crew-10 Dragon for one that was earmarked for a commercial flight later this spring.",
      "That replacement spacecraft, the Crew Dragon \"Freedom,\" blasted off last Friday, carrying Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi to the space station early Sunday.",
      "The Crew-10 flight is what cleared the way for Crew-9 and the Starliner astronauts to come home this week \u2014 about two weeks earlier than the original Crew Dragon could have managed.",
      "For his part, Musk backed up the president's claims about the Biden administration \"abandoning\" the crew. Without offering any evidence, he said NASA turned down an offer to send up a mission specifically to get Wilmore and Williams and bring them back to Earth. No one at NASA has yet confirmed any such offer.",
      "NASA managers have gone out of their way to avoid contradicting the president. At a post-landing news conference, Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrate for space operations, was repeatedly asked about the president's comments. But he chose not address any specifics.",
      "\"NASA, as an agency, we work for the president,\" he said. \"Whoever's there, we work for them. We had an input from that office, we took a look at it and, you know, our job is to take all the inputs we get and operate as safe and successfully as we can.",
      "\"And that's what we did for this administration, and that's what we would do for any administration.\"",
      "Was this the longest any U.S. astronaut has stayed in space?",
      "While 286 days is a long flight by normal NASA standards, it's well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days, set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "As a result, Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with 608 days in space overall. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft, 675 days over four flights. Wilmore's total across three flights will stand at 464 days aloft.",

      "The James Webb Space Telescope has directly observed the key chemical of carbon dioxide in planets outside of our solar system for the first time, scientists announced Monday.",
      "The gas giants are not capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, but do offer clues in a lingering mystery about how distant planets form, according to a study in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The HR 8799 system, 130 light years from Earth, is only 30 million years old \u2014 just a baby compared to our solar system's 4.6 billion years. A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.",
      "\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "They used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.",
      "\"It's like putting your thumb up in front of the sun when you're looking up at the sky,\" lead study author William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP.",
      "Normally, the Webb telescope only detects exoplanets by glimpsing them when they cross in front of their host star.",
      "This \"transiting method\" was how Webb indirectly detected CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-39 in 2022.",
      "But for this latest discovery, \"we're actually seeing the light that is emitted from the planet itself, as opposed to the fingerprint of that light from the host star,\" Balmer said.",
      "This is not easy \u2014 Balmer compared the process to using a torch to spot fireflies next to a lighthouse.",
      "While these gas giants may not be able to host life, it is possible that they had moons that could, he added.",
      "There are missions currently under way to find out if there could be life in the vast oceans underneath the icy shells of several of Jupiter's moons.",
      "\"Key piece of proof\"",
      "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere.",
      "Because CO2 condenses into little ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation.",
      "Jupiter and Saturn are believed to have first formed from a \"bottom up\" process in which a bunch of tiny, icy particles came together into a solid core which then sucked in gas to grow into giants, Balmer said.",
      "So the new discovery is a \"key piece of proof\" that far-off planets can form in a similar way to those in our celestial backyard, Balmer said.",
      "But how common this is throughout the universe remains unclear.",
      "\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is\u2014or how normal.\"",
      "Astronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive \u2014 and none of them known to be habitable.",
      "The \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.",
      "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will use a coronagraph to do that just after its planned launch in 2027.",
      "Last year, the Webb telescope discovered carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the surface of Charon, Pluto's largest moon.",
      "Balmer hopes to use Webb to observe more four-planet systems, but added that future funding was now in question.",

      "McClain, Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov -- both veteran commercial airline pilots \u2014 are replacing Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and his pilot, Sunita Williams.",
      "Three other crew members, cosmonauts Aleksey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, were launched to the station last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. They're scheduled to return to Earth next month.",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner astronaut ferry ship. The flight was originally expected to last about eight days.",
      "But during rendezvous with the space station, the Starliner experienced propulsion system problems and NASA eventually ruled out bringing the crew down on the Boeing spacecraft.",
      "Instead, the astronauts were told to remain aboard the station while the Starliner returned to Earth on its own. NASA then bumped two astronauts from the next station flight \u2014 Crew 9 \u2014 freeing up two seats for use by Wilmore and Williams.",
      "When Hague and Gorbunov reached the station, Wilmore and Williams joined them to become part of Crew 9 for a normal six-month tour of duty.",
      "Now that Crew 10 has arrived, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams will help familiarize their replacements with space station operations before undocking and returning to Earth next week with a splashdown in the Gulf near the coast of Florida. NASA announced on Sunday it was targeting Tuesday for the return journey, with undocking scheduled for 1:05 a.m. ET and splashdown at around 6 p.m.",
      "\"NASA and SpaceX met on Sunday to assess weather and splashdown conditions off Florida's coast for the return of the agency's Crew 9 mission from the International Space Station,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "\"Mission managers are targeting an earlier Crew 9 return opportunity based on favorable conditions (predicted) for the evening of Tuesday, March 18. The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favorable weather conditions expected for later in the week.\"",
      "If all goes to plan, Wilmore and Williams upon landing will have logged 286 days in space since launch last June. While a long flight by any standard, it's still well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days \u2014 set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with around 570 days in space overall, depending on the actual launch date. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft among U.S. astronauts: 675 days over four flights.",

      "Ten minutes after liftoff \u2014 and a dramatic first stage landing back at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station \u2014 the Crew Dragon capsule was released from the rocket's upper stage to fly on its own.",
      "As it moved away, a camera on the Falcon 9's second stage showed what a source described as insulation from the Falcon 9's second stage. While unusual, the Crew Dragon was reported to be in good shape and ready to chase down the space station.",
      "Given an on-time liftoff, the Crew Dragon will carry out an autonomous rendezvous with the space station, catching up with the lab Saturday night and moving in for docking at the space station's forward port at 11:30 p.m.",
      "They'll be welcomed aboard by Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams, along with cosmonauts Alexsey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who were launched last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "Hague and Gorbunov were launched aboard the Crew 9 Dragon in\u00a0September. Two NASA astronauts who originally planned to be on that flight were bumped from the mission to free up two seats for Wilmore and Williams. They became part of Crew 9 and worked with Hague and Gorbunov for the duration of their six-month mission.",
      "The Crew 9 fliers plan to spend two days familiarizing their replacements with the intricacies of space station operation before boarding their own Crew Dragon, the same one that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, for the trip home.",
      "The flight plan calls for undocking Tuesday, setting the stage for re-entry and splashdown off Florida's Gulf Coast next weekend. By that point, Wilmore and Williams will have logged about 290 days \u2014 9.7 months \u2014 in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to around 174 days, depending on the landing date.",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule on June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "The astronauts originally planned to spend about eight days in space, but NASA and Boeing, the Starliner's builder, carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers ruled that option out. Instead, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew 9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner, meanwhile, successfully returned to Earth in September, kicking off hands-on troubleshooting and ongoing work to prepare for the eventual resumption of flights.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of their mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "President Trump blamed the extended mission on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the Starliner crew.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon (Musk), I said, 'Do me a favor, can you get 'em out?' He said 'Yes.' He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon that Mr. Trump was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It it is assigned to the Crew 10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew 9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth along with Hague and Gorbunov.",
      "Musk said earlier he offered to launch a mission to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but the offer, he said, was turned down for political reasons. NASA managers say they never heard of such an offer and that the current plan causes the least disruption to station operations and downstream crew rotation flights.",
      "While NASA could have brought Crew 9 down earlier aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, but that would have left a single astronaut \u2014 Pettit \u2014 aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",

    "story": [
      "Those who glanced up at the sky Thursday night had an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon\u00a0was due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late Thursday night or very early Friday morning, depending on the viewer's time zone. It was visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon technically rose in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon showed a new hue when it happened.",
      "Why was the moon red, orange and yellow?",
      "The moon appeared to turn red as Earth passed directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon takes on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "When was the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse?",
      "This week's \"Blood Moon\" began late Thursday night. The moon moved through Earth's shadow overnight, with the best opportunity to see the reddish moon around 3 a.m. ET Friday.",

      "In a win for the oil and gas pipeline company Energy Transfer,\u00a0 a nine-person North Dakota jury found the environmental group Greenpeace liable for more than $660 million in damages and defamation for the 2016 to 2017 Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline.",
      "In their lawsuit, Dallas-based Energy Transfer claimed Greenpeace was responsible for defamation, disruption and property damage for the protests that captured national attention in 2016. Greenpeace claimed the lawsuit threatened its freedom of speech.",
      "In a statement, Energy Transfer said, \"This win is really for the people of Mandan and throughout North Dakota who had to live through the daily harassment and disruptions caused by the protesters who were funded and trained by Greenpeace. It is also a win for all law-abiding Americans who understand the difference between the right to free speech and breaking the law.\"",
      "Greenpeace plans to appeal the verdict. \"This is the end of a chapter, but not the end of our fight. Energy Transfer knows we don't have $660 million. They want our silence, not our money.\" Sushma Raman, interim executive director of Greenpeace Inc., told CBS News.",
      "Greenpeace accused Energy Transfer of filing a \"SLAPP\" lawsuit, short for strategic lawsuits against public participation. SLAPP lawsuits have been criticized as being a method of curtailing free speech and assembly by individuals, organizations or press by threatening lengthy and expensive legal proceedings in court. 35 states have anti-SLAPP laws aimed at preventing these types of lawsuits. North Dakota is not among them.",
      "Energy Transfer previously filed a federal RICO lawsuit against Greenpeace seeking $300 million in damages in 2017, but that case was dismissed by a federal judge. Energy Transfer then filed a lawsuit against Greenpeace in North Dakota state court shortly after.",
      "\"The verdict against Greenpeace not only represents an assault on free speech and protest rights,\" said Rebecca Brown, president and CEO of the Center for International and Environmental Law, in a statement. \"This case is a textbook example of corporate weaponization of the legal system to silence protest and intimidate communities. This misuse of the legal system stifles legitimate dissent and must be seen as a direct threat to environmental justice and democratic freedoms.\"",
      "In the weeks and months preceding the trial, Greenpeace raised the alarm that the damages sought by Energy Transfer, thought at the time to be in the $300 million range, would be catastrophic to the group, claiming that would amount to 10 times the group's annual U.S. operating budget. Energy Transfer reported over $82 billion in revenue in 2024.",
      "The damages ultimately awarded total roughly $667 million and will be split up among several arms of Greenpeace. Greenpeace USA is on the hook for about $404 million, while Greenpeace Fund Inc. and Greenpeace International must each pay some $131 million, according to The Associated Press.",
      "The 1,172-mile pipeline crosses four states and has been operating since late 2017 despite the controversy and the protest, which stemmed from a pipeline crossing under Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe called the pipeline a violation of its treaty rights and claimed the pipeline route risked polluting the tribe's primary water source and would damage sacred sites.",
      "The protests at Standing Rock drew thousands of people from around the country who camped outside the pipeline's construction site. Celebrities and prominent figures including now-Trump cabinet members Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard also visited the camp.",
      "But violence erupted between police, security guards and protestors several times, culminating in tear gas and water cannons being used against protestors. The camps were cleared in February of 2017. More than 140 people were arrested at the Standing Rock protests.",
      "One of the organizers of the protests was Chase Iron Eyes, an attorney for the Lakota People's Law Project, who was arrested during the demonstrations and charged with felony inciting a riot. Iron Eyes questioned Greenpeace's liability for the protests.",
      "\"I never met a single Greenpeace person, a representative, or ever went to a training or anything like that,\" Iron Eyes told CBS News.",
      "Instead, Iron Eyes found the ruling to delegitimize the concerns and agency of Native Americans who chose to protest at Standing Rock. \"To hold them solely responsible for our fight, this is a tribal nation fight,\" he said. \"I think it's disrespectful to tribal nations, to the Sioux Nation in particular, it was our nation, and our people who stood up.\"",

Many of those guns found their way into civilian hands after agencies traded them to retailers for discounts on new equipment or resold them to their own officers.",
      "In a January report about gun trafficking, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives warned law enforcement against reselling guns because of the frequency with which former police weapons are used in violent crimes.",
      "Police departments sell their used guns. Thousands end up at crime scenes.",
      "Police departments sell their used guns. Thousands end up at crime scenes.",
      "The Trace and CBS News subsequently contacted 60 law enforcement agencies with a history of reselling guns to ask whether they had changed their policies.",
      "Twenty-one departments responded. Four \u2014 the Cincinnati, Columbus, and Sacramento police departments, as well as the Monmouth County Sheriff's Office in New Jersey \u2014 confirmed they had stopped reselling weapons after last year's investigation. (As The Trace and CBS News previously reported, the investigation also prompted the Indianapolis and Minneapolis police departments to discontinue gun resales.)",
      "Seven more agencies said they'd review their policies in light of the ATF's recommendation. Those agencies are the Wisconsin State Patrol, the New York State Police, the Newark Police Department, the sheriff's offices in California's San Diego and Orange counties, the Colorado State Patrol, and the Boulder County Sheriff's Office.",
      "\"We will be considering a policy change regarding selling guns owned by the Boulder County Sheriff's Office this year,\" Boulder County Sheriff Curtis Johnson told The Trace. He said the agency would need to check with the county commissioners to ensure they had enough money to replace old equipment without the trade-in discount, but he believed they would support additional funding if needed.",
      "Police forces generally resell weapons because gun stores offer trade-in value, allowing departments to offset the cost of equipment upgrades and, authorities have argued, save taxpayer money. Agencies that choose to dispose of the guns not only forfeit the trade-in value but must also pay a company to destroy them.",
      "Several agencies cited budgetary concerns as their reason for continuing to resell guns.",
      "Mark Kennedy, chief of the Quincy Police Department in Massachusetts, told CBS News that he feared his officers' used guns could wind up in crimes, but that his department could not afford to change its policy. \"If it wasn't cost prohibitive, I would absolutely destroy them,\" he said.",
      "In Kentucky, law enforcement's hands are tied. A state law requires agencies to sell guns they no longer need, including departmental weapons and those seized in connection with crimes.",
      "In 2019, a Kentucky State Police pistol resold to a retiring detective ended up in Buffalo, New York, where federal agents confiscated it while serving a search warrant on a murder suspect. When CBS News asked whether the Kentucky State Police's policy had changed, a spokesperson pointed to the state law, noting the agency \"is required to comply.\"",
      "Researchers say that while trade-ins can cut an agency's costs by tens of thousands of dollars, taxpayers ultimately bear the financial burden of the violence wrought with resold police guns \u2014 a price that can far outstrip savings on new equipment. A 2010 Iowa State University study estimated the cost of a single homicide at more than $17 million. That price tag includes spending on emergency response and crime scene cleanup, lost wages and tax revenue, salaries for investigators, and the cost of incarcerating suspects.",
      "Scot Thomasson, a former ATF special agent, said law enforcement agencies frequently negotiate trade-ins without explicit approval from local elected officials, leaving taxpayers unaware that the police weapons their money purchased could end up in civilian hands.",
      "\"The taxpayer pays for these guns to be used by police for the protection of their community,\" Thomasson said. \"Now that gun could wind up in a criminal's hands to be used against the same taxpayer that paid for it. It's just plain wrong.\"",
      "In its January warning to law enforcement agencies, the ATF said it had identified more than 1,000 former police guns recovered in homicides and another 2,000 confiscated from convicted felons between 2019 and 2023.",
      "The ATF also cited a 1998 resolution from the International Association of Chiefs of Police that instructed agencies not to resell guns. The resolution noted that \"the recirculation of these firearms back into the general population increases the availability of firearms which could be used again to kill or injure additional police officers and citizens.\"",
      "But William Brooks, a former Norwood, Massachusetts, police chief who now heads the IACP's firearms committee, said IACP resolutions expire after five years, and the 1998 guidance is unlikely to be revived when the organization meets to consider new resolutions this spring.",
      "\"I'd love to see city governments fully fund these weapons purchases so that departments can dispose of their old firearms,\" Brooks said. \"But if they don't, it should be up to departments to decide whether they're going to pass on an upgrade they can't afford without a trade-in.\"",
      "Brooks argued that destroying used police guns wouldn't prevent violence because firearms are already widely available and easy for the public to acquire.",
      "Michael Sierra-Ar\u00e9valo, an associate sociology professor at the University of Texas at Austin and author of \"The Danger Imperative: Violence, Death, and the Soul of Policing,\" said he wasn't aware of any peer-reviewed research linking police trade-ins to increases in violence, but he also hadn't seen evidence proving the practice was safe.",
      "\"The state has a responsibility to be conservative in these situations,\" he said. \"I would question the moral standing of someone who is willing to gamble with the life of a single member of the public on the grounds that they don't have empirical proof that a change of policy would prevent their death.\"",
      "\"We know that people are killed with these guns. That should be enough.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve held its benchmark interest rate steady on Wednesday, with Chair Jerome Powell saying there is \"high uncertainty\" about the potential impact of the Trump administration's trade and other economic policies.",
      "\"Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,\" the Fed stated in its announcement. \"The committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committee's goals.\"",
      "The Fed now expects the economy to grow more slowly this year than it did three months ago, with unemployment around the U.S. projected to hit 4.4%, up from 4.1% in February, according to economic projections also released Wednesday. The central bank forecasts inflation to edge up to 2.7%, up from from its current level of 2.5%.",
      "Policymakers now expect the nation's gross domestic product \u00a0\u2014 the total output of goods and services \u2014 to expand 1.7% this year, down from their December forecast of 2.1%. In 2024, GDP grew 2.8%.",
      "\"Inflation has started to move up,\" Powell said at a news conference. \"We think partly in response to tariffs. And there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year.\"",
      "Powell's base case in that any increase in inflation stemming from tariffs would be \"transitionary,\" but later said it would be difficult to separate how much price hikes stem from tariffs as opposed to other factors.",
      "Recession odds \"extremely low\"",
      "Economists have warned that the Trump administration's aggressive trade policies, including steep tariffs on Canada and Mexico scheduled to take effect April 2, could boost inflation and weigh on economic activity.",
      "\"Acknowledging the likely direction of travel in terms of policy from the Trump administration, FOMC participants revised up their projections for inflation while revising down their projections for GDP,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Chances of a recession \"were extremely low \u2014 if you go back two months. It has moved up, but it's not high,\" Powell told reporters.",
      "Investors had signaled virtually no chance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the central bank's rate-setting panel, lowering interest rates this month. But President Trump's aggressive trade policies, which have triggered concerns about economic growth, have also amplified uncertainty for financial markets.",
      "\"What holds the FOMC back from continuing to push interest rates lower at this moment is uncertainty about the Trump administration's economic policies,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote Wednesday in a research note ahead of the Fed's decision.",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "The central bank's so-called dot plot, used by the Fed to indicate its outlook for where interest rates are headed, indicates the year-end 2025 median projection for the federal funds rate at 3.88%, signaling 50 basis points in cuts this year.",
      "Most economists expect the Fed to lower interest rates two or three times this year, although that hinges on inflation continuing to move closer to the central bank's 2% annual target.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department accused the judge in the case of continuing to \"beat a dead horse\" to pry \"legally immaterial facts\" from the government.",
    "story": [
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and top Justice Department officials said the government may invoke state secrets privilege to block a federal judge from viewing specific information about two deportation flights of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, court filings Wednesday show.",
      "In a filing excoriating D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg for demanding detailed information about the flights, the Justice Department said, \"Continuing to beat a dead horse solely for the sake of prying from the Government legally immaterial facts and wholly within a sphere of core functions of the Executive Branch is both purposeless and frustrating to the consideration of the actual legal issues at stake in this case.\" The filing was signed by Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, as well as top Justice Department officials Emil Bove and Chad Mizelle.",
      "The government argued that Boasberg's demands for detailed information about the two flights from the U.S. to El Salvador Saturday \"represent grave usurpations of the President's powers under the Alien Enemies Act and his inherent Article II powers.\"",
      "The 1798 Alien Enemies Act allows foreigners to be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, including opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they may be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws. President Trump invoked the act Saturday and used it to send the two planes to El Salvador.",
      "On Saturday, Boasberg blocked the flights and ordered them to be turned around if they were already in the air. But the government said that the flights were already in international airspace when he issued his order and argued the judge lacked jurisdiction to order their redirection. The planes landed in El Salvador Saturday night, the Trump administration said. In its filing Wednesday, the Justice Department claimed that disclosing some of the operational information to the court \"could implicate the affairs of United States allies and their cooperation with the United States Government in fighting terrorist organizations.\"",
      "The department argued that the disclosure \"would unquestionably create serious repercussions for the Executive Branch's ability to conduct foreign affairs.\"",
      "Boasberg, who was frustrated by the government's lack of details on the flights and deportation operations during the hearing on Monday, ordered the government to answer a number of questions by noon Thursday, including what time the two planes had departed from U.S. soil, their points of departure, what time the planes left U.S. airspace, when they landed, and what time the alleged gang members were transferred out of U.S. custody.",
      "Bondi criticized Boasberg for requesting the information in the first place, repeatedly accusing him of \"micromanagement of immaterial fact finding.\"",
      "\"The court has now spent more time trying to ferret out information about the government's flight schedules and relations with foreign countries than it did in investigating the facts before certifying the class action in this case,\" they said in the filing. \"That observation reflects how upside-down this case has become, as digressive micromanagement has outweighed consideration of the case's legal issues.\"",
      "They continued to argue that answering the questions posed by Boasberg would subject the government to \"a serious risk of micromanaged and unnecessary judicial fishing expeditions and potential public disclosure.\"",
      "In an order granting the government an additional day to comply with his order, Boasberg also criticized the Justice Department's claim that their responses to his questions would compromise sensitive information, writing that \"the Secretary of State has revealed many operational details of the flights, including the number of people involved in the flights, many of their identities, the facility to which they were brought, their manner of treatment, and the time window during which these events occurred.\"",
      "The federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials was filed by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.",
      "Boasberg's ruling prevents the deportations of the plaintiffs and migrants for 14 days. The Justice Department has appealed the case to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "On Tuesday, lawyers representing the Venezuelan migrants suing the Trump administration warned that failing to block the president from its use would mean anyone could be treated as an enemy alien.",
      "\"The implications of the government's position are staggering. If the President can designate any group as enemy aliens under the Act, and that designation is unreviewable, then there is no limit on who can be sent to a Salvadoran prison, or any limit on how long they will remain there,\" they wrote in a filing to the appellate court.",
      "Despite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said. There are about 250 other alleged Tren de Aragua members still in the United States that the Trump administration is hoping to deport, court filings show.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday declined to block the White House Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to take over the U.S. Institute of Peace while a legal challenge to President Trump's actions targeting the nonprofit organization moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell swiftly moved to consider whether to void the removal of several board members just days after some of them received an email from the White House Presidential Personnel Office informing them that they had been terminated. She was also asked to block staff with DOGE\u00a0from having access to the Institute of Peace facilities.",
      "Howell, who sits on the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., convened a hearing Wednesday afternoon after five of the removed board members \u2014 Ambassador John Sullivan, Judy Ansley, Joseph Falk, Kerry Kennedy and Mary Swig \u2014 filed a lawsuit Tuesday that challenged their firing and what they said was an \"unlawful assault\" on the Institute of Peace, which was established by Congress in 1984.",
      "In addition to the board members, the institute's president, George Moose, was also fired by ex officio board members, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice Admiral Peter Garvin. Kenneth Jackson was then installed as the acting president of the Institute of Peace.",
      "Howell said that \"none of the requirements for removal of a board member were met\" in this case, and added that even if she did reinstate them, because of the president's control over the agency, their power during the period when they were reinstated would be \"very limited.\"",
      "In denying the former board members' request for relief, Howell said it is \"undisputed\" that their removals were not in accordance with federal law, but found that they had not made the required showing for a temporary restraining order.",
      "Still, Howell had harsh words for DOGE and Trump administration officials' treatment of Institute of Peace employees, including Moose.",
      "\"I am very offended by how DOGE has operated at the institute and treated American citizens trying to do a job that they were\" tasked to do, she said.",
      "The dispute over the Institute of Peace burst into public view earlier this week when DOGE team members attempted to gain access to the entity's Washington, D.C., headquarters. The institute said in a statement Saturday that several DOGE members arrived at its building \"unannounced\" on Friday and were accompanied by two FBI agents.",
      "The officials were met by the institute's outside counsel, George Foote, who informed them of the organization's \"private and independent status as a non-executive branch agency,\" according to the statement. The DOGE representatives then left, the agency said.",
      "But on Monday, Moose, the institute's removed president, said in a statement that DOGE had \"broken\" into the building and were able to gain access through an employee of the Institute of Peace's former security contractor, Inter-Con Security Systems, according to court filings.",
      "Foote, the outside counsel, told the Inter-Con employees they were trespassing and called the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department to report their entry, according to the filings.",
      "The institute board members said in their lawsuit that Inter-Con and DOGE personnel \"engaged in additional attempts to unlawfully access the USIP headquarters building, but were eventually able to enter the building, forcibly occupy it, and expel including the duly appointed USIP President, other USIP personnel, and outside counsel.\"",
      "The board members had asked Howell to issue a temporary restraining order blocking Jackson, Trump administration officials and DOGE employees from accessing the Institute of Peace's facilities, computer systems or records. They also sought an order declaring their removal unlawful and void, and preventing their firing.",
      "During the hearing Wednesday, Howell on numerous occasions expressed dismay about the presence of law enforcement alongside DOGE staff.",
      "\"The defendants have not wasted any time bringing in armed law enforcement to help them,\" she said about the alleged takeover of the building.",
      "She reiterated that she was \"offended on behalf of the American citizens who have done so much \u2026 service to this country to be treated so abominably.\"",
      "During an exchange with a Justice Department lawyer, Howell questioned whether Mr. Trump could've gone to the GOP-led Congress to ask for the law establishing the Institute of Peace be changed or used his appointment power to remove and replace members of the board \"rather than taking apart the institute\" with police.",
      "What are the lawful ways to act against Institute of Peace \"without using the force of guns and threats by DOGE,\" she asked.",
      "The Institute of Peace is the latest organization to come under scrutiny by the Trump administration and DOGE as part of the president's initiative to scale down the size of the federal government. Many of these actions have since been challenged in the federal courts as unlawful.",

      "Konanki seen on video walking to beach",
      "Konanki, 20, is from Chantilly, Virginia, a Washington, D.C., suburb, and attends college in Pittsburgh. She has permanent residency in the United States as well as citizenship in India. She arrived in the Dominican Republic for spring break on March 3 and was vacationing with a group of friends, five other women, according to investigators and her parents.",
      "She\u00a0has been missing\u00a0since Thursday, March 6, after surveillance video showed her, three of her friends and two other American men walk toward the beach area outside the Riu Rep\u00fablica hotel. The video was from around 4:15 a.m., investigators in the Dominican Republic said.",
      "Power outages at the hotel may have prompted guests to move outdoors around that time, the hotel said in a statement. An earlier surveillance video showed Konanki and one of her friends hugging at the hotel bar.",
      "One of the men in the group walking to the beach has been identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, an American college student. In the footage, Konanki and Riibe are seen walking with their arms around each other.",
      "Video shows the other four individuals later returning to the hotel, but Konanki and Riibe stayed behind on the beach, a police source said. The last sighting of Konanki and Riibe in the water happened around 4:50 a.m., according to Loudon County Sheriff Mike Chapman, whose office in Virginia is involved in the investigation.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and both struggled against rough seas. He said he believed Konanki got out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "He is presumed to be the last person who saw Konanki alive.",
      "Konanki's disappearance is so far being investigated as a missing persons case, not a criminal investigation.",
      "The Dominican Republic's attorney general said investigators were exploring whether Konanki drowned, but not ruling out the possibility of foul play.",
      "Chapman said \"it's hard to say\" whether there are indications Konanki's disappearance was anything other than an accident.",
      "\"We know that at about 4:50 a.m. was the last sighting that we had of them in the water. We don't know what happened after that,\" Chapman said in a \"CBS Mornings\" interview. \"And we also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say. It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",
      "Konanki's family seeking closure",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office told CBS News that Konanki's family has requested that she be declared deceased, expressed gratitude to investigators for their work and expressed a desire for closure following her disappearance in the Dominican Republic.",
      "The family provided the request in writing to the sheriff's office, according to spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities.",
      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CBS News has learned that their written request referenced Riibe's cooperation with investigators and a lack of evidence collected to date that would suggest foul play was involved in Konanki's disappearance.",
      "Chapman said the family has expressed their belief that she drowned.",
      "\"While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible as we continue to review the evidence and information made available to us in the course of this investigation,\" he said.",
      "Riibe returns to U.S. after facing questioning",
      "Riibe had been confined to a hotel in Punta Cana for more than a week as he faced questioning during the investigation, with officers escorting him anywhere he went. A judge in the Dominican Republic ruled on March 18 that Riibe should be freed from police surveillance.",
      "The law firm representing Riibe, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza, had pushed in legal documents for his freedom, given the absence of any criminal charge, which led to the hearing. In court, Riibe argued to the judge that he was detained inappropriately.",
      "\"I really want to go home and see my family,\" Riibe said. \"I understand I'm here to help but it's been 10 days.\"",
      "His attorneys said earlier that authorities confiscated Riibe's passport as he faced questioning, including direct interrogation by Dominican Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso. The judge's ruling did not include an immediate decision on the issue of returning Riibe's passport, and when he would be able to travel back to the U.S. was initially unclear.",
      "An attorney representing the college student said on Wednesday, March 19, Riibe had obtained a new passport from the U.S. consulate and was on his way home with his father. The attorney said the hearing the day before concluded the release of Riibe was ordered and the La Altagracia Prosecutor's Office then informed him that it was willing to return his passport.",
      "\"Although grateful for the decision of the Prosecutor's Office, Joshua decided, for privacy reasons, to request a new one at the United States Consulate, which was urgently issued to him,\" Riibe's attorney said.",
      "Riibe and his parents, Tina and Albert Riibe, extended \"deep sorrow and solidarity\" with Konanski's family in a statement released through his attorney.",
      "\"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible,\" the statement said. \"Joshua Riibe is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman told \"CBS Mornings\" that Riibe was \"very forthcoming\" with sheriff's detectives who traveled to the Dominican Republic to speak to him, and did not \"seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way.\"",
      "Chapman noted there was \"nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",
      "Originally from Iowa, Riibe is a college senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where he is pursuing a degree in land surveying.",
      "His family in their statement described him as \"a beloved son, brother, and friend, known for his kind nature, sense of humor, and commitment to his community.\"",
      "They also shared concerns about the \"irregular conditions\" of his detainment in Punta Cana, where, they said, he had been \"subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel until Wednesday, March 12.\" The family retained a lawyer \"to initiate legal actions ensuring his safety and the protection of his rights throughout this process,\" according to the statement.",
      "Intensifying search efforts",
      "More than 300 police and other officials, with support from the FBI, are searching the air, sea and land to locate her, Dominican President Luis Abinader said. The Dominican Republic National Police said they have assembled a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, and Interpol has\u00a0issued a global police alert at the request of investigators.",

      "A jury delivered a string of guilty verdicts Wednesday afternoon in what prosecutors call the largest pandemic fraud case in the country.",
      "The jury heard closing arguments Tuesday against accused Feeding Our Future ring leader Aimee Bock and her co-defendant Salim Said. The pair were accused of taking tens of millions of dollars meant to feed hungry children.",
      "The jury began deliberating Wednesday and, within about five hours, reached guilty verdicts on multiple criminal counts, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery. Every count the jury considered came back with a guilty verdict.",
      "The judge ruled that they remain in custody, saying that because their \"fraud scene was premised on deception,\" the court had concerns they would use similar tactics to flee.",
      "\"Both displayed patterns of deception and an absolute inability to comply with authority,\" the judge said.",
      "Said owned and operated Safari Restaurant, a site that received more than $16 million in fraudulent funds. Prosecutors say it was a team effort, alleging that Said devised fake meal counts, rosters and invoices and Bock submitted them to the state department for funding.",
      "The pair \"worked together every step of the way to carry out this fraud scheme,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Harry Jacobs \"and they both got rich doing it.\"",
      "Bock's attorney disputed that, maintaining she wasn't aware of any fraud happening. Said's attorney argues others took his legitimate business and corrupted it.",
      "Before closing arguments, prosecutors questioned Said on his \"lavish\" spending on real estate, clothing and more. He didn't deny the spending, but repeatedly told prosecutors that he spent money he earned.",
      "Bock and Said are two of 70 people charged in the scheme. Roughly 30 others have pleaded guilty and five others were convicted.",
      "Earlier this year, a separate Feeding Our Future defendant admitted to witness tampering in connection with a\u00a0$120,000 bribery attempt\u00a0of a juror. Documents say Ladan Ali flew in from Seattle in May 2024 and followed a juror home after the first day of closing arguments, and then two days later handed a bag containing the cash to the juror's relative and told them there would be more if the juror voted to acquit all the defendants.",

      "Google says it uncovered thousands of illegitimate listings, including for fake businesses, on Google Maps and has announced a lawsuit against the alleged scammers behind the fraud.",
      "The lawsuit, announced Wednesday, claims a man working within a wider network, created and sold fake business profiles on Google Maps.",
      "An initial alert came from a Texas business that flagged an unlicensed locksmith impersonating them on Google Maps. That was just the tip of the iceberg.",
      "The claim sparked an investigation that led Google to uncover and eliminate more than 10,000 illegitimate listings, the company said. The scams ranged from outright fake businesses to legitimate accounts that had been hacked or hijacked.",
      "\"Once we're alerted to the actual fraud, we take extreme efforts to identify similar fraudulent listings,\" Halimah DeLaine Prado, Google's general counsel, said on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" Wednesday.",
      "Google found many of the scams were concentrated in what they call \"duress verticals\" \u2013 services people need in urgent or stressful situations, like locksmiths or towing companies.",
      "\"Scammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated,\" DeLaine Prado said.",
      "Google's investigation also uncovered that these alleged scammers aren't working alone. They collaborate with agents around the world and leverage social media to increase their reach. One example in the lawsuit shows an alleged scammer posted in multiple Facebook groups to advertise \"5 star reviews\" that can bypass Google's guidelines.",
      "How the alleged scammers operate",
      "DeLaine Prado listed several distinctive tactics the Google Maps' scammers used.",
      "First, the bait and switch. This is when someone searches for a local service but instead of reaching a licensed professional, they fall for a fake listing.",
      "Other times, consumers call a real company but that number is intercepted and routed through a \"lead generation service,\" which sends the call to the scammers.",
      "Either way, the consumer gets connected with a completely different company than the one they thought they were reaching out to.",
      "Then, the scam service arrives and often demands a significantly higher price than the original quote. Google says because the scam targets people in \"duress verticals\" the customer is typically in a vulnerable situation, which these bad actors exploit.",
      "How to protect yourself",
      "As always, if something seems off, stop what you're doing and try to verify the legitimacy of the company.",
      "\"Pause, take a moment,\" DeLaine Prado advised. She said users should check the company's URL and phone number to make sure they match the business as advertised.",
      "Another red flag to beware of is if the company asks for more information than necessary, like your social security number just to join a mailing list.",
      "DeLaine Prado also warned consumers to be on alert if they're being asked to pay for services in an unconventional way like paying through gift cards or a wire transfer.",
      "How Google says it's protecting users",
      "Fake business listings are prohibited on Google Maps and the company says it uses a range of tools, from automated programming to analysts, to identify fraud on the platform.",
      "\"Online business profiles are incredibly valuable to businesses, as well as consumers,\" DeLaine Prado said. \"Small and medium businesses use those listings for 'word of mouth,' discoverability.\"",
      "But it's not just listings. Google's lawsuit also outlines how the network of alleged scammers sold fraudulent positive reviews to businesses as a way to suppress real, bad reviews on the platform.",
      "\"Consumers use the reviews under those listings to actually make decisions based on what service to use or not to use,\" DeLaine Prado said. \"A fake profile and a fake review undermines the trust that you have in that ecosystem.\"",
      "This lawsuit is not Google's first swipe at scammers. The company told CBS News it removed or blocked about 12 million fake business profiles in 2023, about a million more than in the year prior.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled in favor of a group of more than two dozen unnamed former and current USAID employees and contractors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday found that Elon Musk and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency likely violated the Constitution when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled in favor of a group of more than two dozen unnamed current and former USAID employees and contractors who had challenged the efforts to shutter USAID, which were mounted by DOGE and Musk, a senior White House adviser who President Trump has said is the leader of the task force.",
      "Chuang granted in part their request for a preliminary injunction and said in a 68-page decision that DOGE and Musk likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and separation of powers.",
      "He ordered Musk and task force employees to reinstate access to email, payment and other electronic systems to all current USAID employees and personal services contractors. The judge also prevented DOGE and Musk from taking any action relating to the shutdown of USAID, including placing employees on administrative leave, firing USAID workers, closing its buildings, bureaus or offices, and deleting the contents of its websites or collections.",
      "DOGE and Musk are prohibited under the judge's order from taking any other actions relating to USAID without the \"express authorization\" of an agency official with legal authority to take the action. The Trump administration is likely to appeal the decision.",
      "\"To deny plaintiffs' Appointments Clause claim solely on the basis that, on paper, Musk has no formal legal authority relating to the decisions at issue, even if he is actually exercising significant authority on governmental matters, would open the door to an end-run around the Appointments Clause,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "He continued: \"If a president could escape Appointments Clause scrutiny by having advisers go beyond the traditional role of White House advisors who communicate the president's priority to agency heads and instead exercise significant authority throughout the federal government so as to bypass duly appointed officers, the Appointments Clause would be reduced to nothing more than a technical formality.\"",
      "Norm Eisen, executive chair of the State Democracy Defenders Fund, which brought the case on behalf of the 26 USAID employees and contractors, said the ruling is an \"important victory\" against Musk and DOGE.",
      "\"They are performing surgery with a chainsaw instead of a scalpel, harming not just the people USAID serves but also the majority of Americans who count on the stability of our government,\" he said in a statement. \"This case is a milestone in pushing back on Musk and DOGE's illegality.\"",
      "USAID was one of the first agencies that came under scrutiny by DOGE as part of Mr. Trump's sweeping plan to shrink the size of the federal government. Soon after the president returned to a second term, the agency, which was established in 1961, became subject to a 90-day pause on foreign assistance funding that devastated nonprofit organizations, businesses and aid groups that received grants and other awards from USAID.",
      "DOGE team members also gained access to the agency's financial and personnel systems, and hundreds of USAID officials were placed on administrative leave. Its website was shut down last month, email accounts deactivated and USAID's Washington, D.C., headquarters were occupied by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "The unidentified USAID employees and personal services contractors filed their lawsuit against Musk and DOGE in mid-February and argued that Musk's actions violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The case was one of several filed after DOGE was established that have challenged Musk's actions and the task force's access to sensitive federal systems.",
      "Musk's role within DOGE has been of particular interest, including among federal judges overseeing court fights involving the task force. While Mr. Trump has claimed publicly that Musk leads DOGE, including during his joint address to Congress earlier this month, Justice Department lawyers have argued that he is a senior adviser to the president and does not have formal authority to make government decisions.",
      "Amid repeated questions about who was leading DOGE, the White House revealed last month that Amy Gleason, who worked for DOGE's predecessor, is its acting administrator.",
      "Chuang, meanwhile, said Musk and DOGE have been behind agency actions throughout the federal government, including at USAID.",
      "He noted that Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla, appears to have been involved in the closure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau headquarters. He said evidence shows that Musk and DOGE \"have taken other unilateral actions without any apparent authorization from agency officials,\" including the firings of employees at the Department of Agriculture and National Nuclear Security Administration.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, the evidence presently favors the conclusion that contrary to defendants' sweeping claim that Musk acted only as an advisor, Musk made the decisions to shutdown USAID's headquarters and website even though he 'lacked the authority to make that decision,'\" Chuang wrote, citing arguments from the Trump administration.",
      "As to USAID, the judge said that the record before the court \"does not support the conclusion\" that decisions to dismantle the agency by permanently closing its headquarters and taking down its website were made by USAID officials.",
      "\"Thus, based on the present record, the only individuals known to be associated with decisions to initiate a shutdown of USAID by permanently closing USAID headquarters and taking down its website are Musk and DOGE team members,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The Constitution's Appointments Clause in part lays out the methods for appointing officers of the United States, divided into two categories: principal officers, appointed by the president with Senate approval, and inferior officers, who generally do not require Senate confirmation. The challengers in the case argued that Musk was carrying out the functions of an officer without being appointed to that role, thus violating the Appointments Clause.",
      "Chuang agreed. He found that where there is evidence that Musk exercised significant authority reserved for an officer while serving in a continuing government position, the unnamed USAID employees and contractors were likely to win on their argument that he skirted the Appointments Clause.",
      "\"The public interest is specifically harmed by defendants' actions, which have usurped the authority of the public's elected representatives in Congress to make decisions on whether, when and how to eliminate a federal government agency, and of officers of the United States duly appointed under the Constitution to exercise the authority entrusted to them,\" he wrote.",
      "In addition to finding that the dismantling of USAID by Musk and DOGE was likely unconstitutional, Chuang found that they lack authorization by Congress to take steps toward abolishing the agency.",
      "\"There is no statute that authorizes the Executive Branch to shut down USAID,\" he wrote.",
      "The judge added that Congress alone has the constitutional authority to take action to eliminate agencies it has created.",
      "\"Where Congress has prescribed the existence of USAID in statute pursuant to its legislative powers under Article I, the president's Article II power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed does not provide authority for the unilateral, drastic actions taken to dismantle the agency,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The judge's opinion warns that there are reasons to be concerned about the potential public disclosure of personal, sensitive or classified information by DOGE team members. He said they \"took extreme measures\" to gain access to classified information, including in secure facilities, \"when there was no identified need to do so,\" and when some DOGE staff lacked security clearances.",
      "Chuang cited one USAID employee on administrative leave who reported that DOGE team members who did not have security clearances granted themselves access to restricted areas that required approval.",

      "In an amended complaint filed in the Southern District of New York late Tuesday, the ice cream brand known for its outspoken views on human rights and the environment, said that UK-based Unilever's dismissal of Stever violated a merger agreement which prevents the unilateral removal of Ben & Jerry's CEO.",
      "The 2000 agreement stipulates that the CEO's removal can only occur \"after good faith consultation with, and the participation in the discussion of, an advisory committee of the Company Board,\" according to the Vermont-based company's complaint.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-jfk-assassination-files-released-2025/",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 13:51:35 -0400",
    "summary": "One professor said this JFK assassination files release is \"certainly the most useful\" of any so far \"because of the redactions being removed.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Tuesday evening released tens of thousands of pages of government documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, weeks after President Trump ordered government agencies to make their JFK files public.",
      "The documents, totaling some 80,000 pages, had been released before, with sections redacted for national security purposes. The declassified versions did not appear to contain significant new revelations about the assassination, based on an initial review by CBS News. But the unveiling of key portions of the records was cheered by researchers and academics who had long argued that the details in certain reports by the CIA and FBI should have been disclosed years ago.",
      "\"This is the most positive news on the release of JFK files since the 1990s,\" said Jefferson Morley, an investigative journalist and vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, which hosts a repository of JFK-related documents. He called the release an \"encouraging start\" while noting that other troves of documents still remain under wraps.",
      "The records were uploaded by the National Archives and Records Administration, the agency responsible for housing the government's collection of files related to the assassination. The Archives said Tuesday that \"all records previously withheld for classification\" have been released, but not all are available online yet.",
      "Shortly after taking office in January, the president took executive action to establish a process to declassify and release any remaining documents related to Kennedy's killing, as well as the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The order instructed the director of national intelligence and attorney general to present the president with a plan for the \"full and complete release of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\"",
      "What's in the newly released JFK files?",
      "The records are unredacted versions of documents that have been released in redacted form in the past. Agencies like the CIA and FBI have argued over the years that the release of the information would harm national security, even decades after the fact.",
      "According to Morley, roughly 3,500 documents in the government's official collection of JFK files contained redactions before the latest release. There were 1,123 documents of varying lengths unveiled Tuesday, meaning about a third of the remaining redacted documents have been released in full. About 75% of those records were produced by the CIA. More than 500 IRS records have been withheld from public release entirely.",
      "\"These new records shed new light on the events leading to JFK's assassination, including his mistrust of the CIA, the surveillance of Oswald in Mexico City, and propaganda operations involving Oswald before and after JFK was killed,\" Morley said in a statement referring to Lee Harvey Oswald, Kennedy's assassin. Oswald sought a visa to return to the Soviet Union in October 1963 while in Mexico City, and technical details of the CIA's surveillance operations were revealed for the first time in Tuesday's release.",
      "Another notable document released in full is a\u00a0memo prepared by Kennedy adviser Arthur Schlesinger Jr. about a potential reorganization of the CIA after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961. The\u00a0previously redacted\u00a0section details the number of undercover CIA personnel stationed overseas, with Schlesinger expressing concern that covert CIA activities were encroaching on the State Department.",
      "Various investigations into the JFK assassination over the years \u2014 some as recently as the 1990s \u2014 swept up classified information that dealt with intelligence gathering methods and friendly foreign governments but were not directly linked to the assassination. Portions of documents, and some entire records, had remained classified for decades to protect sources and methods.",
      "David Barrett, a professor of political science at Villanova University who studies the Kennedy presidency, told CBS News that \"non-scholars who dive into these documents are going to be baffled as to what most of them have to do with the Kennedy or other assassinations.\" For scholars like him, however, he said it is \"certainly the most useful release of documents that has occurred because of the redactions being removed.\"",
      "\"Now I know who or what is being referred to. So a memorandum on CIA relations with the Miami newspapers, for example, and details on three CIA officers doing technical collection of intelligence in Cuba \u2014 I've never really had those details before,\" he said.",
      "Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of \"The Kennedy Half-Century,\" told the Associated Press that his team is going through the released files in search of a \"long, long list\" of sensitive documents that were previously heavily redacted. He believes some of those passages may concern Cuba or \"what the CIA did or didn't do relevant to Lee Harvey Oswald.\"",
      "Last month, the FBI said it had\u00a0discovered\u00a0roughly 2,400 records related to the assassination during a search stemming from Mr. Trump's executive action. Those records did not appear in Tuesday's release, according to Morley.",
      "Where to read the new JFK assassination files",
      "The documents have been uploaded to a portal maintained by the National Archives, which can be found here. The Archives maintains the government's trove of records known as the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection.",
      "Not all of the files are available online yet, however. Some are available \"in person, via hard copy or on analog media formats\" at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the records that are only available in person are being digitized and will be uploaded to the Archives in the coming days. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard will post updates on social media, and the records will also be on the White House website.",
      "Additional documents remain under court seal, including some for reasons of grand jury secrecy. The IRS-related documents must be unsealed before release, and the Archives and Justice Department are working on making these available.",
      "The Mary Ferrell Foundation runs its own JFK documents repository on its website, which has deeper search functions for exploring the trove of records. The group typically adds new documents shortly after they are released by the Archives.",
      "Why did Trump release these JFK files?",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on declassifying and releasing records related to the JFK assassination, in part due to his political alliance with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long called for more transparency about the assassinations that killed his uncle and father.",
      "In 1992, Congress passed a law requiring the government to release all of its records about the assassination by October 2017, while giving the president the authority to withhold records for national security reasons. In his first term, Mr. Trump unveiled thousands of documents, but some of their contents were kept under wraps after lobbying by the CIA and FBI. Other records were withheld altogether.",
      "Over the course of 2021 and 2022, President Biden likewise released thousands of records but kept key portions redacted, frustrating researchers and observers who had called for their full release for years.",
      "When was JFK assassinated?",
      "Kennedy was shot in the head on Nov. 22, 1963, at the age of 46 while riding in a convertible in Dallas, Texas. Oswald, a former Marine and communist activist who had lived in the Soviet Union, was soon arrested for the killing. But Oswald was also shot and killed in the basement of the Dallas police headquarters two days later.",
      "An investigation led by Chief Justice Earl Warren concluded that Oswald acted alone in shooting Kennedy, but the probe has been widely criticized by academics and historians in the 62 years since the assassination.",
      "Oswald had been on the government's radar before the assassination, a fact that the CIA withheld from the Warren Commission. Oswald defected to the Soviet Union in 1959, and returned to the U.S. in 1962. A self-described Marxist, he worked with a pro-Fidel Castro activist group and had contact with Soviet and Cuban consulates in the months leading up to Kennedy's death.",
      "In October 1963, the CIA intercepted a phone call he made to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, and the documents released Tuesday detail some technical aspects of the CIA's surveillance of Oswald and Cuban and Soviet officials.",
      "The Associated Press and \n                                                  \n                      Andres Triay\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Dave O'Brien: Because they didn't do their job, and it's that simple.",
      "That lawsuit lists multiple failures to arrest Chris Prichard. O'Brien says this led to what's called a \"state-created danger,\" meaning the officers' alleged inaction and indifference actually increased the threat to Angela Prichard.",

      "Dave O'Brien: We have reason to believe that he was friendly with law enforcement officers.",

      "In October 2024, Chief Federal Judge C.J. Williams dismissed the lawsuit in its entirety. The Bellevue Police Department, he ruled, \"Did not put Angela in a more dangerous situation,\" and the three officers, \"simply did not commit outrageous conduct.\"",

      "Dave O'Brien: I've heard people say that \u2026 no-contact orders aren't worth the paper they're written on. And in this case that was true. But I firmly believe that they are worth something, but they have to be enforced.",

      "The checks are a holdover from the three stimulus payments that were sent during the pandemic, as some people may not have received some of the money, even if they were eligible.

    "summary": "Susann Sills had posted a topless photo in a political chatroom that enraged her husband, Dr. Eric Scott Sills, according to prosecutors.",
    "story": [
      "Susann Sills was no shrinking violet, says her friend Chris Solimine. They had met while both earned an MBA at the University of Miami. \u00a0\"Susann was ... smart, witty, sarcastic, but not in a mean way... just enough to dig at you,\" he said.\u00a0 \"Incredibly driven, a loyal friend.\"",
      "And she was an accomplished businesswoman. Together with her husband, Dr. Eric \"Scott\" Sills, a renowned fertility specialist, they had started their own IVF practice in April 2015. \"She started the business ... she built it,\" Solimine said, adding, \"Susann pretty much ran everything with the exception of actually doing the procedures.\"",
      "So, it came as a shock when he read the news that Susann Sills had suddenly died on Nov. 13, 2016, from an apparent accidental fall. \"It didn't seem plausible to me that she just fell down the stairs with a migraine headache,\" Solimine said. But that was the story Dr. Sills had told the 911 operator that morning when he called and reported finding his wife face down on the staircase. Solimine says he wondered if there was more to the story.",
      "Rick Leeds, another friend of Susann Sills, said she had left him a troubling message about a month before her death. \"She sounded like she was whispering,\" Leeds said. \"It was so different from the happy, jovial, excited voicemails I got before. This one was definitely ... things weren't good.\" When they spoke, Leeds said it sounded like there was tension over a photo.\u00a0 \"She said it was a topless photo of her that had appeared on a ... blog.\"\u00a0 As it turned out, the topless photo was one that Susann Sills had posted of herself on a political chatroom called Patrick.net.",
      "\"Susann apparently was one of the few women who was involved in this forum,\" according to former Orange County Sheriff's Homicide Detective Dave Holloway, who was the lead case agent. \"She ... kind of threw out on this forum that ... if Donald Trump won the presidential nomination, that she would post a picture of her bare breasts,\" Holloway said.",
      "Leeds says that when he and Susann Sills spoke, it was clear that, \"She and Scott were in a really rocky place, and that she was thinking about leaving him.\" He adds, \"Whatever was going on between her and Scott ... and this picture ... was just ... a pivotal point for her.\"",
      "But Holloway and his team had no idea about the photo or what, if any, significance it had on Susann Sills' death when they arrived at the Sills' San Clemente home.",
      "\"Susann had injuries to pretty much her whole body,\" said Holloway. \"Her face was all bruised up. Her back was bruised up ... both arms and legs ... had bruising and abrasions.\"",
      "\"48 Hours\" correspondent Tracy Smith asked, \"At that point in time that morning November 13th, was Scott Sills a victim or a suspect?\"",
      "\"To us ... he was a victim,\" Holloway said. \"We were going to a house where two kids and a husband just lost their wife and mother.\" But as they continued their investigation, the questions would mount.",
      "Smith goes inside the investigation in an encore of\u00a0\"The Puzzling Death of Susann Sills,\" airing Saturday at 10/9c* on CBS and streaming on Paramount+. (*basketball delay in the east and central time zones/)",
      "Detectives interviewed the couple's 12-year-old twins, Mary-Katherine and Eric Sills. Everyone described the marriage as \"loving.\" The children said their parents rarely fought and were never violent. And they all confirmed that Susann Sills had been suffering from a migraine all weekend. Mary-Katherine, whose room was the quietest, said she had cleaned and tidied it up to look like a hotel suite so that her mom could rest, while Mary-Katherine slept in her parents' bedroom.",
      "In his 911 call, Scott Sills said his wife's shoe had come off on the stairs, suggesting she had gotten up in the middle of the night, tripped and fell. A collection of items around Susann Sills' body seemed to support the story of an accidental fall. There was a large stainless-steel cooking pot, which seemed odd at first, but Susann Sills' family had explained she would sometimes carry a bowl when she felt nauseated. And there was an empty bottle of Tramadol, a pain medication, which Scott Sills said Susann Sills often took to treat her migraines. And off to the side was a red and white scarf. Mary-Katherine told investigators her mother had been wearing it around her neck when she was discovered in the morning. But she had taken it off so as not to impede her mother's breathing.",
      "During a preliminary examination of Susann Sills' injuries, the deputy coroner had noticed some other injuries to her neck that didn't appear to be consistent with a fall. \u00a0\"Her neck had a pretty pronounced ligature mark,\" Holloway said,",
      "Smith asked, \"Is it possible that she could have fallen down the stairs and then somehow the scarf strangled her?\"",
      "\"Could have caught on a banister ... sure, I suppose so,\" Holloway said, \"but we didn't have any evidence of that.\"",
      "Instead, investigators say, they found something suspicious. There was blood in Mary-Katherine's room where Susann Sills had been staying that night, on the curtains, the wall, and the nightstand. And they discovered that Scott Sills, who had been wearing a beanie on his head, had a cut on his head, and a bruise on his forearm. He said he had injured himself while working on his car with his son Eric. Meanwhile Eric told the detectives he'd heard his parents arguing in the early hours of the morning. Scott Sills admitted he had argued with Susann, but said it was because he was upset that she was working late on her laptop, which aggravated her migraines.",
      "Smith asked, \"When you came to the house, it was a death investigation...By the time you left, was it a murder investigation?",
      "\"No,\" said Holloway, \"It wasn't just as clear-cut as that.\"",
      "DNA tests on the blood in the bedroom eventually came back positive for Scott Sills, with a smudge on the wall that showed a mixture of both Scott and Susann's DNA. \"They were both there,\" said Holloway, \"There's a fight.\" And forensic analysis of Susann's phone suggested there was tension in the marriage. In texts sent in late August, less than three months before her death, Susann wrote, \"I am trapped\" ... \"You are killing me\" ... \"I just want out\" and \"We just aren't right for each other.\"",
      "In November 2017, a year after her death, the coroner's office cited Susann Sills' cause of death as ligature strangulation, and the manner as homicide. Dr. Sills was now the prime suspect.",
      "When investigators interviewed Scott Sills again in August 2018, he denied killing Susann Sills, and for the first time he offered an explanation for the blood in Mary-Katherine's room. He said he'd cut himself while changing a window screen.",
      "But on the day of Susann Sills' death, detectives had found something else -- a possible motive. In Scott Sills' home office was a printout of an online exchange between Susann Sills and a male member of Patrick.net dated Aug. 30, 2016. They were discussing that topless photo Susann Sills had posted. The man, who went by \"tenpoundbass\" wrote: \"All I've got to say is you must have a super cool Husband.\" Susann, aka \"turtledove\" replied, \"He's exhausted, actually. It isn't easy being married to a woman who is partially naked and posing, alluringly, all the time ...\"",
      "Scott Sills had denied printing the chat. But investigators had later found a copy of the same exchange on his phone.",
      "\"Does this sound like this could lead to motive?\" asked Smith.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Holloway. \"If it's ... something that's building up in him, some kind of anger ... or jealousy about ... what his wife's doing online without him.\"",
      "\"Enough to kill her?\" asked Smith. \"Mm-hmm,\" Holloway replied.",
      "In April 2019, Dr. Scott Sills was arrested on his way to surgery and charged with the alleged murder of his wife.",
      "At his trial in late 2023, Sills' defense attorney Jack Earley argued there was no motive for murder. And that topless photo? He told Smith, \"It wasn't a big deal.\"",
      "\"It's not striking to you that he had this photo in two places on his phone and then on the printer?\" she asked. \"No,\" he said. \"First of all, I don't know really who printed this stuff up.\"",
      "And Earley offered a unique theory to explain how the forensic pathologist could have found ligature strangulation. He said one or both of the family's dogs had tugged on the scarf that was wrapped around Susann's neck after she fell on the stairs.",
      "\"Mary-Kate ... saw the dogs pulling on the scarf,\" Earley told Smith.",
      "\"Do you honestly think that the dogs pulled hard enough to strangle her to death?\" Smith asked.",
      "\"No,\" he said. \"That was not the main theory.\"",
      "Instead, Earley focused on another injury identified in Susann's autopsy: a fractured C3 vertebra near the base of the neck, which can be fatal, or at least have left Susann incapacitated.",
      "\"Their breathing is compromised,\" Earley explained. \"If they're then choked, it doesn't take much to kill 'em.\"",

      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly signaled of late that policymakers are in no hurry to lower borrowing costs\u00a0for consumers and business. His bigger challenge: How to provide a measure of certainty on the direction of monetary policy as investors try to peer through the fog of uncertainty enveloping the global economy.",

      "Perhaps the most pressing question Powell is likely to face during his press conference Wednesday will focus on the potential impact of the brewing trade war between the U.S. and the country's key trading partners. The barrage of tariffs President Trump has aimed at Canada, China, Mexico, Europe and other countries has yet to make a deep mark on the U.S. economy, but experts warn the trade measures could drive up inflation and slam growth \u2014 a toxic stew known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "Despite signs that the economy is weakening, most Wall Street economists don't expect a recession anytime soon. And in spite of market turbulence caused by Mr. Trump's tariff threats, some experts think stocks are likely to gain strength in the months to come, although not without periodic bouts of volatility.",
      "\"We continue to expect the S&P 500 to reach 6,600 by the end of the year supported by Fed easing, healthy economic and profit growth, as well as AI spending and adoption,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email on Wednesday. \"Investors should consider buying the dip in quality AI stocks, and utilize structured strategies to manage downside risks in their equity exposure.\"",
      "John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, told investors in a report ahead of the Fed meeting that \"markets may have recently become overly pessimistic.\" Although he doesn't expect a recession, he forecasts slower economic growth and described the economy as \"vulnerable.\"",
      "The impact of tariffs and the health of the economy will, of course, help shape the Fed's decision on interest rates, and for policymakers the task amounts to threading the needle. Easing borrowing costs sooner rather than later would shore up growth, but also boost inflation \u2014 anathema to consumers worn down by nearly three years of high prices. By contrast, waiting too long to cut rates could cause the economy to stall.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes ruled in favor of transgender active-duty service members and transgender people in the process of enlisting.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday blocked enforcement of a new Defense Department policy barring transgender people from serving in the U.S. military.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes granted a request for a preliminary injunction sought by transgender active-duty service members and transgender people who are in the process of enlisting. The judge's order temporarily blocks Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the military services from implementing President Trump's executive order and additional guidance that prohibits transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "But the judge put her order on hold until March 21 to give the Justice Department time to seek emergency relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Reyes, appointed by former President Joe Biden, issued her decision after holding several hours of hearings earlier this month, during which she sharply questioned Justice Department lawyers about the Defense Department's justifications for the ban.",
      "\"Indeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed \u2014 some risking their lives \u2014to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them,\" Reyes wrote in her 79-page decision, later adding, \"The court's opinion is long, but its premise is simple.\u00a0 In the self-evident truth that 'all people are created equal,' all means all. Nothing more. And certainly nothing less.\"",
      "Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights for GLAD Law, one of the lead attorneys in the case, called the ruling \"decisive\" and said it \"speaks volumes.\"",
      "\"The court's unambiguous factual findings lay bare how this ban specifically targets and undermines our courageous service members who have committed themselves to defending our nation. Given the court's clear-eyed assessment, we are confident this ruling will stand strong on appeal,\" Levi said in a statement.",
      "A spokesperson for the Justice Department called the ruling \"the latest example of an activist judge attempting to seize power at the expense of the American people, who decisively voted to elect President Trump.\"",
      "The policy arose out of an executive order Mr. Trump issued in late January that directed Hegseth to implement a policy for transgender service members based on troop readiness. The order stated that \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life. A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\"",
      "The executive order also\u00a0revoked a measure implemented in January 2021 by then-President Joe Biden that allowed transgender individuals to serve in the U.S. military.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's directive, Hegseth issued a memorandum in early February that halted recruitment of new service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria and paused gender-affirming care for transgender troops. The Pentagon then said in a late February document that the U.S. would begin removing transgender troops from the military within 30 days unless they obtained a waiver.",
      "The memo said that individuals with a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria \"are no longer eligible for military service.\" It also said that pronoun usage when referring to a service member must reflect his or her sex and barred the use of Pentagon funds for gender-affirming care.",
      "Roughly 1,892 active-duty members of the military received gender-affirming care from the Defense Department between January 2016 and May 2021, according to a January report from the Congressional Research Service. While a Justice Department lawyer told the court earlier this month that the Pentagon does not have data on service members by gender identity, a defense official said that as of Dec. 9, there were about 4,200 troops who had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "Between 2015 and 2024, the Defense Department spent $52 million for care to active-duty service members to treat gender dysphoria, according to a February 26 memo from the Pentagon.",
      "The lawsuit before Reyes was filed in late January by a group of more than a dozen transgender active-duty service members, one person enlisted in U.S. Army basic training and five transgender people who were in the process of enlisting. They argued that the ban was unconstitutional and sought a court order blocking its enforcement.",
      "In her decision, Reyes found that the challengers were likely to succeed on their claim that the ban fails a higher level of judicial scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, because it classifies based on sex and transgender status. The judge also held that the Trump administration's policy is likely driven by unconstitutional animus.",
      "\"The Military Ban is soaked in animus and dripping with pretext,\" she wrote. \"Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.\"",
      "Reyes wrote that Mr. Trump and the Defense Department \"could have crafted a policy that balances the nation's need for a prepared military and Americans' right to equal protection. They still can. The Military Ban, however, is not that policy. The court therefore must act to uphold the equal protection rights that the military defends every day.\"",
      "The judge said government's policy is \"overbroad\" and also includes \"derogatory generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of transgender persons.\" Such generalizations, Reyes wrote, \"do not suffice to show that a sweeping discriminatory ban is substantially related to military readiness and unit cohesion.\"",
      "The decision from Reyes is likely to be appealed by the Justice Department, but it is the latest legal setback for the Trump administration, since several of its policies have been temporarily blocked by federal judges. A second challenge to the Mr. Trump's military ban is currently underway in Washington state.",
      "Mr. Trump sought to bar transgender people from serving in the military during his first term, in 2017, but an initial Pentagon policy was blocked by federal courts. The plan was then revised in 2018, and it took effect the following year and remained in place until the start of the Biden administration.",

      "Worrying test results",
      "The development came as Consumer Reports shared results\u00a0on Tuesday of tests by the group that found found potentially harmful chemicals in roughly half of 41 infant formula products, including acrylamide, arsenic, BPA, lead and PFAS. The remaining products were found to have low levels of, or no, concerning chemicals.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's ties to the Trump administration have provoked protests and violent attacks on Tesla across the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Tesla, whose pioneering electric vehicles were once a symbol of forward-thinking sustainability, increasingly finds itself the target of public furor.",
      "Attacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk's electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted. In Canada, Tesla was removed from an international auto show over safety concerns.",
      "There has been a clear uptick in Tesla attacks since President Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that is slashing government spending. Experts on domestic extremism say it's impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.",
      "In Mr. Trump's first term, his properties in New York City, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role.",
      "\"Tesla is an easy target,\" said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. \"They're rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.\"",
      "Musk critics have organized dozens of peaceful demonstrations at Tesla dealerships and factories across North America and Europe. Some Tesla owners, including a U.S. senator who feuded with Musk, have vowed to sell their vehicles.",
      "String of attacks",
      "The attacks are keeping law enforcement busy. Prosecutors in Colorado charged a suspect last month in connection with a string of attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words \"Nazi cars\" spray-painted on a building. Only weeks, the same Loveland, Colorado, dealership was targeted in another attack involving an incendiary device.",
      "And federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.",
      "\"The statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs,\" the agent wrote.",
      "A number of the most prominent incidents have been reported in left-leaning cities in the Pacific Northwest, like Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, where anti-Trump and anti-Musk sentiment runs high.",
      "An Oregon man is facing charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.",
      "Four Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.",
      "In Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word \"resist\" was also painted in red across the building's front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails \u2014 crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid \u2014 and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.",
      "\"Was this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think \u2014 the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,\" Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. \"None of those factors are lost on us.\"",
      "Meanwhile, some Tesla owners in conservative-leaning states are also facing acts of vandalism, including one Texas man whose Tesla was recently keyed while parked at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.",
      "\"I just bought it because it was an electric car,\" Dallas resident Jeff Nguyen told CBS News Texas. \"This one is pretty fun to drive. It has really just nothing to do with politics or anything like that.\"",
      "Tesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn't have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.",
      "More recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Mr. Trump's 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.",
      "Musk continues to run Tesla \u2014 as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX \u2014 while also serving as Mr. Trump's adviser.",
      "Tesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump's election but has since shed all those gains and this year has tumbled 44%, prompting expressions of concern from Wall Street analysts. Measures of Tesla's brand popularity also show the automaker taking a hit, while the company's sales fell in 2024 for the first since since 2015.",
      "President Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric vehicle showroom. The president promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz's podcast, saying \"at least some of it is organized and paid for\" by \"left-wing organizations in America, funded by left-wing billionaires, essentially.\"",
      "\"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"",
      "The progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize \"Musk Or Us\" protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and \"it explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.\"",
      "Some Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle's new stigma and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like \"I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy\" or \"I just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.\"",
      "Prices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla's most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.",
      "\"We're coming after you\"",
      "The White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of Trump's administration and a key donor to committees promoting Mr. Trump's political interests. Mr. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to \"domestic terror,\" and he has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are \"going to go through hell.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said she'd opened an investigation \"to see how is this being funded, who is behind this.\"",
      "\"If you're going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we're coming after you,\" Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network. In a statement Tuesday, she called the attacks \"domestic terrorism\" and vowed to \"continue investigations that impose severe consequences.\"",
      "Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point.",
      "\"It's not the type of act that I would prioritize,\" Clarke said. \"Not right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.\"",
      "Theresa Ramsdell is the president of the Tesla Owners of Washington state, a club for Tesla enthusiasts, and she and her husband own three of them.",
      "\"Hate on Elon and Trump all you want \u2014 that's fine and dandy, it's your choice,\" she said. \"It doesn't justify ruining somebody's property, vandalizing it, destroying it, setting it on fire. There's other ways to get your voice heard that's more effective.\"",
      "Someone recently slapped a \"no Elon\" sticker on the tailgate of her Cybertruck, but she said she doesn't intend to stop driving her Teslas. Other club members have taken a similar view, she said.",
      "\"I love my car. It's the safest car,\" Ramsdell said. \"I'm not going to let somebody else judge me for the car I drive.\"",

    "summary": "Jessie Hoffman Jr., 46, was put to death Tuesday evening in Louisiana's first execution in 15 years.",
    "story": [
      "Louisiana used\u00a0nitrogen gas to put Jessie Hoffman Jr., 46, to death Tuesday evening in the state's first execution in 15 years. Nitrogen gas has been used just four other times to execute a person in the United States \u2014 all in Alabama, the only other state with a protocol for the method.",
      "\"It is unfortunate that bad people exist, and they do real bad things. When these acts of violence happen, society must not tolerate it,\" Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said in a statement following the execution, adding, \"If you commit heinous acts of violence in this State, it will cost you your life. Plain and simple.",
      "Hoffman declined to give a final statement before the gas began flowing and he subsequently was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. Authorities said the nitrogen gas flowed for 19 minutes during what one official called a \"flawless\" execution, although one witness spoke of the inmate convulsing during the process.",
      "Hoffman's attorneys had sought to halt the execution, saying in a series of court filings leading up to his death the method is unconstitutional, violating the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. They also said it infringes on Hoffman's freedom to practice religion, specifically his Buddhist breathing and meditation in the moments leading up to his death.",
      "Louisiana officials maintain that the method is painless and say it is past time for the state to deliver justice promised to victims' families after a decade-and-a-half hiatus. Attorney General Liz Murrill says that she expects at least four people on Louisiana's death row to be executed this year.",
      "On Monday, Hoffman's attorneys filed a slew of additional challenges in state and federal courts as a last-ditch effort to stop the execution. The 19th Judicial District Court Judge Richard \"Chip\" Moore considered one of the challenges at a hearing Tuesday morning, which involved the question of whether the execution as planned violated Hoffman's religious freedom under the Preservation of Religious Freedom Act. But the state judge in Baton Rouge ultimately declined to the halt the impending procedure, CBS News affiliate\u00a0WAFB reported.",
      "The judge on Monday had issued a temporary restraining order \u2014 preventing the state from executing Hoffman \u2014 pending the Tuesday morning hearing. The restraining order was to expire at 9:30 a.m., with the execution scheduled to take place hours later on Tuesday evening.",
      "After court battles earlier this month, a federal judge temporarily halted Hoffman's execution by nitrogen gas last week, issuing a preliminary injunction to stop the state from immediately carrying out his death sentence. An appeals court quickly reversed that injunction, and in the wake of Tuesday's hearing, Hoffman's attorneys had just one final appeal out to the United States Supreme Court to halt the execution. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected that effort on Tuesday, declining to intervene by a 5-4 vote, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Hoffman was convicted of the 1996 murder of Mary \"Molly\" Elliott, a 28-year-old advertising executive, in New Orleans.",
      "Under the Louisiana protocol, which is nearly identical to Alabama's, officials had earlier said Hoffman would be strapped to a gurney before a full-face respirator mask fitted tightly on him. Pure nitrogen gas was then pumped into the mask, forcing him to breathe it in and depriving him of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions.",
      "The protocol called for the gas to be administered for at least 15 minutes or five minutes after the inmate's heart rate reaches a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer.",
      "Each inmate put to death using nitrogen in Alabama had appeared to shake and gasp to varying degrees during their executions, according to media witnesses, including an Associated Press reporter. The reactions are involuntary movements associated with oxygen deprivation, state officials have said.",
      "Currently, four states \u2014 Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma \u2014 specifically authorize execution by nitrogen hypoxia, according to records compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Alabama first used the lethal gas to put Kenneth Eugene Smith to death last year, marking the first time a new method had been used in the U.S. since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.",
      "In an effort to resume executions, Louisiana's GOP-dominated Legislature expanded the state's approved death penalty methods last year to include nitrogen hypoxia and electrocution. Lethal injection was already in place.",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, a small group of execution opponents held a vigil outside the rural southeast Louisiana prison at Angola, where the state's executions are carried out. Some passed out prayer cards with photos of a smiling Hoffman and planned a Buddhist reading and \"Meditation for Peace.",
      "Over recent decades, the number of executions nationally has declined sharply amid legal battles, a shortage of lethal injection drugs and waning public support for capital punishment. That has led a majority of states to either abolish or pause carrying out the death penalty.",

    "summary": "With the first licenses for providing psychedelic mushrooms issued in Colorado, excitement and questions build about the fungi's potential, affordability and safety.",
    "story": [
      "Colorado regulators are issuing licenses for providing psychedelic mushrooms and are planning to authorize the state's first \"healing centers,\" where the mushrooms can be ingested under supervision, in late spring or early summer.",
      "The dawn of state-regulated psychedelic mushrooms has arrived in Colorado, nearly two years since Oregon began offering them. The mushrooms are a Schedule I drug and illegal under federal law except for clinical research. But more than a dozen cities nationwide have deprioritized or decriminalized them in the past five years, and many eyes are turned toward Oregon's and Colorado's state-regulated programs.",
      "\"In Oregon and Colorado, we're going to learn a lot about administration of psychedelics outside of clinical, religious, and underground settings because they're the first to try this in the U.S.,\" said William R. Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.",
      "Psychedelic mushrooms and their psychoactive compound psilocybin have the potential to\u00a0treat people with depression and anxiety, including those unresponsive to other medications or therapy. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health, says the risk of mental health problems caused by ingesting mushrooms in a supervised clinical setting is low, but may be higher outside of a clinical setting. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a social media post last year, before his nomination as U.S. health secretary, that his \"mind is open to the idea of psychedelics for treatment.\"",
      "Medical experts say more research is needed, particularly in people with a diagnosis or family history of psychotic or bipolar disorder. Adverse effects of psilocybin, including headache and nausea, typically resolve within one to two days. However, extended difficulties from using psychedelics can last weeks, months, or years; anxiety and fear, existential struggle, social disconnection, and feeling detached from oneself and one's surroundings are most common. After the decriminalization and legalization in Oregon and Colorado, psychedelic mushroom exposures reported to poison control centers ticked up in these states and nationally.",
      "In February, about 40 people organized by the psychedelic advocacy group the Nowak Society gathered in Boulder to talk about the coming changes in Colorado. They included Mandy Grace, who received her state license to administer psychedelic mushrooms, and Amanda Clark, a licensed mental health counselor from Denver, who both praised the therapeutic power of mushrooms.",
      "\"You get discouraged in your practice because the current therapies are not enough for people,\" Clark said.",
      "Colorado voters approved Proposition 122 in 2022 to\u00a0legalize natural psychedelics, after Oregon voters in 2020 approved legalizing psilocybin for therapeutic use. Colorado's program is modeled after, but not the same as, Oregon's, under which 21,246 psilocybin products have been sold as of March, a total that could include secondary doses, according to the Oregon Health Authority.",
      "As of mid-March, Colorado has received applications for at least 15 healing center licenses, nine cultivation licenses, four manufacturer licenses, and one testing facility license for growing and preparing the mushrooms, under rules developed over two years by the governor-appointed Natural Medicine Advisory Board.",
      "Psychedelic treatments in Oregon are expensive, and are likely to be so in Colorado, too, said Tasia Poinsatte, Colorado director of the nonprofit Healing Advocacy Fund, which supports state-regulated programs for psychedelic therapy. In Oregon, psychedelic mushroom sessions are typically $1,000 to $3,000, are not covered by insurance, and must be paid for up front.",
      "The mushrooms themselves are not expensive, Poinsatte said, but a facilitator's time and support services are costly, and there are state fees. In Colorado, for doses over 2 milligrams, facilitators will screen participants at least 24 hours in advance, then supervise the session in which the participant consumes and experiences mushrooms, lasting several hours, plus a later meeting to integrate the experience.",
      "Facilitators, who may not have experience with mental health emergencies, need training in screening, informed consent, and postsession monitoring, Smith said. \"Because these models are new, we need to gather data from Colorado and Oregon to ensure safety.\"",
      "Facilitators generally pay a $420 training fee, which allows them to pursue the necessary consultation hours, and roughly $900 a year for a license, and healing centers pay $3,000 to $6,000 for initial licenses in Colorado. But the up-front cost for facilitators is significant: The required 150 hours in a state-accredited program and 80 hours of hands-on training can cost $10,000 or more, and Clark said she wouldn't pursue a facilitator license due to the prohibitive time and cost.",
      "To increase affordability for patients in Colorado, Poinsatte said, healing centers plan to offer sliding-scale pay options, and discounts for veterans, Medicaid enrollees, and those with low incomes. Group sessions are another option to lower costs.",
      "Colorado law does not allow retail sales of psilocybin, unlike cannabis, which can be sold both recreationally and medically in the state. But it allows adults 21 and older to grow, use, and share psychedelic mushrooms for personal use.",
      "Despite the retail ban, adjacent businesses have mushroomed. Inside the warehouse and laboratory of Activated Brands in Arvada, brown bags of sterilized grains such as corn, millet, and sorghum and plastic bags of soil substrate are for sale, along with genetic materials and ready-to-grow kits.",
      "Co-founder Sean Winfield sells these supplies for growing psychedelic or functional mushrooms such as lion's mane to people hoping to grow their own at home. Soon, Activated Brands will host cultivation and education classes for the public, Winfield said.",
      "Winfield and co-founder Shawn Cox recently hosted a psychedelic potluck at which experts studying and cultivating psychedelic mushrooms discussed genetics, extraction, and specialized equipment.",
      "Psychedelic mushrooms have a long history in Indigenous cultures, and provisions for their use in spiritual, cultural, or religious ceremonies are included in Colorado law, along with recognition of the cultural harm that could occur to federally recognized tribes and Indigenous people if natural medicine is overly commercialized or exploited.",
      "Several studies over the past five years have shown the long-term benefits of psilocybin for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, and the Food and Drug Administration designated it a breakthrough therapy. Late-stage trials, often a precursor to application for FDA approval, are underway.",
      "Smith said psilocybin is a promising tool for treating mental health disorders but has not yet been shown to be better than other advanced treatments. Joshua Woolley, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of California-San Francisco, said he has seen the benefits of psilocybin as an investigator in clinical trials.",
      "\"People can change hard-set habits. They can become unstuck. They can see things in new ways,\" he said of treating patients with a combination of psilocybin and psychotherapy.",
      "Colorado, unlike Oregon, allows integration of psilocybin into existing mental health and medical practices with a clinical facilitator license, and through micro-healing centers that are more limited in the amounts of mushrooms they can store.",
      "Still, Woolley said, between the federal ban and new state laws for psychedelics, this is uncharted territory. Most drugs used to treat mental health disorders are regulated by the FDA, something that Colorado is \"taking into its own hands\" by setting up its own program to regulate manufacturing and administration of psilocybin.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado declined to comment on its policy toward state-regulated psychedelic programs or personal use provisions, but Poinsatte hopes the same federal hands-off approach to marijuana will be taken for psilocybin in Oregon and Colorado.",
      "Winfield said he looks forward to the upcoming rollout and potential addition of other plant psychedelics, such as mescaline. \"We're talking about clandestine industries coming into the light,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Mexico's attorney general on Wednesday reported irregularities in an investigation by state authorities into an alleged\u00a0cartel killing site and training camp at a ranch in the western state of Jalisco where people searching for relatives found bones and hundreds of articles of clothing and other personal effects.",
      "The \"ranch of horror,\" as some local media have dubbed it, in the town of Teuchitlan, outside Guadalajara, was found by authorities in September 2024. Six months later, a so-called search collective found charred bone fragments and personal items, raising questions about the original investigation by the Jalisco State Prosecutor's Office.",
      "Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero, whose office took over the investigation last week, said that investigators in Jalisco failed to register evidence and fingerprints and process vehicles found at the ranch, three of which were later stolen.",
      "He said local authorities didn't investigate the ownership of the ranch and failed to scientifically analyze locations at the ranch to understand if they were used as crematoriums. Investigators did not arrest local officials who have been linked to activities at the ranch, he said.",
      "The extensive evidence meant that the \"truth will come out\" about the grisly discovery at a ranch in the western state of Jalisco, Gertz Manero told a news conference.",
      "The United Nations Human Rights Office last week called for \"thorough, independent, impartial and transparent investigations\" into the apparent crimes.",
      "Gertz Manero said federal prosecutors were also not alerted about the site, as is standard procedure, and cast blame on the state prosecutor's office despite the National Guard carrying out an operation at the site carried out last year. There is still not enough information to confirm if the ranch was used to cremate bodies or train cartel members, he added.",
      "The Jalisco Search Warriors group last week shared images that shocked many in a country that's long accustomed to stark news of cartel warfare, forced disappearances and government corruption. The images and videos showed dozens of shoes, piles of clothing and what appeared to be human bone fragments.",
      "Such collectives have long risked their lives to seek answers about what has happened to Mexico's 120,000 disappeared people in the face of rampant impunity.",
      "Vigils and protests took place over the weekend for the victims of the alleged site.",
      "On Monday, a video was circulated showing masked and heavily armed men who read a statement identifying themselves as the Jalisco New Generation cartel and questioning the motivations of the searchers.",
      "The Jalisco cartel was one of eight Latin American criminal organizations the U.S. government\u00a0designated foreign terrorist organizations\u00a0last month.",
      "Multiple mass graves have been found in recent months in Mexico. In January, at least\u00a056 bodies were discovered\u00a0in unmarked mass graves in northern Mexico, not far from the border with the United States.",
      "A\u00a0mass grave\u00a0discovered last December in a suburb of Guadalajara with dozens of bags of dismembered body parts contained the remains of 24 people, authorities said. That same month, Mexican authorities said they recovered a total of\u00a031 bodies\u00a0from pits in Chiapas, a state plagued by cartel violence.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 21:05:08 -0400",
    "summary": "Mexico City lawmakers overwhelmingly approve legislation to keep the bullfighting tradition alive, while also keeping the bulls alive.",
    "story": [
      "Mexico City \u2014\u00a0Mexico City lawmakers on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly to ban violent bullfighting, triggering outrage from aficionados and celebration from animal rights advocates. The legislation, approved by a 61-1 vote, prohibits the killing of bulls and the use of sharp objects that could injure the animals. It also sets time limits on how long bulls can be in the ring, all part of an initiative dubbed \"bullfighting without violence.\"",
      "The decision sparked angry protests from bullfighting supporters and matadors, some of whom tried to breach a police barricade at the local Congress. Some carried signs that read \"Being a fan of la fiesta brava (bullfighting) is not a crime, it's a point of pride.\"",
      "Animal rights activists and lawmakers who have been pushing the bill celebrated, however, walking out onto the steps of Congress surrounded by police in riot gear, pumping their fists and carrying stuffed bull dolls.",
      "\"It was either this or nothing,\" said Sof\u00eda Mor\u00edn, an animal rights activist with the organization Culture Without Torture, Mexico Without Bullfighting, leading the initiative to change the laws. \"We prefer this because, without a doubt, it's a huge step in protecting animals.\"",
      "Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada of the ruling Morena party echoed the activists, saying the decision would turn the Mexican capital into a place \"that respects the rights of animals.",
      "Tuesday's vote appeared to be an attempt to broker a compromise between two warring sides of the debate after years of back-and-forth about the practice.",
      "Bullfighting has long been a tradition and a pastime in Spain and many Latin American nations, but it has come under criticism for animal cruelty because bulls are often killed at the end of the fight. Animal rights groups say approximately 180,000 bulls are killed every year in bullfighting worldwide.",
      "A bloodless form of the attraction took root in California years ago, as reported by CBS San Francisco in 2021. In that version, bulls wear a Velcro pad on their backs while ornately-clad participants on horseback try to affix poles to the raging animals. Then \"forcados\" on foot enter the ring to try and literally grab the bull by the horns, but no blood is shed.",
      "The tradition, which has long drawn big crowds to arenas across Mexico, was dealt a blow when a judge in Mexico City banned the practice in June 2022, shutting down an arena that has been billed as the world's largest bullfighting ring. The judge ruled that bullfights violated city residents' rights to a healthy environment free from violence.",
      "While animal rights advocates celebrated it as a victory, and a step toward ending the bloody tradition, bullfighters said it dealt an economic blow to the city. The National Association of Breeders of Fighting Bulls in Mexico says bullfighting generates 80,000 direct jobs, and 146,000 indirect jobs across the country. Overall, the industry generates approximately $400 million a year.",
      "That was the concern for many in the crowd protesting the end of the violent fights, while others like Juan Pablo Pimienta screamed through a megaphone \"it's an activity where the fighting bull dies in a bullring. That's its nature. ... It is a beast.\"",
      "In 2023, Mexico's Supreme Court overturned the ban without explanation, allowing bullfighting arenas to be flooded once again with fans of the so-called \"fiesta brava.\"",
      "On Tuesday, in a speech before the city's congress, Green Party lawmaker Jes\u00fas Sesma acknowledged that the decision would anger a segment of the city's population.",
      "\"To those families who feel frustrated today, we're here to say that no one lost their job,\" he said. \"There was a middle ground to continue with these bullfighting spectacles, but now without violence.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0For a second night in a row, Israel's military launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip, killing at least 13 more people by early Wednesday after more than 400 were killed the previous day, according to health officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.",
      "Israel's military said it had targeted a Hamas military site in the enclave's southern al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, near the border with Egypt. At least two civilians were among those killed Wednesday, according to the Red Crescent.",
      "Separately, the United Nations agency UNOPS, which helps implement humanitarian, development and peacebuilding projects around the world, said Wednesday that one of its staffers had apparently been killed in a blast in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah.",
      "\"Reports are coming in that a UNOPS colleague has been killed in a detonation in Deir al Balah. It is understood that UNOPS accommodation was hit at approximately 11:30 a.m. this morning,\" the agency said.",
      "The statement from UNOPS came a couple hours after Israel's military issued a statement denying reports that it had struck \"a U.N. compound\" in Deir al-Balah, and adding a call for \"media outlets to act with caution regarding unverified reports.\"",
      "The mounting deaths come after Israel definitively ended a two-month ceasefire with Hamas before dawn Tuesday, resuming full-scale military operations in Gaza and threatening to ramp up its assault further. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a national address Tuesday night, vowed more strikes to force Hamas to release all of the remaining 59 hostages held in Gaza, about two dozen of whom are still believed to be alive.",
      "On Wednesday, Israel said it launched a \"limited ground operation\" in northern Gaza to retake part of a corridor that bisects it, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Even before Israel resumed military operations it had halted all humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza, drawing warnings from aid agencies and the United Nations that civilians would suffer unduly for the impasse in talks aimed at extending the ceasefire.",
      "\"It would be a blessing if this kid passed\"",
      "Dr. Marc Perlmutter, an American surgeon who has been volunteering at the al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, northern Gaza, told CBS News on Tuesday that the facility was struggling to cope with the influx of new patients wounded by Israel's attacks, and that young Palestinians were among those with the worst injuries.",
      "\"The level of bodily damage that these children get in particular is insane. My surgeries there consisted of 4- and 5- and 6-year-old kids with significant nerve injuries, and I've had to borrow nerves from both of their legs to graft nerves in their arms,\" he told CBS News in a phone interview. \"Israel has no trouble bombing hospital grounds. Fifty feet from me is a mosque that was thoroughly destroyed. There's no inhibition on their part to focus on population centers.\"",
      "Perlmutter said given the complete lack of medical supplies \u2013 he doesn't even have soap to wash his hands \u2013 made it impossible to properly treat some of the children coming in with grave injuries.",
      "Speaking of one boy, he said \"it would be a blessing if this kid passed, because of the amount of pain and the amount of destruction in his body \u2013 and our ability to deal with it in this setting is impossibly limited \u2013 and there's no place to transfer him to. There's no level-one trauma center. They're all overwhelmed.\"",
      "Israeli protesters condemn Netanyahu's return to war",
      "Black plumes rose along Israel's border fence with Gaza on Tuesday as the tired but unrelenting mother of Israeli hostage Matan Zangauker, holding a smoke canister up to the sky, angrily protested Netanyahu's resumption of military operations.",
      "\"Don't let the prime minister and the members of his government sacrifice the lives of my son Matan and of all the other living hostages just to remain in power,\" shouted Zangauker, a prominent leader of the protests that happen every week. \"We will not give up on you, we will not allow a return to fighting.\"",
      "Hamas terrorists kidnapped her 25-year-old son from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the unprecedented massacre on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Demonstrations, led by hostages' families, have exploded across Israel since the strikes in Gaza resumed, with thousands rallying regularly outside Israel's legislature, the Knesset, in Jerusalem and Israel's military headquarters, the Kirya, in Tel Aviv.",
      "\"I don't think they're listening. I don't think that they're listening to the people\u2026 to the people who elected them,\" hostage supporter Carmeet Roth told CBS News at a new tent encampment outside the defense complex. She said she was \"horrified\" when Israel's military relaunched airstrikes on Gaza after nearly two months of a fragile ceasefire. Her hopes for more hostages coming out alive have fallen.",
      "\"I think it is much less likely,\" she said, shaking her head. \"We've seen it before. I mean, it never brought them back. Only agreements and deals brought them back. That's the way to move forward.\"",
      "National polls consistently show a majority of Israelis \u2013 70% in a February survey -- want the ceasefire plan agreed to by Israel and Hamas, which was negotiated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, to continue as originally laid out. A second phase of that plan, which should have begun on March 1, stipulated the release of more living hostages in exchange for the full withdrawal of Israel's military from Gaza.",
      "Israel, with support from the Trump administration, demanded a change to those terms as Phase-1 of the agreement ended, however, accusing Hamas of breaching the deal and calling for an extension of the first phase under a new plan it attributed to the White House.",
      "Will Gaza assault destroy Hamas, or just leave \"more hostages dead\"?",
      "Retired General Israel Ziv knows a lot about how Israeli forces operate in the Gaza Strip. He commanded the military's Gaza division during the last major clash in the early 2000s, which, while it paled in comparison to the current war, saw heavy casualties on both sides.",
      "But the 30-year veteran warned that Israel's military may have reached its limit in forcing Hamas to bend to the will of Netanyahu and his far-right government, which has vowed repeatedly to achieve its stated goal of destroying Hamas.",
      "\"You can go up to, let's say, 80%, 90% of destroying the Hamas,\" he said. \"But this last 10%, which is the hardest and the most problematic one, you cannot achieve militarily.\"",
      "Ziv said only a political solution could bring a lasting peace between Israel and Hamas, and he accused Netanyahu of operating \"without enough courage to bring some political solutions to the table.\"",
      "Ziv said Netanyahu was stuck with a Catch-22: Vowing to free the remaining hostages safely while at the same time trying to kill the people who are holding them.",
      "Israel Defense Forces International spokesman Nadav Shoshani insists the military is ready to increase pressure on Hamas, and that doing so would bring the remaining hostages home.",
      "\"We're ready with a different set of plans, including more troops on the ground and a ground operation if needed,\" he told CBS News at a briefing this week. \"History shows that the military pressure could bring back hostages.\"",
      "Ziv disagrees with that assessment.",
      "\"We know over a year now that military pressure does not bring back the hostages,\" he said. \"And in some cases, the other way - it kills them. It kills hostages.\"",
      "\"To my opinion, unfortunately, if we keep on just with those raids and attacks, I think we're going to see more hostages dead.\"",

    "story": [
      "Search efforts pressed on into their second week for Sudiksha Konanki, a college student at the University of Pittsburgh who went missing in early March during a trip to the Dominican Republic resort town Punta Cana.",
      "Details surrounding Konanki's disappearance have begun to emerge as the international investigation continues. Here's what we know so far about her case.",
      "Konanki seen on video walking to beach",
      "Konanki, 20, is from Chantilly, Virginia, a Washington, D.C., suburb, and attends college in Pittsburgh. She has permanent residency in the United States as well as citizenship in India. She arrived in the Dominican Republic for spring break on March 3 and was vacationing with a group of friends, five other women, according to investigators and her parents.",
      "She\u00a0has been missing\u00a0since Thursday, March 6, after surveillance video showed her, three of her friends and two other American men walk toward the beach area outside the Riu Rep\u00fablica hotel. The video was from around 4:15 a.m., investigators in the Dominican Republic said.",
      "Power outages at the hotel may have prompted guests to move outdoors around that time, the hotel said in a statement. An earlier surveillance video showed Konanki and one of her friends hugging at the hotel bar.",
      "One of the men in the group walking to the beach has been identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, an American college student. In the footage, Konanki and Riibe are seen walking with their arms around each other.",
      "Video shows the other four individuals later returning to the hotel, but Konanki and Riibe stayed behind on the beach, a police source said. The last sighting of Konanki and Riibe in the water happened around 4:50 a.m., according to Loudon County Sheriff Mike Chapman, whose office in Virginia is involved in the investigation.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and both struggled against rough seas. He said he believed Konanki got out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "He is presumed to be the last person who saw Konanki alive.",
      "Konanki's disappearance is so far being investigated as a missing persons case, not a criminal investigation.",
      "The Dominican Republic's attorney general said investigators were exploring whether Konanki drowned, but not ruling out the possibility of foul play.",
      "Chapman said \"it's hard to say\" whether there are indications Konanki's disappearance was anything other than an accident.",
      "\"We know that at about 4:50 a.m. was the last sighting that we had of them in the water. We don't know what happened after that,\" Chapman said in a \"CBS Mornings\" interview. \"And we also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say. It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",
      "Konanki's family seeking closure",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office told CBS News that Konanki's family has requested that she be declared deceased, expressed gratitude to investigators for their work and expressed a desire for closure following her disappearance in the Dominican Republic.",
      "The family provided the request in writing to the sheriff's office, according to spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities.",
      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CBS News has learned that their written request referenced Riibe's cooperation with investigators and a lack of evidence collected to date that would suggest foul play was involved in Konanki's disappearance.",
      "Chapman said the family has expressed their belief that she drowned.",
      "\"While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible as we continue to review the evidence and information made available to us in the course of this investigation,\" he said.",
      "Riibe returns to U.S. after facing questioning",
      "Riibe had been confined to a hotel in Punta Cana for more than a week as he faced questioning during the investigation, with officers escorting him anywhere he went. A judge in the Dominican Republic ruled on March 18 that Riibe should be freed from police surveillance.",
      "The law firm representing Riibe, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza, had pushed in legal documents for his freedom, given the absence of any criminal charge, which led to the hearing. In court, Riibe argued to the judge that he was detained inappropriately.",
      "\"I really want to go home and see my family,\" Riibe said. \"I understand I'm here to help but it's been 10 days.\"",
      "His attorneys said earlier that authorities confiscated Riibe's passport as he faced questioning, including direct interrogation by Dominican Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso. The judge's ruling did not include an immediate decision on the issue of returning Riibe's passport, and when he would be able to travel back to the U.S. was initially unclear.",
      "An attorney representing the college student said on Wednesday, March 19, Riibe had obtained a new passport from the U.S. consulate and was on his way home with his father. The attorney said the hearing the day before concluded the release of Riibe was ordered and the La Altagracia Prosecutor's Office then informed him that it was willing to return his passport.",
      "\"Although grateful for the decision of the Prosecutor's Office, Joshua decided, for privacy reasons, to request a new one at the United States Consulate, which was urgently issued to him,\" Riibe's attorney said.",
      "Riibe and his parents, Tina and Albert Riibe, extended \"deep sorrow and solidarity\" with Konanski's family in a statement released through his attorney.",
      "\"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible,\" the statement said. \"Joshua Riibe is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman told \"CBS Mornings\" that Riibe was \"very forthcoming\" with sheriff's detectives who traveled to the Dominican Republic to speak to him, and did not \"seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way.\"",
      "Chapman noted there was \"nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",
      "Originally from Iowa, Riibe is a college senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where he is pursuing a degree in land surveying.",
      "His family in their statement described him as \"a beloved son, brother, and friend, known for his kind nature, sense of humor, and commitment to his community.\"",
      "They also shared concerns about the \"irregular conditions\" of his detainment in Punta Cana, where, they said, he had been \"subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel until Wednesday, March 12.\" The family retained a lawyer \"to initiate legal actions ensuring his safety and the protection of his rights throughout this process,\" according to the statement.",
      "Intensifying search efforts",
      "More than 300 police and other officials, with support from the FBI, are searching the air, sea and land to locate her, Dominican President Luis Abinader said. The Dominican Republic National Police said they have assembled a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, and Interpol has\u00a0issued a global police alert at the request of investigators.",
      "\"We are concerned,\" Abinader said at a news conference on March 10. \"All government agencies are searching \u2026 because the latest information we have from one of them, from the last person who was with the young woman, what he says according to the reports is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them.\"",
      "Dominican Republic National Police said in a statement March 11 that they were \"re-interviewing targeted individuals who were in the victim's proximity at the time of her disappearance.\" Investigators said the individuals included \"hotel employees where Konanki and her companions were staying, with the goal of gathering information to corroborate her movements, interactions, and any relevant details for the investigation.\"",

      "He returned before dawn on Sept. 14, 2019, with at least two other men armed with sledgehammers and crowbars, smashing a window and prying the toilet from its mount. Because the toilet was fully functional and connected to Blenheim Palace's plumbing system before it was taken, the removal caused \"significant damage and flooding in the building,\" police said at the time. The men escaped in stolen vehicles.",
      "\"This was an audacious raid which had been carefully planned and executed,\" prosecutor Shan Saunders said. \"But those responsible were not careful enough, leaving a trail of evidence in the form of forensics, CCTV footage and phone data.\"",
      "The purloined potty was stolen just days after its installation. It has never been recovered but is believed to have been cut up and sold.",
      "The golden toilet was a satirical work, titled \"America\" by Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan, which poked fun at excessive wealth. It weighed just over 215 pounds. The value of the gold at the time was $3.6 million.",
      "After the theft, Cattelan said he hoped the robbery was \"a kind of Robin Hood-inspired action,\" according to Blenheim Palace.",
      "The piece had previously been on display at The Guggenheim Museum in New York. The museum had offered the work to President Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.",
      "Jones, 39, was convicted of burglary in Oxford Crown Court.",
      "The theft was planned by James Sheen, 40, who previously pleaded guilty to burglary, conspiracy and transferring criminal property.",
      "Sheen then worked to broker a deal with Fred Doe to cash in on the haul, prosecutors said. In a series of text messages, Sheen referred to the loot as a \"car,\" but he was actually talking about the gold.",
      "\"I'll link up with ya, I got something right up your path,\" Sheen told Doe in one message.",
      "\"I can sell that car for you in two seconds ... so come and see me tomorrow,\" Doe said in a reply.",
      "Doe, 36, also known as Frederick Sines, was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property.",

    "story": [
      "Istanbul \u2014\u00a0Turkish police on Wednesday arrested Istanbul's mayor \u2014 a popular opposition leader and key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2014 and several other prominent figures as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links. It was a dramatic escalation in an ongoing crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey.",
      "The state-run Anadolu news agency said prosecutors issued detention warrants for the mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, and some 100 other people. Among those detained was Imamoglu's close aide, Murat Ongun.",
      "Authorities also closed several roads around Istanbul and banned demonstrations in the city for four days in an apparent effort to prevent protests following the arrest.",
      "Despite the ban, a live feed on the Anka News Agency's X account appeared to show protesters clashing with riot police at Istanbul University. One sign read: \"The university will not comply.\" No violence was immediately reported from the demonstrations.",
      "Private television network NTV said two Istanbul district mayors were among those detained.",
      "Critics note that the crackdown follows significant losses by Erdogan's ruling party in local elections last year, and amid growing calls for early national elections. Government officials insist the courts operate independently and reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated.",
      "\"We are facing great tyranny, but I want you to know that I will not be discouraged,\" Imamoglu said earlier in the day in a video posted on social media.",
      "Germany criticized the arrests Wednesday, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Sebastian Fischer describing them as \"a serious setback for democracy.\"",
      "Internet watchdog\u00a0Netblocks\u00a0said Wednesday that its live metrics indicated Turkey was restricting access to X, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and other social media platforms.",
      "Erdogan, a populist with what opponents say are increasingly authoritarian tendencies, has led Turkey as prime minister or president for more than 20 years and is now the longest-serving leader in the Turkish republic's history. His current term runs until 2028, but he has indicated he'd like to serve longer \u2014 something he could achieve with the help of a friendly parliament.",
      "Imamoglu was arrested as police searched his home, but it wasn't immediately clear if anything was confiscated. His wife, Dilek Imamoglu, told the private Now television network that police arrived at their residence before dawn and that the mayor was taken around 7:30 a.m.",
      "The Istanbul Stock Exchange's main index dropped by 7% over news of his arrest, triggering a temporary halt to trading to prevent panic selling and stabilize the market. The Turkish lira lost some 7% of its value against the dollar.",
      "Anadolu, the news agency, said that Ekrem Imamoglu and several others were suspected of extortion, money laundering and irregularities concerning tenders and procurements, among other crimes.",
      "Imamoglu is also suspected of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, by allegedly forming an alliance with a Kurdish umbrella organization for the Istanbul municipal elections, the report said. The PKK has waged a decades-long insurgency within Turkey and is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, Washington and other allies.",
      "Earlier this month, in a move lauded by the U.S., the PKK declared a unilateral ceasefire with Turkey's government, following a call from the group's long-jailed leader for it to lay down arms entirely.",
      "\"An attempted coup against our next president\"",
      "A day earlier, Istanbul University invalidated Imamoglu's diploma, effectively disqualifying him from running in the next presidential race \u2014 a university degree is a requisite for running in elections under Turkish law.",
      "The mayor's party \u2014 the main opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP \u2014 was to hold a primary on Sunday where Imamoglu was widely expected to be chosen as its candidate in future presidential elections. The national ballot is currently scheduled for 2028, but the vote is expected to be brought forward.",
      "Despite all the arrests Wednesday, CHP party chairman Ozgur Ozel told the opposition-aligned Halik TV channel that its primary would go ahead as planned. Ozel called Imamoglu's detention \"an attempted coup against our next president.\"",
      "In a social media post written in English, Imamoglu said: \"The will of the people cannot be silenced through intimidation or unlawful acts. I stand resolute, entrusting myself not only to the 16 million residents of Istanbul but to the 86 million citizens\" of Turkey.",
      "Turkey's pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party condemned the detentions and called for the immediate release of all taken into custody.",
      "The dawn raid on Imamoglu's home and his arrest was a \"disgrace that will not be forgotten for centuries. This operation, which shatters faith in justice, is an attempt to redesign politics through the judiciary,\" Tulay Hatimogullari, the party's co-chairwoman, wrote on X.",
      "As he was being arrested, Ongun, the mayor's aide, appealed for support on X, though he at the time did not appear to know that the mayor was also being taken into custody.",
      "\"They think they can silence us and prevent us from defending and supporting Ekrem Imamoglu,\" Ongun said. \"I entrust Ekrem Imamoglu to the Turkish nation. Protect, watch over and support him. They cannot defeat the nation.\"",
      "Police also detained a prominent investigative journalist, Ismail Saymaz, for questioning, the opposition-aligned Halk TV reported.",
      "In nullifying Imamoglu's diploma, the university cited alleged irregularities in his 1990 transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus to its Faculty of Business Administration. Imamoglu said he would challenge the decision.",
      "Imamoglu faces multiple lawsuits, including allegations of trying to influence a judicial expert investigating opposition-led municipalities. The cases could result in prison sentences and a political ban.",
      "He is also appealing a 2022 conviction of insulting members of Turkey's Supreme Electoral Council, a case that could result in a political ban.",
      "Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019 in a historic blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. The president's party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.",
      "The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which his party made significant gains against Erdogan's governing party.",

The commitment fell short of the full ceasefire pushed by the U.S. and agreed to by Ukraine. Hours after Mr. Trump and Putin hung up, Russia launched a series of drone strikes that struck civilian areas and damaged a hospital.",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a joint statement that Mr. Trump \"fully briefed\" Zelenskyy on the call with Putin, and Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy \"agreed to share information closely between their defense staffs as the battlefield situation evolved.\" Zelenskyy, the two said, asked for additional air defense systems, and Mr. Trump \"agreed to work with him to find what was available, particularly in Europe.\"",
      "Waltz and Rubio also said Mr. Trump suggested the U.S. could take ownership of and run Ukrainian's nuclear power plants. \"American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure,\" their statement said.",
      "Zelenskyy, for his part, said he had a \"positive, very substantive, and frank conversation with president of the United States Donald Trump\" and \"thanked him for a good and productive start to the work of the Ukrainian and American teams in Jeddah.\"",

      "On Wednesday, special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff said Putin is operating in \"good faith\" and the Russian leader issued an order following his call with Mr. Trump directing Russian forces not to attack Ukrainian energy infrastructure.",
      "Zelenskyy has expressed skepticism toward the idea that Putin wants peace.",
      "\"We are skeptical when it comes to trusting the Russians,\" Zelenskyy said Tuesday. \"There is no trust to Putin. That's why I am saying we need to understand how it will work technically so that it will not depend on their desire only. That is it.\"",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said \"technical teams\" are heading to Saudi Arabia on Monday to try to hammer out terms of a ceasefire.",
      "\"I spoke today with my Russian counterpart Yuri Ushakov about President Trump's efforts to end the war in Ukraine,\" Waltz wrote on X. \"We agreed our technical teams would meet in Riyadh in the coming days to focus on implementing and expanding the partial ceasefire President Trump secured from Russia.\"",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday, however, that Russia's attacks continued to hit his country's civilian and energy infrastructure, despite Putin's purported agreement with Mr. Trump. Zelenskyy said Moscow's refusal to halt all strikes on proved the need for increased pressure on Moscow to prevent Putin from prolonging the war.",

Those terms were not mentioned by the White House on Tuesday.",
      "\"I do not believe that we should make any concessions in terms of assistance for Ukraine, but rather there should be an increase in assistance for Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said Wednesday, reaction to the seemingly unchanged Russian demands.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump and Putin wrapped up their lengthy phone call, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions as residents took shelter.",
      "Despite efforts to repel the attack, several strikes hit civilian infrastructure, including a direct drone strike on a hospital in Sumy and attacks on cities in Donetsk region. Russian drones were also reported over Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions.",
      "Emergency services said the hospital in Sumy was damaged and that about 150 patients were evacuated, but they did not report any casualties.

      "The idea of Palestinian resettlement in another country is one of several options the Trump team is chewing over as part of the U.S. president's larger goal of ending Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" President Trump said Wednesday, when the Irish Prime Minister was asked during the two leaders' Oval Office meeting by a Voice of America reporter about the president's controversial remarks in February when he suggested taking ownership of Gaza to rebuild it.",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a Feb. 4 press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Gaza could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "\"\u200aWe should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this, and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A combination of Israeli and U.S. officials communicated to Sudan and Somalia, two diplomatic sources confirmed to CBS News. Senior far-right Israeli government officials have already been calling for Palestinians to migrate from the enclave. Mr. Trump's remarks have only emboldened Israel to reach out to other countries to explore opportunities for Palestinian resettlement, one source said.",
      "Three sources familiar with Mr. Trump's idea of resettling Gazans to another country told CBS News that his administration and Israel have also been interested in Syria. One source familiar with the Trump administration's Middle East policy said that the administration has attempted outreach to Syria's new interim government via a third-party interlocutor. Another source from the region told CBS News that Syria's government had been approached, but it was unclear whether there had been any response from Syria to the outreach.",
      "A senior Syrian official told CBS News that they are unaware of any outreach to their government by Israel or the U.S. about resettlement of Gazans.",
      "Dahir Hassan, Somalia's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News that \"neither the U.S. administration nor Israeli authorities have approached the Somali government regarding any proposed relocation of Palestinians to Somalia.\" Hassan also cited concern that \"the dissemination of such unverified information risks fueling recruitment propaganda for extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, potentially exacerbating security challenges in the region.\"",
      "The Sudanese government has not responded to a CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Syria's fledgling interim government is just three months old, after toppling Bashar al-Assad and his brutal regime which held an iron fist over the Syrian people for decades. The Arab northeast African nation of Sudan is currently embroiled in civil war and a refugee crisis while suffering pockets of famine. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel over the last two decades, only to be detained in the country's desert-based detention centers or left to live without any formal status. The East African country of Somalia is a fragile, formerly failed state where the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab continues to wage a deadly insurgency.",
      "Since his Feb. 4 news conference, Mr. Trump has suggested Palestinians would have a choice on whether to leave but also indicated that their departure from Gaza could be permanent. In a Fox News interview several days later he said, \"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities, could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they (the Palestinians) are.\" In the same interview, he said that Palestinians wouldn't have the right to return to Gaza under his plan because the enclave \"is not habitable\" and won't be for years to come.",
      "The United Nations reported in January that over 90% of housing units in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million Gazan civilians have been displaced. Gaza's health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in which Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis and took roughly 250 more hostage.",
      "Multiple Arab governments, the United Nations and some Democratic lawmakers, quickly denounced Mr. Trump's idea of emptying out Gaza with some defining the idea as ethnic cleansing. Instead, Arab leaders endorsed an alternative Egyptian post-war construction plan for Gaza last week, but the Trump administration and Israel were both quick to reject it, again citing that the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had been sending U.S. officials on a regular basis to meet with the new Syrian government in Damascus in the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration when the visits stopped.\u00a0 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, was quick to condemn Mr. Trump's remarks in February, saying that the U.S. president's plan \"is a serious crime that will ultimately fail\". It is unclear what the Trump administration's overall policy toward the new Syrian government will be.",
      "\"The Trump administration should engage directly with the new government in Damascus, particularly after the agreement between Damascus and the SDF (the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces). And to ensure that Iran never again gains a foothold in Syria, for the true, enduring defeat of ISIS, and to conduct a full withdrawal of U.S. forces in the right way unlike what unfolded in Afghanistan,\" Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Washington-based advocacy and humanitarian organization Syrian Emergency Task Force, told CBS News.",
      "Israel has conducted widespread airstrikes in Syria since December, on what it described as Assad regime weapons sites, and seized territory in the buffer zone between both countries. This past week, Israel struck inside a Damascus suburb, saying it was taking out the headquarters of the Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group that has a substantial foothold in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "A State Department spokesperson deferred to the Israeli government, and told CBS News that Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff \"continues to work tirelessly towards either an extension of Phase One (of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement) or an advance to Phase Two with these principles in mind\".",
      "The State Department also referred to remarks by Witkoff from a February Fox News interview in which he said, \"We need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for Gazans and Palestinians.\"",
      "Witkoff also suggested in the same Fox interview that Gaza's entire Palestinian population could go to other Middle East-based Arab nations and other countries beyond the region: \"I think that the president's solution is: how do we address where two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are: in some respects, Egypt, in some respects, Jordan; but in some respects other countries who have called us up and voluntarily said this is a humanitarian effort, we want to help you\".",
      "Asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday about whether the Trump administration is talking to other countries about relocation of two million Palestinians in Gaza, Witkoff said again \"I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that lead to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things.\"",
      "Millions of displaced Palestinians already live in surrounding Arab countries as refugees, including in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt.

      "But this was real. An urgent email was sent by a researcher at South Africa's isolated Sanae IV base in Antarctica accusing a man, one of the nine team members, of becoming violent and mentally unstable. In the email sent to a journalist at South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, the researcher, who has not been identified publicly, requests immediate action to ensure the team's safety.",
      "According to the Times, the researcher alleged that the male team member had physically assaulted a colleague, threatened to kill a different colleague and sexually assaulted another. However, South African officials later said the report of a sexual assault was not correct.",
      "\"His behavior has become increasingly egregious, and I am experiencing significant difficulty in feeling secure in his presence,\" the newspaper quoted the researcher as writing, adding: \"It is imperative that immediate action is taken to ensure my safety and the safety of all employees.\"",
      "South Africa's Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment released a statement saying the alleged assault at the base was reported on Feb. 27, triggering a response plan that saw the government agency use \"trained professionals\" to mediate. The department said those mediators continued to engage with the team at the base on \"an almost daily basis.\"",
      "According to the agency, the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended.\"",
      "The statement went on to say the male perpetrator had written an apology to the victim and was willing \"to verbally apologize to other team members.\"",

      "\"I will be keeping close contact with the base to ensure it remains that way,\" said George, adding that a \"team of psychologists and other experts\" were also in \"direct and constant\" contact with the team.",

      "Those options may be few, as severe weather conditions have completely cut the base off from the sea.

      "Andre Rives was boar-hunting when a female bear nicknamed Caramelles attacked him.",

      "Rives sustained leg injuries and was in a state of shock. A fellow hunter managed to stem the bleeding before he was evacuated by helicopter.",
      "According to the investigation, the bear was killed 1,300 feet outside an authorized hunting area.",
      "The case caused an uproar in the department of Ariege, where hunters have held demonstrations in support of Rives.",
      "\"This is not an anti-bear or pro-bear trial,\" presiding judge Sun Yung Lazare said. Rives is on trial for \"destroying a protected species,\" she said.",
      "When the cubs emerged, \"I looked at them with admiration,\" Rives said in court. \"I made myself very small. Then the mother saw me. Our eyes met, she charged.\"",
      "He said he had no choice but to shoot.",

    "summary": "Officials in Hamas-ruled Gaza say the new Israeli assault has killed more than 400 people, as Israel accuses Hamas of refusing to extend the ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip \u2014 Israel has launched new strikes in the Gaza Strip, killing more than 400 people, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Health Ministry, and promising to wield \"increasing military force\" after talks on further hostage releases stalled, according to officials on both sides of the war. The resumption of Israel's war against Hamas on Monday came after almost two months of relative calm in Gaza under a ceasefire the U.S. helped to broker, but which Israel and Hamas could not agree on how to continue.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement its military is \"currently attacking targets of the Hamas terrorist organization throughout the Gaza Strip, with the aim of achieving the war goals as determined by the political echelon, including the release of all our hostages \u2014 living and dead.\"",
      "\"From now on, Israel will act against Hamas with increasing military force,\" the prime minister's office said.",
      "The health ministry in Gaza, a densely populated coastal enclave that has been run by the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization Hamas for almost two decades, said at least 404 people had been killed in Israel's fresh strikes by midday on Tuesday. Video from the territory showed bodies lined up on the floors of hospitals as more casualties streamed in.",
      "The statement from Netanyahu's office said Israel was resuming strikes because of Hamas' repeated refusals to release its hostages and its rejection of all offers it received from the U.S. presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and mediators.",
      "\"If Hamas does not release all the kidnapped, the gates of hell will open in Gaza and Hamas' murderers and rapists will meet the IDF with forces they have never known before,\" Defense Minister Israel Katz said. \"We will not stop fighting until all the kidnapped return home and all the war's goals are achieved.\"",
      "Over the weekend, Witkoff warned that Hamas must release living hostages immediately \"or pay a severe price.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday evening that the Trump administration was consulted by the Israelis on their attacks in Gaza.",
      "\"Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war,\" National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes told CBS News on Monday.",
      "Hostages families, U.N. and Egypt condemn resumption of war",
      "The group representing the Israeli hostages' families condemned Netanyahu's decision to resume the fighting, accusing him of a \"complete deception,\" arguing that it would endanger the remaining captives, and quickly organizing a new protest against the move.",
      "\"The families' greatest fear has come true \u2014 the Israeli government has chosen to give up on the abductees. We are shocked, angry and anxious about the deliberate disruption of the process to return our loved ones from Hamas captivity,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.",
      "\"Returning to fighting before the last abductee is returned will come at the cost of the 59 abductees who are still in Gaza and could be saved and returned,\" the group said, accusing Netanyahu's government of having \"refused to declare an end to the war in order to implement the next steps in the [ceasefire] deal and return all the abductees.\"",
      "The forum dismissed Netanyahu's claim that the resumption of fighting was intended to secure the remaining hostages' release as \"a complete deception.\"",
      "The forum said \"families are now making their way to Jerusalem and calling on the people of Israel to stand with them\" in a protest on Tuesday. \"There is nothing more urgent than this! With each passing day, the danger to the hostages grows. Military pressure could further endanger their lives and complicate efforts to bring them home safely.\"",
      "United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said he was \"horrified by last night's Israeli airstrikes and shelling in Gaza, which killed hundreds, according to the Ministry of Health in the strip,\" adding that it would \"add tragedy onto tragedy.\"",
      "Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the U.N. chief was \"shocked by the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, in which a meaningful number of civilians have been killed. He strongly appeals for the ceasefire to be respected, for unimpeded humanitarian assistance to be reestablished and for the remaining hostages to be released unconditionally.\"",
      "Egypt, which helped negotiate the ceasefire along with the U.S. and Qatar, issued a statement condemning Israel's actions, which it called \"a flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement and a dangerous escalation that threatens to have dire consequences for the stability of the region.\"",
      "\"Egypt reiterates its complete rejection of all Israeli attacks aimed at re-igniting tension in the region and thwarting efforts aimed at calming the situation and restoring stability. It calls on the international community to intervene immediately to halt the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip and prevent the region from re-entering a new cycle of violence and counter-violence,\" Egypt's foreign ministry said.",
      "Hamas says Israel \"fully responsible for violating and overturning\" ceasefire",
      "Hamas also condemned the attacks, accusing Israel of breaching the ceasefire and putting the fate of the remaining hostages in jeopardy.",
      "In a statement, Hamas said it would hold Netanyahu's government \"fully responsible for the repercussions of the treacherous aggression on Gaza, and for the defenseless civilians and our besieged Palestinian people, who are subjected to a brutal war and a systematic policy of starvation.\"",
      "\"Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate,\" said Hamas, adding a demand for the U.S. and its negotiating partners Egypt and Qatar to \"hold Netanyahu and the Zionist occupation fully responsible for violating and overturning the agreement.\"",
      "In a separate statement, Hamas spokesperson Abdul Latif al-Qanou said Israel's \"coordination with the U.S. administration prior to the attacks confirms the U.S. partnership in the genocide perpetrated against our people and its role in covering up Israeli war crimes.\"",
      "What happened during the ceasefire?",
      "The new strikes come amid the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and after nearly two months of a ceasefire to pause the 17-month-long war that saw dozens of hostages released in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The first phase of the ceasefire ended on March 1 but the pause in major fighting held until Monday.",
      "Since the first phase of the ceasefire ended, the sides have not been able to agree on a way forward to a second phase aimed at releasing the nearly 60 remaining hostages and ending the war altogether. Netanyahu had repeatedly threatened to resume the war, and President Trump had also issued several warnings and ultimatums to Hamas \u2014 some contradicting the agreed-upon terms of the ceasefire \u2014  as negotiations on a second phase of the ceasefire struggled to materialize.",
      "Egypt, Qatar and the United States had been trying to mediate the next steps in the ceasefire.",
      "Earlier in the month, Israel cut off aid into Gaza, stopping the entry of all goods and supplies into the Palestinian territory. Israel said the aid blockade was aimed at pressuring Hamas to accept a\u00a0proposal drafted by the Trump administration to extend the first phase\u00a0of the ceasefire. Under the proposal, Israel had demanded Hamas immediately hand over half of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, which would have been a significant change in the terms initially agreed to under the deal brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt.",
      "On Friday, Hamas said it had accepted a proposal from mediators to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four dual-nationals who had died in captivity. Netanyahu's office cast doubt on the offer last week, accusing the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group of trying to manipulate talks underway in Qatar on the next stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.",
      "In a separate Friday statement, Hamas official Husam Badran reaffirmed what he said was Hamas' commitment to fully implementing the ceasefire agreement in all its phases, warning that any Israeli deviation from the terms would return negotiations to square one.",
      "The agreement had called for negotiations to begin on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, in which the remaining hostages would be released and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.",
      "The war erupted with Hamas' Oct 7, 2023, cross-border terrorist attack, which killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded with a military offensive that killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population. The territory's Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants, but says over half of the dead have been women and children.",
      "While the ceasefire largely halted the fighting, Israel has left troops in Gaza throughout the past two months and continued to strike targets, claiming that Palestinians were trying to carry out attacks or approaching troops in no-go zones.   A number of strikes earlier Monday killed a total of 10 people, according to Palestinian officials.",

      "London - Some court documents related to a freedom of information request to access Prince Harry's U.S. immigration files were released on Tuesday, under an order issued by a Washington D.C. district court, after the conservative Heritage Foundation alleged that the British royal\u00a0may have concealed past drug use when he applied for his visa. Harry currently lives in California with his wife, Meghan, and their children.",
      "The documents released included court filings from several federal agencies responding to the Heritage Foundation's request. They did not include the prince's immigration records. Portions of the documents relating to him or his immigration status were heavily redacted.",
      "Applications for visas to live in the United States ask about current and historical drug use. Admission of drug use can lead to visa applications being rejected, but immigration officers have discretion to make their final decisions on a number of factors. Lying on visa applications can lead to lifetime bans on entering the U.S.",
      "\"There's a lot of discretion that the government has, but merely admitting to drug use very often is not disqualifying from entering the country, but lying about drug use can be more serious and potentially could be disqualifying,\" CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson said.",
      "The Heritage Foundation alleges that Harry may have lied about his past drug use on his application. Their allegations center around claims Harry made in his memoir, published in January 2023, where he described using various types of drugs.",
      "Cocaine \"wasn't much fun, and it didn't make me particularly happy, as it seemed to make everyone around me, but it did make me feel different, and that was the main goal,\" Harry wrote.",

      "The Heritage Foundation lodged a freedom of information request with the Department of Homeland Security in 2023, not long after his book was published, seeking access to Harry's immigration documents.",
      "\"Harry has publicly admitted to extensive illegal drug use. What do we submit this means? That Harry seems to have received special treatment: the DHS looked the other way if the Prince answered truthfully, or it looked the other way if the Prince lied on his visa application. Either action would be wrong,\" Nile Gardiner from the Heritage Foundation said in an online post in 2024.",
      "Harry and Meghan moved to the U.S. in 2020 after stepping down as working members of Britain's royal family.",

      "Meghan has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Most Americans dislike the idea of celebrities being treated differently from anyone else, and Harry's fame and profile makes this case the ideal window into DHS conduct,\" the Heritage Foundation's Gardiner argued. \"If DHS granted Harry special treatment, the implications are obvious: it has likely granted such treatment in the past to others sufficiently famous or sufficiently politically aligned, and will likely continue to do so.\"",

    "story": [
      "The family of missing college student\u00a0Sudiksha Konanki\u00a0has asked authorities that she be declared deceased, the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office in Virginia told CBS News, almost two weeks after she disappeared while visiting Punta Cana for spring break.",
      "The family provided the request in writing to the sheriff's office, according to spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities. According to the sheriff's office, the family has expressed a desire for closure.",
      "In a statement later on Tuesday, Loudoun County Sheriff Michael Chapman said the family also expressed their belief that she drowned.",
      "\"While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible as we continue to review the evidence and information made available to us in the course of this investigation,\" Chapman said.",
      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The student, 20, was last seen in the early morning hours of March 6\u00a0on a beach near the resort town's Riu Rep\u00fablica hotel where she and her friends and had been staying. Surveillance video from the night she disappeared showed Konanki walking toward the beach with a group of three women and two men, one of whom authorities identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, who is presumed to be the last person to see her alive. She and Riibe stayed behind on the beach after the four others left, a police source told CBS News, citing video footage.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and struggled in rough waters. He said he believed Konanki made it out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "Konanki lives in the D.C. suburb Loudon, Virginia, and attends the University of Pittsburgh. Her disappearance sparked a missing persons investigation and massive search effort by authorities in the Dominican Republic and the United States, with agencies probing land, sea and air in hopes of locating her. The Dominican Republic National Police said they created a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, while Interpol issued a missing person alert to police around the world.",
      "Authorities in the U.S. and the Dominican Republic have repeatedly emphasized that this is so far not a criminal investigation. Dominican Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso said investigators are exploring whether Konanki may have drowned but have not ruled out the possibility of foul play. In their request that law enforcement declare her dead, Konanki's family referenced the lack of evidence suggesting foul play so far.",
      "Since Konanki vanished, Reynoso has directly interrogated Riibe, a student at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota who is originally from Iowa, the law firm representing Riibe, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza, told CBS News. Authorities confiscated Riibe's passport while holding him for questioning in Punta Cana and assigning him \"permanent\" police escorts, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza said.",
      "Riibe's attorney has been pushing for his release, noting in legal filings that his client has not been charged with a crime, local media reported. A hearing on that issue was set for later Tuesday.",
      "Chapman described Riibe as \"very forthcoming\" in interviews with two of the sheriff's detectives who traveled to Punta Cana last week to discuss the case with him. In a \"CBS Mornings\" interview, Chapman said Riibe \"didn't seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way,\" echoing previous comments from Riibe's attorneys and parents, who said in a statement that their son \"is deeply dismayed\" by Konanki's disappearance \"and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman said any inconsistencies in Riibe's statements \"were really quite minor and nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",
      "Asked if there's anything that indicates Konanki's disappearance is more than an accident, Chapman said, \"It's hard to say\" and acknowledged that some questions remain unanswered, including what happened after Konanki and Riibe were allegedly in the water.",
      "\"We also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say,\" he said. \"It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",

      "After Mr. Trump signed an executive order that seeks to make sweeping cuts at the nation's largest international broadcaster, about 1,300 employees, including Abramowitz, learned over the weekend they had been placed on administrative leave, and another 500 contractors were terminated. Mr. Trump accused the news agency, which began broadcasting during World War II, of spreading \"radical propaganda.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News Monday, Abramowitz called VOA \"an incredibly important soft power tool\" for the U.S. and said shuttering it would be a \"self-inflicted blow\" to national security because VOA's news coverage helps to combat Chinese, Russian and Iranian disinformation.",
      "\"If America pulls off the playing field and cedes it to our adversaries, then they're going to be telling the narratives that people around the world are going to be hearing, and that can't be good for America,\" he said. \"They're going to be hearing an anti-America narrative. We need to fight that with truth.\"",

      "\"We are getting through to an audience that might otherwise hear propaganda,\" Abramowitz said, adding that many VOA journalists are from countries under authoritarian control. \"The major challenge for the United States in general is this global information war in which countries like China and Russia are essentially really having our lunch. \u2026 So, I really feel that we need an organization that is accurate, unbiased, objective, and that tells the truth about America to the rest of the world in the languages that they understand.\"",
      "\"That has never been more important with a sea of lies and disinformation that are going on around the world,\" he added.",
      "Still, Abramowitz acknowledged\tthat VOA, which has a $270 million annual budget, could be reformed and that it should \"not be resistant to change.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying it has to be the way it's always been,\" Abramowitz said. \"Change is great. Change is needed. Change is required.\"",
      "\"I don't personally think it's a waste of taxpayer money,\" he argued. \"Does that mean that it has to be a $270 million budget? Maybe it could be [$240 million], maybe it could be [$200 million]. Look, we are in an era where the taxpayer expects a smaller, more modernized, more streamlined government.\"",
      "He defended VOA's journalists as non-partisan and said if they harbored any bias, it is against totalitarianism, tyranny and authoritarianism.",
      "\"If you care about a free Iran, if you care about more openness in China, if you care about freedom in Russia, if you care about freedom in Venezuela and Nicaragua, then you have an incredibly important tool in VOA to help push back and to get accurate and objective information into these places that don't have it,\" he said. \"That is incredibly important.\"",

      "But discharge petitions got a boost recently. The House adopted two last year alone. One was a package on natural disaster tax relief. Members also advanced a discharge petition to curb the reduction of Social Security payments to senior citizens. But over the past quarter-century, only four discharge petitions collected the requisite signatures to compel House action.",
      "The remote voting discharge petition by Luna and Pettersen collected enough signatures last week. That will trigger the House to consider the plan on proxy voting for moms and parents \u2013 unless House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can convince the sponsors to dial things back.",
      "Johnson opposes remote voting.",
      "\"I'm afraid the whole thing is unconstitutional. \"So I've tried to discuss this with Anna, and she's pretty stubborn about it,\" said Johnson.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., is the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee. He argued that the GOP backlash to proxy voting \"was insane\" during the pandemic, but then McGovern called out Johnson.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)",
      "\"Speaker Johnson voted remotely 39 times,\" said McGovern.",
      "Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said he opposes proxy voting because of the potential for members to take advantage of the option.",
      "\"Members abused the practice during COVID. They used to go to fundraisers. They used to go on vacation,\" said Burchett. \"But you can't fake a pregnancy.\"",
      "What Luna and Pettersen actually constructed was a discharge petition for a \"rule.\" A \"rule\" is the parliamentary mechanism for the House to put a bill or resolution on the floor. The remote voting plan would pry loose a \"rule\" allowing the House to consider the Luna/Pettersen resolution.",
      "Any member who signed onto the discharge petition can try to call it up as early as March 27. The House GOP brass can delay putting it on the floor until March 31 or April 1. That\u2019s when the House would actually vote to discharge the \"rule\" on proxy voting.",
      "If the House voted to put the \"rule\" for remote voting on the floor, then it can actually debate and vote on the proposed change itself. But the House GOP leadership could also delay this step by a couple of days, perhaps until April 7 or 8.",
      "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson is pictured in front of the US Capitol. (Getty Images/AP)",
      "Fox is told that Johnson could prepare a special rule from the Rules Committee to potentially impede the Luna/Pettersen plan. Under House rules, this plan could make the proxy voting plan only available on the second or fourth Monday of the month, but this approach is unwieldy at best.",
      "The House is scheduled to be out of session on the second Monday of the month, April 14, but it does meet on Monday, April 28. So, it\u2019s possible this could string out the plan until then.",
      "Fox is also told that the House Republican leaders may want to rip the Band-Aid off right away. That could prompt immediate action on the plan when the House returns next week.",
      "Keep in mind that signing the discharge petition only makes it available to come to the floor. The cohort of 218 members who signed the discharge petition are not bound to vote in favor of any of the procedural steps just outlined. They are also not required to vote for the actual change, allowing for remote voting.",
      "That\u2019s why there could be lots of arm-twisting behind the scenes by members who don\u2019t want the House to adopt this plan.",

      "Regardless, when the House does consider any of these machinations, members will have to vote in person in the chamber. At least for now.",

      "Tech expert Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Change-of-address scams involve some of the most seemingly harmless personal information getting into the wrong hands. This can lead to a whole host of problems, including financial losses and identity theft, although change-of-address fraud is technically a form of identity theft.",
      "This kind of fraud involves a scammer impersonating you to request a change of address with the United States Postal Service (USPS).",
      "Once they have your mail redirected to an address they control, they can go through it at their leisure, looking for mail they can steal and information they can use to perpetrate further scams, like taking out loans or credit cards in your name or using your identity to defraud others.",

      "Here\u2019s how it works, step by step",
      "This detailed breakdown explains the process of a change-of-address scam, from initial targeting to the potential consequences and warning signs to watch for.",
      "A person with criminal intent gets your postal address and full name, something that\u2019s most easily done using a so-called people search site. People search sites, also known as people finder sites, are a kind of data broker that specializes in collecting, organizing and selling access to personal information.",
      "The scammer then mails a change-of-address request to the USPS, providing your name and a new address he has access to. The\u00a0online change-of-address form is generally more secure, requiring confirmation via a bank account. That\u2019s why scammers will almost always mail in the request.",
      "The form requires a signature, but this is unlikely to be verified when processing the request. So, the scammer will either find an image of your signature somewhere, steal a document that includes your signature or simply sign your name any which way.",
      "Now that they\u2019ve redirected your mail straight into their hands, the scammer just has to patiently wait for sensitive mail to arrive. They\u2019re on the lookout for anything they can use to steal from you or defraud you. Bank statements, tax documents, checks and even your household bills can be used to commit further acts of fraud and identity theft.",
      "One of the scariest things a scammer can do once he has enough of your personal information is to commit deed fraud, otherwise known as\u00a0home title theft. You\u2019re far from helpless, though. There are telltale signs that you can watch for to catch change-of-address scams early.",
      "The most obvious sign to watch for is a sudden and persistent drop in the amount of mail entering your mailbox. This only applies to mail addressed to you by name. Mail delivered to your address without an addressee, including mail addressed to \"homeowner\" or \"occupant,\" won\u2019t be affected by a change-of-address scam.",
      "The other major things to keep an eye on are your credit report, credit card statements and bank statements. You can request a free credit report from one of the three credit bureaus once per year.",

      "Start by keeping detailed records: Document everything that\u2019s led you to believe your mail has been redirected. This includes the mail you were expecting, any communication with the senders of the missed mail (such as confirming dispatch dates), suspicious phone calls, texts or emails, and any unusual activity in your online accounts, bank accounts or credit reports.Reach out to the USPS for help: Use the\u00a0online locator to find and contact your local U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) office. They can assist with investigating fraudulent mail redirection.Take action if identity theft is suspected: If you believe you\u2019ve become a victim of identity fraud, visit the Federal Trade Commission's identity theft portal. This resource will help you develop a recovery plan and guide you through the steps to protect yourself.",

      "Prevention is better than a cure, and, luckily, there\u2019s a lot you can do to stop change-of-address scams before they start.",
      "1. Invest in personal data removal services: Have your personal information removed from data broker databases, including people search sites. They\u2019re the first port of call for many scammers. Without these companies in the mix, scammers aren\u2019t likely to come across your address in the first place.",
      "A reputable personal information removal service can take your data down from hundreds of sites and keep it off by resending removal requests, even as data brokers try to add your information to their databases.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Reduce the amount of sensitive mail in your mailbox: Start by switching to paperless options wherever available. This will dramatically reduce the amount of sensitive mail heading to your mailbox, leaving criminals with little value to steal. Check your mail daily, as soon as possible after it\u2019s delivered. Get someone to do this for you if you\u2019re away. Some redirection scams start with mail being stolen from your mailbox. Definitely avoid allowing your mailbox to overflow.",

      "3. Secure your mailbox: Consider upgrading to a\u00a0locked mailbox\u00a0to prevent mail theft. If you live in an area prone to mail theft, this simple step can stop criminals from intercepting sensitive documents before they even reach you.",
      "4. Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. Set up USPS Informed Delivery: Enroll in\u00a0USPS Informed Delivery, a free service that lets you preview images of incoming mail before it arrives. This can help you spot missing mail early and identify potential issues with mail redirection.",
      "6. Report suspicious activity immediately: If you notice anything unusual, such as missing mail or unauthorized changes to your accounts, report it right away. Contact the USPS, your bank and the Federal Trade Commission to ensure the issue is documented and addressed promptly.",

      "Change-of-address scams might sound like an unlikely threat, but they can wreak havoc on your finances and peace of mind if left unchecked. By staying alert, securing your personal information and taking proactive measures like monitoring your mail and credit, you can greatly reduce the risk of falling victim to these scams.

      "5. Report suspicious activity:\u00a0If you receive a text that seems off, report it immediately to your mobile carrier, local law enforcement or the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Reporting helps authorities track down scammers and prevent further attacks.",
      "6. Consider using a personal data removal service: Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure to smishing attacks by removing your sensitive information \u2014 like phone numbers, addresses and email details \u2014 from data broker websites. Scammers often rely on these publicly available databases to target victims with personalized phishing texts. These services aren\u2019t foolproof, but they can make it harder for cybercriminals to find and exploit your information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The outward-facing cameras are capable of detecting rolling stops, unsafe lane changes and potential collisions, while the inward-facing cameras monitor driver drowsiness, distraction, seatbelt violations and smoking.

Many truck drivers view their vehicles as second homes, especially long-haul drivers who spend extended periods on the road. The constant presence of cameras in their workspace raises concerns about perceived invasion of privacy in personal space, fear of constant surveillance and micromanagement and worries about data security and potential misuse of collected information.",
      "The use of outward-facing cameras also affects the privacy of other road users because they may record private citizens without consent. There is a risk of data breaches exposing personal information or location data and concerns about how footage might be used or shared. These concerns underscore the need for careful consideration of privacy rights when deploying such technology.",
      "To address some of these privacy concerns, Motive has implemented features such as Driver Privacy Mode, which allows drivers to disable the driver-facing camera while off duty. Additionally, Motive's AI dashcam system includes privacy controls and the option to activate Driver Privacy Mode for individual drivers, groups or entire fleets.

      "With President Donald Trump now in the White House, analysts say Israel is operating with fewer constraints than before, impacting its military approach and the war\u2019s potential outcome.",
      "\"It is all\u00a0about Trump,\" a former senior Israeli official told Fox News Digital, \"Netanyahu can continue this war for another year. If Trump tells him in two weeks, enough, now you have to go for a deal, he would.\" The same source also suggested that a new strategy is now being implemented: Dividing Gaza into controlled corridors, with food and civilian movement under Israeli military oversight, aiming to pressure Hamas.",
      "John Spencer, Chair of Urban Warfare Studies at West Point\u2019s Modern War Institute, told Fox News Digital, \"The Trump administration, even before it was elected, was very clear:\u00a0release all the hostages, including American citizens, or I will provide Israel everything it needs to legally, lawfully, and within all international laws prosecute its war against Hamas, with fewer constraints than the Biden administration put on it.\"",

      "\"The big variable at the higher level is the status of civilian evacuations,\" Spencer explained. \"The United States is now more open to encouraging nations to allow Gazans to temporarily evacuate combat zones, which signals a shift in approach under the Trump administration.\"",
      "The collapse of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has reignited military operations in Gaza. Israel cited Hamas'\u00a0refusal to release hostages\u00a0as the reason for resuming attacks, while Hamas claimed that Israel failed to uphold its commitments under the ceasefire agreement.",
      "Jonathan Conricus, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, highlighted\u00a0Egypt\u2019s role\u00a0in the evolving situation: \"I think that this time around, Egypt will be forced by the U.S. to open up the gate and allow Palestinians to flee the battlefield. That is the right thing to do. It's the humane thing to do. It is the legal thing to do, and that is what Egypt must do,\" he said. He criticized Egyptian authorities for restricting Palestinian movement, arguing that their policies have contributed to civilian suffering.",

      "In a video statement on Tuesday, Netanyahu thanked President Trump for his unwavering support of Israel, \"Our alliance with the United States has never been stronger,\" he said.",
      "On the battlefield, Israel has expanded\u00a0its targets beyond Hamas\u2019 military infrastructure to its governmental network.",
      "\"The recent strikes, as Israel states, include quite a lot of the governmental side of a terror organization,\" Assaf Orion, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute and INSS, told Fox News Digital. However, he said, questions remain about what will follow if Hamas' governance structure is dismantled.",
      "The hostage situation remains a central issue. While the Israeli government argues that military action is necessary to pressure Hamas into releasing captives, concerns about hostage safety have sparked protests within Israel. Conricus told Fox News Digital, \"The risk to hostages has increased. Hamas may execute some in retaliation for Israel\u2019s renewed offensive, but the way I see it, Israel had no choice but to resume military operations after two weeks in which Hamas didn\u2019t release any hostages. Honestly, I\u2019m surprised we\u2019ve waited this long to act.\"",
      "Chief of the General Staff LTG Eyal Zamir conducted a field tour in the Rafah area of the Gaza Strip. He spoke with soldiers and was presented with defensive preparations and operational plans. (IDF)",
      "Orion acknowledged the complexity of balancing military objectives with hostage negotiations: \"There is a clear tension between releasing the hostages, which involves a deal, and eradicating Hamas, which involves fighting. If the hostages are killed, that\u2019s irreversible. An\u00a0enduring defeat to\u00a0Hamas, we all understand, is a generational task,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "Whether Hamas can be fully defeated remains an open question. Spencer believes it to be possible, saying, \"Hamas is weaker than ever, with its ability to hold territory and conduct organized military operations severely diminished. However, Israel must commit to holding the ground it clears, or Hamas could regroup and return.\"",

      "The outcome of Israel\u2019s renewed campaign will depend not just on military strategy but also on Trump\u2019s political approach. As the former Israeli official noted, if Trump decides to push for negotiations, Netanyahu is likely to follow suit. Until then, Israel appears set to continue its most extensive military operation yet.",

      "Former Vice President Al Gore championed the development of the internet so enthusiastically that one of the first myths of the online era was that he claimed to have invented it.",
      "It was in those early days of the world wide web that one of Gore\u2019s successors came of age.",
      "JD Vance grew up with chat rooms and email and instant messaging. He graduated into young adulthood at the dawn of blogging. He entered politics with a millennial\u2019s fluency in social media.",
      "Now, at 40, he is the nation\u2019s third-youngest vice president \u2014 and, nearly a quarter-century after Gore left office, the nation\u2019s first very online vice president. It\u2019s a pioneering distinction that reflects the serious time and thought, as well as the debate-me vibes, that Vance puts into his interactions with others.",
      "\u201cI tend to err on the side of openness,\u201d Vance said in a recent interview aboard Air Force Two. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a generational thing, right? I come from a very tech-forward generation.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s unfiltered use of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, sets him apart from many of his political peers \u2014 and certainly from past vice presidents who were older, far more restrained and far less eager to slide into your mentions.",
      "Where other elected officeholders rely on staff to send out tightly crafted messages, Vance estimates that, even with a full White House portfolio, he writes 98% of his posts himself. And where President Donald Trump and his hit-and-run blasts have pushed social media into new frontiers of political communication and confrontation, Vance has pushed further. Unlike Trump, he engages directly in conversations with his allies and fights with his critics. He also sticks around to watch reactions pour in, replying when it suits him.",
      "At times, Vance is in on the joke. His recent Oval Office upbraiding of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ignited a raft of memes in which Vance\u2019s face was edited into a variety of images \u2014 flattering or unflattering, depending on the poster\u2019s opinion of him. Vance contributed to the discourse by sharing an image of his face in the well-traveled Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme \u2014 a winking acknowledgement that he was enjoying all of the online fuss.",
      "\u201cIt can become very addictive, right?\u201d Vance said of social media. \u201cSo I try to limit myself. We limit our kids\u2019 screen time. I try to limit my screen time, too.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s posts at times veer into hostility. Last month, after he called for the rehiring of a federal employee who had resigned over making racist remarks online, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., scolded Vance, noting how they are both fathers of Indian American children.",
      "\u201cFor the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cRacist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don\u2019t threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes. A culture that encourages congressmen to act like whiny children.\u201d",
      "He accused Khanna of \u201cemotional blackmail\u201d before concluding: \u201cYou disgust me.\u201d",
      "While Vance and his advisers characterize his social media persona as a worthy effort to foster authentic discussion and debate, his detractors view it as abrasive and performative.",
      "\u201cI have no problem with him being active on social media and engaging in conversation with critics,\u201d Khanna said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m not hoping here for Lincoln-Douglas. I wish he were using it to have an actual substantive exchange instead of trying to own the libs in every tweet.\u201d",
      "Aboard Air Force Two, Vance wrestled with his social media habits, at one point calculating how much time he spends online and at another volunteering that he is trying to read more books.",
      "\u201cI actually try not to look at it most of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in my office in the West Wing, I usually have my phone in a secure box, because people come in, there\u2019s classified information flowing everywhere. I sort of assume the Chinese or somebody else are hacked into my phone.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s tough to resist a morning or afternoon scroll.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take 15 minutes just to make sure I\u2019m staying up to date on the news and I know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI\u2019m probably a little bit more active after the kids go to bed, right between 8 and 11.\u201d",
      "Stormy posts, \u2018Always Sunny\u2019 memes",
      "Since being sworn in as vice president two months ago, Vance has posted from his personal @JDVance X account more than 140 times, including reposts and replies to other accounts.",
      "In that same period, the official @VP handle that is managed by his office has posted roughly 250 times, with a heavy concentration on traditional statements, as well as reposts of content from other Trump administration officials and White House-affiliated accounts.",
      "While he averages fewer than three posts a day from his personal account, Vance often maximizes them by taking advantage of the unlimited characters he\u2019s afforded as a verified user. He is known for seeking out thought leaders and others whose beliefs place them outside the bounds of Trump\u2019s right-wing ideology and his reluctance to involve the U.S. in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "Over two days last month, Vance tapped out more than 850 words in a pair of posts that chided Niall Ferguson of the Hoover Institution, a hawkish vestige of the old-guard Republican economic and foreign policy establishment. Ferguson had slammed Trump\u2019s approach to the war in Ukraine. Ferguson did not mention Vance in his original post, but the vice president nevertheless locked in on it, decrying it as \u201cmoralistic garbage.\u201d",
      "On Presidents\u2019 Day, Vance replied to former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan, who had referred to Vance\u2019s rebuke of European free speech laws and asked if he was aware of the White House limiting access to Associated Press reporters.",
      "\u201cYes dummy,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cI think there\u2019s a difference between not giving a reporter a seat in the WH press briefing room and jailing people for dissenting views. The latter is a threat to free speech, the former is not. Hope that helps!\u201d",
      "And though Vance said he locks his phone away for much of the workday, several of his more colorful missives have come on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.",
      "When Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted a clip of a recent CNN appearance in which he accused the White House of being too cozy with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Vance clapped back with a Monday morning \u201cCharlie Conspiracy\u201d meme from the sitcom \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\u201d",
      "\u201cMore politicians should be accessible and responsive,\u201d said Khanna, who, like Murphy and Vance, is viewed as a potential presidential candidate in 2028. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a waste of time or a disservice. It\u2019s the manner in which he\u2019s doing it. \u2026 That\u2019s the problem.\u201d",
      "A reply guy is born",
      "Vance has always been eager to express himself online.",
      "In the aughts and early 2010s he dabbled as a blogger \u2014 first as an amateur Blogspot author during his days in the Marines and at Yale Law School, later at a site led by former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum.",
      "His earliest days on social media are tougher to excavate. Vance acknowledged during his 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio that he had deleted his old tweets, including those critical of Trump.",
      "\u201cIn 4 years, I hope people remember that it was those of us who empathized with Trump\u2019s voters who fought him most aggressively,\u201d Vance wrote in a since-scrubbed post from 2016.",
      "The posts Vance wrote and interacted with in those days, when he was best known for his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d previewed the range he would offer as his political instincts developed. His tweets then were a mix of lighter fare in line with the childless young professional he was at the time \u2014 he goofed on an Obama White House post playing off the Disney film \u201cFrozen\u201d \u2014 and the punchiness he would hone as he made his sharp right turn.",
      "\u201cThis is a pretty insane tweet,\u201d he wrote in response to a December 2016 post by liberal columnist Paul Krugman that suggested Trump could benefit from a 9/11-style attack.",
      "Vance\u2019s online posture became more combative as he transitioned from anti-Trump Republican to Trump-backed candidate and U.S. senator.",
      "While disparaging Democratic leaders as \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d in 2021 \u2014 an attack that came back to haunt him in his early days as Trump\u2019s running mate \u2014 Vance fired off a tweet that included Krugman in the smear. In the years since, he has embraced the role of reply guy.",
      "\u201cIf you weren\u2019t such a humorless scold you might be a senator right now,\u201d he tweeted at Jason Kander, a past Democratic Senate candidate in Missouri who had mocked a photo of Vance pointing a rifle toward the sky in 2023 as a Chinese spy balloon flew over the U.S.",
      "Anyone who wondered whether Vance would change his freewheeling ways after winning the vice presidency got their answer soon after November\u2019s election. When Grace Chong, an associate of influential MAGA movement leader Steve Bannon, criticized him for missing a Senate vote on then-President Joe Biden\u2019s judicial nominees, Vance fired back.",
      "\u201cGrace Chong,\u201d he wrote on X, in a post that he later deleted, \u201cis a mouth breathing imbecile who attacks those of us in the fight rather than make herself useful.\u201d",
      "The angel on Vance\u2019s social media shoulder",
      "Second lady Usha Vance has urged her husband to be nicer on social media \u2014 advice he is not always keen to take, he told activists at last month\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "\u201cI take it sometimes!\u201d he said when reminded of the comment on Air Force Two.",
      "If his wife is the angel on his social media shoulder, who is the devil? The second lady, who was seated across from her husband on the plane and until that point in the interview had quietly kept her head down, looked up in amusement after hearing the question.",
      "\u201cI guess I have a few,\u201d Vance responded, after repeating it.",
      "\u201cThe only time that my staff ever tweets for me,\u201d he continued, nodding toward his communications director, William Martin, \u201cis if I\u2019m in a speech and I say, \u2018Hey, Will, can you just make sure a clip of this gets out in real time?\u2019 Or if I\u2019m in meetings all day, \u2018Hey, can you say something about this, and say it like that?\u2019 That happens probably 2% of the time. The other 98% of the time, it\u2019s all me. So I guess I don\u2019t have anybody else to blame when I get something wrong.\u201d",
      "Vance has copped to being wrong, at least in his opinion, about Trump in 2016. Yet he has been more stubborn about his unsubstantiated claim last fall on X that Haitian migrants were abducting and eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. When reporters confronted him about the absence of evidence, Vance made no apologies and instead took credit for drawing attention to other problems that immigration had stirred up in his home state.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conspiracy theories, some of which turn out to be legitimate, some of which turn out to be totally bats---,\u201d Vance, speaking broadly about the social media landscape, said aboard the plane. \u201cAnd I guess I just think openness is really important.\u201d",
      "How does he muster the confidence to plow ahead with takes that may be proved wrong?",
      "\u201cBeing wrong is OK,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cI\u2019d rather be open with people and wrong than overly cautious, never take any risks in the service of never getting anything wrong.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to change your mind. \u2026 I guess my confidence comes from the fact that, if I can argue somewhat successfully with my wife, I assume I can argue well with anybody.\u201d",
      "The second lady, Vance admitted, wishes he would \u201cbe a little bit more gentle\u201d online.",
      "\u201cBut she\u2019s also encouraged me not to filter myself and not to just become a kind of creature of consultant guidance,\u201d he added. \u201cPoliticians, they get way too comfortable with slogans. Yeah, sometimes you need to hammer home a message, but you can\u2019t just do that, or you become a total robot.\u201d"

      "The federal judge at odds with the White House over its immigration enforcement and now the target of impeachment calls driven by President Donald Trump is a bipartisan appointee whose three-decade career in Washington, D.C., has included cases that have favored Trump.",
      "James Boasberg, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia since 2023, drew Trump\u2019s ire after he temporarily blocked the administration\u2019s effort to carry out migrant deportations by plane over the weekend under a rarely used wartime law.",
      "During an interview that aired Tuesday on Fox News, Trump mentioned impeaching Boasberg, whom he slighted as a \u201clocal judge.\u201d Trump earlier pressed for Boasberg\u2019s impeachment in a social media post and branded him a \u201cradical left lunatic, a troublemaker and agitator.\u201d",
      "Those who know Boasberg and his record insist he is anything but.",
      "In 2002, President George W. Bush nominated Boasberg as an associate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. In 2011, President Barack Obama selected him to be a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and he was confirmed by the Senate in a 96-0 vote.",
      "One Washington attorney who frequently appeared before Boasberg, 62, called him an \u201cextremely conscientious\u201d judge who was \u201cvery much down the center\u201d and committed to getting things right.\u201cHe\u2019s known among lawyers and his colleagues to be a brilliant judge,\u201d the lawyer said, speaking anonymously to avoid being seen as pandering to the judge.",
      "Boasberg initially had barred the Trump administration from deporting five Venezuelan nationals in the U.S. accused of being gang members. While Trump has cited an 18th-century law known as the Alien Enemies Act as the basis for the action, the federal government did not comply with Boasberg\u2019s order to temporarily halt any such flights or turn the flights around, setting off a tense hearing Monday between the judge and Justice Department lawyers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one heck of a stretch, I think,\u201d Boasberg said of the government\u2019s noncompliance of his verbal orders requiring any deportation flights to return to the U.S.",
      "Trump\u2019s impeachment comments led Chief Justice John Roberts to issue a rare rebuke Tuesday of calls to impeach judges over rulings that a president may disagree with, and said targeting individual judges publicly for their decisions was dangerous for the judicial system and rule of law.",
      "A request for comment sent to Boasberg\u2019s chambers Wednesday about Trump\u2019s call for impeachment was not immediately returned.",
      "Like most federal judges in Washington, Boasberg handled a number of Jan. 6 cases and often assigned lighter sentences than those requested by Justice Department prosecutors. In one instance, Boasberg sentenced a Jan. 6 rioter who brought a Confederate flag to the Capitol and wore an \u201cI \u2764\ufe0f TRUMP\u201d beanie before he assaulted officers with chemical spray to 2 1/2 years in federal prison, a full decade less than what prosecutors had sought.",
      "In his time on the bench, Boasberg has also rejected the lies that drove the Jan. 6, 2021, attack.",
      "After overseeing a trial in which a Jan. 6 rioter who assaulted law enforcement officers represented himself, Boasberg said he agreed that politicians who falsely claimed the election was stolen should be \u201cashamed of themselves,\u201d and the defendant should have been \u201cmore perceptive and thoughtful\u201d about the lies he was hearing.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re too smart to have been fooled by the lies on the election,\u201d Boasberg told the defendant.\u00a0In a separate case, Boasberg said claims that the election was stolen were probably false, and an honest belief in the notion did not excuse bad behavior.",
      "\u201cOur society changes its leaders based on what happens at the ballot box, not because of a mob,\u201d he said.",
      "Boasberg also handled the case against a Trump supporter named Ray Epps, who was at the center of an unfounded right-wing conspiracy theory that held he was an FBI informant. While the government sought six months in prison for Epps, Boasberg ultimately sentenced him to probation, saying Epps had been \u201cvilified in a matter unique to January 6 defendants\u201c and that the collateral consequences on Epps\u2019 life were significant. He said Epps was the only Jan. 6 defendant \u201cwho suffered for what you didn\u2019t do.\u201d",
      "Boasberg also oversaw the federal grand jury investigation into the most famous Jan. 6 defendant of all: Donald Trump.",
      "In March 2023, Boasberg heard closed-door arguments from attorneys for Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence over Pence\u2019s testimony in the special counsel investigation headed by Jack Smith. Boasberg ordered Pence to testify in the investigation, and Pence appeared before the federal grand jury in April 2023.",
      "Boasberg, who goes by Jeb, is a native of the nation\u2019s capital and earned a history degree from Yale, where he was a forward on the basketball team. At 6-foot-6, his towering presence carried over into the courtroom, where he worked as a litigator in San Francisco before returning to Washington in the mid-1990s, specializing in homicide prosecutions in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia.",
      "During Boasberg\u2019s formal investiture ceremony elevating him to a federal judge, he sat beside Brett Kavanaugh, his close friend and housemate at Yale Law School and then a federal appeals judge in the D.C. Circuit. Kavanaugh conducted the rites at the ceremony. Seven years later, Trump would select Kavanaugh to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court.\u201cI sincerely think that Jeb Boasberg is one of the best district judges in the country, certainly one of the best in D.C.,\u201d said another Washington lawyer who works at a major firm and knows Boasberg personally. \u201cHe\u2019s a careful, middle-of-the-road judge. He\u2019s not some lefty.\u201d",
      "In 2016, Boasberg ordered the federal government to review the release of 14,900 emails and attachments belonging to Trump\u2019s presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, as part of an investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state. During Trump\u2019s first term, Boasberg ruled in favor of the president when he declined to compel the IRS to turn over his personal tax returns.",
      "Over the years, Boasberg earned a reputation as a fair jurist fond of sprinkling his written opinions with pop culture references.",
      "In one Jan. 6-related lawsuit ruling against a Trump aide, Boasberg wrote: \u201cPlaintiff may resist this conclusion, but as Star Trek\u2019s Dr. Spock intoned, \u2018Resistance is futile.\u2019\u201d",
      "In a 2022 ruling in which Boasberg dismissed a Justice Department suit that sought Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn to register as a foreign agent of the Chinese government, the judge included the Fugees lyrics, \u201cReady or not, here I come, you can\u2019t hide.\u201d",
      "He even starred as a prosecutor in a 2018 mock trial of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHamlet\u201d that was overseen by Kennedy and presented by the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington.",
      "Meanwhile, his career in Washington continued to flourish. In 2020, Roberts appointed him the presiding judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which approves surveillance warrants.",
      "In 2023, he became the chief judge of the District Court in Washington. Before he was named chief judge, he had drawn criticism from Trump allies over what they believed was the lenient sentencing of an FBI lawyer in the government\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.",
      "Beryl Howell, Boasberg\u2019s predecessor as chief judge, told The New York Times in 2023 that she was confident he could handle the public scrutiny.",
      "\u201cJudge Boasberg has the seasoning on the bench, the legal expertise, and the ability to manage and juggle multiple matters that makes him very well suited to be the next chief judge,\u201d Howell said.",
      "A lawyer who\u2019s known Boasberg personally and professionally for many years and asked not to be named for fear of harassment said his rulings speak for themselves.",
      "\u201cHe is not a partisan in any sense of the word,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cHe will do what he believes the law requires without fear or favor.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are people who were meant to do certain jobs,\u201d the lawyer added. \u201cHe was meant to be a judge.\u201d"

    "summary": "Anti-vaccine influencers use a 6-year-old's measles death to promote debunked theories, while health experts warn of the danger of the disease.",
    "story": [
      "In February, a 6-year-old Texan was the first child in the United States to die of measles in two decades.",
      "Her death might have been a warning to an increasingly vaccine-hesitant country about the consequences of shunning the only guaranteed way to fight the preventable disease.",
      "Instead, the anti-vaccine movement is broadcasting a different lesson, turning the girl and her family into propaganda, an emotional plank in the misguided argument that vaccines are\u00a0more dangerous than the illnesses they prevent.",
      "The child\u2019s grieving parents have given just one on-camera interview, to Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit group founded and led until recently by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the health and human services secretary. In a\u00a0video that aired online Monday, the young parents stifled sobs, recalling how their daughter got sick from measles, then pneumonia, how she was hospitalized and put on a ventilator, and how she died.",
      "The couple, who are Mennonites, believe their daughter\u2019s death was the will of God. When Children\u2019s Health Defense\u2019s director of programming, Polly Tommey, asked specifically about parents who heard their story and\u00a0might be \u201crushing out, panicking,\u201d to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the parents rebuked the intervention that offered the best chance of preventing their daughter\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t do the shots,\u201d the girl\u2019s mother said. Measles, she added, is \u201cnot as bad as they\u2019re making it out to be.\u201d She noted that her four other children all recovered after having received alternative treatments from an anti-vaccine doctor, including cod liver oil, a source of vitamin A, and budesonide, an inhaled steroid usually used for asthma.",
      "\u201cAlso, the measles are good for the body,\u201d the girl\u2019s father said, adding through an interpreter of Low German that measles boosts the immune system and wards against cancer \u2014 an untrue supposition often offered by anti-vaccine groups and repeated recently by Kennedy.",
      "Without evidence, influencers at Children\u2019s Health Defense and beyond have reframed the tragedy of the girl\u2019s death as proof \u2014 of the efficacy of unproven cures like vitamin A, of maltreatment by a hospital and even of a plot to undermine Kennedy at the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "It\u2019s a familiar playbook, following countless videos Children\u2019s Health Defense has produced before this one. Along with since-discredited science, the modern anti-vaccine movement was built on the personal accounts of parents \u2014 collected through websites, bus tours and anti-vaccine documentaries \u2014 who claimed vaccines harmed their children.",
      "And even as experts point to overwhelming data on vaccine safety, the raw and immediate accounts \u2014 delivered straight to the movement\u2019s followers \u2014 provide a narrative that public health officials, bound by evidence and constrained by institutional caution, struggle to counter.",
      "\u201cIt was a savvy way of centering a mother\u2019s intuition, a mother\u2019s insight, which is very sacred in our culture,\u201d said Karen Ernst, director of the nonprofit group Voices for Vaccines. \u201cThat was paramount to how they built the movement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem is, a simple story told quickly is so much easier to believe than a nuanced, well-sourced truth told later,\u201d Ernst added. \u201cIn that way, public health is always chasing the anti-vaccine movement around. They\u2019re never getting ahead of it.\u201d",
      "A representative for the family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Children\u2019s Health Defense and Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital also did not respond.",
      "HHS deputy press secretary Emily Hilliard responded with\u00a0a link\u00a0to a recent op-ed on the Fox News website, in which Kennedy wrote, \u201cVaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons.\u201d",
      "Measles has spread largely unchecked through the Mennonite community in Gaines County, Texas, sickening more than 190 people, most of them small children, and reaching into neighboring areas. The actual number of people who have fallen ill has been underreported, officials say, because of inadequate testing. For most children, measles brings a fever and an itchy rash, but it can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, seizures and brain damage. Out of every 1,000 cases, about 200 children require hospitalization, 50 develop pneumonia, one experiences brain swelling that can result in disability, and one to three will die.",
      "In Gaines County, hundreds of parents have lined up for a makeshift warehouse clinic run by Dr. Ben Edwards, an alternative practitioner from Lubbock who treats children with an unproven protocol of cod liver oil and budesonide.",
      "Edwards had not treated the 6-year-old who died, but afterward, he treated the couple\u2019s remaining children at their sibling\u2019s wake.",
      "\u201cDr. Edwards was there for us,\u201d the mother said.",
      "Edwards did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Despite the urgency of the measles crisis, the official response from medical groups has been typically restrained. In a statement Tuesday, a coalition of 34 scientific and medical organizations, including the American Association of Immunologists, the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics, reiterated their support for vaccines as \u201ca cornerstone of public health, a shining example of the power of scientific research, and a vital tool in the fight against preventable diseases.\u201d",
      "In a media landscape in which misinformation spreads faster than institutional statements, it\u2019s unlikely to be enough.",
      "\u201cWe can provide information to other people and just say this is what the data show, but it might take some people with high charisma to help deliver those messages,\u201d said Stephen Jameson, president of the American Association of Immunologists. \u201cBut it is hard, because if a vaccine is preventative, where is the rescue of somebody? How do you tell the story \u2018Child does not get disease\u2019?\u201d",
      "In this environment, Kennedy plays a key public role at the helm of HHS, a platform he has already used to spread falsehoods about measles, the MMR vaccine and the outbreak in Texas.",
      "In an interview with Fox Nation, Kennedy claimed falsely that measles immunity came with protections against cancer and heart disease, that cod liver oil and steroids had provided \u201cmiraculous\u201d treatment for measles cases in Texas and that measles was a threat only to unhealthy children, suggesting that malnutrition \u201cmay have been an issue\" with the girl who died. In another Fox News interview, Kennedy said without evidence that the MMR vaccine causes deaths every year.",
      "\u201cMisinformation is really leading the day,\u201d said Kris Ehresmann, the recently retired director of the Minnesota Health Department\u2019s infectious disease division. \u201cIt\u2019s gone from a parent trying to assess the best decision for their child to a hostile movement that I didn\u2019t see in the early days of my career.\u201d",
      "\u201cCovid politicized vaccines and science, really,\u201d Ehresmann added.\u00a0\u201cAnd that gave the anti-vaxxer folks a huge foothold.\u201d",
      "Patsy Stinchfield, a pediatric nurse practitioner, has seen how the uncontrolled spread of an illness can change parents\u2019 minds \u2014\u00a0with the right messaging. She recalls going \u201cmosque to mosque to mosque\u201d during a 2017 measles outbreak in Minnesota to listen to the Somali community\u2019s concerns and educate local religious leaders about the danger of measles and the safety of the MMR vaccine.",
      "She spoke to nearly every parent of the children hospitalized in the outbreak. \u201cMany of them, the parents, were like, \u2018Oh, my God, I never knew it would be this bad. Why didn\u2019t I know this?\u2019\u201d said Stinchfield, who later served as president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. \u201cThe No. 1 thing I heard was regret \u2014 like, \u2018Why didn\u2019t I vaccinate?\u2019\u201d",
      "Those stories have yet to be publicly shared by parents of children sickened in the West Texas outbreak.",
      "Last week, anti-vaccine activist Del Bigtree dedicated a segment of his internet show, \u201cThe HighWire,\u201d to interviewing Texas mothers whose unvaccinated children contracted and survived measles. As the parents described standing by their choice not to vaccinate, photos of one child, who had to be medevaced to a Lubbock hospital, filled the screen. The girl was lying in a hospital bed, her eyes glazed, connected to lines and tubes.",
      "After years of arguing measles was no threat to healthy U.S. children, Bigtree was visibly taken aback and searched for an explanation \u2014\u00a0perhaps measles had mutated to become more serious, he suggested.",
      "\u201cThat little girl is very sick,\u201d he said."

      "At least 45 people were killed by airstrikes in Gaza late Wednesday and early Thursday as the resumption of Israel's ground and air offensive left a trail of destruction observed by NBC News' team on the ground.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces launched fresh strikes across the Gaza Strip, killing dozens of people according to two hospitals in the southern city of Khan Younis.",
      "More than 30 of those killed were brought to the city's European Hospital, while 13 were taken to Nasser Hospital, officials told NBC News. One family saw 12 of its members killed, including several children.",
      "The strikes hit multiple homes in the middle of the night, with children among those killed as they slept, The Associated Press separately reported.",
      "Sirens that had become increasingly rare during the ceasefire rang out in a number of areas in central Israel on Thursday, after projectiles were launched from the Gaza Strip, the IDF said. NBC News' team in central Israel reporting heard blasts around the same time.",
      "In the hours ahead of the strikes, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz suggested that civilians in the enclave would \"pay the full price\" if  the hostages who remain held by Hamas are not returned.",
      "\u201cReturn the hostages and eliminate Hamas \u2014 the alternative is complete destruction and annihilation,\u201d he said in an address to the Palestinians in Gaza on Wednesday as the Israeli military continued to issue evacuation orders for areas it said were \"battle zones.\"",
      "Hamas said in a statement late Wednesday that Israel\u2019s ground offensive constituted  a \u201cnew and dangerous violation of the signed ceasefire agreement.\u201d",
      "Thursday's strikes came after more than 400 people were killed, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, when Israel resumed strikes across the enclave, breaking its fragile ceasefire with Hamas after two months of relative calm.",
      "Both Israel and the United States have blamed Hamas for the renewed fighting, accusing the militant group of rejecting a proposal to extend the first phase of the current ceasefire agreement, despite that was not part of the original deal.",
      "At least 59 hostages, both dead and alive, are thought to remain in Gaza out of around 250 taken captive during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Nearly 49,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its offensive in the enclave, according to local health officials, whose figures the World Health Organization has said in the past are reputable.",
      "The resumption of war has already brought renewed devastation to the Gaza Strip, with babies and pregnant mothers among those killed when Israeli forces struck the tent camps in which they had sought shelter were struck by Israeli forces.",
      "Among those killed was Afnan Fouad Al-Ghannam, 20, who was seven months pregnant, and her one-year-old son, Mohammad, when their shelter in the Muwasi tent camp was hit. While Muwasi has long been designated a humanitarian zone, it has been struck on multiple occasions during the war.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of a renewed push by corporations to weaponize our courts to silence dissent. We should all be concerned about the future of the First Amendment, and lawsuits like this aimed at destroying our rights to peaceful protest and free speech,\u201d Raman said.",
      "Greenpeace has described Energy Transfer\u2019s case as a clear-cut example of SLAPPs,\u00a0referring\u00a0to a lawsuit designed to bury activist groups in legal fees and ultimately silence dissent. SLAPP is an acronym for \u201cstrategic lawsuit against public participation.\u201d",
      "Energy Transfer said the jury verdict was a \u201cwin\u201d for \u201cAmericans who understand the difference between the right to free speech and breaking the law,\u201d according to\u00a0The Associated Press, citing a statement from the company.",
      "\u201cWhile we are pleased that Greenpeace has been held accountable for their actions against us, this win is really for the people of Mandan and throughout North Dakota who had to live through the daily harassment and disruptions caused by the protesters who were funded and trained by Greenpeace,\u201d the company added.",
      "A spokesperson for Energy Transfer was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Thursday morning."

    "story": [
      "PHOENIX \u2014 The Pentagon restored some webpages highlighting the crucial wartime contributions of Navajo Code Talkers and other Native American veterans on Wednesday, days after tribes condemned the action.",
      "The initial removal was part of a sweep of any military content that promoted diversity, equity and inclusion, or commonly referred to as DEI. Following President Donald Trump\u2019s broader executive order ending the federal government\u2019s DEI programs, the Defense Department deleted thousands of pages honoring contributions by women and minority groups. Department officials say the Navajo Code Talker material was erroneously erased.",
      "\u201cIn the rare cases that content is removed \u2014 either deliberately or by mistake \u2014 that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct the components and they correct the content so it recognizes our heroes for their dedicated service alongside their fellow Americans, period,\u201d Pentagon press secretary John Ullyot said in a statement.",
      "Several webpages on the Code Talkers landed on a \u201c404 \u2014 Page not found\u201d message Tuesday. Some were back up Wednesday \u2014 although any that also mention Native American Heritage Month remain down. Thousands of other pages deleted in the DEI purge are still offline.",
      "White House officials informed the Navajo Nation that an artificial intelligence-powered automated review process looking for content with DEI initiatives led to the elimination of anything mentioning \u201cNavajo,\u201d according to a statement from Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren.",
      "Nygren, who sent a letter to the Defense Department requesting clarity on the issue, said he\u2019s pleased by the resolution.",
      "\u201cI want to assure the Navajo people that we remain in close communication with federal officials to ensure the legacy of our cherished Navajo Code Talkers is never erased from American and Navajo history,\u201d Nygren said.",
      "He also pointed out the 574 federally recognized tribes across the U.S. are sovereign nations and not defined by DEI classifications, a stance broadly supported by other Native American leaders who also sent letters to the Trump administration.",
      "The U.S. Marine Corps initially recruited 29 Navajo men to develop a code based on the unwritten Navajo language in World War II. Using Navajo words for red soil, war chief, clan, braided hair, beads, ant and hummingbird, for example, they came up with a glossary of more than 200 terms, later expanded, and an alphabet. To convey the word \u201csend,\u201d Code Talkers would say the Navajo words for \u201csheep, eyes, nose and deer.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of Navajos followed in their footsteps, sending thousands of messages without error on Japanese troop movements, battlefield tactics and other communications crucial to the war\u2019s ultimate outcome. The code stumped Japanese military cryptologists.",
      "The Code Talkers participated in all assaults the Marines led in the Pacific from 1942 to 1945 and are credited with helping the U.S. win the war. Hundreds of Native Americans from more than 20 tribes also served as code talkers during World War I and World War II, according to the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Indian. Among them were Choctaw, Cherokee, Osage, Chippewa and Hopi speakers.",
      "Among those alarmed to hear of the missing Navajo Code Talker webpages was Peter MacDonald, 96. He and Thomas H. Begay are the only two Navajo Code Talkers still living today.",
      "\u201cThat code became a very valuable weapon and not only saved hundreds of thousands of soldiers, but it also helped win the war in the Pacific,\u201d MacDonald said by phone from his home in Tuba City in the Arizona portion of the Navajo Nation. \u201cAnd it has absolutely nothing to do with DEI.\u201d",
      "A Republican who voted for Trump, MacDonald said he thinks the current administration needs to better walk the line between getting rid of DEI and ignoring history.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m very concerned that communication from the Pentagon down to the various military units should be taught or learn that this information is history, and you don\u2019t want to hide history,\u201d MacDonald said.",
      "The Defense Department has had to issue reassurances that it is not omitting historic achievements by servicemen and women of color. Besides the Code Talkers, the agency also on Wednesday restored a webpage describing baseball and civil rights icon Jackie Robinson\u2019s military service after it was missing earlier in the day. Last week, pages honoring a Black Medal of Honor winner and Japanese American service members were also restored.",
      "\u201cEveryone at the Defense Department loves Jackie Robinson, as well as the Navajo Code Talkers, the Tuskegee airmen, the Marines at Iwo Jima and so many others \u2014 we salute them for their strong and in many cases heroic service to our country, full stop,\u201d Ullyot said. \u201cWe do not view or highlight them through the prism of immutable characteristics, such as race, ethnicity or sex.\u201d",
      "Michael Smith, whose father, Samuel \u201cJesse\u201d Smith Sr., was a Navajo Code Talker, questioned why these pages were removed at all.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how taking Navajo Code Talkers off the Department of Defense website is saving the United States any money because that\u2019s not consistent with the president\u2019s order,\u201d said Smith, who helps organize annual celebrations of the Code Talkers.",
      "Gov. Stephen Roe Lewis of the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona also expressed disappointment, claiming there was missing content relating to all Native American veterans, including Ira Hayes. Hayes was an enrolled member of the tribe and one of six Marines featured in an iconic 1945 Associated Press photograph of U.S. forces raising an American flag during the Battle of Iwo Jima.",
      "Even with some being reposted, he remains worried web content removal is \u201cthe tip of the iceberg.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe way it looks in the (executive) order, this language is skewed and made to sound like the diversity programs are the ones that are unethical,\u201d Smith said."

    "story": [
      "I was in elementary school when my dad took me to the Providence Civic Center for the first round of the 1989 NCAA Tournament. We watched the afternoon games, got dinner, and then he asked me if I wanted to go back for some of the night session. There were two games on tap, but only the very late one seemed like it would be any good. The earlier matchup was between a No. 1-seeded team and some hopeless No. 16-seed. It would be a boring blowout.",
      "Tough luck, my dad told me, there was no way we were staying out until midnight. We could catch the first game and then go home or just leave right now. I remember it being a tough choice, but for whatever reason we stayed \u2014 and then got to witness a game that I am still telling people about almost four decades later, one that oh-so-nearly was (and should have been) among the most monumental upsets in sports history.",
      "That\u2019s when I came down with a full-blown case of March Madness, and it hasn\u2019t let up since. I\u2019m just one of the many fans who consider the next two days the absolute best two days on the annual sports calendar and the entire three-week tournament the single best of any sporting event. I claim no expertise (my national championship pick last year fell a little short), just undiminished enthusiasm and a weakness for the underdog.",
      "With that in mind, here are just a few of the teams and storylines on my mind as the 2025 edition of the NCAA tournament gets underway.",
      "Sleeper team that might make a run: BYU",
      "This is a risky pick, since the No. 6-seeded Cougars face a trendy upset pick, VCU, in the first round. The game will be a clash of styles. Offensive-minded BYU scores more than 80 points a game, averages nearly 11 made 3-pointers, and boasts one of the highest effective field goal percentages in the country. VCU\u2019s stifling defense, meanwhile, limits opponents to just 61.6 points per game and 37.8% shooting from the field. Something will have to give here and it would be no shocker if the Rams (whose coach, Ryan Odom, led No. 16-seed UMBC to an upset for the ages in the 2018 tournament) take down the Cougars.",
      "But if BYU can get past this first-round landmine, they might just get on a roll. This is a confident team that closed the season with nine straight wins, including a 34-point dismantling of Kansas, road victories over Arizona and Iowa State and another win over the Cyclones in the Big 12 tournament. Only a title game loss to mighty Houston kept BYU from coming into the NCAA tournament on a 10-game win streak.",
      "After VCU, the Cougars would likely face Wisconsin, which staggered toward the end of the year with one of their key players, Max Klesmit, banged up. The Badgers could be vulnerable. So too could Alabama, BYU\u2019s most likely opponent if they make it to the Sweet 16. The Tide dropped three of their last five games and there are questions about the status of Grant Nelson and his injured leg.",
      "For that matter, no one can be sure what to expect from the region\u2019s top seed, Duke, with star Cooper Flagg returning from his own ankle issues. BYU hasn\u2019t advanced to the second weekend since the glory days of Jimmer Fredette in 2011, but the way this current team is playing, that hardly seems out of reach.",
      "First-round upset I\u2019m eyeing: No. 12 Liberty over No. 5 Oregon",
      "It\u2019s true that 12-seed vs. 5-seed matchups have historically been upset-prone, but that\u2019s not the reason this one is on my radar. What does get my attention, though, is this: Liberty can shoot the 3-pointer. The mid-major Flames rank sixth nationally (out of 355 teams) in 3-point shooting percentage. They have three players who hit at over a 40% clip, including Taelon Peter, Conference USA\u2019s Sixth Man Player of the Year, who can come in and heat up fast. Lighting it up from outside can go a long way to leveling the playing field in a game like this. Nor is Liberty a slouch on the defensive end, ranking No. 10 nationally in points allowed.",
      "Oregon is a tough draw. They\u2019re on a roll, winners of eight out of their last nine, and figure to have plenty of support from fans with the game in Seattle. But in a one-game situation, the Flames\u2019 potential to catch fire (see what I did there?) makes them an upset candidate.",

      "The football conference that took college basketball by storm",
      "Rick Pitino's improbable path back to college basketball's spotlight",
      "The best NBA prospects to watch in the NCAA tournament (besides Cooper Flagg)",
      "If you like the tournament the way it is, you should probably hope lose these teams lose early: Oklahoma and Texas",
      "Nothing against either one of these schools or states, but they both play in the now-enormous SEC and both posted the same conference record this season: 6-12. That\u2019s the worst conference winning percentage (.333) for any team that\u2019s received an at-large bid to the tournament since its expansion to 64 teams in 1985.",
      "The committee\u2019s decision to include the Sooners and Longhorns comes as the campaign for further expansion of the field \u2014 76 teams now seems to be the consensus target \u2014 seems to be gaining steam. The pro-expansion argument is that more schools than ever now play at the Division I level, so more spots are needed for worthy participants. The reality, though, is that expansion may look more like this: Power conference teams that are short on actual wins slipping in because even picking off a few big fish in a power conference will produce some impressive-seeming metrics.",
      "Plenty of fans are fine with this, no doubt. And success for the Sooners and Longhorns would offer validation for their view. But for those who like the tournament as it is and fear what adding even more teams would mean, it\u2019s probably best if both teams make early exits.",
      "Team my head thinks will win it all: Houston",
      "The Cougars blitzed through the Big 12, winning 19 of 20 games and the regular season title, then went three-for-three in the conference tournament. Overall, they\u2019re 30-4 and have lost only one time (by a single point, in overtime, to a strong Texas Tech team) since the first week of December. This is the third straight tournament that Houston has earned a No. 1 seed, but this edition stands out for two reasons: They\u2019re experienced and used to playing together (more than 80% of last year\u2019s scoring returned this season), both premiums in the transfer portal era; and they finally have an offense to match their perennially elite defense.",
      "Previous Houston teams had to hope their suffocating defense would compensate for woeful shooting. But this one has three players who shoot over 40% from behind the 3-point line (they had none last year), and they rank fourth in the country as a team in 3-point percentage.",
      "A concern is the status of big man J\u2019Wan Roberts, who sprained his ankle last week. He\u2019s expected to be available for the tournament, though he might not be 100% in the first two rounds. If they can get through the first weekend and emerge with a healthy Roberts, this will be the most complete of Houston\u2019s recent tournament teams \u2014 and those teams were all title contenders.",
      "Who my heart wants to win it all: St. John\u2019s",
      "And maybe they will! The fact that Rick Pitino, essentially blacklisted from college coaching at the age of 65, is now at 72 years old taking a 30-4 team ranked No. 5 in the country to the NCAA tournament is improbable enough. That he\u2019s doing it with St. John\u2019s, a powerhouse from an earlier era of the sport that until now has gone a quarter-century without a tournament win, makes this feel like a plot from a movie.",
      "My heart wants them to win it all, but my head can\u2019t quite get there. This is partly because my sentimental favorites almost never actually come in, but mostly because of the Johnnies\u2019 (maybe) fatal flaw: Shooting. More specifically, they\u2019re abysmal from outside \u2014 a mere 30.4% from beyond the arc, 335th out of all 355 Division 1 schools \u2014 and positively atrocious from the foul line, where they\u2019re 68.9% as a team. (Pitino knows first-hand how costly missed free throws can be in a tight tournament game.)",
      "Part of what makes St. John\u2019s so compelling is that they\u2019ve won so much in spite of all of this, thanks to a relentlessly disruptive defense that creates deflections, steals and transitions points \u2014 and that can either erase deficits or blow games open in a matter of a few possessions. It\u2019s no coincidence that St. John\u2019s has trailed by double-digits in eight games this season and come back to win seven of them. But relying on escape acts in the tournament is a dangerous game. I\u2019m hoping for a magical run from Pitino and his team, but fearing the worst."

    "summary": "Anti-vaccine influencers use a 6-year-old's measles death to promote debunked theories, while health experts warn of the danger of the disease.",
    "story": [
      "In February, a 6-year-old Texan was the first child in the United States to die of measles in two decades.",
      "Her death might have been a warning to an increasingly vaccine-hesitant country about the consequences of shunning the only guaranteed way to fight the preventable disease.",
      "Instead, the anti-vaccine movement is broadcasting a different lesson, turning the girl and her family into propaganda, an emotional plank in the misguided argument that vaccines are\u00a0more dangerous than the illnesses they prevent.",
      "The child\u2019s grieving parents have given just one on-camera interview, to Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit group founded and led until recently by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the health and human services secretary. In a\u00a0video that aired online Monday, the young parents stifled sobs, recalling how their daughter got sick from measles, then pneumonia, how she was hospitalized and put on a ventilator, and how she died.",
      "The couple, who are Mennonites, believe their daughter\u2019s death was the will of God. When Children\u2019s Health Defense\u2019s director of programming, Polly Tommey, asked specifically about parents who heard their story and\u00a0might be \u201crushing out, panicking,\u201d to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the parents rebuked the intervention that offered the best chance of preventing their daughter\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t do the shots,\u201d the girl\u2019s mother said. Measles, she added, is \u201cnot as bad as they\u2019re making it out to be.\u201d She noted that her four other children all recovered after having received alternative treatments from an anti-vaccine doctor, including cod liver oil, a source of vitamin A, and budesonide, an inhaled steroid usually used for asthma.",
      "\u201cAlso, the measles are good for the body,\u201d the girl\u2019s father said, adding through an interpreter of Low German that measles boosts the immune system and wards against cancer \u2014 an untrue supposition often offered by anti-vaccine groups and repeated recently by Kennedy.",
      "Without evidence, influencers at Children\u2019s Health Defense and beyond have reframed the tragedy of the girl\u2019s death as proof \u2014 of the efficacy of unproven cures like vitamin A, of maltreatment by a hospital and even of a plot to undermine Kennedy at the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "It\u2019s a familiar playbook, following countless videos Children\u2019s Health Defense has produced before this one. Along with since-discredited science, the modern anti-vaccine movement was built on the personal accounts of parents \u2014 collected through websites, bus tours and anti-vaccine documentaries \u2014 who claimed vaccines harmed their children.",
      "And even as experts point to overwhelming data on vaccine safety, the raw and immediate accounts \u2014 delivered straight to the movement\u2019s followers \u2014 provide a narrative that public health officials, bound by evidence and constrained by institutional caution, struggle to counter.",
      "\u201cIt was a savvy way of centering a mother\u2019s intuition, a mother\u2019s insight, which is very sacred in our culture,\u201d said Karen Ernst, director of the nonprofit group Voices for Vaccines. \u201cThat was paramount to how they built the movement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem is, a simple story told quickly is so much easier to believe than a nuanced, well-sourced truth told later,\u201d Ernst added. \u201cIn that way, public health is always chasing the anti-vaccine movement around. They\u2019re never getting ahead of it.\u201d",
      "A representative for the family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Children\u2019s Health Defense and Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital also did not respond.",
      "HHS deputy press secretary Emily Hilliard responded with\u00a0a link\u00a0to a recent op-ed on the Fox News website, in which Kennedy wrote, \u201cVaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons.\u201d",
      "Measles has spread largely unchecked through the Mennonite community in Gaines County, Texas, sickening more than 190 people, most of them small children, and reaching into neighboring areas. The actual number of people who have fallen ill has been underreported, officials say, because of inadequate testing. For most children, measles brings a fever and an itchy rash, but it can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, seizures and brain damage. Out of every 1,000 cases, about 200 children require hospitalization, 50 develop pneumonia, one experiences brain swelling that can result in disability, and one to three will die.",
      "In Gaines County, hundreds of parents have lined up for a makeshift warehouse clinic run by Dr. Ben Edwards, an alternative practitioner from Lubbock who treats children with an unproven protocol of cod liver oil and budesonide.",
      "Edwards had not treated the 6-year-old who died, but afterward, he treated the couple\u2019s remaining children at their sibling\u2019s wake.",
      "\u201cDr. Edwards was there for us,\u201d the mother said.",
      "Edwards did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Despite the urgency of the measles crisis, the official response from medical groups has been typically restrained. In a statement Tuesday, a coalition of 34 scientific and medical organizations, including the American Association of Immunologists, the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics, reiterated their support for vaccines as \u201ca cornerstone of public health, a shining example of the power of scientific research, and a vital tool in the fight against preventable diseases.\u201d",
      "In a media landscape in which misinformation spreads faster than institutional statements, it\u2019s unlikely to be enough.",
      "\u201cWe can provide information to other people and just say this is what the data show, but it might take some people with high charisma to help deliver those messages,\u201d said Stephen Jameson, president of the American Association of Immunologists. \u201cBut it is hard, because if a vaccine is preventative, where is the rescue of somebody? How do you tell the story \u2018Child does not get disease\u2019?\u201d",
      "In this environment, Kennedy plays a key public role at the helm of HHS, a platform he has already used to spread falsehoods about measles, the MMR vaccine and the outbreak in Texas.",
      "In an interview with Fox Nation, Kennedy claimed falsely that measles immunity came with protections against cancer and heart disease, that cod liver oil and steroids had provided \u201cmiraculous\u201d treatment for measles cases in Texas and that measles was a threat only to unhealthy children, suggesting that malnutrition \u201cmay have been an issue\" with the girl who died. In another Fox News interview, Kennedy said without evidence that the MMR vaccine causes deaths every year.",
      "\u201cMisinformation is really leading the day,\u201d said Kris Ehresmann, the recently retired director of the Minnesota Health Department\u2019s infectious disease division. \u201cIt\u2019s gone from a parent trying to assess the best decision for their child to a hostile movement that I didn\u2019t see in the early days of my career.\u201d",
      "\u201cCovid politicized vaccines and science, really,\u201d Ehresmann added.\u00a0\u201cAnd that gave the anti-vaxxer folks a huge foothold.\u201d",
      "Patsy Stinchfield, a pediatric nurse practitioner, has seen how the uncontrolled spread of an illness can change parents\u2019 minds \u2014\u00a0with the right messaging. She recalls going \u201cmosque to mosque to mosque\u201d during a 2017 measles outbreak in Minnesota to listen to the Somali community\u2019s concerns and educate local religious leaders about the danger of measles and the safety of the MMR vaccine.",
      "She spoke to nearly every parent of the children hospitalized in the outbreak. \u201cMany of them, the parents, were like, \u2018Oh, my God, I never knew it would be this bad. Why didn\u2019t I know this?\u2019\u201d said Stinchfield, who later served as president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. \u201cThe No. 1 thing I heard was regret \u2014 like, \u2018Why didn\u2019t I vaccinate?\u2019\u201d",
      "Those stories have yet to be publicly shared by parents of children sickened in the West Texas outbreak.",
      "Last week, anti-vaccine activist Del Bigtree dedicated a segment of his internet show, \u201cThe HighWire,\u201d to interviewing Texas mothers whose unvaccinated children contracted and survived measles. As the parents described standing by their choice not to vaccinate, photos of one child, who had to be medevaced to a Lubbock hospital, filled the screen. The girl was lying in a hospital bed, her eyes glazed, connected to lines and tubes.",
      "After years of arguing measles was no threat to healthy U.S. children, Bigtree was visibly taken aback and searched for an explanation \u2014\u00a0perhaps measles had mutated to become more serious, he suggested.",
      "\u201cThat little girl is very sick,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Former Vice President Al Gore championed the development of the internet so enthusiastically that one of the first myths of the online era was that he claimed to have invented it.",
      "It was in those early days of the world wide web that one of Gore\u2019s successors came of age.",
      "JD Vance grew up with chat rooms and email and instant messaging. He graduated into young adulthood at the dawn of blogging. He entered politics with a millennial\u2019s fluency in social media.",
      "Now, at 40, he is the nation\u2019s third-youngest vice president \u2014 and, nearly a quarter-century after Gore left office, the nation\u2019s first very online vice president. It\u2019s a pioneering distinction that reflects the serious time and thought, as well as the debate-me vibes, that Vance puts into his interactions with others.",
      "\u201cI tend to err on the side of openness,\u201d Vance said in a recent interview aboard Air Force Two. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a generational thing, right? I come from a very tech-forward generation.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s unfiltered use of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, sets him apart from many of his political peers \u2014 and certainly from past vice presidents who were older, far more restrained and far less eager to slide into your mentions.",
      "Where other elected officeholders rely on staff to send out tightly crafted messages, Vance estimates that, even with a full White House portfolio, he writes 98% of his posts himself. And where President Donald Trump and his hit-and-run blasts have pushed social media into new frontiers of political communication and confrontation, Vance has pushed further. Unlike Trump, he engages directly in conversations with his allies and fights with his critics. He also sticks around to watch reactions pour in, replying when it suits him.",
      "At times, Vance is in on the joke. His recent Oval Office upbraiding of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ignited a raft of memes in which Vance\u2019s face was edited into a variety of images \u2014 flattering or unflattering, depending on the poster\u2019s opinion of him. Vance contributed to the discourse by sharing an image of his face in the well-traveled Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme \u2014 a winking acknowledgement that he was enjoying all of the online fuss.",
      "\u201cIt can become very addictive, right?\u201d Vance said of social media. \u201cSo I try to limit myself. We limit our kids\u2019 screen time. I try to limit my screen time, too.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s posts at times veer into hostility. Last month, after he called for the rehiring of a federal employee who had resigned over making racist remarks online, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., scolded Vance, noting how they are both fathers of Indian American children.",
      "\u201cFor the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cRacist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don\u2019t threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes. A culture that encourages congressmen to act like whiny children.\u201d",
      "He accused Khanna of \u201cemotional blackmail\u201d before concluding: \u201cYou disgust me.\u201d",
      "While Vance and his advisers characterize his social media persona as a worthy effort to foster authentic discussion and debate, his detractors view it as abrasive and performative.",
      "\u201cI have no problem with him being active on social media and engaging in conversation with critics,\u201d Khanna said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m not hoping here for Lincoln-Douglas. I wish he were using it to have an actual substantive exchange instead of trying to own the libs in every tweet.\u201d",
      "Aboard Air Force Two, Vance wrestled with his social media habits, at one point calculating how much time he spends online and at another volunteering that he is trying to read more books.",
      "\u201cI actually try not to look at it most of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in my office in the West Wing, I usually have my phone in a secure box, because people come in, there\u2019s classified information flowing everywhere. I sort of assume the Chinese or somebody else are hacked into my phone.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s tough to resist a morning or afternoon scroll.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take 15 minutes just to make sure I\u2019m staying up to date on the news and I know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI\u2019m probably a little bit more active after the kids go to bed, right between 8 and 11.\u201d",
      "Stormy posts, \u2018Always Sunny\u2019 memes",
      "Since being sworn in as vice president two months ago, Vance has posted from his personal @JDVance X account more than 140 times, including reposts and replies to other accounts.",
      "In that same period, the official @VP handle that is managed by his office has posted roughly 250 times, with a heavy concentration on traditional statements, as well as reposts of content from other Trump administration officials and White House-affiliated accounts.",
      "While he averages fewer than three posts a day from his personal account, Vance often maximizes them by taking advantage of the unlimited characters he\u2019s afforded as a verified user. He is known for seeking out thought leaders and others whose beliefs place them outside the bounds of Trump\u2019s right-wing ideology and his reluctance to involve the U.S. in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "Over two days last month, Vance tapped out more than 850 words in a pair of posts that chided Niall Ferguson of the Hoover Institution, a hawkish vestige of the old-guard Republican economic and foreign policy establishment. Ferguson had slammed Trump\u2019s approach to the war in Ukraine. Ferguson did not mention Vance in his original post, but the vice president nevertheless locked in on it, decrying it as \u201cmoralistic garbage.\u201d",
      "On Presidents\u2019 Day, Vance replied to former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan, who had referred to Vance\u2019s rebuke of European free speech laws and asked if he was aware of the White House limiting access to Associated Press reporters.",
      "\u201cYes dummy,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cI think there\u2019s a difference between not giving a reporter a seat in the WH press briefing room and jailing people for dissenting views. The latter is a threat to free speech, the former is not. Hope that helps!\u201d",
      "And though Vance said he locks his phone away for much of the workday, several of his more colorful missives have come on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.",
      "When Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted a clip of a recent CNN appearance in which he accused the White House of being too cozy with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Vance clapped back with a Monday morning \u201cCharlie Conspiracy\u201d meme from the sitcom \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\u201d",
      "\u201cMore politicians should be accessible and responsive,\u201d said Khanna, who, like Murphy and Vance, is viewed as a potential presidential candidate in 2028. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a waste of time or a disservice. It\u2019s the manner in which he\u2019s doing it. \u2026 That\u2019s the problem.\u201d",
      "A reply guy is born",
      "Vance has always been eager to express himself online.",
      "In the aughts and early 2010s he dabbled as a blogger \u2014 first as an amateur Blogspot author during his days in the Marines and at Yale Law School, later at a site led by former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum.",
      "His earliest days on social media are tougher to excavate. Vance acknowledged during his 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio that he had deleted his old tweets, including those critical of Trump.",
      "\u201cIn 4 years, I hope people remember that it was those of us who empathized with Trump\u2019s voters who fought him most aggressively,\u201d Vance wrote in a since-scrubbed post from 2016.",
      "The posts Vance wrote and interacted with in those days, when he was best known for his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d previewed the range he would offer as his political instincts developed. His tweets then were a mix of lighter fare in line with the childless young professional he was at the time \u2014 he goofed on an Obama White House post playing off the Disney film \u201cFrozen\u201d \u2014 and the punchiness he would hone as he made his sharp right turn.",
      "\u201cThis is a pretty insane tweet,\u201d he wrote in response to a December 2016 post by liberal columnist Paul Krugman that suggested Trump could benefit from a 9/11-style attack.",
      "Vance\u2019s online posture became more combative as he transitioned from anti-Trump Republican to Trump-backed candidate and U.S. senator.",
      "While disparaging Democratic leaders as \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d in 2021 \u2014 an attack that came back to haunt him in his early days as Trump\u2019s running mate \u2014 Vance fired off a tweet that included Krugman in the smear. In the years since, he has embraced the role of reply guy.",
      "\u201cIf you weren\u2019t such a humorless scold you might be a senator right now,\u201d he tweeted at Jason Kander, a past Democratic Senate candidate in Missouri who had mocked a photo of Vance pointing a rifle toward the sky in 2023 as a Chinese spy balloon flew over the U.S.",
      "Anyone who wondered whether Vance would change his freewheeling ways after winning the vice presidency got their answer soon after November\u2019s election. When Grace Chong, an associate of influential MAGA movement leader Steve Bannon, criticized him for missing a Senate vote on then-President Joe Biden\u2019s judicial nominees, Vance fired back.",
      "\u201cGrace Chong,\u201d he wrote on X, in a post that he later deleted, \u201cis a mouth breathing imbecile who attacks those of us in the fight rather than make herself useful.\u201d",
      "The angel on Vance\u2019s social media shoulder",
      "Second lady Usha Vance has urged her husband to be nicer on social media \u2014 advice he is not always keen to take, he told activists at last month\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "\u201cI take it sometimes!\u201d he said when reminded of the comment on Air Force Two.",
      "If his wife is the angel on his social media shoulder, who is the devil? The second lady, who was seated across from her husband on the plane and until that point in the interview had quietly kept her head down, looked up in amusement after hearing the question.",
      "\u201cI guess I have a few,\u201d Vance responded, after repeating it.",
      "\u201cThe only time that my staff ever tweets for me,\u201d he continued, nodding toward his communications director, William Martin, \u201cis if I\u2019m in a speech and I say, \u2018Hey, Will, can you just make sure a clip of this gets out in real time?\u2019 Or if I\u2019m in meetings all day, \u2018Hey, can you say something about this, and say it like that?\u2019 That happens probably 2% of the time. The other 98% of the time, it\u2019s all me. So I guess I don\u2019t have anybody else to blame when I get something wrong.\u201d",
      "Vance has copped to being wrong, at least in his opinion, about Trump in 2016. Yet he has been more stubborn about his unsubstantiated claim last fall on X that Haitian migrants were abducting and eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. When reporters confronted him about the absence of evidence, Vance made no apologies and instead took credit for drawing attention to other problems that immigration had stirred up in his home state.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conspiracy theories, some of which turn out to be legitimate, some of which turn out to be totally bats---,\u201d Vance, speaking broadly about the social media landscape, said aboard the plane. \u201cAnd I guess I just think openness is really important.\u201d",
      "How does he muster the confidence to plow ahead with takes that may be proved wrong?",
      "\u201cBeing wrong is OK,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cI\u2019d rather be open with people and wrong than overly cautious, never take any risks in the service of never getting anything wrong.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to change your mind. \u2026 I guess my confidence comes from the fact that, if I can argue somewhat successfully with my wife, I assume I can argue well with anybody.\u201d",
      "The second lady, Vance admitted, wishes he would \u201cbe a little bit more gentle\u201d online.",
      "\u201cBut she\u2019s also encouraged me not to filter myself and not to just become a kind of creature of consultant guidance,\u201d he added. \u201cPoliticians, they get way too comfortable with slogans. Yeah, sometimes you need to hammer home a message, but you can\u2019t just do that, or you become a total robot.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is stepping into the Democrats\u2019 leadership void, picking up her powerful megaphone to channel the base\u2019s anger \u2014 toward both President Donald Trump and her own party.",
      "Some of the initial skepticism in the party around the progressive star when she first arrived in Washington six years ago has started to fade as she has established herself as a political player on Capitol Hill and demonstrated a unique knack for communicating with a younger generation.",
      "As Democrats scramble to find an authentic and effective messenger for the second Trump administration, there is a growing desire to elevate Ocasio-Cortez, 35, within the party in some way, according to interviews with a dozen Democratic lawmakers, aides and strategists \u2014 especially after last week\u2019s government spending showdown left the base enraged.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez was one of the most outspoken Democrats in torching Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for allowing a Republican funding bill to advance in the Senate to avoid a shutdown. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, publicly urged Ocasio-Cortez to launch a primary challenge against Schumer in 2028 if he runs for re-election, and several House Democrats told NBC News that her colleagues also privately pushed her to do so at a party retreat last week.",
      "Starting Thursday, she is set to take her message on the road with a fellow progressive heavyweight, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has also been critical of current Democratic leadership. The pair will hold a series of rallies in swing districts and on college campuses in Arizona, Nevada and Colorado that are expected to draw massive crowds, sparking inevitable questions about her considering a run for higher office \u2014 perhaps even president in 2028.",
      "\u201cShe would walk into any event in America and draw a significant crowd,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, a political adviser to Sanders. \u201cWhether they like her or not it doesn\u2019t even matter. There are people interested in what she has to say.\u201d",
      "Some of her Democratic colleagues once viewed Ocasio-Cortez as an attention seeker who was more interested in social media stardom than substantive policy. Others believed she fell into the job only accidentally after her upset primary win at age 28 and were skeptical she would be around for long.",
      "But now Democrats across the ideological spectrum are starting to recognize that Ocasio-Cortez can grab the spotlight in a way that few others in the party can.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s got boundless promise as the party leader in our country. But the question is who will have the language to express to America where we need to go,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. \u201cThat\u2019s a tall order for anybody, but I would say she\u2019s definitely a contender. I don\u2019t know that anybody else seems to be a more obvious young candidate for that position.\u201d",
      "There are still plenty of reservations among Democrats about Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s becoming the face of the party. She is a frequent target of conservatives, who portray her as an out-of-touch extremist and often use her as a villain in campaign ads and fundraising efforts.",
      "\u201cHer politics are just too far left for this party,\u201d a chair of a state party that sends a large number of delegates to Democratic presidential conventions, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said of Ocasio-Cortez as a potential national candidate. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with most of her policy positions, but she\u2019s showing fight, which a lot of people are looking for their members of Congress to do, and they\u2019re just not seeing it.\u201d",
      "Still, her ability to connect with the public is something her Democratic colleagues are starting to embrace. Recently, she conducted a presentation for her colleagues on how to reach influencers and use social media. She showed House Democrats a video she produced around the theme \u201cWhat\u2019s in my bag?\u201d in which she also discussed politics and policy. A Democratic lawmaker recalled the video got more than 2 million views.",
      "\u201cTwo million people, right?\u201d said a lawmaker who listened to the presentation. \u201cIf you added all of mine up together and multiplied them by 10, I wouldn\u2019t get to 2 million.\u201d",
      "A moderate House Democrat told NBC News that, despite not being a \u201cbig supporter\u201d of Ocasio-Cortez, they privately voted for her to be the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee when she unsuccessfully ran for the post last year. The moderate Democratic lawmaker said the reason is that \u201cshe is one of the top-tier communicators\u201d in the party and the Oversight Committee job is primarily a \u201cmessaging and marketing\u201d role.",
      "But the lawmaker didn\u2019t wish to reveal the vote publicly, a sign there is still wariness about how Ocasio-Cortez might appeal to more centrist and independent voters.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez ultimately landed a spot on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which deals with a host of issues she cares about related to climate change and income inequality.\u00a0 Her evolution from an outside agitator to an inside player in the party has fueled widespread speculation among Democrats about her political ambitions.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez isn\u2019t entertaining the idea of seeking higher office. Her closest advisers reject the premise that Sanders is handing the baton to her as the titular leader of the progressive movement. They also insist she isn\u2019t plotting to challenge Schumer for his Senate seat in 2028, mount a run for governor of New York in 2026 or start organizing a bid for the White House. But they also aren\u2019t ruling anything out.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez declined a request for an interview.",
      "\u201cThere is no 10-year plan,\u201d said a close Ocasio-Cortez adviser, who was granted anonymity to discuss internal planning. \u201cShe is going to be who she is. She is the last person to think about how a decision is going to impact her down the road, which candidly can be a little frustrating to those of us who are advising her.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe can move quickly and authentically in a way few other elected leaders can,\u201d the adviser added. \u201cIf she jumps into anything, it will be because she truly believes she can make real change.\u201d",
      "Many Democratic leaders said Ocasio-Cortez should keep all potential opportunities open.",
      "\u201cI think AOC has a massive future in front of her, and that\u2019s a decision that she\u2019s going to make. I mean, obviously you see lots of conversation about her running for Senate, her running for president. I think all of those options, if I was her campaign manager, are probably going to be on the table,\u201d said Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee\u2019s association of state party chairs.",
      "In the short term, her colleagues in the House believe her best play is to keep her focus on the job at hand.",
      "\u201cShe has matured and evolved as a political leader in remarkable ways,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cShe has gone from being a huge outside force to being a huge inside force.\u201d"

      "Edward James, 63, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection starting at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison outside Starke under a death warrant signed in February by Gov. Ron DeSantis. Barring a last-minute reprieve, the execution is to be the second this year in Florida, which is planning a third in April.",
      "Three other executions were scheduled this week around the United States: Louisiana put a man to death Tuesday using nitrogen gas for the first time as it resumed executions after a 15-year hiatus. Arizona on Wednesday lethally injected a man who had kidnapped and murdered his girlfriend\u2019s ex-husband. Another lethal injection is planned Thursday in Oklahoma.",
      "James drew the death penalty for the Sept. 19, 1993, killings of 8-year-old Toni Neuner and Betty Dick, 58, the child\u2019s grandmother. James had been renting a room in Dick\u2019s house in Casselberry. where Toni Neuner and three other children were also staying that night.",
      "Court records show James drank up to 24 beers at a party, downed some gin and also took LSD before returning to his room at Dick\u2019s house. The girl was raped and strangled to death. The other children were not harmed.",
      "James, who pleaded guilty to the charges, was also found guilty of the rape and of stealing Dick\u2019s jewelry and car after stabbing her 21 times. Court documents show James drove the car across the country, occasionally selling pieces of jewelry until he was arrested on Oct. 6 of that year in Bakersfield, California.",
      "Police obtained a videotaped confession from James, who despite his guilty pleas was sentenced to death upon an 11-1 recommendation by a jury.",
      "James\u2019 lawyers filed several appeals with state and federal courts, all of which were denied. Most recently, the Florida Supreme Court rejected an argument that James\u2019 longtime use of drugs and alcohol, several head injuries and a heart attack in 2023 led to mental decline that would make his execution cruel and unusual punishment.",
      "The justices, however, agreed with a lower court decision that \u201cJames\u2019s cognitive issues do not shield him from execution.\u201d The court also rejected an argument from James\u2019 lawyers that the heart attack he suffered in prison led to deprivation of oxygen that affected his brain and should be considered new evidence to halt the execution.",
      "Even if it is new evidence, the court determined, the \u201cdefendant cannot establish that such evidence would likely yield a less severe sentence at a new penalty phase.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center said Florida uses a three-drug cocktail for its lethal injection: a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart.",
      "Earlier this year, James Ford was executed for the 1997 killings of a couple in Charlotte County \u2014 witnessed by their toddler daughter, who survived. DeSantis also signed a death warrant for the April 8 execution of Michael Tanzi for the 2000 slaying of a woman in the Florida Keys."

      "Cabinet ministers agreed to terms and conditions for a \u201cno-find, no-fee\u201d contract with Texas-based Ocean Infinity to resume the seabed search operation at a new 5,800-square-mile site in the ocean, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said in a statement Wednesday. Ocean Infinity will be paid $70 million only if wreckage is discovered.",

      "Ocean Infinity CEO Oliver Punkett earlier this year reportedly said the company had improved its technology since 2018. He has said the firm is working with many experts to analyze data and had narrowed the search area to the most likely site.",

      "China is believed to execute more prisoners each year than the rest of the world combined, though the total is a state secret. Executions are traditionally carried out by gunshot, though lethal injections have been introduced in recent years.",

The tariffs add to global trade tensions amid rounds of tariff announcements by the United States, China, Canada and Mexico.",

    "story": [
      "Natalia Grace and one set of her former adoptive parents, Michael and Kristine Barnett, are the subject of a new series, \u201cGood American Family.\u201d",
      "Their story played out in the media and has been the focus of two film projects: a documentary series, \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace,\u201d and now the Hulu drama.",
      "The couple is played by Ellen Pompeo and Mark Duplass in the series. In an interview with TODAY.com, Duplass said the role of Michael Barnett was a \u201cjoy,\u201d because it allowed him to have \u201clatitude\u201d as an actor.",
      "\u201cThis is a story about perspective, right? And because we see this story from so many different perspectives, that means the character of Michael Barnett is so many different things at any given time. And sometimes he seems sweet and intensely paternal and morally centered, and sometimes he feels a little bit manipulative, but sometimes he feels desperate,\u201d he said \u2014 adding that the role is also \u201cdeeply unsettling.\u201d",
      "Showrunner Katie Robbins said the show was created without being in touch with the real people.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t in touch with anybody, which made having the copious amounts of research that we have that much more essential,\u2019 she said. TODAY.com has reached out to Michael and Kristine Barnett for comment and has not heard back by the time of publication.",
      "Where are the real Michael and Kristine Barnett now? Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "Who are Michael and Kristine Barnett?",
      "Michael and Kristine Barnett are a formerly married couple who adopted Natalia Grace, an orphan from Ukraine, in 2010, according to a 2021 document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana reviewing two aspects from the Barnetts\u2019 2021 trials obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "They already had three biological sons, Jacob, Ethan and Wesley. In the book \u201cThe Spark: A Mother\u2019s Story of Nurturing Genius,\u201d Kristine Barnett wrote about raising her eldest son, who she says in the book as diagnosed with autism at 2 and also is a math and science prodigy. The Washington Post called the memoir \u201camazing\u201d and \u201ccompulsive reading.\u201d",
      "The Barnetts previously ran a charity called Jacob\u2019s Place, which had the purpose of raising awareness about autism and funded \u201cprograms that bring joy to children on the spectrum,\u201d according to an archived version of the charity\u2019s website.",
      "What happened between the Barnetts and Natalia Grace?",
      "Michael and Kristine Barnett said they began to suspect that Grace, who has a rare form of dwarfism, was a grown woman masquerading as a little girl, per the court document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "They also accused Grace of threatening their family with violence, per the Court of Appeals document, which Grace has long denied.",
      "Grace was psychologically and medically evaluated between 2010 and 2012, per the document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana.",
      "In 2012, the Barnetts filed a successful petition to change Grace\u2019s legal birth year from 2003 to 1989 to reflect an older age. The following year, they moved to Canada with their biological children and left Grace alone in a rented apartment to transition to \u201clife as an adult,\u201d according the court document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana.",
      "Medical records, however, said Grace was not an adult. According to a 2019 affidavit of probable cause, Grace was examined by a doctor at Peyton Manning Children\u2019s Hospital that determined she was 8 years old in 2010. A 2012 skeletal survey at the same hospital determined she was 11. Per the affidavit, Michael Barnett admitted he and Kristine were aware of these examinations and test results when they left her alone in an apartment in 2013.",
      "Cynthia and Antwan Mans, a Tippecanoe County couple, filed for legal guardianship of Grace in 2016. Michael Barnett filed an objection, \u201casserting that Natalia was an adult,\u201d per the document from the Indiana Court of Appeals. This sparked years of legal back-and-forth.",
      "In 2019, the Barnetts were each charged with six counts of neglect of a dependent and two counts of conspiracy to commit neglect of a dependent. After a protracted legal process, Michael Barnett was acquitted of his charges after a jury trial in 2022 and the charges against his wife were dismissed.",
      "Michael Barnett filed for divorce from Kristine Barnett in 2014, and their divorce was finalized in 2018, according to Indiana court records seen by TODAY.com.",
      "What have they said about their time with Natalia Grace?",
      "Kristine Barnett has denied accusations that Grace was abused while living with her and her ex-husband.",
      "\u201cNatalia was a very much loved and cared for member of my family. She was not abused by anyone in my family. Let\u2019s get straight to these allegations. Nobody ever took a belt to Natalia and the allegations that she was \u2018beaten\u2019 are just plain false,\u201d she wrote in part of a since-deleted Facebook post from January 2024.",
      "She added that \u201cany discipline of Natalia was very minimal\u201d and \u201cnot out of the bounds of normal parenting.\u201d",
      "Kristine Barnett has since removed all posts about Natalia Grace from her Facebook page.",
      "She did not participate in the Investigation Discovery documentary about Grace\u2019s case, but Michael Barnett was interviewed for the docuseries.",
      "In one dramatic scene, he and Grace discuss their past relationship. He accuses his ex-wife of emotional abuse and argues that he and Grace were both victims in their home.",
      "\u201cI had the same monster you did. I was exceptionally controlled and put down and threatened, was minimalized,\u201d he told Grace. \u201cWho I was was ripped from me, and I was guided and instructed to be exactly what she wanted me to be.\u201d",
      "In her deleted Facebook post, Kristine Barnett appeared to address her ex-husband\u2019s allegations.",
      "\u201cMichael Barnett and Natalia Barnett may have the same monster but that monster is not me,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Grace no longer lives with either of the Barnetts. As of early 2025, she was living with another family, the DePauls, and working on becoming more independent, she told People in January.",
      "Where are Michael and Kristine Barnett now?",
      "As of 2023, Barnett appeared to still be living in Indianapolis, Indiana. A 2023 court document related to a speeding violation lists the same Indianapolis address for Barnett as was listed in the 2019 case involving the multiple charges of neglect against him and his ex-wife.",
      "Barnett appears to have remarried and divorced following his split with Kristine Barnett.",
      "According to Indiana court records, a petitioner listed as Michael Barnett with the same Indianapolis address as above filed for divorce against a respondent named Jennifer Barnett. Their divorce was finalized in 2022.",
      "In a 2018 court document confirming her divorce from Michael Barnett, Kristine Barnett was listed as residing in New Hamburg, Ontario.",
      "By 2019, she appears to have moved back to the United States. A court document listed her address as located in Indiana."

    "story": [
      "At only four episodes long, it\u2019s hard to imagine just how much of an impact Netflix\u2019s \u201cAdolescence\u201d has on the viewer.",
      "Each episode of the acclaimd British crime drama miniseries \u2014 co-created by and co-starring Stephen Graham, and inspired by real events \u2014 lands like a punch to the gut. It\u2019s particularly immersive, since each episode has been filmed in one continuous, unbroken camera shot.",
      "\u201cAdolescence\u201d focuses on 13-year-old Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper), who in the first moments is arrested for the murder of one of his classmates, Katie Lewis (Emilia Holliday).",
      "Each episode has a different focus: Episode 1 is about Jamie\u2019s arrest and processing; Episode 2 jumps ahead a couple of days and shows police detectives following up an investigation at Jamie\u2019s school; Episode 3 returns to Jamie, months later and still in detention but not convicted, being interviewed by a psychiatrist; Episode 4 takes us to Jamie\u2019s family, dealing with the fallout of his alleged crime (as he still hasn\u2019t gone to court), many months later.",
      "Here's a rundown of the ending of \"Adolescence\" and why it leaves no room for easy answers.",
      "Did Jamie kill Katie?",
      "Yes, and this gets cleared up fairly early in the series: In Episode 1, CCTV footage shows Jamie and Katie in an altercation. She pushes him, and he pushes her, and then he stabs her repeatedly.",
      "It\u2019s all shown at a distance, without volume, and unless you knew he had a knife on him it might seem that Jamie was punching her.",
      "Jamie\u2019s father Eddie (series co-creator and co-writer Stephen Graham) is shown the footage in that first episode, and believes it \u2014 despite Jamie insisting he wasn\u2019t the one who killed the girl.",
      "Why did Jamie kill Katie?",
      "Since we know Jamie is guilty early on, what remains to be discovered in the last three episodes is the \u201cwhy,\u201d and that\u2019s where things get complicated.",
      "Police bumble their way through coded teen internet speak, discovering that adolescents are aware of phrases like \u201cmanosphere\u201d and \u201cincel.\u201d",
      "They also learn quickly that bullying can happen from multiple angles \u2014 both online in the real world \u2014 that teenagers\u2019 need to be seen and valued by their peers can triumph over everything else they might learn at home or from teachers.",
      "In Episode 3, when we dive deeper into Jamie\u2019s thinking, the series doesn\u2019t let us see a cut-and-dried version of him as either villain or misunderstood victim of bullies. He has a temper, and seems to get pleasure when others are afraid of him. But he can be polite and genuine, unsure exactly of what is going on around him. It\u2019s in this episode where his insistence that he didn\u2019t kill Kate might make some sense in his mind \u2014 he doesn\u2019t see himself as the bad guy, or someone who is capable of killing. But his anger showed him differently.",
      "What happens to Jamie at the end of \u2018Adolescence\u2019?",
      "Jamie isn\u2019t seen in the last episode, only briefly heard. The final episode looks at an earth-shaking morning in the life of Jamie\u2019s family, with Eddie, his mother Manda (Christine Tremarco) and sister Lisa (Amelie Pease).",
      "While they\u2019re riding in Eddie\u2019s recently-vandalized van, they get a call from Jamie \u2014 who announces he\u2019s changing his plea to \u201cguilty\u201d when he goes to court. He doesn\u2019t give a reason why.",
      "Back home, Eddie and Manda have a mutual breakdown, wondering where they went wrong. They ask if they should have gotten him a computer, and put few restrictions on his using it. Eddie, who was physically abused as a boy, says he only wanted to do better with his children. How could they have \u201cmade\u201d a Jamie? But then they also realize they \u201cmade\u201d a Lisa, who by all lights is doing well in school and acts sensibly.",
      "The final scene features Eddy weeping in his son\u2019s bed, surrounded by Jamie\u2019s belongings and toy teddy bear. He gives the bear a small kiss, and tucks it into bed \u2014 something he probably won\u2019t be able to do with his own son ever again.",
      "Will there be an \u2018Adolescence\u2019 Season 2?",
      "It seems unlikely; the Millers\u2019 story in the miniseries comes to a conclusion of sorts, even if it doesn\u2019t provide pat answers. In theory, \u201cAdolescence\u201d could become an anthology series, with different crimes and different characters, but as of now there\u2019s been no announcement from Netflix that there are plans to replicate the show."

He departed the series in 2011 and later returned in April 2021 on the spinoff \"Law & Order: Organized Crime.\"",
      "Fans of Benson and Stabler have been holding out hope the characters will also become romantic partners. In Stabler's return \"SVU\" episode, Stabler's wife died, and over the past few years, Benson and Stabler have crossed over to each other's shows and even shared some steamy moments.",

    "story": [
      "Shant\u00e9 Glover and Brion Whitley started filming \"Temptation Island\" after only one year of dating. Did their budding relationship survive the Netflix series?",
      "Similar to the three other couples on the show, Shant\u00e9 and Brion had concerns about their relationship and needed some clarity before committing to each other.",
      "During the experiment, each of the couples were separated and lived with a group of \"tempters\" of the opposite sex. The end goal for the tempters: Entice the couples so that they wouldn't remain faithful to their original partner.",
      "So, did Shant\u00e9 and Brion fall victim to temptation? Read on for a recap of their \"Temptation Island\" journey and find out if the two are still together today.",
      "Why was Brion and Shant\u00e9\u2019s relationship on the rocks?",
      "Shant\u00e9, a 29-year-old who works in the clinical health care field, and Brion, a 26-year-old who works in medical and pharmaceutical sales, broke down their relationship challenges in Episode 1.",
      "Brion, a self-described \"flirt,\" admitted that he pursued another woman at the beginning of their relationship, leaving Shant\u00e9 feeling insecure. However, they soon reconciled after he realized that the \u201cgrass isn\u2019t greener on the other side.\u201d",
      "Brion called the experiment the \"final test\" for him to prove he could tone down his flirty personality. Additionally, Brion\u2019s high sex drive and fantasies had caused tension in their relationship.",
      "In an interview with Netflix's Tudum before filming, Brion shared his hopes for the experiment, saying, \u201cI want to learn how to be more patient in conversation and listen more.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Shant\u00e9 said she wanted to get out of her comfort zone and feel worthy in her relationship again.",
      "Did they form any romantic connections during the experiment?",
      "Brion wasted no time getting to know the female tempters. In Episode 2, he drank a shot off of contestant Mia Jones' chest and she licked chocolate sauce off his face.",
      "\"If this is Day 2, oh my God,\" he said while saying he could see himself struggling to follow the boundaries he and Shant\u00e9 had set before coming to the island. Both had agreed that any physical contact with the tempters was not allowed.",
      "In a confessional interview, Shant\u00e9 said, \"If either of us cross the boundaries we set, it\u2019s a done deal.\"",
      "While speaking with the tempters, Brion said he was in love with Shant\u00e9 and called her \"out of my league.\" But, he later succumbed to temptation and had a threesome with tempters Courtney Randolph and Alex Zamora in Episode 5.",
      "Afterwards, Brion said he didn't have any regrets and didn't think his girlfriend would be upset.",
      "\"I think I'm still respecting Shant\u00e9 at the end of the day. I think women respect honesty and being true to yourself, and I think a lot of women would rather have someone just be real and talk to them. And if they're going to step out or whatever, let them know,\" he shared in a confessional interview.",
      "For her part, Shant\u00e9 opted to spend her time on the island focusing on introspective work and didn\u2019t form any physical connections with the male tempters.",
      "When she saw footage at one of the bonfires proving that her boyfriend had a threesome, Shant\u00e9 just shook her head in disgust and disbelief.",
      "\"It does kind of make me feel a little dumb, slightly, just because I've been so convinced that he's being faithful to me. And to say that he doesn't have any regrets is sad. It's hurtful. It's disrespectful,\" she told host Mark. L Walberg, adding that she didn't think Brion would have ever behaved the same way in the real world.",
      "When the couples had a chance to film a short video for each other during the experiment, Shant\u00e9 waited in anticipation for Brion's message to provide an explanation.",
      "\"The boundary I crossed is not what I needed in my life and I'll never let you feel insufficient. I love you,\" he said, in part.",
      "Toward the end of the experiment, Brion acknowledged he had acted like a \"d---\" after realizing that Shant\u00e9 did not succumb to temptation.",
      "\"I'm fighting for the relationship for me. I want her. She is a great woman. She doesn't need me. So I've got to see if she still wants me. I think she does, from her words, but I know I'm not trying to lose out on a great woman,\" he said in a confessional interview.",
      "Did they leave the island together?",
      "Yes. Shant\u00e9 and Brion both chose to leave the island together at the end of the experiment.",
      "When they met at the final bonfire, Brion and Shant\u00e9 were each given the opportunity to speak before making their decision. Shant\u00e9  shared her thoughts first. She said, \"For you to do what you did, just for you to say you had no regrets, just made me feel worthless, like I don't matter, like our love never mattered. And I don't deserve that.\"",
      "Brion then apologized and cried as he expressed his love for her.",
      "\"The man I was before we got here, in my opinion, was fake. I think I was so surface level of a boyfriend. ... I just want to show you that I'm a changed man and I'm honestly not worthy of you. And that's a hard pill to swallow because you deserve the best, the absolute best of a man,\" he said.",
      "In the end, Brion announced his decision first. He said he wanted to go home with Shant\u00e9 and rebuild their relationship. Shant\u00e9 needed a few minutes to compose herself before making her decision.",
      "Shant\u00e9 initially chose herself and Brion accepted that, adding that he had to \"lay in the bed I made.\" Afterwards, she said she was happy Brion was more in tune with his emotions. She then changed her mind and decided to give their relationship another try.",
      "\u201cI believe in our love. I think that we can make this something special. And I am happy with my decision,\u201d\u00a0she said in her last confessional interview.",
      "Are they still together?",
      "Brion and Shant\u00e9 have not appeared on each other's social media pages in recent posts. For now, it's unclear if the couple is still together.",
      "Fans will have to wait to hear an update from the couple. Executive producers David Goldberg and David Friedman recently confirmed in an interview with Variety that a reunion has not been filmed yet."

      "After traveling together to a tropical island, the couples were introduced to a group of \"tempters\" whose job was to prevent them from remaining faithful. The men and women were then separated for the duration of the experiment.",

      "On top of that, Alexa\u2019s profession also put a strain on their relationship since the couple has had to move across the country three times.",
      "Did they form any romantic connections during the experiment?",
      "At the onset of the experiment, Alexa and Lino revealed that they hadn't set any boundaries or rules for each other, meaning they were allowed to be physically intimate with the tempters if they wanted.",
      "But Alexa and Lino seemed to be more interested in leaning on the tempters for support and receiving advice about their relationship. Their connections with the tempters were strictly platonic.",
      "Did they leave the island together?",
      "Yes! Alexa and Lino both chose to leave the island together at the end of the experiment.",
      "At the final bonfire, Alexa said her love for Lino had \"grown more than I could imagine.\" She addressed the past issues in their relationship, including the insecurities she struggled with due to her prior divorce, and ended on a positive note.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t need you in my life, but I want you in my life. I need you to believe this deep down. You are my first choice forever,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Lino described the \"Temptation Island\" journey as \"arduous\" and said he came into the experiment with \"resentment, trust issues (and) feelings of (being Alexa's) second choice.\"",
      "\"I quickly realized that was all from a deep-rooted insecurity of myself. It was never anything that you were projecting onto me. It was actually me projecting it onto you. And for that, I truly apologize,\" he said, adding that he found out \"what true love is\" after embarking on the experiment.",
      "Alexa responded to her boyfriend, saying, \"I realized what we have is so, so special. None of that past stuff, guilt, arguments that don't really mean anything, it could never take away this, because this is what everyone wants.\"",
      "Afterwards, Lino asked Alexa to marry him and Alexa gladly accepted the proposal.",
      "Are Alexa and Lino still together?",
      "Executive producers David Goldberg and David Friedman confirmed in an interview with Variety that \"Temptation Island\" was filmed in May 2024. Lino's last Instagram post with Alexa was uploaded in February 2024. Meanwhile, Alexa posted a photo of the couple in April 2024.",

      "Starring Ellen Pompeo as Kristine Barnett, Mark Duplass as Michael Barnett, and Imogen Faith Reid as Natalia Grace, \u201cGood American Family\u201d is \u201ctold from multiple points of view as a means to explore issues of perspective, bias, and trauma,\u201d according to Hulu.",
      "This new drama, a fictionalization of the case, comes on the heels of Investigation Discovery\u2019s third season of its documentary series, \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace,\u201d which takes a deep dive into Grace\u2019s story.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, creator and co-showrunner Katie Robbins confirmed the show was not in touch with the real people depicted, \u201cwhich made having the copious amounts of research that we have that much more essential,\u201d she said.",
      "The series drew from Facebook messages, text messages, depositions, medical records and adoption records, Robbins says. \u201cI can\u2019t even describe how many documents we were looking through,\u201d she says.",
      "The goal was not to make a \u201cdocumentary version\" of the story, Robbins says, because that exists elsewhere. Rather, she wanted to make \u201cthe most emotionally authentic version of this story,\u201d which required drawing from research and identifying places \u201cthat we need to slightly heighten or embellish or adjust to create a compelling narrative story.\u201d",
      "Keep reading to learn more about the real story of Natalia Grace, what her former adoptive parents were charged with, and where she is now.",
      "Who is Natalia Grace?",
      "Natalia Grace is originally from Ukraine and came to the United States in 2008 when she was adopted by a New Hampshire couple.",
      "Her Ukrainian adoption paperwork stated she was born in 2003, according to a 2021 document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Grace was born with a form of dwarfism called diastrophic dysplasia, according to the document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana. This condition can affect bone growth and cause severe skeletal abnormalities, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.",
      "In 2010, the New Hampshire couple who originally adopted Grace put her up for re-adoption, per the document from the Indiana Court of Appeals. She was then adopted by Indiana couple Kristine and Michael Barnett, who have three biological children.",
      "Soon after the adoption, the Barnetts have said they began to suspect that Grace was not a little girl, but an adult.",
      "Grace\u2019s age has been a point of contention. She has maintained that she was a child when she was adopted. In a season of \u201cNatalia Speaks,\u201d a DNA test suggested that Grace\u2019s age was \u201ccloser to 22\u201d at the time of filming, which made her 7 years old when she was adopted, according to the series.",
      "Over the next two years, the Barnetts had Grace medically and psychologically tested. In 2012, the couple successfully filed a petition for a court order to change Grace\u2019s birth year from 2003 to 1989, \u201cbased on age estimates provided by a primary care physician and social worker,\u201d per the document from the Indiana Court of Appeals.",
      "In 2013, the Barnetts moved Grace into her own apartment in Hamilton County, Indiana and \u201cassisted Natalia in obtaining federal disability benefits and supportive services to help her transition to life as an adult,\u201d per the document from the Indiana Court of Appeals. They then moved her into an apartment in Tippecanoe County, then moved to Canada with their biological children.",
      "Soon after moving to Tippecanoe County, Grace met Antwon and Cynthia Mans, and moved in with them, per the Indiana Court of Appeals filing.",
      "In March 2016, Antwon and Cynthia Mans filed a petition seeking guardianship of Grace, according to court documents. She was eventually adopted by them in 2023.",
      "Six months after the adoption, the Manses expressed concerns about Grace in a recorded call to the producers of \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomething ain\u2019t right with Natalia,\u201d Antwon Mans said in the call, which was included in the docuseries. \u201cThis girl is tweakin.\u2019 I feel like she\u2019s the enemy in the house ... Made us look like we\u2019re the enemy.\u201d",
      "\u201cNatalia does not have emotions for nothing but herself,\u201d Antwon Mans also said on the call, as seen in the series. \u201cWe\u2019re done. We\u2019re done with her.\u201d",
      "Grace eventually left the Manses\u2019 home with the help of the family she lives with now, Nicole and Vincent DePaul, a New York couple with dwarfism. In the final chapter of the Investigation Discovery docuseries, which came out in January 2025, Grace is shown living apparently happily with the DePauls.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have a normal childhood \u2014 I had my childhood ripped from me,\u201d Grace said in the docuseries. She added, \u201cI left the nest to explore. It feels really good to know that, yeah, I can actually do this.\u201d",
      "What happened between Natalia Grace and the Barnetts?",
      "Soon after adopting Grace, the Barnetts began to believe she had malicious intentions toward them, Michael Barnett said in \u201cThe Curious Grace of Natalia Grace.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t put into words the everyday abject horror that we had to go through and live with,\u201d he said in the documentary.",
      "The couple alleged that they once woke up to find Grace standing by their bed with a knife, a story Grace has denied.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d she said in the documentary. \u201cI\u2019m an 8-year-old, 37-pound little girl ... I never tried to murder anybody.\u201d",
      "While the Barnetts initially said they believed Grace was an adult, Michael Barnett admitted they knew medical professionals had determined she was a minor at the time of her adoption, according to a 2019 affidavit of probable cause filed in the County of Tippecanoe in Indiana.",
      "According to the same affidavit, Grace was examined at Peyton Manning Children\u2019s Hospital in 2010 and her age was determined to be approximately 8. Two years later, she had a skeletal survey at the same hospital and her age was estimated as 11.",
      "Michael Barnett later admitted that he and his wife \u201cwere aware\u201d doctors had \u201cdetermined Natalia was a minor child\u201d when they left her alone in an apartment in 2013 and moved to Canada with their biological children, according to the affidavit.",
      "Barnett also said his wife \u201ctold Natalia to tell others Natalia looks young but was actually 22,\u201d the affidavit states.",
      "Kristine Barnett did not participate in the docuseries or respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a since-deleted Facebook post, Kristine Barnett called the docuseries \u201chighly sensationalized\u201d and said Grace had been \u201ca very much loved and cared for member of our family.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that these false allegations are occurring after a trial with evidence which was dismissed is disturbing,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s like being assumed guilty after being proven innocent.\u201d",
      "What charges did the Barnetts face?",
      "In September 2019, Michael and Kristine Barnett were each charged with six counts of neglect of a dependent and two counts of conspiracy to commit neglect of a dependent.",
      "In a convoluted legal battle spanning years, the Barnetts filed motions to dismiss the charges against them. Some of these motions were granted, but not all the charges were dismissed.",
      "In a 2021 document, the Court of Appeals of Indiana maintained that the Barnetts had \u201cengaged in numerous \u2018positive acts\u2019 to conceal their criminal neglect of Natalia.\u201d",
      "These acts, in part, included \u201cchanging Natalia\u2019s age to conceal the illegality of abandoning her alone in an apartment and to repel others\u2019 efforts to intervene,\u201d as well \u201cfailing to disclose to the probate court the results of certain medical examinations and evaluations regarding Natalia\u2019s age.\u201d",
      "The court also maintained that regardless of Grace\u2019s age, the State of Indiana could proceed with certain counts against the Barnetts under \u201cthe theory that Natalia was a dependent because of a physical disability.\u201d",
      "Michael Barnett was found not guilty of the charges against him in October 2022, and the charges against Kristine Barnett were dismissed in March 2023, according to the Lafayette Journal & Courier.",
      "Grace and the Barnetts have continued to share differing accounts of their time together.",
      "Grace has alleged that the Barnetts abused her and made her lie about her age, and she has denied their claims that she physically threatened them.",
      "\u201cI feel like I have to defend myself and be like, \u2018Do I look like somebody that could push someone twice my size into a fence? Do I look like I could even grip a knife?\u2019\u201d she told People in January.",
      "\u201cI feel like I was brainwashed by the Barnetts,\u201d she continued. \u201cKristine coached me to lie about my age and say I tried to murder my parents. Why would you do that to your child?\u201d",
      "In a charged conversation with Grace in the docuseries in 2023, Michael Barnett alleged that Kristine had abused him as well, and said he and Grace were both victims in the situation.",
      "Michael and Kristine Barnett divorced in 2014, per NBC News.",
      "\u201cI had the same monster you did. I was exceptionally controlled and put down and threatened, was minimalized,\u201d he said. \u201cWho I was was ripped from me, and I was guided and instructed to be exactly what she wanted me to be.",
      "Where is Natalia Grace now?",
      "As of January 2025, Grace is living with Nicole and Vincent DePaul in upstate New York.",
      "Nicole DePaul defended Grace in a recent People cover story, challenging the Barnetts\u2019 previous claims about Grace\u2019s behavior.",
      "\u201cDid she probably do weird things in the past? Yeah,\u201d DePaul told People. \u201c(But) when you take in a child, you take that child as your own. You don\u2019t just get rid of them when they don\u2019t fit into your puzzle.\u201d",
      "DePaul also said Grace experiences anxiety and has ADHD and PTSD.",
      "According to Grace's interview with People, she was studying for her GED, learning to drive, and earning her own money.",
      "Grace has also said she is in a happy romantic relationship with a U.K.-based boyfriend called Neil.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a big learning curve for me. For the most part, I\u2019ve made peace. It is definitely a blessing to be alive today,\u201d Grace told People. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing I can do to change the past.\u201d"

      "The Israel Defense Forces launched fresh strikes across the Gaza Strip, killing dozens of people according to two hospitals in the southern city of Khan Younis.",
      "More than 30 of those killed were brought to the city's European Hospital, while 13 were taken to Nasser Hospital, officials told NBC News. One family saw 12 of its members killed, including several children.",

      "Among those killed was Afnan Fouad Al-Ghannam, 20, who was seven months pregnant, and her one-year-old son, Mohammad, when their shelter in the Muwasi tent camp was hit. While Muwasi has long been designated a humanitarian zone, it has been struck on multiple occasions during the war.",

      "\u201cChina is absolutely central to the success story of Tesla globally,\u201d said Michael Dunne, chief executive of the San Diego-based advisory service Dunne Insights. \u201cTake China out of the picture, we have a completely different Tesla.\u201d",

      "With his role as a Trump adviser and his high profile in China, where he has met with senior leaders including the foreign minister, Musk has been held up as a potential bridge between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. But it remains unclear to whose advantage that will be.",
      "\u201cIt would be very striking and unlikely if Beijing doesn\u2019t see this as a great gift,\u201d said Isaac Stone Fish, chief executive of Strategy Risks, a research firm based in New York.",
      "\u201cBeijing is long used to using what it calls friends, the technical Chinese term for \u2018useful idiots,\u2019 for folks who can advance the interests of the Communist Party,\u201d Stone Fish said. \u201cBeijing is very used to using people like Elon Musk to do that.\u201d",
      "Though Musk is widely admired in China as an innovator and businessman, his fortunes here could also shift rapidly if U.S.-China relations sour and the public begins to associate him more with Trump administration policies.",
      "The White House, DOGE and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The White House has said Musk\u2019s cost-cutting initiative is unrelated to U.S. foreign policy, while the Chinese Embassy in Washington says the U.S. business community has long been a \u201cstaunch force\u201d for U.S.-China relations.",
      "\u201cWe welcome American companies to continue investing and developing in China, playing an active role as a bridge and contribute to a stable, sound and sustainable China-U.S. relationship,\u201d embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement.",
      "A crucial market",
      "Musk broke ground on the Gigafactory in January 2019, making Tesla the first foreign carmaker to set up a factory in China without a Chinese partner.",
      "Ten months later, the factory was up and running in what businesspeople here like to call \u201cChina speed.\u201d",
      "China now accounts for more than a third of Tesla\u2019s global sales, with more than 657,000 vehicles sold here last year. As of June, Tesla had 520 stores across the country."

      "A Dominican judge ruled Tuesday that Riibe no longer needs to remain under police supervision. However, the judge said his courtroom was not the appropriate venue to resolve the matter of Riibe\u2019s passport.",
      "As Eduardo Vel\u00e1zquez, a prosecutor with the Dominican Republic AG\u2019s office, returned to the courtroom ahead of the judge\u2019s decision Tuesday, NBC News asked him about Riibe\u2019s passport, which prosecutors claim they do not have.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know the passport,\" Vel\u00e1zquez said. Pressed for answers, he responded \u2014 in English: \"I don\u2019t speak Spanish ... er, English, sorry.\"",
      "Konanki's mother appeared to be too grief-stricken to speak at length Tuesday but thanked the international media for its \"help and cooperation.\"",
      "\"We were going through too much pain all these days and we were saddened and we were not able to believe this,\" Konanki's father said. \"Sorry, I cannot, I\u2019m not able to speak anything on that because our heart is broken.\"",

It was a dramatic escalation in an ongoing government crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey.",

      "Legal obstacles",
      "The opposition leader faces multiple lawsuits, including allegations of trying to influence a judicial expert investigating opposition-led municipalities. The cases could result in prison sentences and a political ban.",
      "Imamoglu is also appealing a 2022 conviction of insulting members of Turkey\u2019s Supreme Electoral Council, a case that could result in a political ban.",

The party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.",
      "The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which his party made significant gains against Erdo\u011fan\u2019s governing party."
