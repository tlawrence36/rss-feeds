      "\u201cThe Pitt\u201d has won best drama series at the Emmys, with Noah Wyle taking best actor in a drama",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Seth Rogen and \u201cThe Studio\u201d turned the Emmys into a wrap party, winning best comedy series Sunday and breaking a comedy record for victories in a season with 13, while Noah Wyle and \u201cThe Pitt\u201d took the top drama prize.",
      "The evening also brought meaningful wins for Jean Smart, Stephen Colbert and 15-year-old Owen Cooper, whose Netflix series \u201cAdolescence\u201d dominated the limited series categories.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m legitimately embarrassed by how happy this makes me,\u201d \u201cThe Studio\u201d co-creator Rogen said with his signature giggle, surrounded by cast and crew from the Apple TV+ movie-business romp after it won best comedy at the Peacock Theater in a show hosted by Nate Bargatze that aired on CBS. Rogen personally won four, including best actor.",
      "\u201cThe Pitt\u201d from HBO Max completed a sentimental journey with its win for best drama series. The character-driven medical drama won over viewers and gained emotional momentum during a season whose biggest drama prizes once seemed destined to be swept by \u201cSeverance.\u201d",
      "Wyle won best actor in a drama for playing a grizzled, warm-but-worn-down supervising doctor, getting his first Emmy after five nominations with no victories in the 1990s for playing a scrubbed young cub doctor on \u201cER.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat a dream this has been,\u201d Wyle said. \u201cOh my goodness.\u201d",
      "Katherine LaNasa, whose nurse is perhaps the show's most beloved character, was a surprise winner of best supporting actress in a drama over three women of \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d on a night when every acting Emmy but one went to a first-time victor.",
      "The first-timers included Britt Lower, who won best actress in a drama, and Tramell Tillman, who won best supporting actor, in the night's two biggest moments for \u201cSeverance.\u201d",
      "Along with its creative arts wins, the Orwellian workplace satire ended up with eight for its acclaimed second season. Star Adam Scott lost out to Wyle for best actor.",
      "The show's losses kept the evening from being a total triumph for Apple TV+, which has still never won a best drama prize, though it has now won best comedy three times between \u201cThe Studio\u201d and \u201cTed Lasso.\u201d",
      "Lower\u2019s win was a surprise in a category where Kathy Bates was considered a heavy favorite, for \u201cMatlock.\u201d",
      "Cristin Milioti won best actress in a limited series for \u201cThe Penguin.\u201d",
      "Jean Smart bucked the rookie trend, winning her fourth Emmy for best actress in a comedy for \u201cHacks\u201d and her seventh Emmy overall. At 73, she extended her record for oldest winner in the category.",
      "Netflix\u2019s widely acclaimed \u201cAdolescence,\u201d the story of a 13-year-old in Britain accused of a killing, won six times, including the Emmy for best limited series. Co-creator Stephen Graham won for lead acting and writing while Cooper won best supporting actor and became the youngest Emmy winner in over 40 years.",
      "Cooper said in his acceptance that he was \u201cnothing three years ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so surreal,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cHonestly, when I started these drama classes a couple years back, I didn\u2019t expect to be even in the United States, never mind here.\u201d",
      "Best supporting actress went to Erin Doherty, who played a therapist opposite Cooper in a riveting episode that like all four \u201cAdolescence\u201d episodes was filmed in a single shot.",

      "\u201cThe Studio\u201d came into the evening having won nine Emmys already during last weekend's Creative Arts ceremony. On Sunday night, it added four more, which all went to Rogen. Along with the comedy series award, he won best directing with his co-creator and longtime collaborator Evan Goldberg, and best writing with Goldberg and others.",
      "The show brought blockbuster buzz for its first season from the start and the Emmys ate it up, whether because of Hollywood's love for stories about itself (with A-list guest stars) or the television industry's love for stories that mock the self-importance of movie people.",
      "Backstage, Rogen clumsily tried to hold up all four Emmys at once. Asked whether the night will be fodder for season two, he said no.",
      "\u201cThis is, like, far too good a thing to have happen on our show,\u201d he said. \u201cOur show is generally based on stress and disappointment and right now, we\u2019re all very happy.\u201d",
      "Smart's castmate and constant scene partner Hannah Einbinder, who had also been nominated for all four seasons of \u201cHacks\u201d but unlike Smart had never won, took best supporting actress in a comedy.",
      "She said she had become committed to a long-term bit where \u201cit was cooler to lose.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut this is cool too!\u201d she shouted, then ended her speech by cursing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and saying \u201cFree Palestine!\u201d Political sentiments from the stage were otherwise rare.",
      "In perhaps the night's biggest upset, Jeff Hiller won best supporting actor in a comedy for \u201cSomebody Somewhere,\u201d over Ike Barinholtz of \u201cThe Studio\u201d and others.",
      "Colbert may have been the night's most popular winner, taking best talk series for \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d for the first time. He got huge ovations both when he took the stage to present the first award and when he won.",
      "The win may have been the result of a protest vote and a desire to pay tribute to its host, weeks after its cancellation by CBS. Jimmy Kimmel, who was among his competitors, campaigned for Colbert to win.",
      "\u201cSometimes you only truly know how much you love something when you get a sense that you might be losing it,\u201d Colbert said in his acceptance.",
      "Many perceived the end of the show as punishment of Colbert and placation of President Donald Trump after Colbert was harshly critical of a legal settlement between the president and Paramount, which needed administration approval for a sale to Skydance Media. Executives called the decision strictly financial.",
      "Colbert showed no bitterness to CBS, thanking the network, which telecast the Emmys and aired a commercial celebrating his win, for letting him be part of the late-night tradition.",
      "Bargatze delivered his opening monologue only after the first award was handed out.",
      "The show opened with a sketch where \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars Mikey Day, Bowen Yang and James Austin Johnson joined Bargatze, who played television inventor Philo T. Farnsworth opining on what the future of TV will be like.",
      "Bargatze-as-Farnsworth mentions that there will one day be a Black Entertainment Television. When asked if there will be a network for white people, he replied, \u201cWhy, CBS of course.\u201d",

      "The film extended its meteoric run, scoring the biggest anime opening of all time with a $132.1 million weekend, according to Comscore. Crunchyroll and Sony rolled it out across North America and 49 international markets, pushing the global total to $177.8 million.",
      "\u201cThis performance by this particular film shows the unpredictability of the box office,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIf we were sitting here, let\u2019s say a month or even a couple of weeks ago, would we be thinking, \u2018Wow, a Japanese anime film would be number one at the box office, overperform and bring in $70 million?\u2019 If you predicted that, kudos to you.\u201d",
      "The movie is the first in a three-film trilogy that brings the hit Shonen saga to its climactic showdown.

    "summary": "The Library of Congress has named Arthur Sze the new U.S. poet laureate",
    "story": [
      "The Library of Congress has named Arthur Sze the new U.S. poet laureate",
      "At a time when its leadership is in question and its mission challenged, the Library of Congress has named a new U.S. poet laureate, the much-honored author and translator Arthur Sze.",
      "The library announced Monday that the 74-year-old Sze had been appointed to a one-year term, starting this fall. The author of 12 poetry collections and recipient last year of a lifetime achievement award from the library, he succeeds Ada Lim\u00f3n, who had served for three years. Previous laureates also include Joy Harjo, Louise Gl\u00fcck and Billy Collins.",
      "Speaking during a recent Zoom interview with The Associated Press, Sze acknowledged some misgivings when Rob Casper, who heads the library\u2019s poetry and literature center, called him in June about becoming the next laureate. He wondered about the level of responsibilities and worried about the upheaval since President Donald Trump fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden in May. After thinking about it overnight, he called Casper back and happily accepted.",
      "\u201cI think it was the opportunity to give something back to poetry, to something that I\u2019ve spent my life doing,\u201d he explained, speaking from his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. \u201cSo many people have helped me along the way. Poetry has just helped me grow so much, in every way.\u201d",
      "Sze\u2019s new job begins during a tumultuous year for the library, a 200-year-old, nonpartisan institution that holds a massive archive of books published in the United States. Trump abruptly fired Hayden after conservative activists accused her of imposing a \u201cwoke\u201d agenda, criticism that Trump has expressed often as he seeks sweeping changes at the Kennedy Center, the Smithsonian museums and other cultural institutions.",
      "Hayden\u2019s ouster was sharply criticized by congressional Democrats, leaders in the library and scholarly community and such former laureates as Lim\u00f3n and Harjo. It also led to a debate over who has the authority to decide on an interim replacement.",
      "Although the White House announced that it had named Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as the acting librarian, daily operations are being run by a longtime official at the library, Robert Randolph Newlen. Events such as the annual National Book Festival have continued without interruption or revision.",
      "Laureates are forbidden to take political positions, although the tradition was breached in 2003 when Collins publicly stated his objections to President George W. Bush\u2019s push for war against Iraq.",
      "Newlen is identified in Monday\u2019s announcement as acting librarian, a position he was in line for according to the institution's guidelines. He praised Sze, whose influences range from ancient Chinese poets to Wallace Stevens, for his \u201cdistinctly American\u201d portraits of the Southwest landscapes and for his \u201cgreat formal innovation.\u201d",

      "\u201cLike Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, Sze forges something new from a range of traditions and influences \u2014 and the result is a poetry that moves freely throughout time and space,\u201d his statement reads in part.",
      "Sze\u2019s official title is poet laureate consultant in poetry, a 1985 renaming of a position established in 1937 as consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. The mission is loosely defined as a kind of literary ambassador, to \u201craise the national consciousness to a greater appreciation of the reading and writing of poetry.\u201d Initiatives have included Robert Pinsky\u2019s \u201cFavorite Poem Project,\u201d for which the public would share thoughts on works of their choosing, and Lim\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cYou Are Here,\u201d which included poetry installations at national parks.",
      "Sze wants to focus on a passion going back more than a half-century to his undergraduate years at the University of California, Berkeley \u2014 translation. He remembers reading some English-language editions of Chinese poetry, finding the work \u201cantiquated and dated\u201d and deciding to translate some of it himself, writing out the Chinese characters and engaging with them \u201con a much deeper level\u201d than he had expected. Besides his own poetry, he has published \u201cThe Silk Dragon: Translations from the Chinese.\u201d",
      "\u201cI personally learned my own craft of writing poetry through translating poetry,\u201d he says. \u201cI often think that people think of poetry as intimidating, or difficult, which isn\u2019t necessarily true. And I think one way to deepen the appreciation of poetry is to approach it through translation.\u201d",
      "Sze is a New York City native and son of Chinese immigrants who in such collections as \u201cSight Lines\u201d and \u201cCompass Rose\u201d explores themes of cultural and environmental diversity and what he calls \u201ccoexisting.\u201d In a given poem, he might shift from rocks above a pond to people begging in a subway, from a firing squad in China to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s plantation in Virginia. His many prizes include the National Book Award for \u201cSight Lines\u201d and such lifetime achievement honors as the Jackson Poetry Prize and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.",
      "He loves poetry from around the world but feels at home writing in English, if only for the \u201crichness of the vocabulary\u201d and the wonders of its origins.",
      "\u201cI was just looking at the word \u2018ketchup,\u2019 which started from southern China, went to Malaysia, was taken to England, where it became a tomato-based sauce, and then, of course, to America,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was just thinking days ago, that\u2019s a word we use every day without recognizing its ancestry, how it\u2019s crossed borders, how it\u2019s entered into the English language and enriched it.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "He co-wrote \u201cLast Train to Clarksville\" and \"I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone.\"",
      "NEW YORK -- Songwriter Bobby Hart, a key part of the Monkees' multimedia empire who teamed with Tommy Boyce on such hits as \u201cLast Train to Clarksville\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Not Your Steppin\u2019 Stone,\u201d has died. He was 86.",
      "Hart died at his home in Los Angeles, according to his friend and co-author, Glenn Ballantyne. He had been in poor health since breaking his hip last year.",
      "Boyce and Hart were a prolific and successful duo in the mid-1960s, especially for the Monkees, the made-for-television group promoted by Don Kirshner. They wrote the Monkees' theme song, with its opening shot, \"Here we come, walkin' down the street,\" and enduring chant, \"Hey, hey, we're the Monkees,\" and their first No. 1 hit, \u201cLast Train to Clarksville.\u201d The Monkees' eponymous, million-selling debut album included six songs from Boyce and Hart, who also served as producers and used their own backing musicians, the Candy Store Prophets, as session players.",
      "\"I always credit them not only with writing many of our biggest hits, but, as producers, being instrumental in creating the unique Monkee sound we all know and love,\" the Monkees' Micky Dolenz wrote in a foreword to Hart's memoir, \"Psychedelic Bubblegum,\" published in 2015.",
      "As Boyce and Hart grew in fame and the Monkees took more control of their work, they pursued their own careers, releasing the albums \"Test Patterns\" and \"I Wonder What She's Doing Tonite\" and appearing on such sitcoms as \"I Dream of Jeannie\" and \"Bewitched.\" They also were politically active. They campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy when he ran for president in 1968 and wrote the brassy \"L.U.V. (Let Us Vote)\" in support of the 26th Amendment, which in 1971 lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Their other songs included the Monkees' melancholy \"I Wanna Be Free\" and the theme to the daytime soap opera \"Days of Our Lives.\"",
      "They were covered by everyone from Dean Martin (\"Little Lovely One\") to the Sex Pistols (\"I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone\").",
      "In the 1970s and '80s, Hart managed several hits with other collaborators and even contributed material to another TV act, the Partridge Family. He worked with Austin Roberts on \"Over You,\" an Oscar-nominated ballad performed by Betty Buckley in \"Tender Mercies,\" and with Dick Eastman on \"My Secret (Didja Gitit Yet?)\" for New Edition. He and Bryce toured with Dolenz and fellow Monkee Davy Jones in the '70s, put out the album \"Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart\" and received renewed attention when the Monkees enjoyed a comeback in the 1980s.",

      "He was a minister's son, born Robert Luke Harshman in Phoenix, Arizona. In his memoir, he remembered himself as a shy kid with a \"strong desire to distinguish\" himself, as he wrote in \"Psychedelic Bubblegum.\" Music was the answer. By high school, he had learned piano, guitar and the Hammond B-3 organ. He also started his own amateur radio station, eventually adding a console, turntables and microphones. After graduating from high school and serving in the Army reserves, he settled in Los Angeles in the late 1950s, hoping first to become a disc jockey, but soon working as a songwriter and session musician. His name shortened to Bobby Hart, he toured as a member of Teddy Randazzo and the Dazzlers, and with Randazzo and Bobby Weinstein wrote \"Hurt So Bad,\" a hit for Little Anthony and the Imperials later covered by Linda Ronstadt.",
      "He also befriended Boyce, a singer and songwriter from Charlottesville, Virginia, with a \"very unusual personality, spontaneous and extroverted, yet very cool at the same time.\" Boyce and Hart helped write the top 10 hit \"Come a Little Bit Closer\" for Jay and the Americans and were a strong enough combination that Kirshner recruited them for his Screen Gems songwriting factory: They were assigned to the Monkees. Asked to come up with songs for a quartet openly modeled on the Beatles, they devised a twangy guitar line similar to the one for the \"Paperback Writer\" and wrote \"Last Train to Clarksville,\" a chart topper in 1966 based in part on Hart's mishearing of the Beatles hit (he thought Paul McCartney was singing \u201ctake the last train\u201d near the end; McCartney was singing \u201cpaperback writer\u201d).",
      "When Kirshner suggested a song with a girl's name in the title, they turned out \"Valleri\" and reached the top 5. For the show's theme song, a stroll outside was enough.",
      "\"Boyce began strumming his guitar and I joined in by snapping my fingers & making noises with my mouth that simulated an open & closed hi-hat cymbal,\" Hart wrote in his memoir. \"We had created the perfect recipe for inspiration and started singing about just what we were doing: 'Walkin' down the street.'\"",

      "Much like his inspiration for his runway show, the VIP guestlist was straight out of Hollywood. Whoopi Goldberg sat between Oprah and singer Lizzo. Front row celebrities cheered as longtime Siriano muse Coco Rocha opened the catwalk in her classic high powered supermodel strut, wearing a black-and-white stripe and polka dot organza blazer paired with a mini skirt and matching hat.",
      "For his spring 2026 collection, Siriano said he drew inspiration from actor Marlene Dietrich and how she played with both feminine and masculine styles.",
      "\u201cA lot of the collection is black-and-white, but a lot of texture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have this beautiful plaid sequin, polka dot, stripes ... that she\u2019s worn in her kind of repertoire of clothes and then we end in this idea of like, what if all of a sudden the film turned to color?\u201d",
      "Sticking with the old Hollywood glamour theme, models wore their hair in slick backed buns with one pin curl wave. In a modern twist, some models wore their structured blazers with only tights.",
      "From tailored blazers to voluminous bubble dresses, Siriano played with patterns and structure throughout his collection.",
      "Siriano relied on his color palette to transport attendees to the silver screen with black-and-white patterns from polka dots, stripes and plaid at the top of his show before transitioning his looks to Technicolor fabrics including a tiffany blue ball gown and a barbie pink deconstructed tuxedo dress.",
      "The show was a first for \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d star Natasha Rothwell. \u201cI want to spend an insane amount of money,\u201d she said after the show. \u201cFor my first fashion show, it was everything.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even something I could have dreamt as a possibility, and the fact that I'm getting to do it is, geez, one of the honors of my career,\u201d Scott told The Associated Press. Houston's voice is one that soundtracked his childhood \u2014 courtesy his mom \u2014 and he refers to Houston as one of the most influential performers in his life and the lives of many.",
      "\u201cTimeless,\u201d he describes her.",
      "Here's how the new song came into existence.",
      "Such an undertaking couldn't be possible without the approval of a number of parties. Specifically, it required Pat Houston, Whitney\u2019s sister-in-law and the executor of her estate, and Primary Wave, which acquired the copyrights to hit Whitney Houston songs as part of a 2022 deal.",
      "Pat Houston says the idea for Scott's \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d actually came from Primary Wave. They were familiar with Scott's live cover version of the song from his stint opening for Ed Sheeran in 2024. On that tour, Scott stripped the 1987 classic down into a ballad, blending it with Robyn's \u201cDancing On My Own.\u201d",
      "After hearing what Scott could do with the song \u2014 taking it from its up-tempo pop spirit to a big-hearted ballad, while also taking into consideration that 2025 marks the 40th anniversary of Houston's music career \u2014 Pat Houston was on board. It was yet another opportunity for celebration. \u201cI said, you know what, this is a no-brainer. This is the Houston style. So, let\u2019s go with this,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWhitney was a balladeer and that\u2019s why we all fell in love with her,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd Calum turned the song into a beautiful ballad.\u201d",
      "First, the Houston estate and Primary Wave provided Scott with the original vocal stems, produced by her longtime producer Narada Michael Walden. Then Scott recorded the song with producers Jon \u201cMAGS\u201d Maguire, Andrew Yeates and Charlie T in the U.K. in \u201cabout a week,\u201d he recalls. They were joined by a string section, which gave additional dimension to their somber take on the song.",
      "\u201cTake a pop song and make it sad,\u201d Scott jokes of his approach.",
      "Recording the ballad made sense because, as Scott points out, the lyrics to the original song are a bit melancholic. \u201cYou want to dance with somebody who loved you, you know, you're not actually dancing with them,\u201d he says. It's about yearning. But in an early demo, the chorus was recorded in a minor chord \u2014 which sounded a bit too depressing. The change was made swiftly; even slowed, the song needed some of that Houston ebullience.",

      "Another early decision: The new song would start with just Houston's voice, alone, in the first verse. \u201cWhitney starts the song because this is her song,\u201d Scott says simply. \u201cI would never dare stand in front of Whitney for that first verse.\u201d",
      "Eagle-eyed (eared?) fans might notice the sound of a snare drum bleeding into her vocal on that verse \u2014 because it was originally recorded to tape, not digitally, and because \u201cwe can\u2019t change anything like that because those are etched into the song and into her vocal,\u201d says Scott. \u201cAnd to remove it would be taking a piece away.\u201d",
      "It's one of the reasons they kept the song's iconic key change in the last chorus as well.",
      "\u201cI really had to dig for those high notes,\u201d he says of the recording. \u201cIt was an honor just to harmonize with her.\u201d",
      "Scott looked to the original songwriters for approval \u2014 the dream team of George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam. They were immediately on board.",
      "\u201cSome people would have come in and they would have added something ... to boost their visibility next to Whitney. And he had the boldness to tear it all down and just have acoustic piano, just Whitney, and then give her the first verse,\u201d said Merrill. \u201cAnd I mean, this is his project. To me, that\u2019s showing such respect.\u201d",
      "That, and they recognize Scott as a virtuosic vocalist. \u201cHis music really features his voice, as with Adele or Whitney, and rightly so because he can carry it off,\u201d said Rubicam. \u201cThere aren\u2019t just hundreds of people who can carry that off with his kind of power.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a good vocal match together,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey both got a lot of emotionality and command also of their vocal instrument. ... Whitney could overpower a lot of people. But for Calum, he\u2019s confident and he had a vision about it and they both are meeting at an emotional level.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like I gently walked alongside Whitney,\u201d says Scott. The song is meant to feel alive, channeling the spirit of Houston \u2014 not a tribute, but an active single. It's why their version of \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d will be featured on his new album \u201cAvenoir,\u201d out Oct. 10.",
      "\u201cThis is as much part of my story as any other song on the album,\u201d he says. \u201cJust being given the honor of it has been, you know, I could die a very happy man now.\u201d",
      "\u201cForty years ago, this particular song was hot then and it\u2019s hot now,\u201d says Pat Houston. \u201cSo why not keep producing. But it\u2019s the right connection, it's the right platform and it certainly is the right artist to collab with her on this.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Ellie Potts goes dancing with her friends most weeks. They don\u2019t put on the latest Taylor Swift or Ed Sheeran, though \u2014 they much prefer English country dances that were popular more than 200 years ago.",
      "As the music starts, about two dozen men and women curtsy and bow, extend a gloved hand to their partner, before dancing in circles or skipping in elaborate patterns around each other.",
      "Like many of her fellow Hampshire Regency Dancers, Potts is a devotee of Jane Austen and all things from the Regency period.

      "The highlight is a Regency costumed promenade on Saturday, where some 2,000 people in their finest bonnets, bows and costumes will parade through the streets of Bath. Organizers say the extravaganza holds the Guinness World Record for the \u201clargest gathering of people dressed in Regency costumes.\u201d",
      "Bonny Wise, from Indiana, is attending her sixth Jane Austen festival in Bath. This time she\u2019s bringing four period dresses she made, and will lead a tour group of 25 Austen enthusiasts from all over the United States.",
      "\u201cI started planning a tour four years ago, when I realized this was a big year for Jane,\u201d said Wise, 69. She credited the 1995 adaptation of \u201cSense and Sensibility\u201d with sparking her obsession.",
      "\u201cThat movie just opened up a whole new world for me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start with the books, the movies, then you start getting into the hats, the tea, the manners \u2026 one thing just led to another.\u201d",

      "Ed Sheeran has long sought to bring people together with his music, whether it be his emotionally resonant acoustic ballads or unproblematic, danceable pop hits",
      "NEW YORK -- Ed Sheeran has long sought to bring people together with his music, whether it be his emotionally resonant acoustic ballads or unproblematic, danceable pop hits. \u201cPlay,\u201d his eighth studio album out Friday, stays in that familiar lane for the most part.",
      "In his quest, Sheeran has maintained an everyman quality by carefully evolving with the status quo (while, largely, removing himself from public discourse, save his copyright court win and more recent promotional pop-ups in everyman places, like a New York City ice cream shop just this week). The aesthetic of Ed Sheeran, global star, still matches that of Ed Sheeran, up-and-coming troubadour. Most of the time, it's still just Sheeran, his guitar and his loop pedal against the world.",
      "Of course, Sheeran, like most pop stars, knows that as his stardom has risen and his audience widened, the meaning of that relatability has shifted. His listeners, over a decade in, know that too. So \u201cPlay,\u201d the first project in a new series from Sheeran named for symbols (he's said \u201cRewind\u201d will be next), uses Sheeran's global acclaim to his advantage \u2014 without straying too far from his singer-songwriter roots.",
      "Recorded throughout his \u201cMathematics World Tour\u201d and finished in Goa, India, the project feels split. There are moments that herald the return of Sheeran the hitmaker, an exciting development after his last two albums \u2014 the final chapter of his mathematics series, \u201cSubtract,\u201d and the folk-pop \u201cAutumn Variations\u201d \u2014 were well received but failed to produce the kind of chart-toppers that created Sheeran, the megastar. Most tracks, however, fall more in line with those albums, deviating little from the narrative songwriting toolkit that raised Sheeran, the artist.",
      "Sheeran turned to new collaborators for a couple songs that are already established hits. The addictive \u201cSapphire\u201d features Indian singer Arijit Singh, who ranks among Spotify's most popular artists globally. A Farsi version of the single \u201cAzizam,\u201d written and produced with Ilya Salmanzadeh, Savan Kotecha and Johnny McDaid, was released in April featuring Iranian singer Googoosh. Sheeran isn't just eyeing the U.S. and U.K. charts here \u2014 he's playing for cross-cultural domination, and having fun while doing it.",
      "The rest of the tracks, those that feel more classically Sheeran, see old themes recycled: \u201cOld Phone\u201d provides him the space to remember old friends and reminisce about his changing personal life, just as the landscape in 2017's \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d provided a tangible marker of memory. The conceit of the sappily sweet \u201cCamera\u201d \u2014 \u201cI don't need a camera to capture this moment\u201d \u2014 comes in conflict with that of Sheeran's own beloved \u201cPhotograph\u201d from 2014's \u201cMultiply.\u201d",
      "There are still moments that feel like they'll stick: Sheeran's ode to his daughters, \u201cFor Always,\u201d with cooing backing vocals from co-writer Amy Allen, is sure to be a favorite father-daughter dance track, right behind the groovy \u201cThe Vow\u201d on wedding playlists.",
      "Sheeran flexes his pen on \u201cOpening,\u201d the album's first track. Bounded by glittery verses about boundaries, he raps about his family, his mental health, that court case, fame and what comes next. \u201cBeen a long time up top but I ain\u2019t complacent/If I look down I can see replacements,\u201d he raps at one point. \u201cGotta make dreams and chase them.\u201d",
      "Sheeran wants to be for everyone. And to do that, he'll still be an everyman.",

      "Real moviegoer energy has always made the Toronto International Film Festival a good measuring stick for not just what might catch on during Hollywood\u2019s awards season but what will click with audiences",
      "TORONTO -- Anyone will tell you it\u2019s the audiences that make the Toronto International Film Festival. They aren\u2019t purely industry folks, like they are in Cannes or Venice, but more boisterous, enthusiastic moviegoers with their own rituals, like growling like buccaneers at the piracy warning that plays before each screening.",
      "That real-moviegoer energy has always made TIFF a good measuring stick for not just what might catch on during Hollywood\u2019s awards season, but also what will click with audiences. Yet there might be no more endangered species in today\u2019s film industry than the kind of crowd-pleaser that thrives in Toronto.",
      "More than most years, this year\u2019s festival, which wraps up this weekend, has been a veritable ark for the castaways of today\u2019s Hollywood: star-driven dramas, big-screen comedies, adult-oriented movies without a whiff of franchise about them. All struggled to reach the screen in the first place. But for many of these movies, the fight to reach audiences is just getting started.",
      "One of the standouts was Derek Cianfrance\u2019s \u201cRoofman,\u201d a stranger-than-fiction true tale about a North Carolina man (Channing Tatum) imprisoned for robbing dozens of McDonald's by burrowing in from their roofs. He escapes prison and, instead of trying to outrun the authorities, hides out for weeks inside a Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. Cianfrance, the grittily realistic filmmaker of \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d and \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines,\u201d uses the story as a funny and oddly moving examination of box-store materialism. Paramount will release it Oct. 10.",
      "\u201cWhen I was shopping it around, a lot of people were saying, \u2018We don\u2019t make movies like this anymore,\u2019\u201d Cianfrance said. \u201cSo it\u2019s really hard. It\u2019s one of the reasons why there are so many production credits on the front of the movie. I had to get it from everywhere to be able to do it.\u201d",
      "The movie industry is coming off a summer that fell painfully shy of expectations. May-to-Labor Day ticket sales at the North American box office came to about $3.67 billion, according to Comscore, well short of the $4 billion-plus season that was once automatic. You could point to numerous reasons for that, like the diminished potency of superhero films or that Sony Pictures Animation\u2019s \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d the biggest hit of the summer, launched on Netflix, not in theaters.",
      "But it\u2019s also true that Hollywood, mostly concerned with hitting home runs, is badly in need of some doubles, too.",
      "This year\u2019s TIFF was full of good candidates, though some of them will be steered toward streaming platforms. That includes Rian Johnson\u2019s deliciously gothic, surprisingly sincere, church-set whodunit \u201cWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery,\u201d which Netflix will give a two-week theatrical release despite its director\u2019s strong affinity for theaters.",
      "And Paul Greengrass\u2019 \u201cThe Lost Bus,\u201d a disaster movie for the age of climate change, will likewise get a quick two weeks in theaters before landing on Apple TV+. Starring Matthew McConaughey as a bus driver rescuing kids during the 2018 Camp Fire, Greengrass' film viscerally captures the swift-spreading blaze, as well as the dry, tinderbox landscape it rose out of.",
      "But even a brief theatrical run can be hard-won. Nia DaCosta\u2019s \u201cHedda,\u201d a stylish 1950s-set Ibsen adaptation starring Tessa Thompson, will launch in theaters Oct. 22 before detouring to Prime Video a week later.",
      "\u201cLiterally three months after it was greenlit, people were like: This movie wouldn\u2019t happen anymore,\u201d DaCosta said. \u201cWe were with Orion Pictures, a full theatrical release, and then the strikes happened. We were holding. We had to fight for the movie to stay alive. We lived but the consequence of that was theatrical window and then Prime Video. We did feel that industry shift. But I\u2019m really proud we got to make it.\u201d",

      "\u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which Lionsgate will release Oct. 17, is a little clunky at times, but its satire of the gig economy isn\u2019t off target, nor is Keanu Reeves\u2019 performance as a sweet but mistake-prone angel. Ansari plays a man driven to homelessness whose not-official guardian angel (Reeves), overstepping his bounds, swaps his life with that of a much wealthier man (Seth Rogen).",
      "It was one of two movies at TIFF trying for a throwback kind of high-concept comedy.

But tastes are always changing. Donna Langley, chief of Universal Pictures, noted as much in her talk at the festival.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the shift in horror,\u201d said Langley, who pointed to \u201cauteur directors turning to horror.\u201d \"It\u2019s not the horror as we came to know over the last decade.\u201d",
      "Fate, like it does in \u201cEternity\u201d and \u201cGood Fortune,\u201d will soon have its say for this year's crop of crowd pleasers in search of ticket-buying crowds. Some signs are ominous. Last year\u2019s winner of the festival\u2019s People's Choice Award \u2014 the most watched honor of TIFF and usually a signal of a surefire best-picture nomination \u2014 went to the Stephen King adaptation \u201cThe Life of Chuck.\u201d Mike Flanagan's film didn\u2019t have distribution at the time, and when Neon ultimately released it in June, \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d went mostly unnoticed. It was a reminder that success in Toronto no longer guarantees anything.",
      "Some are taking distribution into their own hands. Black Bear Pictures, the production company behind last year\u2019s \u201cSing Sing,\u201d announced that it will distribute one of the buzziest TIFF entries: David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s \u201cChristy,\u201d starring Sydney Sweeney as the boxer Christy Martin. Black Bear co-financed \u201cChristy,\u201d just as it did two other highlights of TIFF: Clint Bentley\u2019s Denis Johnson adaptation \u201cTrain Dreams,\u201d a hit at Sundance, and Daniel Roher\u2019s \u201cTuner.\u201d",
      "\u201cTuner,\u201d which played without distribution in place, stars Leo Woodall (\u201cThe White Lotus\u201d) as a piano tuner with a pitch-perfect ear who, after his father-figure partner (Dustin Hoffman) falls ill, uses his gift to crack open safes. It's a crackling crime thriller, and \u2014 like so many of the movies at TIFF \u2014 the kind of movie that supposedly doesn't get made anymore. And yet movies like \u201cTuner\u201d do get made, somehow, and will keep finding a way to do so, so long as audiences show up for them.",
      "\u201cSomeone wrote, \u2018This movie-movies really hard,\u2019\u201d Roher said at the premiere, citing a review. \u201cI was like: That\u2019s right. That was the intention.\u201d",

      "Julian Fellowes has been saying goodbye to \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d for nearly as long as it has existed. By the fifth season of the series, he\u2019d even grown accustomed to writing more definitive endings, not knowing that there would be a sixth season and three feature films to come.",
      "But 15 years after the world first met Violet Crawley, Lord Grantham, Lady Mary, Mr. Carson, John Bates and everyone else upstairs and downstairs at that beautiful estate, the creators are really, truly closing a chapter and saying farewell with \u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale,\u201d which opens in theaters nationwide Friday.",
      "\u201cIt is sad,\u201d Fellowes said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s been a huge chunk of my life. And when I die, I think it\u2019ll probably be the only job anyone remembers. But I hope it\u2019s been happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d which was conceived by producer Gareth Neame as a kind of spinoff to \u201cGosford Park,\u201d was in many ways an improbable hit. In an era of television that celebrated difficult men and antiheroes, here was a warm British period drama about aristocrats and their household staff that became a global phenomenon and, later, a successful film franchise. The first two features, released in 2019 and 2022, grossed more than $287 million at the worldwide box office.",
      "\u201cNone of us knew it was going to be a success,\u201d said actor Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Grantham. \u201cI remember Gareth saying to me, \u2018Let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s not going to run beyond seven episodes, these sorts of shows don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d",
      "But audiences never seemed to tire of the Downton crew. The longer it went on, the more it became part of the furniture.",
      "\u201cIt has been this remarkable journey,\u201d Neame said. \u201cWe look at the Grantham family, the Crawleys, as a representative of the families that we all live in because we\u2019ve seen them marry and have children and pass away and get money and lose money and become sick and get well again, hopefully. There\u2019s something extremely comforting about that.\u201d",
      "Despite the success of the show, which ended in 2015, a feature film was never a given. From a studio perspective, Neame said, there were very few precedents and the ones that existed were not positive. Money always seemed to be lost. But the bigger headache was the idea that even if they got the greenlight to make a film, they\u2019d have to assemble more than 20 specific actors to do it. And they needed every one.",
      "\u201cWe said goodbye when we finished the TV show and didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever come back,\u201d Bonneville said. \u201cI said, it\u2019s like herding cats, he\u2019ll never get us together again. And, blow me down, he did, not once but three times.\u201d",
      "They were difficult negotiations, Neame said, and much more complicated than anyone might imagine, but there was still such goodwill that they made it work. Especially for this last film, he said, \u201ceveryone wanted to give it a proper conclusion and see an ending for all of those characters.\u201d",
      "In the first film, the family prepared for a visit from the king and the queen. In the second, they traveled to the South of France and said goodbye to the Dowager, Maggie Smith's sharp, beloved matriarch who had been with the show from the beginning and was a large part of the reason it even got made. There were many farewell parties for her on set. Then, two years after the film was released, Smith died at 89.",

      "\u201cJaws\u201d is the subject of the first ever large-scale exhibit devoted to a single film at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Why would anyone keep a prop from the set of \u201cJaws?\u201d",
      "Steven Spielberg was musing about what it felt like while making his 1975 oceanic classic, and how little he thought any of it would matter when shooting the now-legendary opening scene of a woman night-swimming past an ocean buoy. His primary concern was keeping his job as a 26-year-old director amid unfolding disasters.",
      "\u201cHow did anybody know to take the buoy and take it home and sit on it for 50 years?\u201d he said.",
      "That prop is among the first things visitors will see as they enter a 50th anniversary \u201cJaws\u201d exhibit opening Sunday and running through July at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures.",
      "The exhibition featuring more than 200 pieces from the culture-changing blockbuster is the first full show in the four-year history of the museum that is dedicated to a single film. It comes amid a bevy of celebrations of the film's five-decade life, including a theatrical re-release last week.",
      "Spielberg spoke to a gathering of media at the museum after touring the exhibit, which takes visitors chronologically through the film's three acts, with some relic or recreation from virtually every scene.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just so proud of the work they\u2019ve done,\u201d the 78-year-old said. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve put together here at this exhibition is just awesome. Every room has the minutiae of how this picture got together.\u201d",
      "\u201cClearly this is a very historic initiative for us,\u201d museum director Amy Homma said before introducing the director and also announced the museum plans a full Spielberg retrospective in 2028.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d has been essential to the Academy Museum, which opened in 2021 and is operated by the organization that gives out the Oscars.",
      "The only surviving full-scale mechanical shark from the production, 25 feet in length and nicknamed \u201cBruce\u201d by Spielberg after his lawyer, has permanently hung over the escalators since it opened.",
      "Homma said Bruce has become an \u201cunofficial mascot\u201d that \u201chelped to define this museum.\u201d",
      "The media preview was accompanied by a 68-piece orchestra playing John Williams\u2019 score. Two of the musicians played on the original.",
      "The exhibit includes a keyboard with instructions on how to play Williams' famously ominous two-note refrain that a generation of children learned to tap out on the piano.",
      "Similar novelties include a dolly-zoom setup to which visitors can attach their phone and shoot their own face to recreate perhaps the film\u2019s most famous shot, the zoom-in to star Roy Scheider\u2019s frightened gaze on the beach in the fictional town of Amity.",

      "But it's the real stuff from the production that really makes the show, with relics from both sides of the camera.",
      "There's that buoy initially kept by Lynn Murphy, a marine mechanic who worked on the film who lived in Martha's Vineyard where the film was shot, before selling it to a collector in 1988.",
      "And there is a dorsal fin prop that struck terror in beachgoers in the film and moviegoers in the theater, and a real great white shark's jaw used for reference by the filmmakers that also appeared on screen.",
      "Film geeks can get a close look at the aquatic cameras used by cinematographer Bill Butler and his team, and a Moviola used by editor Verna Fields. And they can get a play-by-play of the processes of casting director Shari Rhodes and a team of screenwriters that included Peter Benchley, author of the novel.",
      "Spielberg said for him the exhibition above all \u201cproves that this motion picture industry is really truly a collaborative art form. No place for auteurs.\u201d",
      "He said the crew's camaraderie was the only thing that kept the production together.",
      "Their making of the riveting film was oddly enough marked mostly by boredom \u2014 endless waits because of unfavorable conditions, unwanted ships in the background and broken down equipment that led to the shoot going 100 days over schedule.",
      "\u201cI just really was not ready to endure the amount of obstacles that were thrown in our path, starting with Mother Nature,\u201d Spielberg said. \u201cMy hubris was we could take a Hollywood crew and go out 12 miles into the Atlantic Ocean and shoot an entire movie with a mechanical shark.

      "The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday posted more than 100 letters to various drug and online prescribing companies, including Hims & Hers, which has built a multibillion-dollar business centered around lower-cost versions of blockbuster obesity injections.",
      "The FDA warned the company to remove \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d promotional statements from its website, including language claiming that its customized products contain \u201cthe same active ingredient\u201d as FDA-approved drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. The formulations cited by regulators are produced by specialty compounding pharmacies and aren't reviewed by the FDA.",
      "\u201cYour claims imply that your products are the same as an FDA-approved product when they are not,\u201d states the warning letter, dated Sept. 9.",
      "San Francisco-based Hims said Tuesday that it \u201clooks forward to engaging with the FDA.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur website and our customer-facing materials note that compounded treatments are not approved or evaluated by the FDA,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "It\u2019s the first FDA attempt to directly police online platforms like Hims, which have long argued they\u2019re not subject to traditional drug advertising rules.",
      "A memo signed by President Donald Trump last week directed Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the FDA to ensure that pharmaceutical ads on TV, social media and other websites are \u201ctruthful and non-misleading.\u201d As part of the initiative, the FDA promised to send 100 letters to companies with deceptive ads.",
      "The new FDA letters each contain \u201ccease and desist\u201d language. That\u2019s a different approach for the agency, which typically drafts its letters in highly bureaucratic language citing specific FDA regulations.",
      "Hims has been under scrutiny from Washington for months.",
      "Earlier this year, a Super Bowl ad from the company touted the benefits of its weight-loss medications but didn't list any of their side effects or potential harms. FDA rules require advertisements to present a balanced picture of drug risks and benefits.",
      "Makary singled out the ad in last week\u2019s Journal of the American Medical Association, calling it a \u201cbrazen\u201d example of how advertising is \u201ccontributing to America\u2019s culture of overreliance on pharmaceuticals for health.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee meets this week, with votes expected on whether to change recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B and chickenpox.",
      "The exact questions to be voted on Thursday and Friday in Atlanta are unclear. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to questions seeking details to a newly posted agenda, although the department announced five additional appointments to the committee Monday.",
      "Some public health experts are worried that the votes will \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 raise unwarranted new questions about vaccines in the minds of parents.",
      "Perhaps even more consequential would be a vote that restricts a government program from paying for vaccines for low-income families.",
      "\u201cI'm tightening my seat belt,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert.",
      "The panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors have almost always accepted those recommendations, which are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading antivaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices.",

      "Before Kennedy was health secretary, ACIP would typically vote in June to reaffirm recommendations for shots against respiratory viruses that sicken millions of Americans each fall and winter.",
      "This past June, Kennedy's ACIP voted to recommend flu shots for Americans but was silent on COVID-19 shots.",
      "Before that meeting, Kennedy announced he was removing COVID-19 shots from the CDC's recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women. The move was heavily criticized by doctors' groups and public health organizations, and prompted a lawsuit by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups.",
      "Days after Kennedy's announcement, CDC officials said families could still get the 2024-2025 version of COVID-19 shots for their kids in consultation with their doctors. That clarification meant shots would still be covered by the federal government's Vaccines For Children program, which pays for shots for families who lack money or adequate health insurance coverage. It's now responsible for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.",
      "As with flu shots, however, there are new COVID-19 formulations each fall, to account for changes in which strains are circulating. The committee has not yet voted on whether to recommend this season's COVID-19 shots or whether those shots should be covered by the VFC program.",
      "Further complicating the picture: When the FDA last month licensed this fall's COVID-19 shots, the agency took the unusual step of narrowing their use for healthy younger adults and children.",
      "If the ACIP simply follows that, and if there is no additional clarifying language from the CDC, then \u201cthat would take away access for roughly half of America\u2019s kids,\u201d said Dr. Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "The pediatricians group urges that vaccinations continue for all children ages 6 months to 2 years.",
      "Hepatitis B can cause serious liver infections. In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during use injection-drug use.",
      "But the virus also can be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections.",
      "A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).",
      "Infant vaccinations are stressed for women who have hepatitis B or, crucially, who have not been tested for it. The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.",
      "Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are considered a success, and no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problem with giving kids the shots on their first day of life, Schaffner said.",

      "In 2005, a combination MMRV shot \u2014 measles, mumps, rubella and varicella \u2014 was licensed. The CDC initially recommended that doctors and parents use the combo shot over separate MMR and varicella injections.",

      "DayJahiah Valdivia, a senior at K\u012bhei Charter School, said her stress levels spike when there are strong winds or small brush fires. Valdivia lives in Upcountry Maui, which also faced wildfires that burned over a thousand acres of land on the same day as the 2023 Lahaina fires. Her home was spared, but it took months for her family to return because their property was covered in soot and needed professional cleaning.",
      "She feels less anxious now that her family members have discussed their escape plan for future disasters. But a summer fire near a friend\u2019s home in Central Maui renewed her fears about her loved ones\u2019 safety.",

      "In a University of Hawaii study of fire survivors conducted in 2024, just over half of children reported symptoms of depression, and 30% were likely facing an anxiety disorder. Nearly half of kids in the study, ages 10 to 17, were experiencing PTSD.",

Both Lahaina and Paradise had housing shortages after their fires, so families had to move away or live with friends to go to school or work in the area. In general, students who don\u2019t have a permanent living arrangement tend to struggle more academically and have more behavioral challenges, research shows.",
      "Many Paradise students still struggle with anxiety and grief, seven years later, making it difficult to fully engage in school. A year after the Camp Fire, 17% of students were homeless, and the suspension rate was 7.4%, compared to 2.5% statewide. The suspension rate remained nearly triple the state average last year, and more than 26% were chronically absent.",
      "Aryah Berkowitz, who lost her home, two dogs and her family\u2019s business in the Paradise blaze, dealt with lingering behavioral challenges following the disaster.

      "Maui has long dealt with medical workforce challenges. Even before the fires, it faced a shortage of mental health professionals because they struggled with the state\u2019s high cost of living and housing shortage.",
      "The fires brought burnout and greater economic obstacles, only exacerbating the issue. Since then, Hawaii\u2019s education department has tried to bulk up Maui\u2019s mental health staff by bringing in providers from neighbor islands and the mainland and, more recently, using a $2 million federal grant to support students.",
      "But hiring mental health staff has been so difficult that even the federal money hasn\u2019t made much of a dent. In the first nine months of the grant, the state education department primarily used the money to bus displaced students from other parts of the island to Lahaina schools.",
      "The state has used the money to hire five part-time mental health providers working with students and staff, including one specialist who works in the evenings with students living as boarders on Lahainaluna\u2019s campus, said Kimberly Lessard, a Department of Education district specialist.",
      "Two of the six behavioral health specialist positions in Lahaina schools remained unfilled this summer, as they have been for years due to Maui\u2019s housing shortage and high cost of living, Lessard said.",
      "Valdivia, who still struggles with anxiety from the Upcountry Maui fires, has seen the impacts of the provider shortage firsthand. She\u2019s on a two- to three-month waiting list to see a psychiatrist on Maui, and she\u2019s seeing an O\u02bbahu-based therapist via telehealth because there aren\u2019t enough providers who can meet with her in person.",

      "Lapow founded the Maui Hero Project, which his website describes as \u201cadventure-based counseling services.\u201d The eight-week program Lapow started 25 years ago teaches teens basic disaster preparedness skills and immerses them in outdoor activities. It's also a form of mental health support, which Lapow has leaned into since the wildfires.",
      "Lapow\u2019s approach has become a common strategy for nonprofits and therapists trying to reach kids who have balked at discussing their mental health since the fires. But those efforts don't always reach the kids who need the most help.",
      "There\u2019s a strong stigma around seeking mental health services, particularly in Filipino and Latino communities that make up a large portion of Lahaina\u2019s population, said Ruben Juarez, a professor at University of Hawaii who led the research study on fire survivors. Families may see counseling as a sign of weakness, and children may be reluctant to open up to therapists out of fear of being judged or scrutinized, he added.",

      "A major concern has been the impact of recent U.S. funding cuts. The U.S. had supported the response to Congo\u2019s past Ebola outbreaks, including in 2021 when the U.S. Agency for International Development provided up to $11.5 million to support efforts across Africa.",

      "A new study finds well-preserved areas of Amazon rainforest occupied and managed by Indigenous peoples show lower incidences of multiple diseases in the regions around them",
      "Every time humans cut into the Amazon rainforest or burn or destroy parts of it, they're making people sick.",
      "It's an idea Indigenous people have lived by for thousands of years. Now a new study in the journal Communications Earth & Environment adds to the scientific evidence supporting it, by finding that instances of several diseases were lowered in areas where forest was set aside for Indigenous peoples who maintained it well.",
      "With the United Nations climate summit set for Brazil in November, the study authors and outside experts said the work highlights the stakes for people around the world as negotiators try to address climate change. Belem, the city hosting the conference, is known as the gateway to the Amazon, and many who will be attending, from activists to delegates, think the role of Indigenous communities in climate action and conservation will be highlighted in a distinct way.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018forest man\u2019 or \u2018man forest,\u2019 according to the Indigenous perspective, has always been linked to the reciprocity between human health and the natural environment where one lives,\u201d said Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez Cayetano, president of the Federation of Ticuna and Yagua Communities of the Lower Amazon, or FECOTYBA, in the Peruvian Amazon. \u201cIf each state does not guarantee the rights and territories of Indigenous peoples, we would inevitably be harming their health, their lives, and the ecosystem itself.\u201d",
      "That harm can look like respiratory diseases such as asthma caused by toxic air pollution after fires, or illnesses that spread from animals to humans such as malaria, said Paula Prist, a senior program coordinator for the Forest and Grasslands Unit at the International Union for Conservation of Nature and one of the study authors.",
      "The researchers compiled and analyzed data on forest quality, legal recognition of Indigenous territory and disease incidence in the countries that border and include the Amazon.",
      "The work was \u201cimpressive\u201d to University of Washington health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi. She said it highlighted the complexity of factors that affect human health, and the importance of understanding the role Indigenous communities play in shaping it. \u201cUsing these methods, others could study other parts of the world,\u201d she said.",
      "The researchers found creative ways to account for other variables that can affect the spread of diseases, like access to health care in a given area, said Magdalena Hurtado, an anthropology and global health professor at Arizona State University and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences who was not involved with the study. But she expressed concern that the findings were presented with a precision that may not be warranted, given that they were based on correlation and use data on observations that can be difficult to measure.",
      "\u201cThey claim that Indigenous territories only protect health when forest cover is above 40%. And so that that feels like, why 40%? Why not 35? Or why not a range?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the study is wrong, but it means that we need to be cautious because the patterns could change if different, more precise methods were used.\u201d",
      "Still, she thinks this is a starting point that could open the door to future research. \u201cThey are actually doing something quite beautiful,\u201d empirically connecting the legal recognition of Indigenous lands to human health outcomes, she said.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, of FECOTYBA, said that's important for the global policymakers who are coming to Brazil.",
      "\u201cFrom my Indigenous perspective, I think that this type of study would make our ancestral knowledge more visible and precise,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is willing to risk a government shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accept Democratic demands on health care",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer weathered backlash from Democrats earlier this year when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. But he\u2019s now willing to risk a shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accede to Democratic demands.",
      "Schumer says he and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries are united in opposing any legislation that doesn\u2019t include key health care provisions and a commitment not to roll them back. He argues that the country is in a different place than it was in March, when he vigorously argued against a shutdown, and he says he believes Republicans and President Donald Trump will be held responsible if they don\u2019t negotiate a bipartisan deal.",
      "\u201cThings have changed\u201d since the March vote, Schumer said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. He said Republicans have since passed Trump\u2019s massive tax breaks and spending cuts legislation, which trimmed Medicaid and other government programs, and Democrats are now unified \u2014 unlike in March, when he voted with Republicans and Jeffries voted against legislation to fund the government.",
      "A shutdown, Schumer said, wouldn\u2019t necessarily worsen an environment in which Trump is already challenging the authority of Congress. \u201cIt will get worse with or without it, because Trump is lawless,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Schumer\u2019s threat comes as Republicans are considering a short-term stopgap spending measure to avoid a Sept. 30 shutdown and as Democrats face what most see as two tough choices if the parties can\u2019t negotiate a deal \u2014 vote with Republicans to keep the government open or let it close indefinitely with no clear exit plan.",
      "It also comes amid worsening partisan tensions in the Senate, where negotiations between the two parties over the confirmation process broke down for a second time Thursday and Republicans are changing Senate rules to get around Democratic objections. Democrats are also fuming over the Trump administration\u2019s decision to unilaterally claw back $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid just as negotiations over the spending deadline were getting underway in late August.",
      "Republicans have said that Democrats clearly will be to blame if they don\u2019t vote to keep the government open, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has repeatedly said that Schumer needs to come to them with a specific proposal on health care, including an extension of expanded government tax credits for many Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans are open to extending those credits before they expire at the end of the year.",

      "Schumer said Democrats also want Republicans to commit that the White House won\u2019t take back money they have negotiated and Congress has approved after Republicans pushed through a $9 billion cut requested by the White House in July and Trump blocked the additional foreign aid money in August. \u201cHow do you pass an appropriations bill and let them undo it down the road?\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Schumer\u2019s move to support the spending legislation in March put him in the rare position of bucking his party\u2019s base. He said then that of two bad options, a partial government shutdown was worse because it would give Trump even more control to shut down agencies and there would be \u201cno off-ramp\u201d to get out of it. \u201cI think people realize it\u2019s a tough choice,\u201d he said.",
      "He faced massive backlash from within the party after the vote, with some activists calling on him to resign. Jeffries temporarily distanced himself from his New York colleague, saying in a statement immediately after Schumer\u2019s vote that House Democrats \u201cwill not be complicit.\u201d The majority of Senate Democrats also voted against the plan.",
      "This time, though, Schumer is in lockstep with Jeffries and in messaging within his caucus. In Democrats\u2019 closed-door lunch Wednesday, he shared polling that he said suggested most Americans would blame Trump, not Democrats, for a shutdown.",
      "\u201cI did what I thought was right\u201d in March, Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different situation now than then.\u201d",

      "The government released guidelines on how platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram should apply the world's first ban on children using social media from Dec. 10. It says verifying the ages of all account holders would be unreasonable.",
      "\u201cWe think it would be unreasonable if platforms reverified everyone\u2019s age,\u201d said Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, who drafted the guidelines. Her use of the word \u201creverified\" suggested the platforms usually already had sufficient data to verify a user was older than 16.",

      "Behind him, six more macaws waited inside wooden boxes strapped to the passenger seat, ready for their training. Ramli was on his way to join fellow macaw enthusiasts from the surrounding area, turning a vacant lot into a lively gathering place for both birds and their keepers.",
      "On the training field, the 33-year-old Ramli taught the birds to fly and return within three minutes when he blew his whistle, in preparation for a competition of obedience and cohesiveness among birds within the group.",
      "Ramli\u2019s passion for birds began in 2018 when he kept small parakeets, but soon he dreamed of caring for larger, more elegant species like macaws. Inspired by videos on social media showing birds returning faithfully to their trainers after flying freely, the 33-year-old decided to leave his job as a motorcycle mechanic to focus on this new path.",
      "That dream became a reality in 2020, when an exotic bird owner entrusted him with Zoro, a striking Blue and Gold macaw. Zoro was the first macaw Ramli trained, and the bond they built was the start of his journey into the life of the charismatic parrots that are native to South America.",
      "Today, Ramli keeps 18 of them in an adjacent part of his home, where he lives with his small family in a rural area of southern Jakarta. It is almost like running a school for macaws.",
      "Each bird has a name and a personality he knows well.",
      "There is Lexus, a Shamrock macaw with a bright red crown, and Wel, a Shamlet macaw marked by vivid orange on its head. They are just two among the hybrid species under his care.",

      "\u201cThese animals are no different from humans. Some are quicker to understand what we command, while others take a while to catch on,\u201d Ramli said.",
      "He has never set a specific price for caring for and training the birds, and only accepts what the macaw owners are willing to give him.",
      "With the help of two friends, he has participated in a number of competitions in the Greater Jakarta area. He does it not only to win prizes, but also to show the results of his daily care and training.",
      "\u201cI really love birds. It is like I have a special affection for them. And then there is another thing. I am proud to take care of the expensive birds, which is quite an amount of money that I probably couldn\u2019t afford otherwise,\u201d Ramli said.",

      "BLANTYRE, Malawi -- Malawi began counting votes Tuesday in a presidential election that's expected to be a tight race between two old rivals that could go to a runoff and comes at a time of economic turmoil in one of the world\u2019s least-developed countries.",
      "Voters faced a choice between giving President Lazarus Chakwera, 70, a second term or selecting another leader to solve the southern African nation\u2019s soaring inflation, cost-of-living crisis and critical fuel shortages.",
      "Among the 16 other candidates, former President Peter Mutharika, 85, is viewed as a strong challenger to return as leader.",
      "The two rivals faced off in 2019, when Mutharika's victory as the incumbent over challenger Chakwera was nullified by a court because of widespread irregularities. Chakwera won an historic rerun of that vote in 2020.",
      "While Chakwera\u2019s election was greeted with an outpouring of public support, the national mood has changed after five hard years for a largely rural country that already had high levels of poverty.",
      "Polls closed in Tuesday's one-day vote and counting began by late afternoon, according to election officials. By law the results must be announced within a week. Voters will also choose the makeup of Parliament and more than 500 local government representatives.",

      "Since then, inflation has surged from around 8% to 27% under Chakwera and there are critical shortages of fuel and sugar. Long lines at gas stations have become part of daily life, while stark price increases have meant everyday food items like the staple corn have become unaffordable for many.",

Dozens of his supporters showed up to his last hearing, many wearing the Luigi video game character\u2019s green color as a symbol of solidarity. His April arraignment in the federal case drew a similar outpouring.",
      "If Judge Gregory Carro permits the state case to go forward, Mangione\u2019s lawyers have said they want him to dismiss terrorism charges and bar prosecutors from using evidence collected during Mangione\u2019s arrest last December, including a 9 mm handgun and a notebook in which authorities say he described his intent to \u201cwack\u201d an insurance executive.",

      "Mangione has pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism, in the Dec. 4, 2024, killing. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind as he arrived for an investor conference at the New York Hilton Midtown. Police say \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase commonly used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.",

      "Rivian Automotive is starting to build a long-delayed electric vehicle plant in Georgia, despite tough challenges in the U.S. market",
      "ATLANTA -- It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they're confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.",
      "The money-losing California-based company breaks ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump\u2019s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.",
      "Rivian Chief Policy Officer Alan Hoffman said the company believes it can sell electric vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because they're superior.",
      "\u201cWe did not build this company based upon federal tax incentives,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to prove that we\u2019re going to be successful in the future.\u201d",
      "The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian\u2019s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S sport utility vehicle in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.",
      "The Illinois plant will begin making smaller R2 SUVs next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. The company has said the Georgia operation will be able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028. It plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.",
      "The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it\u2019s limiting production now in part to launch 2026 models.",
      "\u201cFor Rivian, it\u2019s do-or-die time,\u201d said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. \u201cWe saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can\u2019t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.\u201d",
      "Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025's first half, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors' slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.",
      "But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful of the startup automakers.",
      "The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But the competition now includes Ford\u2019s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.",
      "After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025\u2019s first half.",
      "At the same time, some automakers\u2019 ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram\u2019s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles at a suburban Detroit plant.",

      "Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can\u2019t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.",
      "Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who has said he wants to make Georgia \u201cthe electric mobility capital of America,\u201d acknowledges Rivian faces bumps, but says he remains confident the company can fulfill its promises.",
      "While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia\u2019s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.",
      "Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden's administration in November agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's hostility toward EVs, Hoffman said Rivian hopes the U.S. Department of Energy will distribute the loan money, arguing it will boost domestic manufacturing.",

      "There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Hoffman says Rivian is \u201cin this for the long haul.\u201d",

      "The world\u2019s fondness for matcha is about to be tested by steep price increases.",
      "Global demand for the powdered tea has skyrocketed around the world, fueled by consumer interest in its health benefits and by the bright green matcha lattes bubbling up on social media. In the U.S., retail sales of matcha are up 86% from three years ago, according to NIQ, a market research firm.",
      "But the matcha market is troubled. In Japan, one of the biggest matcha producers, poor weather reduced this year\u2019s harvest. Matcha is still plentiful in China, another major producer, but labor shortages and high demand have also raised prices there.",
      "For Americans, there\u2019s the added impact of tariffs. Imports from China are currently subject to a 37.5% tariff, while the U.S. has a 15% tariff on imports from Japan. It\u2019s not clear if tea will be exempted from tariffs because it\u2019s a natural product that\u2019s not grown in significant quantities in the U.S. \u2014 an accommodation that the Trump administration has made for cork from the European Union. The Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative didn\u2019t respond to messages left by The Associated Press.",
      "Aaron Vick, a senior tea buyer with California-based tea importer G.S. Haly, says he paid 75% more for the highest-grade 2025 crop of Japanese matcha, which will arrive in the U.S. later this fall. He expects lower grades of matcha to cost 30% to 50% more. Chinese matcha \u2014 while generally cheaper than Japanese matcha \u2014 is also getting more expensive because of high demand, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople should expect an enormous increase in the price of matcha this year,\u201d Vick said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bit of a tough ride for matcha devotees. They will have to show the depth of their commitment at the cash register.\u201d",
      "Even before this year\u2019s harvest, growing demand was straining matcha supplies. Making matcha is precise and labor intensive. Farmers grow tencha \u2014 a green tea leaf \u2014 in the shade. In the spring, the leaves are harvested, steamed, de-stemmed and de-veined and then stone ground into a fine powder. Tencha can be harvested again in the summer and fall, but the later harvests are generally of lower quality.",
      "There are ways to cut corners, like using a jet mill, which grinds the leaves with high pressure air. But Japan has other issues, including a rapidly aging workforce and limited tencha production. And despite Japanese agricultural ministry trying to coax tea growers to switch to tencha from regular green tea, many are reluctant to do so, concerned that the matcha boom will fade.",

      "Chinese matcha has historically been considered inferior to Japanese matcha and used as a flavoring for things like matcha-flavored KitKat bars instead of as a drinking tea. But the quality is improving, according to Jason Walker, the marketing director at Firsd Tea, the New Jersey-based U.S. subsidiary of Zhejiang Tea Group, China\u2019s largest tea exporter.",

      "President Donald Trump's administration has renewed its request to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration renewed its request Sunday for a federal appeals court to let him fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors, a move the president is seeking ahead of the central bank\u2019s vote on interest rates.",
      "The Trump administration filed a response just ahead of a 3 p.m. Eastern deadline Sunday to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, arguing that Cook\u2019s legal arguments for why she should stay on the job were meritless. Lawyers for Cook argued in a Saturday filing that the Trump administration has not shown sufficient cause to fire her, and stressed the risks to the economy and country if the president were allowed to fire a Fed governor without proper cause.",
      "Sunday\u2019s filing is the latest step in an unprecedented effort by the White House to shape the historically independent Fed. Cook\u2019s firing marks the first time in the central bank\u2019s 112-year history that a president has tried to fire a governor.",
      "\u201cThe public and the executive share an interest in ensuring the integrity of the Federal Reserve,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers argued in Sunday\u2019s filing. \u201cAnd that requires respecting the president\u2019s statutory authority to remove governors \u2018for cause\u2019 when such cause arises.\u201d",
      "Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has accused Cook of signing separate documents in which she allegedly said that both the Atlanta property and a home in Ann Arbor, Michigan, also purchased in June 2021, were both \u201cprimary residences.\u201d Pulte submitted a criminal referral to the Justice Department, which has opened an investigation.",

      "Wall Street rose to more records",
      "NEW YORK -- Wall Street rose to more records on Monday at the start of a week that could show whether the U.S. stock market\u2019s big recent rally has been overdone or prescient.",
      "The S&P 500 climbed 0.5% and topped its prior all-time high, which was set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 49 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.9% to its own record.",
      "Tesla helped lead the way and rose 3.6% after Elon Musk bought stock worth roughly $1 billion  through a trust. The electric vehicle company\u2019s stock price came into the day with a slight loss for the year so far, and the purchase could be a signal of Musk\u2019s faith in it.",
      "Alphabet was the single strongest force lifting the S&P 500 after gaining 4.5%, which brought the total value for Google\u2019s parent company above $3 trillion. Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple are the only other companies on Wall Street worth that much.",
      "The market\u2019s main event for the week will arrive on Wednesday. That\u2019s when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision  on interest rates, and the unanimous expectation is for the first cut of the year. Such a move could give a kickstart to the job market, which has been slowing.",
      "Stocks have already run to records on the assumption that a cut is coming on Wednesday, though. Expectations are also high that the Fed will keep lowering rates through the end of this year and into 2026. That creates the possibility for disappointment in the market, which would mean drops for stock prices, if the Fed doesn\u2019t end up slashing rates as aggressively as traders expect.",
      "That\u2019s why more attention will be on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell says in his press conference following the decision than on the decision itself. Fed officials will also release their latest projections for where they see interest rates and the economy heading in upcoming years, which could provide another potential flashpoint.",
      "What\u2019s keeping the Fed on guard is a possible jump in inflation because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. That\u2019s because lower interest rates can give inflation more fuel and send it even higher. And inflation has already proven difficult  to get under the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",
      "Another threat for Wall Street is if the job market slows too much. In that case, a recession could create a downturn in corporate profits that\u2019s steep enough to swamp the benefits that lower interest rates bring in the near term.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, has pushed angrily for cuts to interest rates. He\u2019s often attacked Powell personally, nicknaming him \u201cToo Late,\u201d and is trying to remove one of the Fed\u2019s governors  from its board.",
      "\u201c\u2018Too Late\u2019 must cut interest rates now, and bigger than he had in mind,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media network Monday, using his trademark all-caps style.",
      "On Wall Street, Intel rose 2.9% after trimming its forecast for expenses this year. The move came after it completed the sale of a 51% stake in its Altera business to the Silver Lake investment firm.",

      "U.S.-based shipping companies, however, have endorsed it. The Chamber of Shipping of America wants one global system, not multiple regional systems that could double charge vessels for their emissions depending on the route, said Kathy Metcalf, the chamber's president emeritus.",
      "Shipping emissions have grown over the last decade to about 3% of the global total as vessels have gotten bigger, delivering more cargo per trip and using immense amounts of fossil fuels. The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.",
      "In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of a regulatory framework to impose a minimum fee for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above certain thresholds and set a marine fuel standard to phase in cleaner fuels. The IMO aims for consensus in decision-making but, in this case, had to vote. The United States was notably absent.",
      "Now nations have to decide if the regulations will enter into force in 2027. If agreed upon, the regulations will become mandatory for large oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emit 85% of the total carbon emissions from international shipping, according to the IMO.",
      "If nations don't agree, shipping\u2019s decarbonization will be further delayed and \u201cthe chance of the sector playing a proper and fair part in the fight to keep global heating below dangerous levels will almost certainly be lost,\u201d said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition and Ocean Conservancy shipping program director.",

      "The proposal also asks the federal government to distribute an additional $9.4 billion in federal funds that the state has already requested or is expecting but first needs additional action from U.S. agencies.",

Officials said there were over 100 storm-related deaths in the state.",

      "The Sony-owned Crunchyroll release shattered expectations with a mighty $70 million debut in North America, according to Sunday estimates from Comscore. That haul marks the biggest domestic opening ever for an anime film, surpassing \u201cPok\u00e9mon: The First Movie,\u201d which opened with $31 million in 1999.",
      "The film extended its meteoric run, scoring the biggest anime opening of all time with a $132.1 million weekend, according to Comscore. Crunchyroll and Sony rolled it out across North America and 49 international markets, pushing the global total to $177.8 million.",
      "\u201cThis performance by this particular film shows the unpredictability of the box office,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIf we were sitting here, let\u2019s say a month or even a couple of weeks ago, would we be thinking, \u2018Wow, a Japanese anime film would be number one at the box office, overperform and bring in $70 million?\u2019 If you predicted that, kudos to you.\u201d",
      "The movie is the first in a three-film trilogy that brings the hit Shonen saga to its climactic showdown. The story follows Tanjiro Kamado, a kind-hearted boy who takes up swordsmanship after his family is slaughtered and his sister, Nezuko, is turned into a demon. Together, they fight a supernatural underworld of monstrous foes while clinging to what\u2019s left of their humanity.",

      "The Federal Reserve is facing economic uncertainty and political pressure as it meets this week to decide whether to cut interest rates",
      "WASHINGTON -- In a sign of how unusual this week's Federal Reserve meeting is, the decision it will make on interest rates \u2014 usually the main event \u2014 is just one of the key unknowns to be resolved when officials gather Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "For now, it's not even clear who will be there. The meeting will likely include Lisa Cook, an embattled governor, unless an appeals court or the Supreme Court rules in favor of an effort by President Donald Trump to remove her from office. And it will probably include Stephen Miran, a top White House economic aide whom Trump has nominated to fill an empty seat on the Fed's board. But those questions may not be resolved until late Monday.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is mired in uncertainty. Hiring has slowed sharply, while inflation remains stubbornly high.",
      "So a key question for the Fed is: Do they worry more about people who are out of work and struggling to find jobs, or do they focus more on the struggles many Americans face in keeping up with rising costs for groceries and other items? The Fed's mandate from Congress requires it to seek both stable prices and full employment.",
      "For now, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed policymakers have signaled the Fed is more concerned about weaker hiring, a key reason investors expect the central bank will reduce its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point on Wednesday to about 4.1%.",
      "Still, stubbornly high inflation may force them to proceed slowly and limit how many reductions they make. The central bank will also release its quarterly economic projections Wednesday, and economists project they will show that policymakers expect one or two additional cuts this year, plus several more next year.",
      "Ellen Meade, an economics professor at Duke University and former senior economist at the Fed, said it's a stark contrast to the early pandemic, when it was clear the Fed had to rapidly reduce rates to boost the economy. And when inflation surged in 2021 and 2022, it was also a straightforward call for the Fed, which moved quickly to raise borrowing costs to combat higher prices.",
      "But now, \u201cit\u2019s a tough time,\u201d Meade said. \u201cIt would be a tough time, even if the politics and the whole thing weren\u2019t going on the way they are, it would be a tough time. Some people would want to cut, some people would not want to cut.\u201d",
      "Amid all the economic uncertainty, Trump is applying unprecedented political pressure on the Fed, demanding sharply lower rates, seeking to fire Cook, and insulting Powell, whom he has called a \u201cnumbskull,\u201d \u201cfool,\u201d and \u201cmoron.\u201d",
      "Loretta Mester, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, said that Fed officials won't let the criticisms sway their decisions on policy. Still, the attacks are unfortunate, she said, because they threaten to undermine the Fed's credibility with the public.",
      "\u201cAdded to their list of the difficulty of making policy because of how the economy is performing, they also have to contend with the fact that there may be some of the public that\u2019s skeptical about how they\u2019ve gone about making their decisions,\u201d she said.",

      "There are typically 12 officials who vote on the Fed's policies at each meeting \u2014 the seven members of the Fed's board of governors, as well as five of the 12 regional bank presidents, who vote on a rotating basis.",
      "If a court rules that Cook can be fired, or Miran isn't approved in time, then just 11 officials will vote on Wednesday. Either way, there ought to be enough votes to approve a quarter-point cut, but there could be an unusual amount of division.",
      "Miran, if he is on the board, and Governor Michelle Bowman may dissent in opposition to a quarter-point reduction in favor of a steeper half-point cut.",
      "There could be additional dissenting votes in the other direction, potentially from regional bank presidents who might oppose any cuts at all. Beth Hammack, president of the Fed's Cleveland branch, and Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, have both expressed concern that inflation has topped the Fed's 2% targer for more than four years and is still elevated. If either votes against a cut, it would be the first time there were dissents in both directions from a Fed decision since 2019.",
      "\u201cThis degree of division is unusual, but the circumstances are unusual, too,\" Andolfatto said. \u201cThis is a situation central banks really don\u2019t like: The combination of inflationary pressure and labor market weakness.\u201d",
      "Hiring has slowed in recent months, with employers shedding 13,000 jobs in June and adding just 22,000 in August, the government reported earlier this month. And last week a preliminary report from the Labor Department showed that companies added far fewer jobs in the year ending in March than previously estimated.",
      "At the same time, inflation picked up a bit last month and remains above the Fed's 2% target. According to the consumer price index, core prices \u2014 excluding food and energy \u2014 rose 3.1% in August compared with a year earlier..",
      "With inflation still elevated, the Fed may have to proceed slowly with any further cuts, which would likely further frustrate the Trump White House.",

      "\u201cYou've got to enjoy this,\u201d Schwarber said later, puffing on a fat cigar. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen all the time.\u201d",
      "The Phillies hope it keeps happening all the way through October as they chase the franchise's third World Series crown and first since 2008.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re playing really good baseball right now and just got to keep going and keep understanding we've got a bigger picture,\u201d Harper said. \u201cWe've got things on our mind that we want to win.\u201d",
      "Philadelphia was already assured its fourth straight National League playoff berth on Sunday, when the San Francisco Giants lost to the Dodgers.",
      "And with the second-place New York Mets idle Monday, the Phillies needed a win to become the first division champion in the majors this season. They blew three one-run leads before finally getting past the NL West-leading Dodgers for their ninth victory in 11 games, opening a 12 1/2-game lead over the Mets in the NL East with 11 to play.",
      "Philadelphia had just one hit \u2014 Schwarber's 53rd homer \u2014 until the seventh inning. But then Weston Wilson and Harper homered as Philly rallied against the defending World Series champions.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re just tough and they\u2019re resilient,\u201d Phillies manager Rob Thomson said about his team. \u201cThey just keep fighting and I\u2019m proud of them. This is a really special group.\u201d",

      "It was the earliest division clinch in Phillies history, two days sooner than the 2011 team that won the NL East on Sept. 17. This squad got it done in Game 151, second-fastest behind those 2011 Phillies who did it in Game 150.",

I felt like guys came up, they stepped up right away and they got the job done. That\u2019s how you win big baseball games.\u201d",
      "Since the July 31 trade deadline, the Phillies are 29-14.",
      "They lost ace right-hander Zack Wheeler when he went on the injured list a month ago with a blood clot in his right shoulder. Wheeler was 10-5 with a 2.71 ERA in 24 starts when he was sidelined, but Philadelphia's pitching depth has allowed the team to absorb such a huge loss.",
      "It certainly helped that the Phillies acquired closer Jhoan Duran and center fielder Harrison Bader from Minnesota at the trade deadline.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a little bit different than we have been in the past,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cWe can do some things. We\u2019re going to slug but we also can play some small ball to win games, too. It\u2019s a good balance.\u201d",
      "All-Star shortstop Trea Turner (right hamstring strain) and third baseman Alec Bohm (left shoulder inflammation) are both on the IL. Thomson said Bohm could return later this week at Arizona, while Turner could be back in time for the final homestand of the regular season.",
      "The victory made Thomson the third manager in franchise history to win consecutive division titles, joining Charlie Manuel (2007-11) and Danny Ozark (1976-78). Thomson is the fourth manager in Major League Baseball history to reach the postseason in each of his first four full seasons. Among the other three is Dodgers skipper Dave Roberts.",

      "Disappointed to be going home so soon? Sure.",
      "Did it overshadow his season in the slightest? Not at all. Showing wisdom beyond his years, Lutkenhaus explained his early exit \u2014 a seventh-place showing in his opening heat \u2014 in terms any runner can understand.",

      "It's her only real competition these days.",
      "The Kenyan star, whose inspiring quest for the four-minute mile was the talk of track earlier this year, was widening her lead over the rest of the runners as she rounded the bend.

      "\u201cThis is my first time one-on-one interacting with Faith,\u201d said Ewoi, a 28-year-old who trains in America and won her first medal at a major. \u201cI always watch her doing amazing things. I never thought I'd be sitting together with her, hearing something from her. She's really inspiring everybody, and that's really good for the sport.\u201d",

      "She was among a group of female runners that included Allyson Felix and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce who had babies in their prime, but refused to bend to the untrue belief that motherhood meant the end of success on the track.",

      "If he struggles again, a suddenly doubtful fanbase turns its worries into a five-alarm fire. And even if he plays well, the result and Manning's stat line will likely be dismissed as coming against inferior competition.",
      "Stats are one thing. Just passing the eye test this week would be a start.",
      "Manning's play so far has stoked the embers of doubt. He struggled badly in a season-opening loss to Ohio State. He started slow the next week but rallied with four touchdown passes against San Jose State.",
      "His day against UTEP was downright rough. Manning was 11 of 25 passing for 114 yards with one touchdown and interception. He had a streak of 10 consecutive incompletions. He side-armed some throws and missed open receivers. There were boos late in the first half.",
      "Through three games, Manning is completing just 55% of his passes.",
      "\u201cIt's frustrating because I know I'm better than that,\u201d Manning said. \u201cBut you know, we're going to be better this week and get clicking on offense. I'm excited to get going.\u201d",

      "Authorities say that social media platforms should not require age verification for all users when a ban on children under 16 having accounts goes into effect in December in Australia",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian authorities said Tuesday that social media platforms should not demand age verification for all account holders starting from December, when a ban on children under 16 having accounts goes into effect in the country.",
      "The government released guidelines on how platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram should apply the world's first ban on children using social media from Dec. 10. It says verifying the ages of all account holders would be unreasonable.",
      "\u201cWe think it would be unreasonable if platforms reverified everyone\u2019s age,\u201d said Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, who drafted the guidelines. Her use of the word \u201creverified\" suggested the platforms usually already had sufficient data to verify a user was older than 16.",
      "She said the platforms have \u201ctargeting technology\u201d to focus on those under 16.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists in Colombia\u2019s Amazon are capturing and testing endangered pink river dolphins to monitor mercury contamination from illegal gold mining and deforestation",
      "PUERTO NARINO, Colombia -- A flash of pink breaks the muddy surface of the Amazon River as scientists and veterinarians, waist-deep in the warm current, patiently work a mesh net around a pod of river dolphins. They draw it tighter with each pass, and a spray of silver fish glistens under the harsh sun as they leap to escape the net.",
      "When the team hauls a dolphin into a boat, it thrashes as water streams from its pink-speckled sides and the crew quickly ferries it to the sandy riverbank where adrenaline-charged researchers lift it onto a mat. They have 15 minutes \u2014 the limit for how long a dolphin can safely be out of the water \u2014 to complete their work.",
      "Fernando Trujillo, a marine biologist leading the effort, kneels beside the animal\u2019s head, shielding its eye with a small cloth so it can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening. He rests his hand gently on the animal and speaks in low tones.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve never felt the palm of a hand. We try to calm them,\u201d said Trujillo, sporting a pink dolphin bandana. \u201cTaking a dolphin out of the water, it\u2019s a kind of abduction.\u201d",
      "One person counts the dolphin's breaths. Another wets its skin with a sponge while the others conduct multiple medical tests that will help show how much mercury is coursing through the Amazon\u2019s most graceful predators.",
      "Trujillo directs the Omacha Foundation, a conservation group focused on aquatic wildlife and river ecosystems, and leads health evaluations of river dolphins. It's a painstaking operation involving experienced fishermen, veterinarians and locals that takes months of planning and happens a couple of times a year.",
      "\u201cWe take blood and tissue samples to assess mercury,\u00a8 Trujillo told The Associated Press from the Colombian riverside town of Puerto Narino. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re using dolphins as sentinels for the river\u2019s health.\u201d",
      "Mercury contamination comes mainly from illegal gold mining \u2014 a growing industry across the Amazon Basin \u2014 and forest clearing that washes mercury that naturally occurs in soil into waterways.",
      "The miners use mercury to separate gold from sediment, then dump the sludge back into rivers, where it enters fish eaten by people and dolphins. Rising global gold prices have fueled a mining boom, and mercury pollution in remote waterways has increased.",
      "Mercury can damage the brain, kidneys, lungs and immune system and cause mood swings, memory loss and muscle weakness in people, according to the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Pregnant women and young children are most at risk, with prenatal exposure linked to developmental delays and reduced cognitive function.",
      "\u201cThe maximum any living being should have is 1 milligram per kilogram,\u201d Trujillo said. \u201cHere, we\u2019re seeing 20 to 30 times that amount.\u201d",
      "In previous years, his team found 16 to 18 milligrams per kilogram of mercury in dolphins, which can suffer the same neurological damage, organ damage and other problems as humans. In Colombia\u2019s Orinoco River, levels in some dolphins have reached as high as 42, levels scientists say are among the most extreme ever recorded in the species.",
      "Trujillo said it's difficult to prove the toxin is directly killing dolphins. Further studies are underway, he added, noting that \u201cany mammal with a huge amount of mercury will die.\u201d",
      "When Trujillo and his team tested their own blood three years ago, his results showed more than 36 times the safe limit \u2014 36.4 milligrams per kilogram \u2014 a level he attributes to decades working in mercury-affected areas and a diet heavy in fish. With medical assistance, his levels have dropped to about 7 milligrams.",
      "\u201cMercury is an invisible enemy until it builds up to a sufficient amount, then it starts to affect the central nervous system,\u201d Trujillo told AP after his team managed to capture and test four pink dolphins. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing evidence of it in Indigenous communities.\u201d",
      "A series of scientific studies and reports \u2014 including work by the International Pollutants Elimination Network and academic researchers \u2014 have found high mercury exposure among Indigenous peoples across the Amazon, including in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Suriname and Bolivia. Hair samples showed averages well above WHO's safe threshold of 1 part per million, with one Colombian community registering more than 22 milligrams per kilogram.",

The International Union for Conservation of Nature listed the pink dolphin as endangered in 2018. Trujillo said exact numbers for the Amazon are unknown, but his organization estimates 30,000 to 45,000 across the basin.",

It banned mercury use in mining in 2018, ratified the Minamata Convention aimed at reducing mercury in the environment and submitted an action plan in 2024.

      "Other Amazon nations say they\u2019re stepping up. Brazil has launched raids and moved to restrict satellite internet used by illegal gold-mining camps that use mercury, aiming to disrupt logistics and supply lines. Peru recently seized a record 4 tons of smuggled mercury. Ecuador, Suriname and Guyana have filed action plans to cut mercury use in small-scale gold mining.",
      "The dolphin testing operation relies on Jos\u00e9 \u201cMariano\u201d Rangel, a charismatic former fisherman from Venezuela. He leads the charge when it\u2019s time to haul the animals \u2014 which can weigh as much as 160 kilograms (about 353 pounds) \u2014 into the small boats. It's a moment that can end with a stinging blow to the jaw as the dolphins thrash to break free.",
      "\u201cThe most difficult part of the captures is enclosing the dolphins,\u201d Rangel said.",
      "A portable ultrasound machine scans lungs, heart and other vital organs for disease. The team checks for respiratory problems, internal injuries and signs of reproduction, photograph the animals' skin and scars, swab blowholes and genital openings for bacterial cultures, and collect tissue for mercury testing. Microchips are implanted so researchers can identify each animal and avoid duplicating tests.",
      "Omacha has recorded antimicrobial resistance \u2014 bacteria that can\u2019t be killed by common medicines \u2014 and respiratory problems. They have also identified possible emerging diseases, such as papilloma virus, that could pose risks to both dolphins and humans.",
      "After a long morning hauling and testing dolphins, the scientists return to a laboratory in Puerto Narino that's covered with posters of dolphins and manatees and the bones and skulls of dolphins and other animals. They test some samples, prepare others to send to larger facilities and end their day repairing nets and refilling kits to do it all again at dawn.",
      "For Trujillo, each capture, scan and blood test is part of a larger fight.",

      "TikTok users in the U.S. may get a reprieve from the threat of a shutdown after the Trump administration announced it has reached a framework deal with China for the ownership of the popular social video platform.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a press conference after the latest round of trade talks between the world\u2019s top two economies concluded in Madrid that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would speak Friday to possibly finalize the deal. He said the objective of the deal would be to switch to American ownership.",
      "He did not disclose the terms of the deal, saying that it is between two private parties, but added that \"the commercial terms have been agreed upon.\u201d",
      "Little is known about the actual deal in the works, including what companies are involved and whether the United States would have a stake in TikTok. Li Chenggang, China\u2019s international trade representative, said the two sides have reached \u201cbasic framework consensus\u201d to properly solve TikTok-related issues in a cooperative way, reduce investment barriers and promote related economic and trade cooperation, according to China\u2019s official news agency Xinhua.",
      "Oracle Corp. has been floated as a likely buyer for the platform. Representatives for the company did not immediately respond to a message for comment on Monday.",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the team was \u201cvery focused on TikTok and making sure that it was a deal that is fair for the Chinese,\u201d but also \u201ccompletely respects U.S. national security concerns.\u201d",
      "Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China\u2019s Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid there was consensus on authorization of \u201cthe use of intellectual property rights such as (TikTok\u2019s) algorithm\u201d \u2014 a main sticking point in the deal.",
      "The sides also agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, he said.",
      "Though he has no clear legal basis to do so, Trump has continued to extend the deadline for TikTok to avoid a ban in the U.S. This gives his administration more time to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership. The next deadline is on Sept. 17, and Trump has already signaled he would extend it if needed.",
      "It is not clear how many times Trump can keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far, there have been no legal challenges against the administration. Trump has amassed more than 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters. He said in January that he has a \u201cwarm spot for TikTok.\u201d",
      "For now, TikTok continues to function for its 170 million users in the U.S. Tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle were persuaded to continue to offer and support the app, on the promise that Trump\u2019s Justice Department would not use the law to seek potentially steep fines against them.",

      "The Moroccan company Somagec, which activists allege is linked to the president, confirmed the outage but denied having a hand in it. The AP could not confirm a link.",
      "\u201cThe current situation is extremely serious and worrying,\u201d one of the signatories who spent 11 months in prison said, speaking anonymously for fear of being targeted by the government.",
      "In addition to the internet shutdown, \"phone calls are heavily monitored, and speaking freely can pose a risk,\u201d said Macus Menejolea Taxijad, a resident who recently began living in exile.",
      "It is only the latest of repressive measures that the country has deployed to crush criticisms, including mass surveillance, according to a 2024 Amnesty International report.",
      "Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony, is run by Africa\u2019s longest-serving president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who, at 83, has served as president for more than half his life. His son serves as the vice president and is accused of spending state funds on a lavish lifestyle. He was convicted of money laundering and embezzlement in France and sanctioned by the U.K.",
      "On Friday, the U.N.'s top court declined Equatorial Guinea's request for France to return a Paris-based mansion confiscated as part of a corruption probe, ruling that the African nation has not shown it has a \u201cplausible right to the return of the building.\u201d",
      "Despite the country\u2019s oil and gas wealth, at least 57% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty, according to the World Bank. Officials, their families and their inner circle, meanwhile, live a life of luxury.",

With a population of around 5,000 people, the island has been seeking independence from the country for years as it accuses the government of disregarding its residents.",
      "The internet shutdown is the latest in a long history of Malabo\u2019s repressive responses to the island\u2019s political and economic demands, activists say, citing regular arrests and the absence of adequate social amenities like schools and hospitals.",

After the Supreme Court ruled the ban constitutional, President Donald Trump suspended it on his first day in office to give the China-based company ByteDance time to find a new buyer.",

He has repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance to find a buyer and hinted occasionally that there was a deal in place, but without offering details. The White House started its own TikTok account last month.",
      "Becerra's new approach is part of an effort by Democrats to counter the rightward swing that was seen last year both in red states such as Texas and Florida and blue states such as California, New Jersey and New York, where Trump improved his numbers among Latinos.",
      "The idea is to lock in a key user base by pushing out content early on a platform politicians are still largely experimenting with. The effort comes when the Trump administration is phasing out multilingual services as part of the president's push to make English the official language of the United States.",
      "Candidates running in the 2025 elections in New Jersey and Virginia are already adapting their campaigns to appeal to Hispanics, who may have stayed away from the polls or voted for Trump based on his economic promises. But strategists say that it\u2019s still very much up for debate whether the trend will hold.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s critical to communicate in the language and on the platforms where voters spend their time and get their information,\u201d Becerra said in a statement.",
      "A 2024 Pew Research Center survey concluded that while TikTok has seen significant user growth in a short time, the demographics were different depending on race and ethnicity. Nearly half of Hispanic adults reported using it compared with 39% of Black adults and 28% of white adults.",
      "Becerra\u2019s campaign says it will push out a mix of videos with him speaking directly to the camera, policy explainers and behind-the-scenes clips from the campaign trail. It also plans to collaborate with influencers and publish videos created by supporters. All in Spanish.",

      "Dotcom had asked the High Court to review the legality of an official\u2019s August 2024 decision that he should be surrendered to the U.S. to face trial on charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering. It was the latest chapter in a protracted 13-year battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire from New Zealand.",
      "The Megaupload founder had applied for what in New Zealand is called a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official's decision was lawful.",
      "A judge on Wednesday dismissed Dotcom's arguments that the decision to deport him was politically motivated and that he would face grossly disproportionate treatment in the U.S. In a written ruling, Justice Christine Grice also rejected Dotcom's claim that New Zealand's police were wrong to charge his business partners, but not him, under domestic laws \u2014 which likely yielded laxer sentences than if the men had been tried in the U.S.",
      "The latest decision could be challenged in the Court of Appeal, where a deadline for filing is Oct. 8. It wasn't immediately clear if Dotcom would do so.",
      "One of his lawyers, Ron Mansfield, told Radio New Zealand that Dotcom's team had \"much fight left in us as we seek to secure a fair outcome,\u201d but didn't elaborate further. Neither Dotcom nor Mansfield responded to a request for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s government hasn\u2019t disclosed what will happen next in the extradition process or divulged an expected timeline for Dotcom to be surrendered to the United States.",
      "The saga stretches back to the January 2012 arrest by New Zealand authorities of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion along with other company officers at the request of the FBI. U.S. prosecutors said Megaupload raked in at least $175 million, mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies, before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors said the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "He has been free on bail in New Zealand since February 2012.",
      "Dotcom and his business partners fought the FBI's efforts to extradite them for years, including by challenging New Zealand law enforcement's actions during the investigation and arrests. In 2021, however, New Zealand\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be surrendered.",

      "Under New Zealand law, it remained up to the country\u2019s justice minister to decide if the extradition should proceed. The minister, Paul Goldsmith, ruled in August 2024 that it should.",
      "But by then, Dotcom was the only person whose fate remained in question. Two of his former business partners, Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk, pleaded guilty to charges against them in a New Zealand court in June 2023 and were sentenced to two and a half years in jail.",
      "In exchange, U.S. efforts to extradite them were dropped. Part of Dotcom's latest legal bid challenged the police decision not to extend a plea deal under New Zealand laws to him too.",

      "Prosecutors earlier abandoned their extradition bid against a fourth Megaupload officer, Finn Batato, who was arrested in New Zealand. Batato returned to Germany, where he died from cancer in 2022.",

      "\u201cI am pleased my decision has been upheld,\u201d Goldsmith said Thursday in a written statement.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A dying octopus in a Southern California aquarium is receiving an outflowing of love and well wishes as she spends her final days pouring her last energy into caring for her eggs \u2014 even though they will never hatch.",
      "Many on social media have reminisced about seeing the giant Pacific octopus named Ghost when they had visited the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach. Some shared that they had a tattoo of Ghost or would wear a sweater emblazoned with the beloved cephalopod in her memory.",
      "\u201cShe is a wonderful octopus and has made an eight-armed impression on all of our hearts,\u201d the aquarium said on Instagram.",
      "Ghost laid eggs earlier this week and entered the last phase of her life cycle, known as senescence. During this period, the octopus will neglect her own basic needs like eating, instead focusing on protecting her eggs and aerating them to prevent bacteria or other harmful agents from growing on them.",
      "Ghost's eggs are unfertilized and will never hatch, however. In the wild, giant Pacific octopuses spend their whole lives alone and only come together for a brief instance to reproduce.",
      "\u201cYou really can\u2019t combine males and females for any period of time because they don\u2019t naturally cohabitate,\u201d said the aquarium's vice president of animal care, Nate Jaros. \u201cThey\u2019re at high risk or aggression or even potentially death.\u201d",
      "Ghost is originally from the waters of British Columbia, Canada, and arrived at the aquarium in May 2024 from a scientific collector. She was only 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms) then but now weighs more than 50 pounds (22.7 kilograms).",
      "The average giant Pacific octopus lives for three to five years. Ghost is estimated to be between two and four years old, Jaros said.",
      "Ghost was a \u201csuper active and very physical octopus\u201d who enjoyed spending time with humans, Jaros said.",
      "She was trained to voluntarily crawl into a basket so staff would weigh her and monitor her diet. Sometimes, she would push aside food her caregiver was offering just to interact with them more, Jaros said.",

      "He is now one of thousands of small-scale farmers in the southern African country using a generative AI chatbot designed by the non-profit Opportunity International for farming advice.",
      "The Malawi government is backing the project, having seen the agriculture-dependent nation hit recently by a series of cyclones and an El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought. Malawi\u2019s food crisis, which is largely down to the struggles of small-scale farmers, is a central issue for its national elections next week.",
      "More than 80% of Malawi's population of 21 million rely on agriculture for their livelihoods and the country has one of the highest poverty rates in the world, according to the World Bank.",
      "The AI chatbot suggested Maere grow potatoes last year alongside his staple corn and cassava to adjust to his changed soil. He followed the instructions to the letter, he said, and cultivated half a soccer field's worth of potatoes and made more than $800 in sales, turning around his and his children's fortunes.",
      "\u201cI managed to pay for their school fees without worries,\u201d he beamed.",
      "Artificial intelligence has the potential to uplift agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 33-50 million smallholder farms like Maere's produce up to 70-80% of the food supply, according to the U.N.'s International Fund for Agricultural Development. Yet productivity in Africa \u2014 with the world's fast-growing population to feed \u2014 is lagging behind despite vast tracts of arable land.",
      "As AI's use surges across the globe, so it is helping African farmers access new information to identify crop diseases, forecast drought, design fertilizers to boost yields, and even locate an affordable tractor. Private investment in agriculture-related tech in sub-Saharan Africa went from $10 million in 2014 to $600 million in 2022, according to the World Bank.",
      "But not without challenges.",
      "Africa has hundreds of languages for AI tools to learn. Even then, few farmers have smartphones and many can't read. Electricity and internet service are patchy at best in rural areas, and often non-existent.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges to sustainable AI use in African agriculture is accessibility,\u201d said Daniel Mvalo, a Malawian technology specialist. \u201cMany tools fail to account for language diversity, low literacy and poor digital infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The AI tool in Malawi tries to do that. The app is called Ulangizi, which means advisor in the country's Chichewa language. It is WhatsApp-based and works in Chichewa and English. You can type or speak your question, and it replies with an audio or text response, said Richard Chongo, Opportunity International's country director for Malawi.",

      "As Big Tech\u2019s data centers continue to grow threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are considering bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- With the explosive growth of Big Tech's data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.",
      "Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.",
      "Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.",
      "Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.",
      "That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.",
      "Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.",

      "That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.",
      "Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.",
      "A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.",
      "The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs \u2014 likely for the biggest power users \u2014 to meet growing demand.",
      "The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast \u2014 twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data \u2014 and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.",
      "Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.",
      "\u201cData center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.",
      "Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.",
      "Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.",
      "The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.",

      "\u201cThis is particularly concerning given that states within PJM\u2019s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,\u201d the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.",
      "The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.",
      "Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a \u201cbring your own generation\u201d requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.",
      "In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.",
      "Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.",
      "However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.",
      "To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.",
      "It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.",
      "Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.",
      "But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.",
      "\u201cAnd the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?\" Silverman said. \"Or is there a better way to do it?\u201d",

      "The single-dose vaccine was developed by the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland state after more than a decade of research led by professor of microbiology Peter Timms.",

The free app grouped similar pictures together and then suggested the best shot to keep. I found that I generally agreed with its suggestions.",

      "High school and college educators say that student use of artificial intelligence has become so widespread that they need to rethink how to assign and assess students",
      "The book report is now a thing of the past. Take-home tests and essays are becoming obsolete.",
      "High school and college educators around the country say student use of artificial intelligence has become so prevalent that to assign writing outside of the classroom is like asking students to cheat.",
      "\u201cThe cheating is off the charts. It\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve seen in my entire career,\u201d says Casey Cuny, who has taught English for 23 years. Educators are no longer wondering if students will outsource schoolwork to AI chatbots. \u201cAnything you send home, you have to assume is being AI\u2019ed.\u201d",
      "The question now is how schools can adapt, because many of the teaching and assessment tools that have been used for generations are no longer effective. As AI technology rapidly improves and becomes more entwined with daily life, it is transforming how students learn and study, how teachers teach, and it\u2019s creating new confusion over what constitutes academic dishonesty.",
      "\u201cWe have to ask ourselves, what is cheating?\u201d says Cuny, a 2024 recipient of California\u2019s Teacher of the Year award. \u201cBecause I think the lines are getting blurred.\u201d",
      "Cuny\u2019s students at Valencia High School in southern California now do most writing in class. He monitors student laptop screens from his desktop, using software that lets him \u201clock down\u201d their screens or block access to certain sites. He\u2019s also integrating AI into his lessons and teaching students how to use AI as a study aid \u201cto get kids learning with AI instead of cheating with AI.\u201d",
      "In rural Oregon, high school teacher Kelly Gibson has made a similar shift to in-class writing. She is also incorporating more verbal assessments to have students talk through their understanding of assigned reading.",
      "\u201cI used to give a writing prompt and say, \u2018In two weeks I want a five-paragraph essay,\u2019\u201d says Gibson. \u201cThese days, I can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s almost begging teenagers to cheat.\u201d",
      "Take, for example, a once typical high school English assignment: Write an essay that explains the relevance of social class in \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Many students say their first instinct is now to ask ChatGPT for help \u201cbrainstorming.\u201d Within seconds, ChatGPT yields a list of essay ideas, plus examples and quotes to back them up. The chatbot ends by asking if it can do more: \u201cWould you like help writing any part of the essay? I can help you draft an introduction or outline a paragraph!\u201d",
      "Students say they often turn to AI with good intentions for things like research, editing or help reading difficult texts. But AI offers unprecedented temptation and it\u2019s sometimes hard to know where to draw the line.",
      "College sophomore Lily Brown, a psychology major at an East Coast liberal arts school, relies on ChatGPT to help outline essays because she struggles putting the pieces together herself. ChatGPT also helped her through a freshman philosophy class, where assigned reading \u201cfelt like a different language\u201d until she read AI summaries of the texts.",
      "\u201cSometimes I feel bad using ChatGPT to summarize reading, because I wonder is this cheating? Is helping me form outlines cheating? If I write an essay in my own words and ask how to improve it, or when it starts to edit my essay, is that cheating?\u201d",
      "Her class syllabi say things like: \u201cDon\u2019t use AI to write essays and to form thoughts,\u201d she says, but that leaves a lot of grey area. Students say they often shy away from asking teachers for clarity because admitting to any AI use could flag them as a cheater.",
      "Schools tend to leave AI policies to teachers, which often means that rules vary widely within the same school. Some educators, for example, welcome the use of Grammarly.com, an AI-powered writing assistant, to check grammar. Others forbid it, noting the tool also offers to rewrite sentences.",
      "\u201cWhether you can use AI or not, depends on each classroom. That can get confusing,\u201d says Valencia 11th grader Jolie Lahey, who credits Cuny with teaching her sophomore English class a variety of AI skills like how to upload study guides to ChatGPT and have the chatbot quiz them and then explain problems they got wrong.",
      "But this year, her teachers have strict \u201cNo AI\u201d policies. \u201cIt\u2019s such a helpful tool. And if we\u2019re not allowed to use it that just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Lahey says. \u201cIt feels outdated.\u201d",

      "For example, one English language learner wrote an assignment in his native language and used DeepL, an AI-powered translation tool, to translate his work to English but didn\u2019t realize the platform also altered his language, which was flagged by an AI detector.",
      "Enforcing academic integrity policies has been complicated by AI, which is hard to detect and even harder to prove, said Fitzsimmons. Faculty are allowed flexibility when they believe a student has unintentionally crossed a line but are now more hesitant to point out violations because they don't want to accuse students unfairly, and students are worried that if they are falsely accused there is no way to prove their innocence.",
      "Over the summer, Fitzsimmons helped draft detailed new guidelines for students and faculty that strive to create more clarity. Faculty have been told that a blanket ban on AI \u201cis not a viable policy\u201d unless instructors make changes to the way they teach and assess students. A lot of faculty are doing away with take-home exams.

      "Residents of Santiago de Compostela are struggling with overtourism",
      "SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, Spain -- While some Barcelona residents sought to repel a tsunami of tourists with plastic water pistols, a neighborhood association in Santiago de Compostela opted for a friendlier approach: a guide to good manners for visitors to their town, the endpoint of the Catholic world's most famous pilgrimage.",
      "Translated into several languages, the group posted it throughout the northwestern Spanish city and distributed it at its ever-growing number of hostels. It reminded tourists to keep noise down, respect traffic rules and use plastic protectors on hiking poles to avoid damaging the narrow cobblestone streets, among other things.",
      "To little avail, it would seem. Large groups still take over the streets singing hymns, bikes ride in the wrong direction and metal pole tips clatter against the ground. Santiago's social media is awash with photos denouncing a lack of decorum.",
      "Tourists' greater offense, though, stems from their sheer numbers; the old town and squares surrounding the cathedral holding the reputed tomb of Saint James the Apostle \u2014 and that was the center of town life for a millennium \u2014 today are almost exclusively the domain of outsiders, whose influx has served to expel residents. This dynamic has left Santiago emerging as the latest global destination where longtime residents have grown embittered by the overtourism transforming their community.",
      "\u201cWe do not have tourism-phobia. We have always lived in harmony with tourism, but when it gets out of hand, when the pressure goes beyond what is reasonable, that is when rejection arises,\u201d said Roberto Almu\u00ed\u00f1a, president of the neighborhood association in the old town that's a UNESCO World Heritage site.",
      "The \u201cCamino de Santiago,\u201d known in English as the Way of St. James, dates back to the 9th century, with pilgrims following its converging trails for up to hundreds of kilometers on paths originating in Portugal and France. The modern popularity it gained with the 2010 film \u201cThe Way\u201d starring Martin Sheen was turbocharged more recently by social media and experience-driven travel after the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Last year, a record half-million people signed up to trek one of the approved routes to the cathedral \u2014 equal to five times the city\u2019s resident population, and marking a 725-fold increase over the last four decades. Added to those masses are ordinary tourists not arriving by trail.",
      "The proliferation of short-term rentals drove annual rent prices up 44% from 2018 to 2023, according to a study commissioned by the city council to the Fundaci\u00f3n Universidade da Coru\u00f1a. That led municipal authorities in May to request the regional government classify the area as a high-pressure zone, like Barcelona or San Sebastian, which would help to limit rent increases.",
      "Already, last November, Santiago's city council enacted a ban on Airbnb-style tourist accommodations in the historic center, arguing at the time in a statement that it was \u201ca necessity arising from its significant growth, which has clear effects on the number of housing units available for residents and on their price.\u201d",
      "Sihara P\u00e9rez, a researcher at the University of Santiago, described finding anywhere to rent in the city as \u201cmission impossible,\u201d while Antonio Jerem\u00edas, 27, told The Associated Press that he's considering moving back in with his mother, because his salary working full-time at a warehouse isn\u2019t enough to make ends meet.",
      "Andrea Dopazo, 32, tried to move out of her parents\u2019 house in a neighborhood located fully 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the city center. But her desire to continue living in the place where she grew up and community ties are strong proved futile, and she had to take something in a town outside Santiago.",
      "\u201cThe only people who have been able to stay in the neighborhoods are those who have been lucky \u2014 or unlucky \u2014 enough to inherit an apartment from their grandparents, uncles or parents,\u201d said Dopazo, who works in human resources.",

      "In the old town, tourists can stay in small hotels in former homes or huge hostels converted from former seminaries, which aren\u2019t subject to the ban. But in the hustle to cash in, some short-term rentals are apparently flouting the restriction, evidenced by tenants collecting keys from lockboxes hung outside buildings.",
      "\u201cSome follow the rules and others don\u2019t, but this is the model that is really limiting residential housing,\u201d said Montse Vilar, from another neighborhood group, Xuntanza.",
      "Santiago\u2019s City Hall told The Associated Press in a statement that it is \u201cdoing everything in its power to enforce the regulations\u201d and that it takes action whenever it detects a case of an illegal apartment housing tourists.",
      "Between 2000 and 2020, the historic center lost about half its permanent population, now reduced to just 3,000 residents who \u201cresist like the Gauls\u201d behind buildings' thick stone facades, Almu\u00ed\u00f1a said. There are no hardware stores or newsstands left, and just one bakery. A couple grocery stores coexist with cafes, ice cream parlors and souvenir shops.",
      "\u201cThe city has emptied out. You only have to take a walk to see that all we've got are closed, abandoned buildings that are falling apart,\u201d Almu\u00ed\u00f1a added.",
      "This year, the number of pilgrims reaching Santiago is on track to set another record. The surge is further souring Santiago's residents on their city's tourism-centric economic model; already half of them rejected it as of 2023, up from just over one-quarter a decade earlier, according to a study conducted by Rede Galabra, a research group focused on cultural studies at the University of Santiago.",
      "Even some of the pilgrims are noting a shift, like Spaniards \u00c1lvaro Casta\u00f1o and Ale Osteso who met on the route four years ago and have returned every year since.",
      "\u201cThe Camino is becoming more and more known, many more people are coming,\u201d Osteso said one recent morning at the end of their trek, among tour groups of pilgrims in bright, color-coordinated outfits and families snapping pictures. \u201cSpirituality seems to have been a little lost at times.\u201d",

      "MORENO VALLEY, Calif. -- A wild burro dubbed Cupid is recovering from surgery after being shot with an arrow in what officials say is the latest in a series of a half-dozen attacks since June on donkeys that roam semirural areas of inland Southern California.",
      "The 2-year-old female burro was spotted last Wednesday with a blue arrow protruding from her right shoulder as she wandered with a herd in the foothills of Moreno Valley, about 65 miles (104 km) east of Los Angeles.",
      "Animal services and the Riverside County Sheriff's Department responded and helped bring the wounded animal in for an emergency procedure to remove the arrowhead. The projectile had punctured the burro's right lung, said Chad Cheatham, vice president of DonkeyLand, a nonprofit rescue organization.",
      "\u201cRight now she\u2019s stable and is standing, which is a huge improvement,\" Cheatham said Monday. When Cupid is fully recovered, she will join a group of rescued burros who meander DonkeyLand's 2,000-acre (800-hectare) sanctuary and wildlife preserve.",
      "The rescue group is offering a $24,000 reward, raised from donations, for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in at least six bow attacks on burros over the past several months.",
      "The Riverside County Department of Animal Services said Tuesday that the investigation is ongoing, and asked for the public's help in identifying a suspect or suspects.",
      "Wild burros are protected under federal law. They are an iconic symbol of the American Southwest, dating to their days as pack animals for people flocking to California during the Gold Rush.",
      "Cheatham said burros have become an \u201cunofficial mascot\u201d of Moreno Valley, where hundreds of them have rambled freely for at least 75 years. They even help with wildfire abatement by munching on tinder- dry grass in remote and ready-to-burn canyons across Riverside and San Bernardino counties, he said.",
      "\u201cSo they really do provide a benefit to the community. The firefighters love them because, they say, \u2018Man, these guys can go places we can\u2019t go,\u2019 \u201d Cheatham said.",

      "Last year, neighboring San Bernardino County, where wild burros are estimated to number in the thousands, contracted with the nonprofit Peaceful Valley Donkey Rescue to humanely capture the animals and relocate them to sanctuaries.",
      "\u201cWhile the wild burros delight many residents and visitors, they also commonly encounter vehicle traffic and freight trains, resulting in tragedy for burros and humans,\u201d the county said in a statement. \u201cThe burros also seriously injure themselves leading to infection and death when they become entangled in fencing or when their hooves get caught in cemetery flower vases.\u201d",
      "The arrows used in the Moreno Valley attacks were broadheads, a style traditionally used for hunting, said Cheatham. According to DonkeyLand, the first attack occurred the weekend of June 14, when a young burro was found grazing with an arrow in her side not far from where Cupid was discovered. A few days later, a second burro was found shot with a similar style of arrow in the same area.",
      "Since then, at least three other donkeys were shot in the vicinity, including a pair estimated to be two to four months old, the rescue group said.",
      "Healthy donkeys typically live 40 years or more and vary in size from waist-high \u201cminis\u201d that may weigh 300 pounds (135 kilograms) to bulky \u201cmammoths.\u201d",
      "Last year, two men pleaded guilty to federal charges for using high-powered rifles to kill three wild burros in Southern California\u2019s Mojave Desert, about 90 miles (145 km) north of Moreno Valley.",

Tim Kaine says he will introduce two separate bipartisan resolutions this week that would terminate the national emergencies that Trump declared to justify the tariffs he has imposed on Canada and Brazil. In April, four Republicans voted with Democrats to block Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada, but the House never took it up.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Two brothers pleaded guilty on Tuesday to murder-related counts for the shooting death of a North Carolina sheriff's deputy three years ago when authorities said the officer approached a pickup truck late at night in a rural area.",
      "Alder Marin-Sotelo, 28, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in Wake County court in the killing of 48-year-old Deputy Ned Byrd, a K-9 officer. The man's brother, Arturo Marin-Sotelo, 32, pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to first-degree murder.",
      "Superior Court Judge Graham Shirley sentenced Alder Marin-Sotelo to life in prison without the chance for parole and Arturo Marin-Sotelo to a prison sentence of between roughly eight to 10 years.",
      "Both of them had previously been charged with murder and had otherwise been scheduled to go to trial in September 2026. Byrd's co-workers, family and friends filled the courtroom to see the plea agreements carried out.",

      "Freeman said evidence would have been presented at trial that showed Byrd was traveling the night of Aug, 11, 2022, in his patrol vehicle en route to a law enforcement training center for his dog when he noticed a pickup truck beside a fence on the side of a dark road. Byrd pulled over and moved his vehicle up to the truck.",
      "A recording from his in-car camera showed that Byrd got out of the vehicle, and mere seconds later six gunshots could be heard, followed later by the pickup leaving the scene, Freeman said. An autopsy determined that the officer was shot four times, three in the back of the head, the prosecutor said in court. The brothers, who were from Mexico, ultimately were located in separate vehicles in western North Carolina days after the shootings.",
      "Legal proceedings had been delayed largely because in April 2023, Alder Marin-Sotelo escaped from a Virginia jail where he was being held after pleading guilty months earlier to a federal charge of firearm possession by someone in the country unlawfully.",
      "The FBI said Alder Marin-Sotelo was taken into custody a few days later in Mexico. He was held there until February 2025, when Mexico agreed to send to the U.S. nearly 30 prisoners requested by the federal government.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The House passed legislation Tuesday that would overhaul how youth who commit crimes are prosecuted in the District of Columbia as congressional Republicans mobilized behind President Donald Trump's efforts to crack down on crime in the nation's capital.",
      "One of the bills, called the \u201cDC Crimes Act,\" would lower the age of a youth offender in the federal district from 24 to 18 and require that criminal sentencing be at least as long as the mandatory minimums for adults, overruling local D.C. policy. It would also require the D.C. attorney general to establish a public website that would publish statistics on youth criminal acts.",
      "The bill passed 240-179, with 30 Democrats joining Republicans in support.",
      "A second bill, the D.C. Juvenile Sentencing Reform Act passed by a narrower 225-203 margin, with eight Democrats backing the measure and one Republican \u2014 Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014 voting against it.",

Thousands of National Guard troops and federal law enforcement officers are patrolling the city's streets, thanks to a now-lapsed emergency order from Trump. Republicans have cheered the intervention and criticized how the city is run.",
      "The city filed a lawsuit challenging that National Guard intervention. Late Tuesday the administration entered a filing asking that a temporary injunction sought by the district be denied and the case be dismissed, partially on the grounds that the mayor has acknowledged the success of the actions. Twenty-three states weighed in on the lawsuit in support of the administration and 22 are behind the district.",
      "Still, the latest slate of D.C. legislation has an uncertain future in the Senate, where some Democratic support would be needed. Democrats have criticized Trump's aggressive intervention in the city's governance and affairs and have defended the ability of residents in the nation's capital to govern themselves.",
      "Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a Texas Democrat, said Trump is \"constantly attacking what Republicans used to call a small government and deciding to be the biggest government that you can find. It\u2019s truly shameful.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration has added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in nearly three decades",
      "MIAMI -- The Trump administration on Monday added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, a stinging rebuke to a traditional U.S. ally that reflects a recent surge in cocaine production and fraying ties between the White House and the country\u2019s leftist president.",
      "Even as it determined that Colombia had failed to comply with its international counternarcotics obligations, the Trump administration issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered major aid cuts, citing vital U.S. national interests.",

      "President Gustavo Petro, who has said on several occasions that whisky kills more people than cocaine, lamented Trump's decision during a televised cabinet meeting Monday, saying Colombia was penalized after sacrificing the lives of \u201cdozens of policemen, soldiers and regular citizens, trying to stop cocaine\u201d from reaching the United States.",
      "\u201cWhat we have been doing is not really relevant to the Colombian people,\u201d he said of the nation\u2019s antidrug efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s to stop North American society from smearing its noses\u201d in cocaine.",
      "The U.S. last added Colombia to the list, through a process known as decertification, in 1997 when the country\u2019s cartels \u2014 through threats of violence and money \u2014 had poisoned much of the nation\u2019s institutions.",
      "\"Decertification is a blunt tool and a huge irritant in bilateral relations that goes well beyond drug issues and makes cooperation far harder in any number of areas,\u201d said Adam Isacson, a security researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so rarely used.\u201d",
      "The president at the time, Ernesto Samper, was facing credible accusations of receiving illicit campaign contributions from the now-defunct Cali cartel and a plane he was set to use for a trip to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly session was found carrying 4 kilograms of heroin.",
      "A remarkable turnaround began once Samper left office. Successive U.S. administrations \u2014 both Republican and Democrats \u2014 sent billions in foreign assistance to Colombia to eradicate illegal coca crops, strengthen its armed forces in the fight against drug-fueled rebels and provide economic alternatives to poor farmers who are on the lowest rungs of the cocaine industry.",
      "That cooperation, a rare U.S. foreign policy success in Latin America, started to unravel following the suspension a decade ago of aerial eradication of coca fields with glyphosate. It followed a Colombia high court ruling that determined the U.S.-funded program was potentially harmful to the environment and farmers.",
      "A 2016 peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the nation\u2019s largest rebel group known as FARC, also committed Colombia to rolling back punitive policies likened to the U.S. spraying of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War in favor of state building, rural development and voluntary crop substitution.",
      "Since then, cocaine production has skyrocketed. The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. That is almost triple the size of New York City.",

      "\u201cThe failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership,\u201d Trump said in a presidential memo submitted to Congress. \u201cI will consider changing this designation if Colombia\u2019s government takes more aggressive action to eradicate coca and reduce cocaine production and trafficking, as well as hold those producing, trafficking, and benefiting from the production of cocaine responsible, including through improved cooperation with the United States to bring the leaders of Colombian criminal organizations to justice.\u201d",
      "Under U.S. law, the president annually must identify countries that have failed to meet their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months.",

      "A San Francisco supervisor who pushed to turn a 2-mile stretch of highway into a car-free park faces a recall vote in his district",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- During the coronavirus pandemic, the city closed a stretch of a four-lane highway along San Francisco\u2019s Pacific Coast and made it an automobile-free sanctuary where bicyclists and walkers flocked to exercise and socialize under open skies and to the sound of crashing waves.",
      "But with the post-pandemic return to school and work, resentment grew among neighborhood residents who relied on the artery to get around. Some blamed the district city supervisor who helped make the change permanent by placing on a citywide ballot a measure to turn the 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) stretch into a new park.",
      "On Tuesday, district voters will decide whether to recall Supervisor Joel Engardio.",
      "The recall of a local supervisor who represents one-tenth of a city of 800,000 might seem like minor politics. But the election highlights a San Francisco in flux and a still cranky, even emboldened electorate as leaders prepare to make tough decisions about the city\u2019s future.",
      "The recall election will be the city's third in four years. It's fueled by many of the same people who tossed out three liberal school board members in February 2022 followed by the ouster of politically progressive San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin in June of that year.",
      "\u201cThis recall is really about the future of our city,\u201d said Engardio in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cDo we want to be a city that just preserves itself in amber and goes back in time? Or do we want to be a city that innovates, thinks ahead, is forward-looking and welcomes new people?\u201d",
      "Engardio, a crime victims\u2019 advocate, supported the previous recalls. He was among detractors who said Boudin was too lenient on crime and the San Francisco Unified School Board too focused on progressive politics, including renaming 44 school sites.",
      "Later in 2022, he defeated an incumbent to win one of 11 seats on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Engardio represents the Sunset District, a low-key residential neighborhood of single-family homes on the west side with a high Chinese population.",
      "Last year, he was one of five city supervisors who placed a proposal to permanently ban cars from the Great Highway on the November 2024 ballot. Measure K passed citywide, but failed in his district. In May, recall petitioners submitted 10,500 valid signatures to qualify the initiative for Tuesday\u2019s ballot.",
      "On an overcast afternoon last week, people jogged and rode bikes down what had once been called the Great Highway. Moms pushed babies in strollers on a road divided by a median of blowing sand and creeping ice plant succulents, still striped with dotted white lines marking what used to be driving lanes. An older man walked by slowly, using a cane.",
      "The new park dubbed Sunset Dunes is popular with many San Francisco residents \u2014 but not so much with those in its home community.",
      "Backers of the recall say Engardio betrayed his constituents by going back on support for a compromise that would have kept the highway open to vehicles during the week and banned them on weekends. They say he failed to listen to their concerns about quality of life and traffic safety in the district.",

A quick emergency response saved his life, but the shooting left the 28-year-old father wounded where a bullet traveled through his arm and leg.",
      "Police had seized the car Hernandez was driving when he was shot and the $462 cash it contained as evidence. A friend took him to the police station to ask for his belongings on June 24 \u2014 not knowing the visit could mark the last time he enjoyed freedom in the United States.",
      "Hernandez is one of a growing number of crime victims and relatives who have been arrested and indefinitely detained pending removal proceedings during the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "In January, Immigration and Customs Enforcement rescinded a policy that had shielded many victims from detention and removal. The number of people applying for visas that allow some victims and their families to remain in the country has plummeted since then. Others are being detained as they go through the lengthy application process. Of those detained, many have been declared ineligible for release under another ICE policy change.",
      "Critics say the outcome is not only cruel to victims and their families but is harming public safety by making those who are in the U.S. illegally unlikely to report crimes and cooperate with police.",
      "\u201cThis type of thing is now the new normal. This scenario is happening every day in every city,\u201d said Dan Kowalski, a retired attorney who has been an expert on immigration law for decades. \u201cAny contact with any level or kind of state or federal law enforcement, civil or criminal, puts you in danger of detention by ICE.\u201d",

      "A native of Mexico who entered the U.S. illegally, Hernandez has been in federal custody for all of the 2 \u00bd months since he visited his police station. Police arrested him on an old warrant for failing to pay a traffic ticket, and he was turned over to ICE custody within hours.",
      "Hernandez has been apart from his 9-year-old son, unable attend medical appointments critical for recovering from his gunshot wounds, and unable to work the construction job that paid his family's bills.",
      "He was denied medicine for the first five days as he suffered in excruciating pain, he said.",
      "\u201cI was locked in a single cell for several days. It felt like forever,\u201d Hernandez recalled this month in court testimony, before a federal judge ruled that his indefinite federal detention without a bond hearing was illegal.",
      "It was 4 a.m. on June 21 when Hernandez cried out for help in downtown Muscatine, a city of 24,000 along the Mississippi River where he had lived with relatives since he arrived in the U.S. in 2021.",
      "Witnesses saw Hernandez behind the wheel of his Volkswagen Jetta covered in blood as he struggled to convey what happened to them in Spanish. A woman called 911, saying she believed he had been stabbed in the leg.",
      "Officers arrived from the nearby police station in minutes, and found blood pouring out of Hernandez\u2019s inner thigh and pooling on the seat. One wrapped a tourniquet around the wound to try to stop the blooding as Hernandez appeared to close his eyes and drift in and out of consciousness.",
      "Investigators learned that he hadn\u2019t been stabbed, but shot with a bullet that traveled through his left wrist and right thigh before exiting onto the floor of the driver\u2019s seat.",
      "An ambulance took him to a nearby hospital emergency room where doctors concluded he needed to be transported 40 miles away for advanced treatment at the University of Iowa hospital.",
      "There, doctors performed a surgery to remove bullet and bone fragments and gave him blood transfusions. His lawyer says those interventions saved Hernandez\u2019s life, but left him with him with a $27,000 hospital bill.",
      "Friends were stunned by the attack, saying Hernandez was a hard worker who avoided drugs and alcohol. He\u2019d stayed out of trouble during his more than four years in Muscatine with one exception: He\u2019d been pulled over and ticketed a couple times for driving without a license.",
      "When Hernandez arrived at the police station seeking his belongings, investigators were still looking for the suspects involved in his attempted robbery and shooting.",
      "Police told Hernandez that his car and cash were at an impound lot and he couldn't get them. Hernandez said an officer told him to wait while they researched his criminal history. He told them about the tickets.",
      "Police discovered Hernandez had a 7-month-old bench warrant, stemming from his failure to pay a $250 ticket for driving with a suspended license in November 2024. A judge issued the warrant last December after Hernandez didn\u2019t show up for a hearing that he said he didn't know about.",
      "A few months earlier, Muscatine Police Chief Anthony Kies had assured the city where roughly one in five residents is Hispanic that his officers would never inquire about immigration status.

      "Investigators obtained social media messages showing he had been in touch with a 20-year-old woman, Kimber Kallenberger, after she asked for money and food on a community Facebook forum.",
      "Kallenberger later told police she falsely told Hernandez she would have sex with him for cash in a plot to set him up to be robbed by her boyfriend. The plan was for her boyfriend, 18-year-old Justin Bass, to intimidate Hernandez with a gun to get the money but not to shoot him, she said.",
      "After Hernandez pulled up to meet her in an alley in a quiet neighborhood, he refused to give the money to Kallenberger. Bass shot him, police say, and took off running. A wounded Hernandez drove for several blocks before asking witnesses for help.",

It protected those carrying so-called U and T visas that allow crime and human trafficking victims and their relatives to remain in the country. The protections extended to those who had applied for such visas and were awaiting decisions, which can take years to process.",
      "Hernandez is seeking to apply for a U visa, and would appear to be eligible as the victim of a felony assault and key witness against the two charged in the attack. But the Muscatine County prosecutor Jim Barry has yet to certify his eligibility, according to Hernandez's attorney. Barry didn't respond to messages.",
      "The Biden-era policy also called on ICE agents to look for signs immigrants had been victimized and to consider that as \u201ca positive discretionary factor\u201d when deciding whether to detain them. The goal was to avoid discouraging immigrant victims from cooperating with police in reporting and solving crimes.",
      "But some conservatives have argued that victimization alone should not allow those in the country illegally to stay.",
      "The new policy allows ICE agents to detain crime victims, including the U and T visa holders, as long as they check with police \u201cto ensure criminal investigative and other enforcement actions will not be compromised.\" Agents aren\u2019t required to look for any evidence of victimization.",

      "Immigration lawyer Bethany Hoffmann said victims are rightly concerned that an application could put them on the government's radar.

      "\u201cI have been practicing for 17 years and I have never seen that before,\u201d she said, adding that the man had no criminal history but was subject to a 10-year-old removal order.",
      "Compounding the impact is another new practice in which ICE and immigration judges have required the indefinite detention of anyone who entered the country without permission.",
      "Over the past 30 years, immigration lawyers say many such detainees would have been able to be released pending removal proceedings as long as they were deemed not to be a flight risk or danger to the community. With a steady job, local relatives and a minimal criminal history, Hernandez would be a prime candidate for release.",
      "In a Sept. 5 decision, the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed with ICE's new position that all individuals who crossed the border without permission are ineligible for bond, regardless of how long they have been in the country.",
      "Several federal judges have rejected that argument. U.S. District Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger in Iowa became the latest on Sept. 10, ruling that Hernandez was not subject to mandatory detention. She ordered immigration authorities to provide Hernandez a bond hearing within seven days, saying his detention was causing \u201cirreparable harm.\" A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.",
      "At the end of his testimony on Sept. 5, Hernandez pleaded with the judge to protect his family from retaliation, saying they had done nothing wrong.",

      "\u201cI do feel proud of myself for getting in because not everyone gets accepted,\u201d said Kapua, 14, a freshman at Kamehameha Schools, a competitive private school with affordable tuition that gives preference to Native Hawaiians. \u201cI'm just, like, grateful for being able to have those opportunities.\"",
      "Kapua was just a baby when her parents set the stage for her acceptance at the school by adding details of her Native Hawaiian ancestry to a genealogy database. As an incoming seventh grader, she also took an admissions test and highlighted her kung fu skills and fluency in Hawaiian language.",
      "Kamehameha Schools gives admissions preference to the Indigenous people of Hawaii, with a caveat: \u201cto the extent permitted by law.\"",
      "A campaign is underway to test the policy's legality and stop Kamehameha from favoring Hawaiians, part of a movement to expand the legal definition of racial discrimination in education. Conservative activists have been emboldened by a Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action in college admissions and by the Trump administration's war against diversity, equity and inclusion. Now, they're targeting scholarships, academic programs and admissions policies tied directly or indirectly to race.",
      "Students for Fair Admissions, led by Edward Blum, a leading opponent of affirmative action, set up a website this month vowing to challenge Kamehameha's admissions policy in court. \"It is essentially impossible for a non-Native Hawaiian student to be admitted to Kamehameha,\u201d the site says.",

      "\u201cI'm hoping they hire a good lawyer, build a good case,\u201d said Andria Tupola, a 1998 graduate and a member of the Honolulu City Council. She says the school helped her build a stronger connection to Hawaiian culture.",
      "Attending Kamehameha can also be life-changing. The Native Hawaiian community struggles with higher rates of poverty and incarceration, so Hawaiian children may have educational disadvantages. Admission to Kamehameha offers a chance for quality private school education \u2014 with boundless opportunities, first-class facilities and Hawaiian cultural values.",
      "Along with a breathtaking ocean view, the sprawling Honolulu campus boasts top amenities \u2014 an Olympic-sized pool, buffet lunches, athlete laundry service and grounds adorned with native plants. An annual, elaborate Hawaiian song contest between high school classes is broadcast on local TV.",
      "Kamehameha Schools was founded by the will of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, the great-granddaughter of King Kamehameha I. When she died in 1884, her will directed the establishment of schools that give preference to Native Hawaiians. The endowment also supports scholarships to other private schools, plus community activities.",
      "Last year, more than 5,400 students enrolled across three Kamehameha campuses on Oahu, Maui and the Big Island.",
      "Each year, the number of applications exceeds the number of spaces by as much as 17 to 1, depending on the campus and grade, the Kamehameha website says.",
      "There\u2019s an understanding among Hawaii residents that only students with Hawaiian blood will be admitted. Many see the policy as a way to remedy disparities stemming from U.S. colonization and the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom by a group of American businessmen.",

      "Kalani Rosell was the first non-Hawaiian to graduate from Kamehameha Schools Maui in 2007. His acceptance drew sharp criticism from Hawaiians. The school said he had been selected after a list of qualified Hawaiian students had been exhausted.",
      "More than 15,000 people protested after a 2005 ruling by a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the policy of restricting admission to Hawaiians, ruling it violated federal civil rights law. Kamehameha sought a rehearing.",
      "The following year, the court upheld the policy. Kamehameha later settled with the family of the white student who brought the case when he was denied admission.",
      "\u201cWe anticipated that our nearly 140-year-old admissions policy, providing preference to Native Hawaiian children, would again be challenged,\" Kamehameha trustees said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident that our policy aligns with established law.\u201d",
      "When Kekoa Kealoha, who graduated in 2003, heard about the campaign against the school, he was shocked to hear it was led by \"somebody who was, like, a real heavy hitter.\"",

      "Each year during Hispanic Heritage Month, huge celebrations can be expected across the U.S. to showcase the diversity and culture of Hispanic people.",
      "This year, the Trump administration's immigration crackdowns, a federally led English-only initiative and an anti-diversity, equity and inclusion push have changed the national climate in which these celebrations occur. Organizers across the country, from Massachusetts and North Carolina to California and Washington state, have postponed or canceled heritage month festivals altogether.",
      "Celebrated each year from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, the month is a chance for many in the U.S. to learn about and celebrate the contributions of Hispanic cultures, the country\u2019s fastest-growing racial or ethnic minority, according to the U.S. Census. The group includes people whose ancestors come from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America.",
      "More than 68 million people identify as ethnically Hispanic in the U.S., according to the latest census estimates.",
      "Before there was National Hispanic Heritage Month, there was Hispanic Heritage Week, which was created through legislation sponsored by Mexican American U.S. Rep Edward R. Roybal of Los Angeles and signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson.",
      "The weeklong commemoration was expanded to a month two decades later, with legislation signed into law by President Ronald Reagan.",
      "\u201cIt was clustered around big celebrations for the community,\u201d Alberto Lammers, director of communications at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute said. \u201cIt became a chance for people to know Hispanic cultures, for Latinos to get to know a community better and for the American public to understand a little better the long history of Latinos in the U.S.\u201d",
      "Sept. 15 was chosen as the starting point to coincide with the anniversary of \u201cEl Grito de Dolores,\u201d or the \u201cCry of Dolores,\u201d which was issued in 1810 from a town in Mexico that launched the country\u2019s war for independence from Spain.",
      "The Central American nations of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica celebrate their independence on Sept. 15 and Mexico marks its national day on Sept. 16, the day after the cry for independence.",
      "Also during National Hispanic Heritage Month, the South American nation of Chile observes its independence day on Sept. 18.",
      "The White House so far has not mentioned any planned events. Last year, President Joe Biden hosted a reception and issued a proclamation for the occasion.",
      "Hispanic was a term coined by the federal government for people descended from Spanish-speaking cultures. But for some, the label has a connotation of political conservatism and emphasizes a connection to Spain. It sometimes gets mistakenly interchanged with \u201cLatino\u201d or \"Latinx.\u201d",
      "For some, Latino reflects their ties to Latin America. So some celebrations are referred to as Latinx or Latin Heritage Month.",
      "Latin Americans are not a monolith. There are several other identifiers for Latin Americans, depending largely on personal preference. Mexican Americans who grew up during the 1960s Civil Rights era may identify as Chicano. Other may go by their family\u2019s nation of origin such as Colombian American or Salvadoran American.",
      "Each culture has unique differences when it comes to music, food, art and other cultural touchstones.",
      "September typically has no shortage of festivities. Events often include traditional Latin foods and entertainment like mariachi bands, folkl\u00f3rico and salsa dance lessons. The intent is to showcase the culture of Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and other Latin countries.",

Some companies and universities have followed suit.",
      "Early in September, organizers of a Mexican Independence festival in Chicago announced they would postpone celebrations due to Trump\u2019s promises of an immigration crackdown in the city.",
      "\u201cIt was a painful decision, but holding El Grito Chicago at this time puts the safety of our community at stake \u2014 and that\u2019s a risk we are unwilling to take,\u201d said the organizers of the festival.",
      "A new date has not yet been announced. Though Mexican Independence Day falls on Sept. 16, celebrations in Chicago typically span more than a week and draw hundreds of thousands of participants for lively parades, festivals, street parties and car caravans.",
      "\u201cThe fact that the federal government is sending troops as we start these celebrations is an insult,\u201d Illinois state Sen. Karina Villa, a Democrat, said at a news conference. \u201cIt is a fear tactic. It\u2019s unforgivable.\u201d",
      "Similarly, Sacramento's annual Mexican Independence Day festival was canceled with organizers citing the political climate and safety concerns.",

      "Some would-be international students are not showing up on American campuses this fall despite offers of admission because of logjams with visa applications, which the Trump administration slowed this summer while it rolled out additional vetting. Others have had second thoughts because of the administration's wider immigration crackdown and the abrupt termination of some students' legal status.",
      "But none face bigger obstacles than the students hit with travel bans. Last year, the State Department issued more than 5,700 F-1 and J-1 visas \u2014 which are used by foreign students and researchers \u2014 to people in the 19 travel ban-affected countries between May and September.

Seven other countries have tighter restrictions that also apply to student visas.",

He has called some of the countries\u2019 screening processes \u201cdeficient\u201d and said he plans to keep the ban in place until \u201cidentified inadequacies\u201d are addressed.",

    "summary": "One of Hollywood's leading actors, Robert Redford starred in such movies as \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and \"The Way We Were.\"",
    "story": [
      "Academy Award-winning actor and director Robert Redford, one of the biggest movie stars to ever grace the screen and whose startlingly magnetic charisma in such films as \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" \"The Way We Were\" and \"The Sting\" made him an icon, has died. He was 89.",
      "Cindi Berger, CEO of the publicity firm Rogers & Cowan PMK, confirmed Redford's death to CBS News in a statement. Berger said he died Tuesday at his home in the mountains of Utah surrounded by those he loved. She didn't provide details about the circumstances surrounding his death.",
      "Barbra Streisand, who starred alongside Redford in the 1973 romantic drama \"The Way We Were,\" said the Hollywood legend was \"one of the finest actors ever\" in a tribute on social media.",
      "\"Every day on the set of The Way We Were was exciting, intense and pure joy,\" Streisand said. \"We were such opposites: he was from the world of horses; I was allergic to them! Yet, we kept trying to find out more about each other, just like the characters in the movie.\"",
      "Actor Robin Wright, who worked with Redford on his 2010 film \"The Conspirator,\" praised the actor and director during an interview on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" after news of his death was announced.",
      "\"He was amazing,\" Wright said. \"I mean, what an icon, and his body of work will live on forever. And to be able to be directed by an actor, that was fantastic, and that's such a rarity. And he's an icon that's going to be greatly missed.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters outside the White House before traveling to the U.K., President Trump said, \"I'll tell you, Robert Redford was great. He had a series of years that he was \u2014 there was nobody better.\"",
      "Redford burst into the Hollywood stratosphere in the late 1960s, when he was paired with Paul Newman in the Western \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" Their charm playing lovable outlaws was undeniable, but it would be Redford's nonchalance about his striking good looks that helped sell his characters \u2014 in comedies, dramas and adventures \u2014 making him one of the leading box office draws of the 1970s and '80s.",
      "Then, as founder of the Sundance Institute, he used his celebrity to help nurture independent films while promoting generations of young filmmakers, as well as environmental and social justice issues. Since 1985, the institute has hosted the internationally famous Sundance Film Festival, which has been the launching pad for innumerable talents, from Quentin Tarantino, John Sayles and Christopher Nolan to the Coen brothers. In 1989, the New York Times called Redford \"a godfather to the American independent film movement.\"",
      "In a joint statement with other Sundance Institute leadership, acting CEO Amanda Kelso said, \"Today is a sad day for the Sundance Institute community. Bob's vision launched a movement that, over four decades later, has inspired generations of artists and redefined cinema in the U.S. and around the world.\"",
      "\"The vibrant storytelling landscape we cherish today, both as artists and audiences, is unimaginable without his passionate drive and principled leadership. Beyond Bob's enormous contributions to culture at large, we will miss his generosity, clarity of purpose, curiosity, rebellious spirit, and his love for the creative process,\" the statement said, in part.",
      "According to Redford, his fame was hardly predictable.",
      "\"I was so much the last choice\" for the role of the Sundance Kid, he told CBS' \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006. \"They tried everything to keep me out of the picture because I wasn't known, compared to Paul [Newman].\"",
      "His performance changed all that. The comedy-drama, directed by George Roy Hill, topped the box office chart for 1969.",
      "Four years later, Redford and Newman teamed up again in Hill's caper \"The Sting,\" which won seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Redford was also nominated for best actor for his performance as a small-time con artist out for revenge against a big-city gambler (played by Robert Shaw).",
      "Redford would star in 16 features between 1969 and 1980, many of them hits that traded on his remarkable screen presence: \"Downhill Racer,\" \"The Hot Rock,\" \"Jeremiah Johnson,\" \"The Candidate,\" \"The Great Gatsby\" with Mia Farrow, \"The Great Waldo Pepper,\" \"Three Days of the Condor\" with Faye Dunaway, \"The Electric Horseman\" with Jane Fonda and \"Brubaker.\" So bright was his star power that he reportedly earned a $2 million paycheck for what was barely a walk-on in the World War II epic \"A Bridge Too Far.\"",
      "But his most surprising film was one which he produced and fought for: the acclaimed 1976 drama \"All the President's Men,\" the story of Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who uncovered the Watergate scandal.",
      "\"It took four years, and the studio, they said, 'Politics? I don't think so,'\" Redford said in 2006. \"You know, 'Watergate is a dead issue.' And I said, 'It's not. It's a detective story about investigative journalism and about the American trait of hard work, and hard work led to something that spared us the loss of our First Amendment. That, to me, is worth making.'\"",
      "The film was nominated for eight Oscars and won four, including for its screenplay by William Goldman, and for Jason Robards' performance as Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.",
      "Redford starred in hit after hit, but he told \"Sunday Morning \" in 2018 many of those films he's never watched. Really? \"I don't know. I haven't ever counted 'em, but a lot,\" Redford said. \"'Cause I thought if I look at myself too much, I'm gonna be too aware of myself and that means when I go to do something new, I won't be able to do it without being slightly aware of what I'm doing rather than just being free.\"",
      "He moved on to a job where he wouldn't have to look at himself \u2014 behind the camera, as director of \"Ordinary People.\" Based on the novel by Judith Guest, it tells of an affluent family whose veneer of stability is shattered after one son dies in a boating accident and another attempts suicide. It starred Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore in a rare dramatic role, Judd Hirsch and Timothy Hutton, who won a best supporting actor Academy Award for his feature film debut. The film also won best picture, and for Redford a best director Oscar.",
      "In the decade following \"Ordinary People,\" he appeared on screen only a few times \u2014 in the baseball tale \"The Natural,\" the Oscar-winning \"Out of Africa\" opposite Meryl Streep, and the romantic comedy \"Legal Eagles.\"",
      "He would also return to the director's chair eight times, with an eclectic mix of stories and genres: \"The Milagro Beanfield War,\" about a land war pitting a Hispanic farmer against real estate interests; \"A River Runs Though It,\" a period drama of family and fly-fishing, with Brad Pitt; \"Quiz Show,\" about TV's quiz show scandal in the 1950s; \"The Horse Whisperer,\" about a horse trainer with a remarkable gift; \"The Legend of Bagger Vance,\" a golf fable with Will Smith and Matt Damon; \"Lions for Lambs,\" a political drama of wartime co-starring Tom Cruise and Streep; \"The Conspirator,\" about the Confederate plot surrounding Lincoln's assassination; and the political thriller \"The Company You Keep.\"",
      "\"One of the lions has passed,\" Streep said in a statement Tuesday. \"Rest in peace my lovely friend.\"",
      "Scarlett Johansson, who said Redford cast her in \"The Horse Whisperer\" when she was just 11 years old, remembered him as someone who was \"patient and warm and kind.\"",
      "\"Every day before each scene, he would take the time to sit with me and walk me through all of the beats that led my character up until that particular point in the story. No matter the reality of the days rush, I always felt he had all the time in the world for our work,\" Johansson said. \"Bob taught me what acting could be, and it was from his generosity and patience that I was inspired to pursue the possibilities of the craft.\"",
      "Redford made perhaps his biggest contribution to movies by founding the Sundance Institute, which developed and fostered the work of young and diverse independent filmmakers outside of mainstream Hollywood. Begun in 1981, Sundance encompassed workshops with writers, directors and actors, and later hosted the internationally recognized film festival.",
      "Asked by Collider in 2019 his reasons for founding the institute, Redford said, \"The goal for me was very simple: to celebrate people who don't get celebrated, who are ignored or undiscovered and who deserve to be discovered.\"",
      "The road to stardom",
      "Charles Robert Redford Jr. was born on Aug. 18, 1936, in Santa Monica, California. Raised in Van Nuys, Redford described his neighborhood as \"lower working class.\" Though he lived in the shadow of Hollywood, he had no interest in a career in the movies.",
      "\"I grew up in kind of a rough neighborhood,\" he said. \"We'd go to matinees, any time there was a love scene on the screen, we'd go, 'Oh boo, you tell 'em lover,' you know, and make fun of the scene. The idea that I would be that guy is just too much for me to take!\"",
      "He attended the University of Colorado in Boulder, where he had an athletic scholarship, but was kicked out after his freshman year for drinking, shortly after the death of his mother, Martha, in 1955.",
      "He ventured to Europe, studying art in France, Italy and Spain, before settling in New York City, where he took art classes at the Pratt Institute while also studying acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He described being self-conscious in his early experiences onstage, but soon recognized \"something unfamiliar was clicking inside.\" He performed in school productions of \"The Seagull\" and \"Antigone,\" attracting an agent, and was soon on Broadway in \"Tall Story\" and \"The Highest Tree,\" before starring with Julie Harris in \"Little Moon of Alban,\" in 1960.",
      "He also made guest appearances on TV shows such as \"Maverick,\" \"Playhouse 90,\" \"Perry Mason,\" \"Naked City,\" \"Route 66\" and \"The Twilight Zone.\" He co-starred with Jason Robards in a 1960 TV version of Eugene O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh,\" directed by Sidney Lumet.",
      "In 1961 he starred on Broadway in \"Sunday in New York,\" and two years later in the Neil Simon comedy \"Barefoot in the Park,\" directed by Mike Nichols. It was a role he repeated in the 1967 film, opposite Jane Fonda.",
      "\"I held some fantasy out in my head that I would return to art, and I carried that maybe five years into my acting career,\" Redford said, \"and then finally one day just looked at myself in the mirror, and I said, 'Who are we kidding? This is what you do. This is what you do well and like it. Give up the idea that you're going to maintain this career in art.'\"",
      "His film appearances grew following a big screen debut in the 1962 World War II drama \"War Hunt\" (co-starring future director Sydney Pollack).",
      "But Redford wasn't considered a big enough name to co-star with Paul Newman in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" \u2014 the studio wanted anyone but him, even after the film's director and screenwriter went to bat for him. It wasn't until Newman, 11 years his senior and already a big name, met with Redford and told the studio he wanted Redford to co-star, that he got the part.",
      "It was a generosity that Redford returned some years later, when he went to bat for Newman to co-star in \"The Sting.\"",
      "\"Follow the money\"",
      "While on a press tour for \"The Candidate,\" his 1972 satire about a California lawyer's run for Senate against a popular incumbent, Redford sought out Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward after reading some of the reports he and Carl Bernstein had written on the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. The movie star was rebuffed. [Bernstein feared Republican backlash to their reporting if it was found out they were talking with Hollywood.] They finally met up in 1973, along with screenwriter William Goldman, and in 1974 Redford bought the film rights to the pair's yet-to-be-published book, \"All the President's Men,\" for $450,000.",
      "Starring Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, and directed by Alan J. Pakula, the film captured the intensity of the reporters' hunt for answers as they sought to \"follow the money\" and unravel the Watergate scandal.",
      "Never mind that audiences knew how the story ended (Nixon resigned); the film was a critical and commercial hit, and became an inspiration for generations of young journalists.",
      "Once Redford had gotten the taste of directing with \"Ordinary People,\" his appearances in front of the camera grew fewer: \"Havana,\" \"Sneakers,\" \"Indecent Proposal,\" \"Up Close & Personal,\" \"The Last Castle,\" \"Spy Game,\" and \"An Unfinished Life\" filled out his acting resume for the years between 1990 and 2005. He also narrated the 1992 documentary \"Incident at Oglala,\" about Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier. Redford's companies, Wildwood Enterprises and Sundance Productions, produced at least two dozen feature films.",
      "Meanwhile, much of his energy was devoted to the success of the Sundance Institute and its film festival, held in the mountains of Utah each January.",
      "Welcome to Sundance",
      "In 1978 the Utah Film Commission established the United States Film Festival as a means to draw visitors to the Wasatch Mountains for something other than skiing. The festival was co-created by Sterling Van Wagenen, who was a cousin of Redford's then-wife, Lola Van Wagenen. Advocating to include independent features in the program, Redford agreed to show up at the festival and participate in a panel. Afterwards, he formed the Sundance Institute, to aid filmmakers wishing to make stories that could not find a home among Hollywood studios that were chasing hugely commercial pictures.",
      "In 1985 the U.S. Film & Video Festival was struggling financially, and so Sundance took it over, eventually replacing the name with its own. Moved to Park City, the festival drew ever-increasing numbers of filmmakers, buyers, agents, publicists, journalists and fans to the tiny town. Beyond the festival, industry professionals would mentor young filmmakers in workshops and screenwriting labs. Wes Anderson's \"Bottle Rocket,\" Kimberly Peirce's \"Boys Don't Cry,\" Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Hard Eight,\" and Miranda July's \"Me and You and Everyone We Know\" were all developed in the Sundance Labs.",
      "In 1989 the festival blew up with the success of Stephen Soderbergh's \"sex, lies, and videotape,\" which won the Audience Award and was picked up by Miramax. Its subsequent theatrical release earned the low-budget dramedy a cool $25 million and an Oscar nomination.",
      "Since then, films and filmmakers who have broken out at the festival have included Quentin Tarantino (\"Reservoir Dogs\"), Robert Rodriguez (\"El Mariachi\"), Kevin Smith (\"Clerks\"), Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\"), Todd Solandz (\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\"), Ryan Coogler (\"Fruitvale Station\"), Damien Chazelle (\"Whiplash\"), Jordan Peele (\"Get Out\"), and the audience favorites \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" and \"The Blair Witch Project.\"",
      "Sundance also started a program to develop theatrical works, which has resulted in such productions as \"The Laramie Project,\" \"Light in the Piazza,\" and \"Angels in America.\"",
      "Not quite retiring",
      "In 2012 Redford was executive producer and narrator of the documentary \"Watershed,\" about the politics surrounding the Colorado River \u2014 the environmental and cultural damage from misuse of a vital natural resource. Asked by ThinkProgress whether his films can make a difference, Redford said, \"I've given up the idea that I can really change anything, and I just do the best I can. It's either that or do nothing, and we know that nothing doesn't work.\"",
      "The following year Redford starred in \"All Is Lost,\" playing a solo sailor facing disaster at sea when his small craft is crippled in an accident. He did much of the stunt work himself, in a \"storm-tossed\" water tank (the spray from fire hoses cost him partial hearing in one ear). He was hailed for his remarkable performance in which he uttered virtually no dialogue.",
      "\"All in all, it was worth it,\" he told the Salt Lake Tribune. \"I'm proud of the work. I felt it was a chance to do something at this point that was different and bold.\"",
      "Redford also added his name to the roster of Hollywood stars recruited for the Marvel Universe, appearing in \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" and \"Avengers: Endgame\" as (spoiler alert) the leader of a plot against S.H.I.E.L.D. He also starred opposite Nick Nolte in \"A Walk in the Woods,\" played Dan Rather in \"Truth,\" and appeared opposite an animated creature in the Disney film \"Pete's Dragon.\" He also reteamed with Jane Fonda in the romance \"Our Souls at Night,\" their fourth film together.",
      "In 2018 he starred in \"The Old Man & the Gun,\" as an aging bank robber on the run. Redford told \"Sunday Morning\" that he connected very easily with the protagonist as an outlaw: \"I think probably I must've been born with an outlaw sensibility, in terms of my nature, yeah. Because from the time I was just a little kid, I was always wanting to go away from the rules. I wanted to \u2014 I didn't want to break any, I just didn't want to be held by them. In kindergarten, I ran away three times!\"",
      "With the film's release he announced he would be retiring from acting \u2014 but he remained active with voice work and producing documentaries.",
      "In addition to his Oscar win for \"Ordinary People,\" Redford was nominated for directing and producing \"Quiz Show,\" and in 2002 he received an honorary Academy Award for his impact on the industry. Three years later he was named a Kennedy Center honoree. At the Washington ceremony, Paul Newman ribbed Redford, referring to his reputation for lateness: \"Backstage they think the only reason he's even in the vicinity was because they told him this whole thing was yesterday.\"",
      "In 2016 Redford received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The citation read: \"His art and activism continue to shape our nation's cultural heritage, inspiring millions to laugh, cry, think, and change.\" At the presentation ceremony, President Barack Obama remarked, \"As an actor, director, producer, and as an advocate, he has not stopped \u2014 and apparently drives so fast that he had breakfast in Napa and dinner in Salt Lake.\"",
      "Redford was married to Lola Van Wagenen in 1958; they divorced in 1995. They had four children: Scott, who died at age 2 months from sudden infant death syndrome; Shauna, an artist; James (Jamie), a filmmaker and environmental activist, who died of cancer in 2020; and Amy, a director.",
      "In 2009, Redford married artist and environmental activist Sibylle Szaggars.",
      "In 2018, the private Redford reflected to \"Sunday Morning\" on a favorite saying by T.S. Eliot: \"'There's only the trying. The rest is not our business.' It's one of my favorite phrases. Because you can't guarantee where the trying is going to get you. So, you can't guarantee the result. The only thing there is in its place is the trying. That's where the action is.\"",

      "Al-Jasser had been convicted of terrorism and high treason on the basis of posts he was accused of authoring, according to UNESCO.",
      "UNESCO's director general Audrey Azoulay condemned his execution, saying: \"A death sentence imposed on journalists constitutes a serious attack on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. Journalists must be able to report without fear for their lives or safety.\"",
      "Reporters Without Borders, an organization that works to protect journalists, branded the charges against Al-Jasser as \"false.\"",
      "\"This execution of a journalist went forward to very little international criticism and this is clearly a result of these billions that had been invested in the country's whitewashing strategy,\" Shea told CBS News.",
      "When asked whether they believed the comedians would be able to freely tell jokes at the festival, the HRW researcher predicted there would be clear red lines drawn by organizers to prevent any criticism of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, who has already taken over as ruler of the highly conservative Islamic kingdom, as well as his policies and the broader royal family.",
      "Shea called on the high-profile entertainers attending the event \u2014 funding for which comes from the Saudi government's General Entertainment Authority \u2014   to mitigate the positive effect that their presence might have on the country's reputation for human rights abuses, including by \"speaking out about the abuses.\"",
      "Tim Dillon, one of the comedians scheduled to perform at the Riyadh festival, claimed on his podcast that he's being paid $315,000 for a single show, and that some of his more famous colleagues would receive around $1.6 million for their appearances.",
      "CBS News has contacted the publicists representing billed attendees Bill Burr, Mark Normand, Kevin Hart, Sebastian Maniscalco, Dave Chapelle, Louis C.K., Whitney Cummings, Tom Segura, Andrew Schulz and Jim Jeffries, but has received no comment from any of them regarding their expected appearances in Saudi Arabia.",
      "CBS News asked Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment on HRW's assertions, but has not received a response.",
      "One of the highest-profile cases of the Saudis' purported efforts to change their image came in 2021, with the launch of LIV Golf, a golf league that saw seasoned professionals defect from the famed PGA Tour in exchange for highly profitable contracts.",
      "Critics accused the golfers of helping the Saudi government to \"sportswash\" its reputation, only three years after Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, an outspoken critic of the county's leadership, was brutally murdered inside a Saudi diplomatic office in Istanbul, Turkey.",
      "A CIA report concluded with a medium to high degree of confidence that the killing was likely carried out at bin Salman's orders.",
      "In a 2019 interview with CBS' 60 Minutes, bin Salman denied ordering Khashoggi's assassination, but said he took responsibility for it.",

    "published": "Sun, 14 Sep 2025 10:18:50 -0400",
    "summary": "Now showing at Chicago's Art Institute, an exhibition of works by Gustave Caillebotte offers a fresh perspective on a French painter ripe for rediscovery.",
    "story": [
      "Monet \u2026 Degas \u2026 Renoir. When we think of French Impressionism, it's the usual suspects who spring to mind. But one lesser-known artist is ripe for rediscovery.",
      "\"Gustave Caillebotte is probably the least-known of the Impressionist painters,\" said Gloria Groom, co-curator of a new exhibition of the works of Caillebotte, now on display at the Art Institute of Chicago. \"I think he's still not completely integrated into that story. He's still kind of the outsider.\"",
      "The museum has long been home to the artist's most recognizable painting, \"Paris Street - Rainy Day.\"",
      "\"People, they may not know Gustave Caillebotte's name, but if you say the painting with the umbrellas, they all know it,\" said Groom. \"And so you start thinking, okay, it's all about this bourgeois couple walking down the street. But it's not, because there's a painter with a ladder, the charwoman who's opening her umbrella, all these different types of people.\"",
      "\"Paris Street - Rainy Day\" played a supporting role in the beloved movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\". While it was out on loan, museum-goers were bereft. \"We got letters,\" said Groom. \"But you can't be part of an exhibition to be a partner if you don't lend the major work for the exhibition. So, we made that sacrifice. And now we're celebrating its return.\"",
      "The exhibition looks at Caillebotte's work from a new perspective. While his peers were painting ballerinas and landscapes, Caillebotte's canvases focused on men to a degree unusual for the time.",
      "Groom said, \"He's looking at the men in his life, he's looking at the relationships. But he's not just doing, you know, macho masculinity. He's doing men in interiors, men on sofas, men looking out a window, kind of turning the tables in many ways.\"",
      "Some of the paintings scandalized the French art establishment. \"The Floor Scrapers\" was rejected from a prestigious art exhibition.",
      "And, at another exhibition, a painting featuring a nude man was relegated to a small, inaccessible room. \"It's a male nude, but not an Adonis,\" said Groom. \"It's shocking even today. It's a beautiful, beautiful painting, and it's sensuous. Let's face it, it's sensuous!\"",
      "When this exhibition opened in Paris last year with the title \"Painting Men,\" some critics condemned what they considered the show's insinuation of Caillebotte's homosexuality. The artist never married, but shared the last decade or so of his life with a female companion.",
      "But the show moved on to Chicago with a new title \u2013 \"Painting His World\" \u2013 which has others saying the changed title minimizes the artist's focus on the same sex.",
      "Gloria Groom says, quite simply, the paintings speak for themselves: \"The paintings are the paintings, and that's what we're interested in. We try to open it up to all kinds of interpretations, and people will see what they want to see.\"",
      "Gustave Caillebotte died in 1894. He was just 45. All these decades later, people are still seeing what they want to in his beguiling artistry.",

    "summary": "The actor-comedian talks about his new horror film \"Him,\" in which he plays an aging football superstar tempting a rookie quarterback with an evil bargain, and how he learned to turn personal loss into dramatic power.",
    "story": [
      "Just a stone's throw from the concert halls of New York's Lincoln Center is another place where creative dreams come true: LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, a launching pad for the most talented teens in New York. Liza Minnelli studied here; so did Billy Dee Williams, Jennifer Aniston, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, and Adrien Brody. \"A two-time Oscar-winner, look at that!\" said Brody's former classmate, Marlon Wayans, Class of 1990. \"Makes me so proud. We used to give him wedgies!\"",
      "As an actor, writer and producer, Wayans is behind some of the best-loved projects in recent memory, like the \"Scary Movie\" franchise, a comic satire of horror films. There have been five \"Scary\" movies (some without the Wayans brothers), but they're back at the helm for the upcoming #6 next year.",
      "And when he's not making movies, Marlon Wayans tours on the live stand-up comedy circuit. He also turns out streaming comedy specials like clockwork. \"Probably a year that I had a day off,\" he said. \"Probably three years since I had a vacation.\"",
      "I asked, \"What are you chasing?\"",
      "\"I don't know if I'm chasing, or if I'm running from something!\" he laughed. And for his latest role, he had to do both.",
      "In the new psychological horror film \"Him,\" a rookie quarterback (played by Tyriq Withers) wants to be the greatest. Marlon Wayans is an aging football superstar who's going to help him. At first he's a likeable coach, but he morphs into a something evil.",
      "Is he the Devil in this film? \"No, I think I'm just one of the people that the Devil uses to entice the people who sell their soul,\" Wayans said.",
      "To watch a trailer for the film \"Him,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The notion of trading your soul for athletic immortality is one of the all-time great storylines. You might recall \"Damn Yankees,\" with a hopeful fan striking a deal with the Devil. And as the Devil's advocate in \"Him,\" Wayans' character puts the rookie quarterback through hell. \"The movie seems like, 'Oh, you're selling your soul to the Devil.' The Devil exists every day, everywhere,\" Wayans said. \"At least 20 times a day you are gonna be faced with God or the Devil. So, it's a choice. Everything you do is a choice.\"",
      "It's a big change for someone raised on comedy. Marlon Wayans is the youngest of 10 siblings, in the comedy dynasty known as the Wayans family. He often worked with his brothers, like when he teamed up with Shawn as an undercover FBI agent in the 2004 cult favorite \"White Chicks.\"",
      "Family is still the bedrock of Wayans' life, and the passing of some close relatives and friends over the past few years hit especially hard, as he described in his 2024 special \"Good Grief\":",
      "\"I've been dodging depression for the last three years. I lost my momma three years ago. And let me tell you y'all something, ain't no pain, ain't no nothing like losing your momma.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you think losing all these people in such a short span of time, that pain, informs your acting?\"",
      "\"Yes, because I used to have to manufacture tears,\" Marlon said. \"My mother died ... it's all I gotta think about. It's right there. It's right behind my eyes. I don't need 20 minutes to go think about stuff no more.\"",
      "Wayans has learned how to turn personal loss into dramatic power. He was told he was the only one considered for his role in \"Him,\" a sign that his time may have finally come.",
      "He said, \"It took me doing the work for 53 years to feel special.\"",
      "\"You didn't feel special?\" I asked.",
      "\"I felt like I was working towards something.\"",
      "\"And now you feel like that something is here?\"",
      "\"I feel like it's never there, but it's getting closer,\" he replied.",
      "To date, Marlon Wayans' movies alone are said to have grossed nearly $2 billion, and there are more on the way. But he says he'll never forget LaGuardia, the unique school where it all started. \"I'll always love this city, and I'll always love this school. This is my baby for life. I hope these kids know how good they got it.\"",
      "He almost didn't get to go. His father didn't want him to attend. \"Nah, my dad, he was super-religious, and he was kind of a homophobe; he didn't want me wearing tights! 'Cause you have to wear tights when you come to this school.\"",
      "The late LaGuardia drama teacher Peter Treitler gave him permission to wear sweatpants instead, a little thing that changed Marlon's life forever.",
      "Mr. Treitler's words are still alive in Marlon's heart: \"He said, 'I'll make a deal with you: If you go to this school, you work harder than anybody else here, and you be special.' Young people need people that believe in them and see they're great. But young people gotta do the work so they can see they're great.\"",
      "\"Well, that's the thing, is you took that and ran with it,\" I said.",
      "Wayans replied, \"I'm still running with it.\"",

      "In 2010, their namesake label, Veronica Beard, was born, along with its now-iconic Dickey Jacket. The early days were anything but glamorous. Swanson Beard set up a makeshift showroom in her apartment, juggling young children and a dog, while Miele Beard announced mid-launch that she was pregnant with her fifth child. Between the two, they had eight children and a fledgling business.",
      "Their breakthrough came with Saks Fifth Avenue, which gave the brand its first major retail platform. From there, Veronica Beard rapidly grew, and today boasts 42 stores worldwide, including a flagship location on Madison Avenue in New York City.",
      "\"It was the most thrilling moment of our career,\" Swanson Beard said of the store opening. \"It was the physical manifestation of all of our hopes and dreams.\"",
      "Fifteen years later, the brand has evolved into a full lifestyle label, offering ready-to-wear, denim, shoes, and handbags, while still promoting the power of a great blazer.",
      "\"We love the idea of the uniform being your blazer with jeans,\" said Miele Beard. \"Get your best pair of jeans, throw on a white tank and a jacket, and you're done. You've just elevated your style.\"",
      "The Dickey Jacket remains the brand's signature piece. When Gwyneth Paltrow featured it on Goop, the Beards knew they had made it.",
      "\"For us, that was like being on Oprah's list,\" Swanson Beard said.",
      "Beyond fashion, the duo is committed to giving back. Their philanthropic initiative, Veronica Beard Gives Back, supports causes including Feeding America, the American Heart Association, and the Council of Fashion Designers of America.",
      "Their mission resonates with the women who choose their clothes. Recently, Katherine, Princess of Wales wore a Veronica Beard dress to announce she had completed her cancer treatment.",
      "\"She could have chosen a power suit to say, 'I'm strong,'\" said Swanson Beard. \"Instead, she chose something feminine and earthy. I was so emotional about it.\"",
      "At its heart, Veronica Beard is more than a label; it's a mantra.",
      "\"We always say our battle cry is 'make it happen,'\" Swanson Beard explained. \"For us, being the clothes on a woman's back when she's making it happen is the greatest thing in the world.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 19:44:42 -0400",
    "summary": "With the U.S. economy facing headwinds, the Federal Reserve faces pressure to trim interest rates this week for the first time since December 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's rate decision on Wednesday is shaping up to be its most consequential of the year, with most economists predicting the first cut of 2025. The real suspense is over how deep the reduction could be \u2014 and whether the Fed might signal a broader pivot that could set the course for the rest of the year.",
      "So far, the Fed has resisted calls from President Trump to cut its benchmark interest rate, which helps determine borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Mr. Trump has pointed to the fact that inflation has remained\u00a0relatively muted, so far this year, as evidence the central bank has been too late in lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Apart from Mr. Trump's push for a cut, the Federal Reserve is facing growing economic uncertainty ahead of its Sept. 17 meeting, raising the stakes for a rate decision.",
      "On the one hand, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with hiring slowing to a standstill, which would argue for a cut. But inflation is also creeping higher under the weight of the Trump administration's tariffs, an issue that the Fed has pointed to as its reason for keeping the benchmark rate unchanged so far this year.",
      "Adding to the complications is Mr. Trump's pressure on the Fed to reduce rates. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has responded by stressing the independence of the Federal Reserve, pointing out that the Federal Open Market Committee, its 12-member rate-setting group, relies on economic data to make its policy decisions, rather than political pressure.",
      "\"The committee tries to get a complete picture of the biggest downside risks for the economy, and then at the end of the meeting, there needs to be some sort of weighting \u2014 it's an art as much as science,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, an economics professor at Villanova University.",
      "When will the Fed announce its rate decision?",
      "The Fed will announce its next rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Sept. 17.",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point cut stands at 96%, according to CME FedWatch, which relies on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices to determine the likelihood. There's only a 4% probability of a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, the tracker says.",
      "Economists will also be listening for whether the Fed provides guidance on whether it expects additional rate cuts at its next two meetings in 2025, set for Oct. 29 and Dec. 10.",
      "What data will determine the Fed's decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep inflation low while also ensuring full employment.",
      "But those two goals can be in conflict with each other because rising inflation requires the Fed to boost interest rates, which tamps down spending by making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow. The Fed's best weapon for fighting high unemployment, however, is to cut rates, as that makes it cheaper for businesses to expand and hire more workers.",
      "Fed officials will be closely scrutinizing inflation and jobs data as they determine which side of the dual mandate needs more attention.",
      "While the inflation rate has receded from its 2022 peak, it's still far above the Fed's goal for a 2% annual rate, and has inched up in recent months as the Trump administration's tariffs ripple through the economy, pushing some prices higher.",
      "Meanwhile, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with many sectors \u2014 including manufacturing, which Mr. Trump has vowed to revive \u2014 shedding jobs in August. The result is a marked slowdown in hiring, with employers adding an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus about 106,000 workers each month in 2024.",
      "\"It's going to be very difficult, but it will be weighing these two conflicting objectives,\" Kersting noted.",
      "How does the Fed compare with other central banks?",
      "Mr. Trump's has criticized the Fed's decision to hold off on cutting this year by pointing to decisions by other central banks, such as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, to reduce their borrowing costs.",
      "\"Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had ZERO. No inflation, great economy \u2014 We should be at least two to three points lower,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media in June.",
      "Yet the U.S. is facing an issue that isn't as pressing for other nations: Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "Because the tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. businesses directly to the federal government, the cost is largely borne by American companies and consumers \u2014 not other nations. The White House has said exporters abroad bear the brunt of tariffs, while Trump administration officials make the case that more balanced trade with U.S. economic partners over the longer term will create jobs, energize the manufacturing sector and generate federal revenue.",
      "Fed Chair Powell has pointed to the tariffs as a reason the Fed has wanted to keep its powder dry, given that many economists believe the import duties will reignite inflation in the U.S.",
      "The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a closed watched inflation gauge, rose at annual rate of 2.9% in August, the sharpest pickup since January. Heavily imported goods, such as coffee, audio equipment and household furniture, saw some of the steepest price hikes last month, CPI data shows.",
      "How are American consumers holding up?",
      "Many Americans are souring on the economy, feeling pressured by higher costs for everything from housing to groceries.",
      "A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that two-thirds of Americans said prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise, and about the same share said they expect that to continue. More than half of consumers said the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only about one-quarter said they believe it's improving.",
      "The CPI has steadily risen since April, when it fell to an annual rate of 2.3%, or just above the Fed's 2% target.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has pointed to mortgage rates that were close to 7% for much of 2025 as a reason for a faltering housing market.",
      "\"Could somebody please inform Jerome 'Too Late' Powell that he is hurting the Housing Industry, very badly? People can't get a Mortgage because of him. There is no Inflation, and every sign is pointing to a major Rate Cut,\" the president wrote\u00a0in an Aug.19 post on social media.",
      "But mortgage rates are determined by several factors beyond the Fed's benchmark rate, including the strength of the U.S. economy and the 10-year Treasury note. Already, rates have declined in recent weeks, dipping to 6.35% for the week of Sept. 11, in anticipation of the Fed's cut and weaker economic data.",
      "Even so, a rate cut could help some consumers by lowering their borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"A declining interest rate environment will provide some relief for borrowers,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"Whether it's a homeowner with a 7% mortgage or a recent graduate hoping to refinance student loans and credit card debt, lower rates can ease the burden on many indebted households by opening opportunities to refinance or consolidate.\"",

      "Since 2021, budget retailers have seen a large influx of more affluent shoppers, according to data from GlobalData Retail. This year, nearly 28% of high-income people have shopped at discount chains Aldi, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Five Below, Family Dollar, Lidl, Ollie's, PopShelf or Walmart, up from around 20% four years ago, the research and consulting firm found.",
      "A key catalyst for the shift is one that has plagued Americans up and down the income ladder in recent years, experts told CBS MoneyWatch: inflation.",
      "Emerging from the pandemic, many middle- and even upper-income consumers had extra savings after receiving federal stimulus checks and because they chopped their spending on categories like travel and dining out, said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData.",
      "But since then, the financial cushion wealthier consumers once enjoyed has shrunk while the cost of living has risen, leading many to seek out more affordable stores.",
      "\"They don't like the fact that more and more of their money is absorbed by essentials and the basics of life,\" Saunders told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So what has happened is they have sought out better value for money, and they've especially done that in grocery and household essentials.\"",
      "GlobalData defines middle-income as households with annual income of $56,501 to $169,750, while high-income households are those earning more $169,751. The market research firm taps a range of data sources \u2014 including consumer surveys, credit card spending and retailer data \u2014 to build a national picture of the retail landscape.",
      "The migration of higher income consumers to discount retailers has \"accelerated since the pandemic, and especially since the bout of inflation that started in 2021,\" added Saunders, noting that a similar trend followed the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "One of the biggest winners of this trend has been Walmart, according to Saunders. More than 17% of Americans earning six figures today shop at the Arkansas-based company, the world's biggest retailer, up from less than 15% in 2021, GlobalData found.",
      "To be sure, wealthier consumers don't face the same financial constraints as low-income people. But high- and middle-income Americans are also looking for ways to beat inflation and stretch their dollar, experts said.",
      "Inflation is well below its 2022 peak, but remains sticky for food and other essentials. Will Auchincloss, an Americas retail sector partner at EY Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch that elevated prices for many goods and services are forcing consumers across the income spectrum to \"muscle through.\"",
      "Inflation isn't the only thing driving more people to discount retailers. Better brand selection and a more diverse assortment of products has made budget chains more appealing to a wider audience, Saunders said, noting that retailers like Walmart and Aldi are actively courting more upscale shoppers.",
      "\"One of the things Walmart has been doing is refurbishing a lot of its stores, putting a bit more effort into presentation, because it knows that higher-income consumers expect a nicer experience,\" he said. \"If you provide that, the lower-income consumers like it, too.\"",
      "Walmart remodels around 650 stores nationwide on an annual basis, according to a company spokesperson. The\u00a0upgrades\u00a0typically include updated layouts, newly painted exteriors and interiors, interactive displays, new signage and checkouts, and interactive displays \u2014 reminiscent what you might see in an IKEA store \u2014 that allow customers to touch and feel merchandise.",
      "The company has also expanded its brand selections to include manufacturers like Apple and Dell, as well as fashion brands like Scoop and Free Assembly, a Walmart spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",

Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are planning to speak Friday \"to firm everything up,\" as Mr. Trump put it Tuesday morning.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "Under the law, ByteDance must divest from TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",

      "Lutnick said China or ByteDance \"can have a little piece\" but \"Americans will have control\" of the algorithm and \"own the technology.\"",
      "TikTok was a topic of conversation during Bessent's trade talks on Monday with Chinese officials in Spain. When asked by reporters later in the day whether China would have a stake in the company, Mr. Trump said, \"We haven't decided that.\"",
      "An apparent deal in April fell through after Mr. Trump announced new tariffs on China. The deal would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time.",
      "Sources with knowledge of the negotiations told CBS News this week that the latest deal includes technology company Oracle and private equity firm Silver Lake. (David Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded on Tuesday morning that China will \"firmly defend its national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, and will carry out technology export approvals according to relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "The statement added that the Chinese government \"also fully respects the will of enterprises and supports them in conducting business negotiations on an equal footing in accordance with market principles.\"",
      "Lawmakers have said that any deal that does not divest TikTok from ByteDance runs afoul of the law, including any arrangement that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. while using ByteDance's algorithm.",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court, TikTok's lawyer said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to completely cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. In legal filings, TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to access global content and vice versa.",
      "Trump claims authority to not enforce law",
      "Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor, said it's not unusual for laws to go unenforced, but it's typically because there are resource constraints or the law is ambiguous. The TikTok law is \"completely unambiguous,\" he said.",
      "\"There's no room to argue that the law doesn't say what it says and there's also no resource constraint,\" he said. \"I don't think that there is a sort of similar instance of this sort of flagrant attempt to let a company violate the law.\"",
      "In letters to tech companies earlier this year, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote that Mr. Trump \"determined that an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform would interfere with the execution of the president's constitutional duties to take care of the national security and foreign affairs of the United States.\"",
      "Bondi said the Justice Department is \"irrevocably relinquishing\" any legal claims against the companies, informing them that they can continue to make TikTok available in their app stores \"without violating the act, and without incurring any legal liability.\"",
      "The letters were made public in early July as part of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits.",
      "\"Whatever your view of prosecutorial discretion, it does not give the president the power to say that something prohibited by statute is actually lawful,\" said Zachary Price, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco. \"It would at most let you suspend enforcement. In other words, you might be able to never seek penalties under the law, but \u2026 you can't tell them that they're acting lawfully when they're violating the statute.\"",
      "Anupam Chander, a law professor at Georgetown University, called the claims in Bondi's letters an \"excessive assertion of presidential power.\"",
      "But Chander said that by not enforcing the law instead of shutting it down, Mr. Trump may have a better chance at accomplishing what Congress insisted was the law's intent: to force a sale.",
      "\"It's a lot harder to sell a dead horse than a live horse,\" Chander said. \"If you force it to shut down and then hope in six months that you might engineer a sale \u2014 at that point, the value might have diminished so much that there's very little reason, very little economic incentive for ByteDance to sell at all.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's non-enforcement of the law has prompted some pushback from lawmakers, though the intensity has been relatively muted compared to the alarms Congress sounded over the app's potential national security risks.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",

    "summary": "The Senate confirmed Trump economic adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve to finish Adriana Kugler's term. Miran plans to return to his White House job afterward.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate on Monday confirmed economist and Trump adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, giving President Trump more influence over the Fed just one day before central bank officials will meet to decide whether to cut interest rates.",
      "Miran was confirmed 48-47 for a term that runs until January, filling a vacancy created last month when Biden appointee Adriana Kugler stepped down before the end of her term. Miran currently chairs the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. In an unusual move, he's said he will take an unpaid leave of absence from that job while serving on the Fed board instead of resigning altogether, citing \"the short duration of the appointment.\"",
      "Miran is arriving at the central bank in time for a crucial Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, during which 12 top Fed officials \u2014 including Miran \u2014 will discuss monetary policy and decide whether to change the Fed's target interest rate. The committee is widely expected to vote for a rate cut, after leaving rates stable so far this year.",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Fed officials for not cutting interest rates sooner, nicknaming Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" \u2014 pressuring a central bank that typically operates independently. The president favors a rate cut because it could boost economic growth and slash borrowing costs for American consumers, but the move could risk causing inflation to heat up.",
      "The Senate Banking Committee advanced Miran's nomination in a party-line vote last week, after lawmakers grilled him on whether he would preserve the Fed's independence.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the committee's top Democrat, alleged last week Miran's nomination was part of a gambit by Mr. Trump to \"seize personal control of the Fed,\" citing his decision not to fully resign from his White House role.",
      "\"He will have zero credibility with markets, zero credibility with businesses, and zero credibility with the public if he is confirmed to the Board under these circumstances,\" Warren said.",
      "But Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who chairs the committee, lauded Miran, saying he \"brings deep experience, proven leadership and a clear commitment to ensuring that the American economy remains strong and competitive.\"",
      "Miran said in a hearing earlier this month he believes the \"independence of monetary policy is a critical element for [the Fed's] success,\" and \"I intend to preserve that independence.\"",
      "Miran also said he would \"absolutely resign\" from the Council of Economic Advisers if he is confirmed to a longer term on the Fed board after his four-month appointment runs out.",
      "In a written questionnaire for senators, Miran didn't rule out attending meetings for the White House's Council of Economic Advisers and consulting with CEA staff, but \"only in my capacity as a member of the Fed and to the extent appropriate for a member of the Fed in the normal course of business.\" He also said he will not have access to his CEA email while at the Fed.",
      "The Miran nomination is just one move by Mr. Trump that could reshape the central bank.",
      "The president moved to fire Fed board member Lisa Cook last month, accusing her of making false statements on mortgage documents. Cook argued the firing was unlawful, and a judge ruled last week that Cook can remain on the board while a lawsuit plays out. The Trump administration asked an appeals court to halt that ruling before this week's interest rate meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump will also have an opportunity to pick a new Fed chair when Powell's four-year term in the role ends in May. The president has floated firing Powell before then, but the idea is legally untested. Powell's 14-year term on the Fed board does not end until 2028, so he could remain on the board until then while giving up his role as chair. Some prior Fed chiefs have stepped down after their time as chair runs out, but it's unclear if Powell will follow suit.",
      "Two other Fed board members \u2014 Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 were confirmed during Mr. Trump's first term. If the president succeeds in firing Cook, and if Powell resigns next year, five of the Fed Board of Governors' seven members would be Trump nominees.",

      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is looking into reports that faulty electronic door handles on 2021 Tesla Model Y SUVs prevented owners from entering and exiting the vehicles, according to filing on the regulator's website. In several cases, parents describe situations in which they were unable to access children inside the car.",
      "The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received nine reports on \"inoperable door handles,\" with the most commonly reported issues involving parents' inability to reenter the car after placing their child in the back seat before going on a drive, or to remove their child from the back seat at the end of a drive.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/form-of-energy-cheapest-lazard-lcoe/",
    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:28:07 -0400",
    "summary": "CBS News looked at the cost of producing coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar energy to determine which is the cheapest.",
    "story": [
      "The emergence of renewable energy like wind and solar as a viable alternative to oil, gas and other fossil fuels has raised critical questions about which form of power offers the best value today \u2014 a debate made all the more urgent by the ravages of climate change.",
      "In the U.S., where energy policy has been shaped by politics for more than a century, the battle continues to play out at the highest levels of government. Former President Biden delivered one of the biggest endorsements of renewable energy in the form of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offered tax credits and rebates to businesses, organizations and households that invest in solar, wind and geothermal technologies.",
      "By contrast, President Trump has been a staunch supporter of the oil and gas industry. During his inauguration speech in January, he reaffirmed his commitment to fossil fuel production, saying, \"We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet. That will help to do it.\"",
      "Within six months of taking office, Mr. Trump signed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" into law, which phases out clean energy tax incentives while simultaneously expanding tax breaks for the oil and gas industries. Separately, his administration has pared back offshore wind leasing and made it more difficult for clean energy projects to qualify for federal dollars.",
      "On the global trade front, Mr. Trump has issued a flurry of tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, which experts say will translate into higher costs for energy projects that rely on imports. The White House is pushing these policies amid concerns over rising U.S. energy prices, with average electricity costs up 5.5% from a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "To get to the bottom of which form of energy is the cheapest, CBS News analyzed the cost to produce coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar energy, including the impact of tax incentives, tariffs and other factors.",
      "Determining the cheapest form of energy",
      "Multiple criteria come into play in trying to assess the cheapest form of energy. These include consumers' monthly costs; the cost to produce energy; and the potential social cost energy production can have on a community's health and the environment. External factors like tax incentives and fluctuations in the economy also can affect the price it costs to heat and cool our homes.",
      "CBS News set out to answer the question using what's called the Levelized Cost of Energy, or LCOE, a commonly cited benchmark for wholesale energy costs. LCOE is the price that a power-generating facility must receive for its electricity to cover all its expenses \u2014 including capital, equipment, maintenance and other financing costs \u2014 over the lifespan of a project.",
      "A 2025 LCOE report from investment bank Lazard shows the cost to produce energy without any government subsidies and how that changes when you layer in other factors, such as tax subsidies provided under the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Yet while LCOE calculations are widely used, they don't offer a full picture when it comes to evaluating the cost and value of energy, experts told CBS News. Other factors, such as interest rates and federal regulations, can also have a major impact on the cost of building and operating energy infrastructure.",
      "LCOE also doesn't account for the value a given form of energy delivers. For example, because solar and wind are affected by the weather, they tend to be less consistent than oil and gas, meaning a backup source of energy may be necessary.",
      "\"You have to talk about, what is the additional cost of balancing that production from a resource that doesn't produce all the time?\" Severin Borenstein, faculty director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, told CBS News.",
      "How tax subsidies factor in",
      "The U.S. government has a long history of using tax subsidies to encourage energy production. Oil and gas companies have benefited from such support for more than a century. One example is a tax deduction known as Intangible Drilling Costs, or IDCs, which allows companies to deduct certain expenses associated with finding and preparing an oil or gas well.",
      "By comparison, only in recent decades have renewable energy projects drawn a larger share of federal dollars. The push for renewables accelerated in the 1970s, when the U.S. was facing an energy crisis defined by fuel shortages and high prices,\u00a0according\u00a0to Congress.gov.",
      "Lazard's report shows how the LCOE for renewable energy fluctuates when you account for certain provisions of the IRA aimed at lowering the cost of developing clean energy projects. Those include the investment tax credit (ITC), production tax credit (PTC) and energy community bonus, which increases the value of the ITC and PTC by 10% for projects in certain areas.",
      "Lazard's calculations assume these credits will be in place for 10 years. Notably, however, the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law by Mr. Trump this summer is slated to phase out those credits over the next two years.",
      "Although Lazard examines how the IRA affects renewable energy prices, it doesn't factor in any government subsidies flowing to the oil and gas industry, which vary widely and can be difficult to assess.",
      "The Environmental and Energy Study Institute, a bipartisan nonprofit research group,\u00a0estimates that direct U.S. subsidies to the fossil fuel industry amount to at least $20 billion per year. However, the FracTracker Alliance, a nonprofit focused on the impact of fossil fuels,\u00a0says the industry receives an estimated $760 billion annually in government subsidies and tax breaks.",
      "More benefits will go to the oil and gas industries under the \"big, beautiful bill.\" A June report from the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the legislation will funnel nearly $18 billion in tax incentives to the oil and gas industry over the next 10 years.",
      "Oil and gas companies have lauded the new law as a win for the industry. Sunil Mathew, chief financial officer of Occidental Petroleum, said during a recent company earnings call that the measure \"will provide significant cash tax benefits to Oxy.\" He expects the law will save Occidental $700 million to $800 million in \"cash taxes\" by the end of next year.",
      "How do tariffs factor into energy production costs?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are also projected to alter the cost it takes to fund energy projects in the U.S. To gauge the impact of tariffs on energy costs, CBS News turned to a model created by global data and analytics company Wood Mackenzie.",
      "In the following chart, dark green indicates a scenario in which the U.S. hasn't applied any country-level tariffs, but still maintains levies on copper, steel and aluminum imports; the medium shade of green represents current baseline tariffs imposed by the U.S. since Mr. Trump resumed office in January through August 7; and the light green indicates if trade relations with a U.S. economic partner is likely to worsen or deteriorate.",
      "As depicted, U.S. tariffs are projected to hit battery storage production the hardest. Chris Seiple, vice chairman of the power and renewables group at Wood Mackenzie, noted that while some energy equipment is produced domestically, other tech, such as battery cells, mostly comes from abroad, making them more susceptible to tariffs.",
      "\"The vast majority of our battery cells come from China,\" he said. \"And so the cost of a battery project is going to go up by a certain percentage.\"",
      "This could lead to what Seiple described as a \"whack-a-mole\" effect, in which over time companies move their manufacturing to non-tariffed countries to avoid an additional financial burden.",
      "What is the cheapest form of energy?",
      "Given these multiple and interconnected factors, what ends up being the cheapest form of energy to produce?",
      "According to Lazard, renewables remain the most cost-competitive form of generating and distributing energy. Onshore wind, which runs from $37 to $86 per megawatt-hour ($/MWh), is the most affordable on a baseline level and when tax subsidies are included.",
      "Utility scale solar \u2014 what most people think of when they hear about solar energy \u2014 is the next most cost-effective approach, with costs ranging from $38 to $78 per megawatt-hour.",
      "Fossil fuel and nuclear energy sources are more expensive to generate. Coal costs $71 to $173 per megawatt-hour; gas costs $48 to $109; and U.S. nuclear costs $141 to $220, Lazard found.",
      "The main reasons for these differences in cost? Experts told CBS News that while the capital cost for renewable projects is steep, the expense of operating and maintaining such facilities tends to be lower than that associated with fossil fuel production.",
      "\"Wind and solar you basically do all the investment up front, and then it operates \u2014 not quite for free \u2014 but at extremely low operating costs per kilowatt hour,\" Borenstein said.",
      "With fossil fuels, the cost of oil, gas and coal \u2014 which can be volatile \u2014 is another key factor.",
      "\"For a natural gas-fired power plant, you have to buy the natural gas,\" he explained. \"And likewise, a coal-fired power plant, you have to buy the coal. And so the price\u2026 is going to fluctuate.\"",
      "Experts who spoke with CBS News agreed that renewable energy ends up being the most competitive when it comes to costs. Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a Washington, D.C. consulting firm, concurred that solar and wind are the cheapest to run. Natural gas is the most affordable source of backup energy, which is necessary to make sure power is available around the clock, he said.",
      "Seiple said if you need a small amount of inexpensive electricity, solar is the way to go. It's \"low cost to build, it can be deployed quickly and modularly, the fuel is free and not volatile in price, and the ongoing maintenance costs are minimal,\" he said. \"And if the U.S. didn't penalize it with tariffs, it would be even lower cost.\"",
      "Despite such advantages for renewable energy, experts say the U.S. shouldn't put all of its eggs in one basket. Multiple sources told CBS News that what's needed is a diversity of energy options that can meet the country's\u00a0rising demand for electricity. Taking certain forms of energy out of the mix would compromise the system as a whole, they note.",
      "\"There is no one cheapest form that you can run the whole system on, and in fact, it depends on combining them in ways to [get] the cheapest possible cost,\" Borenstein said.",

      "The precise structure of the final deal was unclear Monday night, but will include multiple companies, the sources said. It's not clear what level of involvement Chinese firms \u2014 including TikTok's current parent company ByteDance \u2014 will have in the deal, and who will control TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm. Presidents Trump and Xi are expected to talk on Friday.",

      "Last year, Congress passed and then-President Joe Biden signed a bill that essentially gave TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, an ultimatum: either divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a unanimous 9-0 decision. But Mr. Trump has issued a series of orders unilaterally delaying its enforcement. The latest came in June, when he pushed back the deadline for enforcing the measure until this Wednesday.",

TikTok has long denied that the Chinese authorities exert any influence on the platform.",

      "Washington \u2014 U.S. and Chinese negotiators have agreed to the outlines of a deal to resolve the dispute over ownership of TikTok, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday, adding that President Trump is set to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week.",
      "\"We have a framework for a TikTok deal,\" Bessent said after talks with Chinese officials in Spain. \"The two leaders, President Trump and Party Chair Xi, will speak on Friday to complete the deal. But we do have a framework for a deal with TikTok.\"",
      "Bessent said the agreement is \"between two private parties\" and that \"the commercial terms have been agreed upon.\" He said the talks in Spain centered around the future of the app.",
      "Mr. Trump hinted at the agreement in a post on Truth Social earlier Monday morning.",
      "\"The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China,  has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly,\" the president wrote. \"A deal was also reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!!\"",
      "Later Monday, Mr. Trump was asked by reporters whether China would have a stake in the company.",
      "\"We haven't decided that,\" he said.",
      "A spokesperson to Vice President JD Vance said the deal means hundreds of millions of Americans will be able to continue using the app.",
      "\"President Trump and Vice President Vance provided the leadership and foresight necessary to produce a framework deal that fulfills another campaign promise and saves TikTok,\" the spokesperson said.",

The latest came in June, when he pushed back the deadline for enforcing the measure until Sept. 17.",
      "The president's orders have directed the Justice Department\u00a0not to take action or impose penalties against tech companies like Apple and Google for failing to comply with the law by allowing TikTok on their platforms.",
      "Mr. Trump's extensions have come as the U.S. tries to negotiate an agreement that would separate the hugely popular video-sharing app from ByteDance. The Trump administration appeared close to a deal in the spring, which would have spun TikTok's U.S.-based operations into a new company owned and operated by a majority of American investors, and allowed ByteDance to maintain a minority stake. But Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports scuttled the proposed deal.",
      "ByteDance, however, refuted then that an agreement had been reached because there were still key issues unresolved. TikTok's parent company said any deal regarding the app's future would be subject to approval by the Chinese government.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fed-rate-cut-mortgage-impact-september-2025/",
    "published": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 16:10:43 -0400",
    "summary": "Experts say Americans shouldn't expect a further decline in mortgage rates immediately after the Fed's September meeting.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower its benchmark interest rate this week for the first time since December of 2024. A rate cut would give Americans a sliver of relief on a wide range of loans, but would it bring down mortgage rates?",
      "Average rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.35%\u00a0this week, its lowest level in nearly a year, as financial markets have preemptively priced in a Fed cut when policymakers meet Sept. 16-17.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages \u2014 popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans \u2014 also fell. The average rate slipped to 5.5% from 5.6% last week. A year ago, it was 5.27%.",
      "With that in mind, experts say homeowners should not expect an immediate drop in mortgage costs should the central bank officially cut its rate on Thursday.",
      "Here's what to know about how monetary policy affects mortgage rates.",
      "What influence does the Fed have on mortgage rates?",
      "The Federal Reserve does not directly impact mortgage rates. Instead, it sets what is known as the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for overnight loans.",
      "\"The Fed is setting short-term interest rates,\" Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Things like the mortgage rates are longer-term interest rates.\"",
      "While Fed rate cuts directly affect short-term interest rates, such as on certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts, they also impact the broader lending environment, experts note.",
      "Adjustable-rate mortgages, for instance, are more sensitive to changes in the federal funds rate because they are tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), a short-term market index.",
      "Fixed-rate mortgages, meanwhile, tend to move in the same direction as the bond market, particularly the 10-year Treasury note, because they are both long-term instruments with relatively stable risk,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Brookings Institute, a nonprofit public policy organization.",
      "\"They're maybe not pressed up against one another, but they're sort of moving in the same direction,\" said Krimmel.",
      "The upshot is that conventional mortgage loans have terms of 15 to 30 years (adjustable-rate loans have shorter terms), so investors are more focused on the longer-term economic conditions reflected in Treasury rates than in the Fed's short-term lending horizon.",
      "Yields on the 10-year Treasury note bounced around this year due to concerns over tariffs and what the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would mean for the economy, Stephen Kates, an analyst at personal finance website Bankrate, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders use the yield on 10-year Treasurys as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4% Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"Investor sentiments, how bonds are being bought and sold, expectations of inflation are all going to impact those longer-term rates,\" Kates said.",
      "What impact could a Fed cut have on mortgage rates?",
      "Experts say lenders have already been lowering their rates ahead of a likely rate cut by the Fed. The average rate on both 30-year mortgages and 15-year mortgages have inched down at the same time that several fed governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell have signaled support for slashing interest rates, Krimmel pointed out.",
      "Kates agreed. \"A lot of the decrease that we've seen in the last four to six weeks has been in anticipation by some of this cut,\" he said.",
      "Banks and other enders often lower their rates in anticipation of a Fed cut. In September 2024, for example, mortgage rates declined to a two-year low ahead of what turned out to be an unusually large 0.50 percentage point reduction by Fed officials. This is why the rate offers you see now, at the start of the month, may not look much different from those you see later in September, once the cut is official.",
      "Fed interest rate policy is just one of the factors that can affect the cost of home loans, note experts. A range of other factors can also play a role, including the rate of inflation, job growth, consumer spending and housing demand, as well as global events and other government policies.",
      "Because financial markets are forward-looking, any statements made by Powell on the direction of monetary policy could have more of an impact on the housing market than a rate cut itself, according to Krimmel.",
      "\"That might be where there is actually some action with the bond markets or with mortgage rates, because he might give some hints about where the Fed is headed in the future,\" he said.",

      "The litigation was sparked by Facebook's privacy scandal in 2018 with Cambridge Analytica, which\u00a0scraped user data\u00a0from the site as part of an effort to profile voters. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has denied any liability or wrongdoing under the settlement.",

      "Some Facebook users reported receiving payments on Sept. 15, with the money showing up in their PayPal, Venmo or other mobile payment accounts.

      "How much will I get?",
      "A Sept. 5 court filing discloses that the average payment amount is approximately $29.43, with the maximum payout rising to $38.36.",
      "Facebook users are receiving a portion of the $725 million after administrative costs and lawyers' fees are paid out.",
      "The payments are based on how many people filed claims, as well as how long each claimant was using Facebook during the 15-year period covered by the settlement.",
      "Each claimant receives one \"allocation point\" for each month they had an \"activated\" Facebook account between May 24, 2007, and December 22, 2022. The settlement administrator adds up all the points assigned to all eligible claimants and then divides the net settlement amount by that number.",
      "Because the payments are based on the number of points assigned to each claimant, people who were on Facebook for shorter periods of time are likely to receive a lower settlement amount. The maximum payment of $38.36 would be given to people who were on Facebook for the entire 15-year period covered by the settlement, the Sept. 5 document notes.",

But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.",

    "summary": "President Trump says getting rid of a quarterly reporting requirement for public companies would lower costs and help businesses.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump says he wants to ditch a staple of U.S. financial markets: quarterly earnings reports.",
      "If Mr. Trump's push is successful, the change would eliminate a requirement that's been in place for 55 years, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, mandating quarterly reports\u00a0since 1970.",
      "Instead, the president said he wants to replace quarterly reporting with a new SEC rule requiring that companies disclose their financial data every six months. Providing companies with a longer ramp for issuing their reports would \"save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday in his social media post.",
      "\"Did you ever hear the statement that, 'China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis???' Not good!!!\" he added.",
      "The idea is far from new, with academic and business experts suggesting such a change in years past, for similar reasons as those cited by Mr. Trump. During his first term, Mr. Trump had asked the SEC to examine the three- versus six-month reporting requirement, although no change was made.",
      "But Mr. Trump's renewed push could make such a corporate overhaul more likely today, TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a Monday research report.",
      "\"We start with a 60% probability that the SEC switches to semi-annual from quarterly reporting, though the fact that this is an easy win for [SEC Chairman Paul] Atkins to deliver to Trump causes our bias to be that the prospects for action are more likely to rise than to fall,\" Seiberg noted.",
      "Here's what to know about the idea.",
      "Why is Mr. Trump proposing this now?",
      "There are some new pushes from the corporate sector.",
      "The Long Term Stock Exchange \u2014 a national securities exchange \u2014 said last week that it plans to petition the SEC to do away with the quarterly requirement. The San Francisco-based exchange lists companies focused on long-term goals, with its founder Eric Ries criticizing the financial markets for pushing businesses to prioritize short-term wins.",
      "The proposed change also aligns with the Trump administration's goal to ease regulatory burdens on companies, which it has said would help unlock economic growth by reducing businesses' costs.",
      "What's the benefit?",
      "Supporters of the change say quarterly reporting is too costly and time-consuming and discourages companies from wanting to go public. They also say company executives focus too much on hitting quarterly earnings targets and not enough on long-term planning.",
      "Is there a downside?",
      "Those who favor quarterly earnings say the reports provide investors with valuable financial updates and make them aware of any new risks the company is facing. Six-month reviews would deprive investors of those important insights, they argue.",
      "\"This might be great for long-term company builders, but terrible for public market investors who need timely data,\" noted one executive, Sam Kampner, the founder of analysis firm SalesCraft AI, on social media on Monday. \"[H]aving less information means you'd be making less-informed investment decisions.\"",
      "What does the data show?",
      "A 2018 study published in the Harvard Business Review looked at a similar change in the U.K., which stopped requiring quarterly reporting in 2014. The results were \"nuanced and falls somewhere between the two extreme narratives,\" Shivaram Rajgopal, a professor at Columbia Business School, wrote in the Harvard report.",
      "\"Moving away from quarterly reporting did not end corporate short-termism and earnings management, but nor did it destroy all transparency, leaving investors in the dark,\" he added.",

Documents obtained by The Associated Press also showed that on a second form submitted by Cook to gain a security clearance, she described the property as a \"second home.\"",
      "Cook sued the Trump administration to block her firing, the first time a president has sought to remove a member of the seven-person board of governors. Cook secured an injunction Tuesday that allows her to remain as a Fed governor.",
      "The administration has appealed the ruling and asked for an emergency ruling by Monday, just before the Fed is set to meet and decide whether to reduce its key interest rate. Most economists expect they will cut the rate by a quarter point.",
      "Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has accused Cook of signing separate documents in which she allegedly said that both the Atlanta property and a home in Ann Arbor, Michigan, also purchased in June 2021, were both \"primary residences.\" Pulte submitted a criminal referral to the Justice Department, which has opened an investigation.",
      "Claiming a home as a \"primary residence\" can result in better down payment and mortgage terms than if one of the homes is classified as a vacation home.",
      "The descriptions of Cook's properties were first reported by Reuters.",
      "Fulton County tax records show Cook has never claimed a homestead exemption on the condo, which allows someone who uses a property as their primary residence to reduce their property taxes, since buying it in 2021.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration wants an appeals court to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before an interest rate meeting next week.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court Thursday to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in time for a crucial meeting next week when Fed officials will decide whether to lower interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook from the Federal Reserve's powerful Board of Governors last month, accusing her of falsely claiming two different homes as her principal residence in mortgage documents. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb blocked the firing on Tuesday, concluding that the president \"has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal.\" Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be removed \"for cause.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to stay that ruling while the government appeals it. The Justice Department argued that the president has broad discretion to remove federal officials, including to decide whether \"cause\" exists, and courts have \u2014 at most \u2014 extremely narrow authority to review those decisions.",
      "\"Here, the evidence\u2014which Cook has yet to offer contrary explanation for\u2014was that she applied for two loans for her personal benefit, and was able to obtain favorable interest rates by misrepresenting where she lived,\" the government argued Thursday. \"Regardless of whether that misconduct occurred before or during office, it indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy for the whole Nation.\"",
      "Those allegations surfaced in a letter from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee who cited mortgage papers for homes that Cook bought in Georgia and Michigan in 2021. Abbe Lowell, an attorney representing Cook, called the government's accusations \"unsubstantiated and vague.\"",
      "The government requested that the appeals court act by the end of the day on Monday, noting that the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Cook's attorneys asked the appellate court to deny the Trump administration's request, calling it \"wholly unwarranted.\"",
      "\"An administrative stay would threaten Governor Cook's participation in next week's meeting and potentially plunge the FOMC's vote into turmoil,\" Cook's attorneys wrote in court papers. \"In addition, it has the real potential of impacting domestic and foreign markets. The Government has provided no justification for such a grave disruption of the status quo.\"",
      "The appeals court directed the government to reply to Cook's filing by Sunday at 3 p.m., making a ruling before then unlikely.",
      "Why does the Fed committee matter?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 which includes Cook, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and 10 other top central bank officials \u2014 is responsible for setting the Fed's interest rate targets, which have a major impact on economic growth, inflation and borrowing costs. The panel typically acts independently, with little input from elected officials.",
      "The committee has voted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, but investors and economists widely expect it to reduce rates at next week's meeting. Rate cuts could lead to stronger economic growth, but at the risk of causing inflation to heat up.",
      "Mr. Trump has tangled with the Fed for months over its decision to keep rates steady, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing the rate-setting committee should overrule him. Powell's term ends in May.",
      "Amid that pressure, Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in late August. A Biden appointee, Cook's term on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors is set to end in 2038. The allegations against Cook are not related to Mr. Trump's push against the Fed, but if she is removed from the board, the president could pick her replacement, giving him more influence over the central bank.",

      "The cost-of-living adjustment has averaged 2.6% over the last 20 years, according to the Senior Citizens League. A COLA of 2.7% would be higher than this year's adjustment of 2.5%, but below the 3.2% boost seniors received in 2024.",
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) makes a cost-of-living adjustment each year based on inflation data from July, August and September.

      "The inflation-adjusted median monthly cost of homeownership in 2024 rose to $2,035, up nearly 4% from $1,960 in 2023, according to new Census Bureau\u00a0data. That cost encompasses monthly mortgage and insurance payments, taxes, utilities and other fees.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence is poised to change how businesses and consumers interact in virtually every industry, including travel, which is ripe for disruption by AI.",
      "When the first online trip planning sites emerged in the mid-1990s, they let consumers act as their own travel agents. Decades later, artificial intelligence tools are able to take over that role, and plan and book trips on behalf of travelers, saving them time and even money.",
      "\"It takes a lot of research and clicking around. It takes an average of 30 days between when you start planning a trip and when it's fully finished,\" Skylar Erickson, co-founder of Gondola AI, which helps consumers maximize their loyalty points, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You have 40 tabs open on your browser, so it takes a lot of work to get to that right answer.\"",
      "Also, because airfares and hotel room rates fluctuate constantly based on demand, shoppers could save a lot of time using a chatbot or other AI-powered tool to track and compare prices rather than manually refreshing their browsers.",
      "\"You log into a site, and you're trying to find the right price based on what other airlines are charging \u2014 that's the ultimate goal,\" Ram Reddy, an AI expert and chief technology officer at Nagarro, a consulting firm, said. \"AI tools that know you well can get you to the right place at the right time, when prices, which aren't static, are changing every minute.\"",
      "Consumers booking trips are already seeing AI's value: 41% of more than 2,000 consumers\u00a0surveyed\u00a0by Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, said they had recently used AI tools for travel inspiration or itinerary planning.",
      "From inspiration to booking",
      "There are a range of AI-powered apps and bots at consumers' fingertips that can help plan a trip \u2014 from inception to booking. AI-powered bots can help travelers dream up trip ideas, turn visual inspiration into ready-to-go itineraries, and complete bookings and payments while maximizing the consumer's own loyalty points and other rewards so that they save money. In other words, AI provides the services in which travel agents at brick-and-mortar travel agencies once specialized.",
      "Ways AI can assist travel planning",
      "Did you see a social media post of a trip you'd like to be on? Send it to Expedia to book your own version through a feature called Trip Matching, which can turn social media reels into bookable trip itineraries.",
      "Don't know what to plan for the kids while on a family vacation? ChatGPT can generate a list of free activities in any locale.",
      "Not sure how many loyalty points or rewards you've accrued, or what they're worth? A company called Gondola AI can figure that out, helping users maximize their loyalty points so their dollars take them further.",
      "Trip planning and booking is prime territory for AI agents to test their skills, and hopefully, make the process easier for consumers, according to AI leaders.",
      "\"These days, it's easier to identify where AI is not being used to help travelers. It is everywhere, from planning to booking,\" Melanie Fish, head of global PR for Expedia Brands, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Jennifer Yellin, travel expert at Points Path, a browser extension that helps consumers compare flight deals, said the more she utilizes AI for trip planning, the better the technology gets to know her, and the more useful it becomes.",
      "\"The more you use it, it starts to recognize your patterns and preferences. It gets to know you as a traveler,\" she said of a Gondola AI, one of her favorite new tools. \"If you've been booking stays at Ritz Carltons, it won't suggest a Marriott Residence Inn as a first option; it will suggest a stay of a similar caliber.\"",
      "\"I used it dozens of times\"",
      "Other travel industry pros say they see more value in AI's ability to help them navigate locales once they've arrived.",
      "\"ChatGPT totally revolutionized how we were able to get along in China \u2014 I used it to scan menus and translate them into English,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I used it dozens of times a day.\"",
      "As far as trip planning goes, Keyes said that while he's generally an AI optimist, \"the use case has not yet proven itself to me.\"",
      "Which tools are the most helpful? These are some popular trip planning tools. Here's how they can help, and where they fall short.",
      "AI travel planning tools",
      "ChatGPT:\u00a0The AI chatbot can suggest places to stay or things to do anywhere in the world. Tell it you're visiting New York City around Christmastime with young children and you're not sure what neighborhood to stay in. It can suggest parts of town and outline their pros and cons.",
      "Google Flight Deals: Enter a destination and desired dates, or describe the type of trip you'd like to take, such as \"beach escape,\" or \"Paris in the fall.\" Let the AI-powered search engine \u2014 designed for travelers who want to save money \u2014 try to find you the best deal based on such parameters. The tool is not an AI agent though, and can't book tickets for you.",
      "Expedia Trip Matching:\u00a0The AI tool lets you send a public Instagram travel reel, or video, to Expedia, which will create an itinerary based on the visual inspiration you provide. The reel must be publicly available on Instagram, and the AI tool can only suggest trips in the U.S. market.",
      "Gondola AI: Give the tool access to your email, and it will cull your loyalty points and rewards from airlines, hotels and credit card companies to let you know what they are worth. It will compare prices in cash versus combinations of points, and can save you hundreds of dollars. It comes into play after you've decided where you want to go and stay. \"We are about finding you money, earning you money and redeeming at the highest possible value,\" Erickson said.",

      "Lee won the seat over Republican Ruth Bittner with 61% of the vote.",
      "The election to replace Hortman, a former Minnesota House speaker, took place about three months after she and her husband were gunned down in their home by a man impersonating a police officer in Brooklyn Park, a suburb northwest of Minneapolis. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette also were shot in their home, but survived.",
      "Vance Boelter, 57, faces federal and state murder, attempted murder and other charges in the June 14 attacks.",
      "Tuesday's special election between Lee and Bittner also follows another act of political violence, the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah last Wednesday. The shootings have been a concern among voters in the district \u2014 and for both candidates.",
      "Lee said he wants to calm the \"charged atmosphere\" in the wake of Kirk's death.",
      "Bittner said the violence briefly gave her pause about running for office, but she concluded that \"there's no way to solve this problem if we shrink back in fear.\"",
      "Lee, a former Brooklyn Park City Council member, easily won a three-way Democratic primary in August. Bittner, a real estate agent, was the sole Republican on the primary ballot for the seat in the heavily Democratic district.",

Right now, those opportunities are getting too far out of reach. I'm going to do everything I can to make a brighter future a reality for all of us,\" \u00a0Lee said in a statement on his victory.",
      "Lee's win restores a 67-67 tie and preserve a power-sharing deal that existed for most of the 2025 legislative session after the 2024 elections cost House Democrats their majority.",
      "Hortman brokered that agreement, which ended Democrats' three-week boycott. Under the deal, she agreed to end her six-year tenure as speaker and let Republican Lisa Demuth take the position. Hortman then took the title speaker emerita. Most legislative committees became evenly split between Republican and Democratic members, with co-chairs from each party.",
      "The tie in the House meant some level of bipartisan agreement was required to pass anything in this year's session.",
      "An upset by Bittner would have given Republicans control of the House for the first time since 2018, and put them in an even stronger position to force concessions from Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and a Senate that Democrats control by only one vote. Walz on Tuesday announced his campaign for a third consecutive term, something no governor in state history has achieved.",
      "Nearly three months after Hortman's killing, the House Democrats chose Rep. Zack Stephenson as her successor to lead the caucus. Stephenson was Hortman's campaign manager in 2004, and she became his mentor and friend in the ensuing years. He was first elected to the Legislature in 2018.",
      "Two more special elections will be held Nov. 4 in a pair of Minnesota Senate districts.",
      "One is to fill the seat vacated by Democratic Sen. Nicole Mitchell, of the St. Paul suburb of Woodbury. She resigned in July after she was convicted of burglarizing her estranged stepmother's home. The other is for the seat of Republican Sen. Bruce Anderson, of the Minneapolis exurb of Buffalo, who died in July.",
      "Given that the districts are heavily Democratic and heavily Republican, respectively, control of the Senate isn't expected to change. But the Democratic candidate for Mitchell's seat is state Rep. Amanda Hemmingsen-Jaeger, of Woodbury. If she wins, the governor will have to call another special election to fill her House seat.",

Kennedy Jr. that preceded her removal as director, after Kennedy testified to the same Senate panel earlier this month that she said she wasn't \"trustworthy.\"",
      "Monarez, who was ousted from her job less than a month after her Senate confirmation, plans to say that she believes she was fired because she would not agree to pre-approve the recommendations from a newly reconstituted vaccine advisory panel known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. She also plans to say she refused to fire career scientists at the agency.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy demanded two things of me that were inconsistent with my oath of office and the ethics required of a public official,\" Monarez plans to say. \"He directed me to commit in advance to approving every ACIP recommendation regardless of the scientific evidence. He also directed me to dismiss career officials responsible for vaccine policy, without cause. He said if I was unwilling to do both, I should resign.\"",

      "Monarez will tell the panel, \"Secretary Kennedy told me he could not trust me. I had refused to commit to approving vaccine recommendations without evidence, fire career officials without cause, or resign \u2014 and I had shared my concerns with this committee. I told the secretary that if he believed he could not trust me, he could fire me.\"",

      "In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 ACIP members and replaced them with hand-picked officials, some of whom critics say are vaccine skeptics. The newly constituted panel is set to meet on Thursday and Friday and is likely to discuss updated vaccine recommendations for Hepatitis B, RSV and MMRV, or measles, mumps, rubella and varicella.",
      "During Kennedy's testimony, Democrats and a few Republican senators on the committee told Kennedy they were concerned about his and the CDC's vaccine panel's approach to these recommendations.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy, in your confirmation hearing, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines. Since then, I've grown deeply concerned,\" GOP Sen.

      "\"When she refused to acknowledge her insubordination, President Trump fired her,\" Nixon said.",

    "story": [
      "Just hours before Tyler Robinson was arrested for allegedly killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the 22-year-old appeared to take responsibility for the shooting in a message to friends on the chat platform Discord, a company spokesperson confirmed to CBS News on Monday.",
      "\"Hey guys, I have bad news for you all,\" read a message from an account that allegedly belonged to Robinson, according to the spokesperson and a law enforcement source. \"It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this.\"",
      "The messages were first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "The messages came toward the end of a nearly two-day-long manhunt after Kirk was fatally shot during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Robinson confessed to his father. Robinson was taken into custody late Thursday night, FBI Director Kash Patel said Friday.",
      "Over the preceding day, Patel ordered the release of half a dozen surveillance photos of the suspected shooter and asked the public for help solving the case, which drew nationwide attention and sparked new worries about the specter of political violence.",
      "While the FBI looked for leads, according to two law enforcement sources, Robinson and his friends bantered about the shooting in a more than 20-person group on Discord. The platform is popular among gamers. During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday, Patel confirmed that the FBI is investigating a group chat on the platform Discord that the suspect was allegedly involved in.",
      "The Discord spokesperson said an internal investigation by the company found \"no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord.\"",
      "At least three friends asked Robinson if he was the shooter, saying the photos released by the FBI looked like him, the law enforcement sources said. He did not seem to refute it.",
      "In one exchange, the sources said a friend appeared to tease Robinson by quipping that he should avoid McDonald's \u2014 where accused UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione was caught with a manifesto, a gun and a fake ID late last year.",
      "\"Whatever you do don't go to a mcdonalds anytime soon,\" the friend wrote, according to the law enforcement sources.",
      "The account appearing to belong to Robinson responded: \"Better also get rid of this manifesto and exact copy rifle I have lying around.\"",
      "Before the arrest, messages from the account belonging to Robinson appeared to suggest he planned to turn himself in to authorities, the Discord spokesperson confirmed.",
      "One message read, \"im surrendering through a sheriff friend in a few moments, thanks for all the good times and laughs, you've all been so amazing, thank you all for everything.\"",
      "Robinson was later taken into custody on aggravated murder, obstruction and firearm charges.\u00a0 Cox says the state will seek the death penalty. Robinson could make his first court appearance Tuesday afternoon, after officials file formal charges, Christopher Ballard, chief of staff for the Utah County Attorney's Office, has said.",
      "Law enforcement sources told CBS News that he was arrested after Robinson's father saw the FBI's images and confronted his son. Robinson admitted to being the person in the photos, but when his father encouraged him to turn himself in, Robinson said he would rather die by suicide, the sources said.

    "story": [
      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday announced his plans to seek reelection, launching a rare bid for a third consecutive term that would make history if he wins.",
      "Walz, a Democrat, revealed his intention to run again in a video posted on social media, touting policy achievements in office and making an appeal for unity.",
      "\"We've made historic progress in our state, but we're not done yet. I'm staying in the fight,\" the governor said.",
      "In his announcement video, Walz called Minnesota \"the best place on Earth with the best people,\" but acknowledged the state has \"seen terrible times this year.\"",
      "\"I'm heartbroken and angry about the beautiful people we lost to gun violence,\" Walz said, referencing the high-profile political assassination of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark and the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church late last month. \"But it's in these moments we have to come together, because I've seen what we can do when we work together.\"",
      "Walz said in the video that, if reelected, his priorities would include cracking down on fraud, making health care more affordable, investing in public schools and getting \"serious about gun violence.\"",
      "The former teacher and Congressman was elected governor in 2018 and won reelection in 2022. In 2024, former Vice President Kamala Harris chose him as her running mate in the presidential election, which catapulted him to the national stage.",
      "After the loss to President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, Walz returned to Minnesota to serve out the remaining two years of his term. Earlier this year, he went on a town hall tour of GOP districts across the Midwest, prompting speculation about a future presidential run. In an interview with The New Yorker in March, Walz said if the circumstances were right and he has the right \"skill set\" for the moment,\u00a0he would consider running in 2028.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, he and Walz have continued the clashes begun during election season. In his announcement video, Walz said he will \"never stop fighting to protect us from the chaos, corruption and cruelty coming out of Washington.\"",
      "During his gubernatorial tenure, Walz and Democratic lawmakers approved\u00a0several progressive victories, including universal free school meals, the legalization of recreational marijuana, codified abortion rights and more.",
      "Polling suggests Walz faces some political headwinds heading into his reelection campaign. A\u00a0Star Tribune Minnesota poll in June\u00a0found that half of Minnesotans did not want Walz to seek a third term. A majority of independents disapprove of his performance, as well as voters who live outside of Hennepin and Ramsey counties.",
      "And his time in office hasn't been without controversy. After authorities announced charges in the $250 million Feeding Our Future fraud case \u2014 the largest COVID-19 fraud case in the country \u2014 Walz\u00a0faced scrutiny for how his administration handled it\u00a0and Republicans blamed him for letting it happen under his watch. The scandal prompted a renewed focus on fraud and governmental oversight in the most recent legislative session, which included some changes, though plans for a new state watchdog agency\u00a0failed to pass.",
      "Since Feeding Our Future, there have been additional investigations into fraud in state programs, including alleged bogus claims billed at autism centers\u00a0and for housing services. Fraud in state government is already becoming a centerpiece to Republicans' campaign against him.",
      "Walz's 2022 challenger Scott Jensen is running again for the Republican nomination. State Rep. Kristin Robbins, who chairs the new House fraud-focused committee, and businessman Kendall Qualls have also launched campaigns.",
      "Walz defeated Jensen in 2022 by eight percentage points.",
      "In its 167 years as a state, Minnesota has never elected a governor for three consecutive four-year terms,\u00a0according to the Minnesota Legislative Reference Library. Rudy Perpich served three non-consecutive terms and is the state's longest serving governor.",
      "Before his reelection, Walz led the state through the COVID-19 pandemic, the police murder of George Floyd and the unrest that followed.",
      "Walz and state lawmakers this year achieved what he called \"the most impressive achievement\" of his career, wrapping up a contentious budget agreement during a special session of the most closely divided Legislature in Minnesota history. The work to finalize the $66 billion biennial budget staved off a government shutdown and made significant headway into a projected $6 billion deficit in future years.",
      "\"This is why I got into this business, to try and make a difference, work together, compromise, find common ground,\" Walz said of the agreement. \"The commitment to making democracy work was as strong as I've seen.\"",
      "Walz's party made key concessions to get the deal across the finish line, including removing adult undocumented immigrants from the state's health care program.",

    "story": [
      "The parents of teenagers who killed themselves after interactions with artificial intelligence chatbots testified to Congress on Tuesday about the dangers of the technology.",
      "\"What began as a homework helper gradually turned itself into a confidant and then a suicide coach,\" said Matthew Raine, whose 16-year-old son Adam died in April.",
      "\"Within a few months, ChatGPT became Adam's closest companion,\" the father told senators. \"Always available. Always validating and insisting that it knew Adam better than anyone else, including his own brother.\"",
      "Raine's family sued OpenAI\u00a0and its CEO Sam Altman last month alleging that ChatGPT coached the boy in planning to take his own life.",
      "ChatGPT mentioned suicide 1,275 times to Raine, the\u00a0lawsuit alleges, and kept providing specific methods to the teen on how to die by suicide. Instead of directing the 16-year-old to get professional help or speak to trusted loved ones, it continued to validate and encourage Raine's feelings, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Also testifying Tuesday was Megan Garcia, the mother of 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III of Florida.",
      "Garcia sued another\u00a0AI company, Character Technologies, for wrongful death last year, arguing that before his suicide, Sewell had become increasingly isolated from his real life as he engaged in highly sexualized conversations with the chatbot.",
      "His mother told CBS News last year that her son withdrew socially and stopped wanting to play sports after he started speaking to an AI chatbot. The company said after the teen's death, it made changes that require users to be\u00a013 or older to create an account and that it would launch parental controls in the first quarter of 2025. Those controls were rolled out in March.",
      "Hours before the Senate hearing, OpenAI pledged to roll out new safeguards for teens, including efforts to detect whether ChatGPT users are under 18 and controls that enable parents to set \"blackout hours\" when a teen can't use ChatGPT. The company said it will attempt to contact the users' parents if an under-18 user is having suicidal ideation and, if unable to reach them, will contact the authorities in case of imminent harm.",
      "\"We believe minors need significant protection,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement outlining the proposed changes.",
      "Child advocacy groups criticized the announcement as not enough.",
      "\"This is a fairly common tactic \u2014 it's one that Meta uses all the time \u2014 which is to make a big, splashy announcement right on the eve of a hearing which promises to be damaging to the company,\" said Josh Golin, executive director of Fairplay, a group advocating for children's online safety.",
      "\"What they should be doing is not targeting ChatGPT to minors until they can prove that it's safe for them,\" Golin said. \"We shouldn't allow companies, just because they have tremendous resources, to perform uncontrolled experiments on kids when the implications for their development can be so vast and far-reaching.\"",
      "California State Senator Steve Padilla, who introduced legislation to create safeguards in the state around AI Chatbots, said in a statement to CBS News, \"We need to create common-sense safeguards that rein in the worst impulses of this emerging technology that even the tech industry doesn't fully understand.\"",
      "He added that technology companies can lead the world in innovation, but it shouldn't come at the expense of \"our children's health.\"",
      "The Federal Trade Commission said last week it had launched an inquiry into several companies about the potential harms to children and teenagers who use their AI chatbots as companions.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 For a fourth time, President Trump has pushed back enforcing a bipartisan law that would effectively ban\u00a0TikTok over the video-sharing app's failure to cut ties with ByteDance, its China-based parent company.",
      "The president signed an executive order Tuesday extending the pause on enforcing the law until at least Dec. 16.",
      "The move comes on the heels of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's announcement Monday that U.S. and Chinese negotiators had agreed to \"a framework\" to resolve a dispute over TikTok's ownership. Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are planning to speak Friday \"to firm everything up,\" as Mr. Trump put it Tuesday morning.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "Under the law, ByteDance must divest from TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "Members of Congress and national security officials have for years warned that TikTok could serve as a vehicle for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda. During his first term, Mr. Trump tried unsuccessfully to ban the app, citing the potential security risks.",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has praised TikTok for helping him win the support of young voters and dismissed concerns about the app as \"highly overrated.\" The White House recently launched its own TikTok account.",
      "Mr. Trump has said for months that a deal to sell TikTok is on the verge, but the details of an official agreement, which would be subject to approval from the Chinese government, have yet to be made public.",
      "\"We have American buyers,\" Mr. Trump told reporters last month, adding that he had yet to speak with Xi about a sale.",
      "Mr. Trump also teased a deal in late June, telling Fox News in an interview that a group of wealthy individuals had agreed to buy TikTok and he would be sharing more in the coming weeks. Mr. Trump said he thought Xi \"will probably do it.\"",
      "Discussions with China about a potential sale were happening \"at the highest level,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on June 30.",
      "In late July, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview on CNBC that the \"deal is over to them right now,\" referring to China, and warned that TikTok \"is going to go dark\" if it's not approved.",
      "\"We made the decision. We can't have Chinese control and have something on 100 million American phones,\" he said.",
      "Lutnick said China or ByteDance \"can have a little piece\" but \"Americans will have control\" of the algorithm and \"own the technology.\"",
      "TikTok was a topic of conversation during Bessent's trade talks on Monday with Chinese officials in Spain. When asked by reporters later in the day whether China would have a stake in the company, Mr. Trump said, \"We haven't decided that.\"",
      "An apparent deal in April fell through after Mr. Trump announced new tariffs on China. The deal would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time.",
      "Sources with knowledge of the negotiations told CBS News this week that the latest deal includes technology company Oracle and private equity firm Silver Lake. (David Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded on Tuesday morning that China will \"firmly defend its national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, and will carry out technology export approvals according to relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "The statement added that the Chinese government \"also fully respects the will of enterprises and supports them in conducting business negotiations on an equal footing in accordance with market principles.\"",
      "Lawmakers have said that any deal that does not divest TikTok from ByteDance runs afoul of the law, including any arrangement that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. while using ByteDance's algorithm.",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court, TikTok's lawyer said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to completely cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. In legal filings, TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to access global content and vice versa.",
      "Trump claims authority to not enforce law",
      "Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor, said it's not unusual for laws to go unenforced, but it's typically because there are resource constraints or the law is ambiguous. The TikTok law is \"completely unambiguous,\" he said.",
      "\"There's no room to argue that the law doesn't say what it says and there's also no resource constraint,\" he said. \"I don't think that there is a sort of similar instance of this sort of flagrant attempt to let a company violate the law.\"",
      "In letters to tech companies earlier this year, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote that Mr. Trump \"determined that an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform would interfere with the execution of the president's constitutional duties to take care of the national security and foreign affairs of the United States.\"",
      "Bondi said the Justice Department is \"irrevocably relinquishing\" any legal claims against the companies, informing them that they can continue to make TikTok available in their app stores \"without violating the act, and without incurring any legal liability.\"",
      "The letters were made public in early July as part of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits.",
      "\"Whatever your view of prosecutorial discretion, it does not give the president the power to say that something prohibited by statute is actually lawful,\" said Zachary Price, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco. \"It would at most let you suspend enforcement. In other words, you might be able to never seek penalties under the law, but \u2026 you can't tell them that they're acting lawfully when they're violating the statute.\"",
      "Anupam Chander, a law professor at Georgetown University, called the claims in Bondi's letters an \"excessive assertion of presidential power.\"",
      "But Chander said that by not enforcing the law instead of shutting it down, Mr. Trump may have a better chance at accomplishing what Congress insisted was the law's intent: to force a sale.",
      "\"It's a lot harder to sell a dead horse than a live horse,\" Chander said. \"If you force it to shut down and then hope in six months that you might engineer a sale \u2014 at that point, the value might have diminished so much that there's very little reason, very little economic incentive for ByteDance to sell at all.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's non-enforcement of the law has prompted some pushback from lawmakers, though the intensity has been relatively muted compared to the alarms Congress sounded over the app's potential national security risks.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",

      "\"Ultimately, it's happening because, you know, the royal family \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 is the biggest trump card this government can play at big moments of international statesmanship and diplomacy,\" Roya Nikkhah, the royal editor for the Sunday Times newspaper, told CBS News ahead of Mr. Trump's arrival. \"There's a lot in it for us and our government in terms of national interest, and President Trump will get all those images that he desperately wants to have again.\"",
      "Growing divisions in the United Kingdom",
      "While Mr. Trump is briefly leaving behind a United States still rattled by the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk last week, he's touching down in a nation facing its own political divisions.",
      "Mr. Trump's visit comes as Starmer faces the most significant political headwinds of his one-year premiership. His government has come under mounting pressure from an ascendant right-wing political movement at home, against a backdrop of growing polarization in Britain. Powerful outside voices, including tech billionaire and former close Trump ally Elon Musk, have been accused of stoking these divisions",
      "A demonstration in London organized by far-right, anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, drew more than 110,000 people on Saturday, billed as a rally to \"Unite the Kingdom\" and for free speech. Musk himself addressed the rally by video-link. Eight people were arrested, and a small number of Robinson supporters clashed with police officers who were keeping them apart from counterprotesters.",
      "As CBS News' Haley Ott reported from the protest on Saturday, among the Union Jacks and England flags carried by many members of the crowd, there were also MAGA hats and American flags.",
      "\"Britain is a nation proudly built on tolerance, diversity and respect. Our flag represents our diverse country and we will never surrender it to those that use it as a symbol of violence, fear and division,\" Starmer said in a social media post on Sunday, rebuking some of the behavior seen at the march.",
      "There has also been much criticism of the rhetoric employed by Musk when he addressed the weekend demonstration.",
      "\"Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die,\" the billionaire, who has been a vocal critic of Starmer since he took office in July 2024, told the crowd.",
      "While Mr. Trump may no longer be on friendly terms with Musk, his administration is ideologically aligned with the two central themes of Saturday's demonstration in London: advocating for free speech and an aggressively nationalist immigration policy.",
      "That could make discussions with Mr. Trump diplomatically challenging for Starmer to navigate when they meet later this week.",
      "U.K. ambassador's dismissal over Epstein badly timed for Starmer and Trump",
      "The man who would have had a key role in the organization of the president's state visit is no longer in his post. Peter Mandelson was fired by Starmer as British Ambassador to the United States last week after new details emerged of his ties to Epstein. That also helped put the issue and questions around Mr. Trump's own past relationship with Epstein back in the headlines, a subject he has dismissed as a Democrat-inspired \"hoax.\"",
      "Starmer removed Mandelson from the key post after days of drip-fed revelations about Mandelson's years-long friendship with convicted sex offender Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell in New York in 2019.",
      "Pressure started mounting on Starmer to take action when messages written by Mandelson to Epstein were released by the U.S. House Oversight Committee earlier this month, as part of a redacted 2003 \"birthday book\" to the late financier. They included a series of short notes accompanied by photos.",
      "Among other personal messages, Mandelson wrote that Epstein was known for \"taking you by surprise... in one of his glorious homes he likes to share with his friends (yum yum),\" and that \"wherever he is in the world, he remains my best pal!\"",
      "The final straw for Starmer, however, came after Bloomberg published a selection of emails on Sept. 10, from about 100 emails said to have been exchanged between Mandelson and Epstein between 2005 and\u00a0 2010. Their contents, including suggestions by Mandelson that Epstein vigorously defend himself against the sexual misconduct allegations, led to Starmer promptly firing the ambassador.",
      "In a podcast interview, Mandelson acknowledged the veracity of his correspondence with Epstein and expressed his deep regret that he had ever interacted with him, insisting he never saw evidence of the financier's crimes and had believed previous rebuttals issued by his attorneys.",
      "The \"birthday book\" in question is the same document The Wall Street Journal first reported the existence of in July, prompting Mr. Trump, who is also alleged to have written a message for Epstein in the book, to file a lawsuit against the newspaper and the owner of its parent company, Rupert Murdoch.",
      "The Wall Street Journal published the full document, showing Mr. Trump's alleged signature, last week.",
      "Mr. Trump denies writing the message, calling it and the signature \"fake.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Starmer are unlikely to avoid questions from journalists during the state visit this week about the deceased sex offender.",

    "summary": "The Senate confirmed Trump economic adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve to finish Adriana Kugler's term. Miran plans to return to his White House job afterward.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate on Monday confirmed economist and Trump adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, giving President Trump more influence over the Fed just one day before central bank officials will meet to decide whether to cut interest rates.",
      "Miran was confirmed 48-47 for a term that runs until January, filling a vacancy created last month when Biden appointee Adriana Kugler stepped down before the end of her term. Miran currently chairs the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. In an unusual move, he's said he will take an unpaid leave of absence from that job while serving on the Fed board instead of resigning altogether, citing \"the short duration of the appointment.\"",
      "Miran is arriving at the central bank in time for a crucial Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, during which 12 top Fed officials \u2014 including Miran \u2014 will discuss monetary policy and decide whether to change the Fed's target interest rate. The committee is widely expected to vote for a rate cut, after leaving rates stable so far this year.",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Fed officials for not cutting interest rates sooner, nicknaming Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" \u2014 pressuring a central bank that typically operates independently. The president favors a rate cut because it could boost economic growth and slash borrowing costs for American consumers, but the move could risk causing inflation to heat up.",
      "The Senate Banking Committee advanced Miran's nomination in a party-line vote last week, after lawmakers grilled him on whether he would preserve the Fed's independence.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the committee's top Democrat, alleged last week Miran's nomination was part of a gambit by Mr. Trump to \"seize personal control of the Fed,\" citing his decision not to fully resign from his White House role.",
      "\"He will have zero credibility with markets, zero credibility with businesses, and zero credibility with the public if he is confirmed to the Board under these circumstances,\" Warren said.",
      "But Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who chairs the committee, lauded Miran, saying he \"brings deep experience, proven leadership and a clear commitment to ensuring that the American economy remains strong and competitive.\"",
      "Miran said in a hearing earlier this month he believes the \"independence of monetary policy is a critical element for [the Fed's] success,\" and \"I intend to preserve that independence.\"",
      "Miran also said he would \"absolutely resign\" from the Council of Economic Advisers if he is confirmed to a longer term on the Fed board after his four-month appointment runs out.",
      "In a written questionnaire for senators, Miran didn't rule out attending meetings for the White House's Council of Economic Advisers and consulting with CEA staff, but \"only in my capacity as a member of the Fed and to the extent appropriate for a member of the Fed in the normal course of business.\" He also said he will not have access to his CEA email while at the Fed.",
      "The Miran nomination is just one move by Mr. Trump that could reshape the central bank.",
      "The president moved to fire Fed board member Lisa Cook last month, accusing her of making false statements on mortgage documents. Cook argued the firing was unlawful, and a judge ruled last week that Cook can remain on the board while a lawsuit plays out. The Trump administration asked an appeals court to halt that ruling before this week's interest rate meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump will also have an opportunity to pick a new Fed chair when Powell's four-year term in the role ends in May. The president has floated firing Powell before then, but the idea is legally untested. Powell's 14-year term on the Fed board does not end until 2028, so he could remain on the board until then while giving up his role as chair. Some prior Fed chiefs have stepped down after their time as chair runs out, but it's unclear if Powell will follow suit.",
      "Two other Fed board members \u2014 Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 were confirmed during Mr. Trump's first term. If the president succeeds in firing Cook, and if Powell resigns next year, five of the Fed Board of Governors' seven members would be Trump nominees.",

      "The Biden administration in 2021 imposed restrictions on Hungarian passport holders born outside of Hungary and reduced the timeframe of authorized travel permitted under the Visa Waiver Program, citing a simplified naturalization policy backed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban that extended citizenship to people born abroad who claimed Hungarian ancestry.",
      "Officials said at the time that nearly 1 million people were granted citizenship between 2011 and 2020 without adequate vetting.",
      "Under the Visa Waiver Program, most citizens of participating countries are allowed to visit the United States for 90 days or fewer, if they obtain approval within the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). Citizens from more than 40 countries are eligible to travel to the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program, according to the State Department's\u00a0website.",
      "While ESTA approvals typically allow travel over a span of two years, restrictions added by the U.S. in 2023 had reduced that validity period for the Hungarian travelers born outside the country from two years to one, and limited the authorization to only one entry into the U.S.",
      "Beginning Sept. 30, the Trump administration is restoring the validity period back to two years and allowing Hungarians to make multiple entries into the U.S. within that time.",
      "\"The United States and Hungary have a strong security partnership, and that commitment is reflected in the actions that Hungary has taken to meet the security standards of the Visa Waiver Program,\" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.",

      "While Mr. Trump has embraced Orban, the Biden administration had a colder relationship with the NATO ally. Then-President Biden criticized the Hungarian leader in 2024 as \"looking for a dictatorship.\" Hungary for months delayed the expansion of NATO to include Sweden and Finland, arguing their additions would antagonize Russia.",

      "The precise structure of the final deal was unclear Monday night, but will include multiple companies, the sources said. It's not clear what level of involvement Chinese firms \u2014 including TikTok's current parent company ByteDance \u2014 will have in the deal, and who will control TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm. Presidents Trump and Xi are expected to talk on Friday.",
      "The deal includes a blend of new investors, including Silver Lake, a private equity firm based in California, and existing investors, the sources said.",

      "\"We have a group of very big companies that want to buy it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And, you know, the kids wanted it so badly. I had parents calling me up. They don't want it for themselves.

      "Last year, Congress passed and then-President Joe Biden signed a bill that essentially gave TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, an ultimatum: either divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a unanimous 9-0 decision.

TikTok has long denied that the Chinese authorities exert any influence on the platform.",
      "The concerns stretch back to Mr. Trump's first term.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, a stinging rebuke to a traditional U.S. ally that reflects a recent surge in cocaine production and fraying ties between the White House and the country's leftist president.",
      "Even as it determined that Colombia had failed to comply with its international counternarcotics obligations, the Trump administration issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered major aid cuts, citing vital U.S. national interests.",
      "Nonetheless, it is a major step against one of the United States' staunchest allies in Latin America, and it could further hamper efforts to restore security in the countryside, according to Adam Isacson, a security researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he regretted the decision, which overlooked decades of bloodshed by Colombian security forces and civilians all in the name of a U.S.-led drug war.",
      "\"Everything we do has nothing to do with the Colombian people,\" Petro said during a televised address Monday night. \"It is to prevent the American society from smearing its noses in order to work, work and work, because this drug is a stimulant.\"",
      "The U.S. last added Colombia to the list, through a process known as decertification, in 1997 when the country's cartels \u2014 through threats of violence and money \u2014 had poisoned much of the nation's institutions.",
      "It \"is a blunt tool and a huge irritant in bilateral relations that goes well beyond drug issues and makes cooperation far harder in any number of areas,\" Isacson said. \"That's why it's so rarely used.\"",
      "The president at the time, Ernesto Samper, was facing credible accusations of receiving illicit campaign contributions from the now-defunct Cali cartel, and a plane he was set to use for a trip to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly session was found carrying 4 kilograms of heroin.",
      "A remarkable turnaround began once Samper left office. Successive U.S. administrations \u2014 both Republican and Democrats \u2014 sent billions in foreign assistance to Colombia to eradicate illegal coca crops, strengthen its armed forces in the fight against drug-fueled rebels and provide economic alternatives to poor farmers who are on the lowest rungs of the cocaine industry.",
      "That cooperation started to unravel following the suspension a decade ago of aerial eradication of coca fields with glyphosate. It followed a Colombian high court ruling that determined the U.S.-funded program was potentially harmful to the environment and farmers.",
      "A 2016 peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest rebel group known as FARC, also committed Colombia to rolling back punitive policies likened to the U.S. spraying of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War in favor of state building, rural development and voluntary crop substitution.",
      "Since then, cocaine production has skyrocketed. The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N.

      "Along with production, drug seizures have also soared to 654 metric tons so far this year. Colombia seized a record 884 metric tons last year.",
      "But unlike past governments, manual eradication of coca crops under Petro's leadership has slowed, to barely 5,048 hectares this year \u2014 far less than the 68,000 hectares uprooted in the final year of his conservative predecessor's term and well below the government's own goal of 30,000 hectares.",
      "Petro, a former rebel himself, also has angered senior U.S. officials by denying American extradition requests, as well as criticizing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and its efforts to combat drug trafficking in neighboring Venezuela.",
      "\"Under my administration, Colombia does not collaborate in assassinations,\" Petro said on Sept. 5 after the U.S. military carried out a deadly strike on a small Venezuelan vessel in the Caribbean that the Trump administration said was transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\"The failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership,\" Trump said in a presidential memo submitted to Congress. \"I will consider changing this designation if Colombia's government takes more aggressive action to eradicate coca and reduce cocaine production and trafficking, as well as hold those producing, trafficking, and benefiting from the production of cocaine responsible, including through improved cooperation with the United States to bring the leaders of Colombian criminal organizations to justice.\"",
      "Under U.S. law, the president annually must identify countries that have failed to meet their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months.",
      "In addition to Colombia, the Trump administration listed four other countries \u2014 Afghanistan, Bolivia, Myanmar and Venezuela \u2014 as among 23 major drug transit or drug-production countries that have failed to meet their international obligations. With the exception of Afghanistan, the White House determined that U.S. assistance to those countries was vital to national interests and therefore they would be spared any potential sanctions.",
      "The redesignation of Venezuela as a country that has failed to adequately fight narcotics smuggled from neighboring Colombia comes against the backdrop of a major U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean that has already led to two deadly strikes on small Venezuelan vessels that the Trump administration said were transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\"In Venezuela, the criminal regime of indicted drug trafficker Nicol\u00e1s Maduro leads one of the largest cocaine trafficking networks in the world, and the United States will continue to seek to bring Maduro and other members of his complicit regime to justice for their crimes,\" Trump's designation said. \"We will also target Venezuelan foreign terrorist organizations such as Tren de Aragua and purge them from our country.\"",

    "story": [
      "Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Wednesday as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate. Officials described it as a \"targeted attack,\" and it drew\u00a0condemnation from both sides of the political aisle as authorities launched a massive search for the suspect.",
      "On Friday, officials announced they have a person in custody for the fatal shooting. They identified him as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who resides in southern Utah. Robinson was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office.",
      "Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray is reviewing the evidence to determine the appropriate charges and plans to file them on Tuesday, Christopher Ballard, chief of staff for the Utah County Attorney's Office, confirmed to CBS News on Saturday. Robinson could make his first court appearance Tuesday afternoon, Ballard said.",
      "Kirk, who co-founded the right-wing advocacy group Turning Point USA, was 31. He is survived by his wife, Erika, and two young children.",
      "Turning Point USA announced Saturday that a public funeral for Kirk will be held on Sunday, Sept. 21, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.",
      "Here is what we know so far about the assassination and ongoing investigation.",
      "Who is the suspect?",
      "More details about Robinson and what happened before and after the attack are emerging.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Robinson is not a student at Utah Valley University, where the attack took place, and has been living with his family in Washington County, located in the southwestern corner of the state. Family members said Robinson had \"become more political\" in recent years, the governor said.",
      "Utah State University said Robinson briefly attended the school for one semester in 2021. According to the Utah System of Higher Education, Robinson was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St. George, Utah.",
      "Robinson's father owns a business installing kitchen countertops and cabinets and his mother is a licensed social worker, according to public records and their social media accounts. Robinson is the oldest of three brothers.",
      "\"They are very supportive parents who loved their boys and are involved in the community,\" a neighbor who said she knew the Robinson family well but had not seen Robinson in a few years told CBS News. She also said the parents were supportive of the country and of President Trump.",
      "State records show that Robinson registered to vote as unaffiliated. He is listed as an inactive voter in state records, meaning he didn't vote in the last two elections. He was not old enough to vote in 2020.",
      "Robinson had no prior felony or misdemeanor convictions and no prior violent offenses, according to a Public Safety Assessment Report filed in Utah state court.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said Robinson was taken into custody at 10 p.m. local time Thursday night, though Utah officials said it was in the early hours of Friday. Records from the Utah County Sheriff's Office Corrections Division show he was booked into jail at 7:58 a.m. local time (9:58 a.m. ET).",
      "Mr. Trump first broke the news on \"Fox and Friends\" that someone had been taken into custody.",
      "\"With a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody. Everyone did a great job,\" the president said.",
      "Cox said messages on Discord, an instant messaging and social media platform, that were reviewed by investigators referenced a rifle wrapped in a towel that was left in the woods and engravings on bullets. The messages came from a person named \"Tyler\" and were shared with an unidentified individual, Cox said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Discord said it had removed an account associated with Robinson for violating the company's \"off-platform behavior policy,\" which prohibits users from engaging in various forms of violence, and will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement. The spokesperson also said Discord \"found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence\" on the platform itself.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by this tragedy and extend our condolences to the Kirk family and everyone affected,\" Discord's statement said. \"The messages referenced in recent reporting about planning details do not appear to be Discord messages. These were communications between the suspect's roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.\"",
      "A Discord spokesperson also confirmed the company provided law enforcement with copies of chat messages in which the 22-year-old suspect appeared to confess to the killing to a group of friends.",
      "According to the spokesperson, an account appearing to belong to Robinson claimed responsibility for the shooting in a message to a group of online friends on Thursday night, about two hours before officials said Robinson was taken into custody.",
      "\"Hey guys, I have bad news for you all,\" read the message from the account allegedly belonging to Robinson. \"It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this,\" Robinson wrote, according to a Discord spokesperson and a law enforcement source.",
      "The spokesperson also confirmed additional messages from an account allegedly belonging to Robinson that suggested he planned to turn himself in to authorities, including one that read, \"im surrendering through a sheriff friend in a few moments, thanks for all the good times and laughs, you've all been so amazing, thank you all for everything.\"",
      "The Washington Post was first to report on the content of the messages.",
      "The governor said authorities believe Robinson acted alone and said there is currently no information that would lead to additional arrests. He told reporters Friday morning he can't answer questions about the possible motive of the suspect.",
      "Robinson is currently on \"special watch\" at the Utah County Jail while he is being evaluated to determine if he is a risk to himself or others, Utah County Sheriff's Spokesperson Sgt. Raymond Ormond told CBS News. The Utah County Sheriff said in a statement on Sunday that he had not been made aware of any suicide concerns or comments involving Robinson, but noted that the suspect would \"remain on a special watch status until cleared by mental health, which may take several days.\"",
      "Individuals are held in a special housing unit while on special watch.",
      "\"Tyler Robinson is being housed in our special housing unit so that we can keep a close eye on him,\" the sheriff's statement said. \"This is done for various reasons ranging from: the types of crimes you're booked on, behavioral issues, violent behavior, and/or suicidal comments made during the arrest.\"",
      "Ormond said everyone is given an initial screening after booking, but some are put on the more intensive special watch until they're screened.",
      "How the suspect was captured",
      "Cox said Robinson's father recognized his son as the subject of photos that were released by law enforcement and urged him to turn himself in.",
      "Robinson admitted to his father that he was the person in the photos, two federal law enforcement sources told CBS News. Robinson said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, the federal law enforcement sources said.",
      "Robinson's father called a youth pastor who knows the 22-year-old and is close to the family, and he and the pastor tried to calm Robinson down. The sources said the pastor, who also serves as a court security officer, called the U.S. Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies. Marshals  then detained Robinson and kept him secure while waiting for the FBI. The FBI later took him into custody.",
      "Investigators reviewed video footage and said they identified Robinson arriving on Utah Valley University's campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at around 8:29 a.m. local time Wednesday, the day of the shooting, according to the governor. Robinson was wearing a plain maroon T-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo and light-colored shoes, Cox said.",
      "He is believed to have changed clothing on the roof, where the shot was fired from, before changing back into what he was originally wearing. When investigators encountered Robinson, he was wearing clothing consistent with that outfit, the governor said.",
      "Tracking the suspect",
      "On Thursday, Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason described the suspect they were seeking as a male who \"blended in\" with the college community and appeared to be college age.",
      "The public safety department and the Salt Lake City FBI office posted images of someone they called a \"person of interest,\" showing an individual appearing to wear a dark long-sleeve shirt, a hat and sunglasses. More photos posted later on Thursday showed the person wearing a backpack.",
      "Mason said investigators were able to track the shooter's movements before and after the assassination.",
      "According to a probable cause statement filed by investigators after Robinson's arrest, investigators were able to track his movements on campus starting at approximately 11:50 a.m. local time on Wednesday. He was observed entering a building called the Losee Center near where Kirk's event was taking place, which was the shooting location, and going up to the roof, according to the statement.",
      "Mason said the shooter moved to the other side of the building after firing a single shot, then jumped off and fled into a neighborhood off campus. Investigators contacted homeowners with cameras and witnesses to identify leads, he said.",
      "In a news briefing Thursday evening in Orem, Utah, with Patel in attendance, officials released security video that showed a man \u2014 who Mason called a suspect \u2014 running across the roof and then climbing down the side of the building immediately after the shooting.",
      "As he climbed off the edge of the building and dropped down, he \"left some palm impressions, some smudges, some places we're looking to collect DNA,\" along with a shoe print that indicated he was wearing Converse tennis shoes, Mason told reporters while showing the video.",
      "\"It's important to note his black t-shirt, his black pants, and there appears to be some white on the soles of those Converse tennis shoes,\" Mason said. \"Those are all identifiable items that we're looking for.\"",
      "After dropping off the building, the video showed the man moving across a grassy area before entering traffic. Mason said he crossed the street into a wooded area, where the firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was later found.",
      "The FBI said it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads law enforcement to identify and arrest the person or people involved in Kirk's assassination. Patel said authorities had received more than 11,000 leads as of Friday morning.",
      "Gun and bullet casings recovered",
      "FBI special-agent-in-charge Robert Bohls said Thursday that investigators recovered a \"high-powered, bolt-action rifle,\" which they believe was the weapon used in the assassination. It was found in a wooded area where the shooter fled and was wrapped in a towel, according to Bohls. The rifle was determined to be a Mauser .30-06-caliber bolt-action rifle, according to the probable cause statement.",
      "Patel suggested on Monday that investigators found DNA linking Robinson to the scene of the shooting on some of the items they recovered, including a screwdriver and a towel.",
      "\"The DNA hits from the towel that was wrapped around the firearm, and the DNA on the screwdriver, are positively processed for the suspect in custody,\"\u00a0Patel said on \"Fox & Friends.\"",
      "Cox said that there were inscriptions on the casings of the bullet that was fired, as well as on the casings of three bullets that were not fired.",
      "According to the probable cause statement, the fired bullet casing contained the inscription, \"Notices Buldge OWO what's this?\" An unfired bullet casing read, \"hey fascist! CATCH!\" followed by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow symbol and three down arrow symbols. And a second unfired casing read, \"O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!\" A third unfired casing said, \"If you read This, you are GAY Lmao.\"",
      "Cox didn't speculate on the meaning of the inscriptions.",
      "Investigators also have a footwear impression, palm print and forearm imprints that will be analyzed, the FBI official said.",
      "Timeline of \"targeted attack\"",
      "The event where Kirk was speaking was scheduled to begin in the UVU courtyard at noon.",
      "A CBS News review of livestream footage and video metadata indicates Kirk was shot around 12:23 p.m., which is also when the FBI's Patel said Kirk was shot. He was struck in the neck by a single gunshot.",
      "A map produced by CBS News' Confirmed team shows where Kirk was when he was shot \u2014 in the central courtyard of Utah Valley University, which is surrounded by campus buildings.",
      "A university spokeswoman said Wednesday that they believed the shot was fired from the Losee Center. A law enforcement source told CBS News that the gunman appeared to have fired from the building's roof.",
      "The FBI released a video\u00a0\u2014 timestamped at 12:23 p.m. local time \u2014 that appears to show a person climbing off a roof at Utah Valley University and fleeing the scene. Dispatch audio reviewed by CBS News described a person on the roof of a nearby building wearing black clothing and carrying a long rifle.",
      "Video captured at 2:37 p.m. shows officers searching an area around a quarter mile north of the campus.",
      "At 2:40, more than two hours after the shooting, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Kirk had died.",
      "While authorities have not specified a potential motive for the shooting, Mason said they believe it was a \"targeted attack toward one individual.\" Only one shot was fired, and Kirk was the only victim, the commissioner said.",
      "Cox called the shooting \"a political assassination,\" while Mr. Trump, in a video posted to Truth Social, blamed it on \"radical left political violence,\" which he said \"has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.\"",
      "Charlie Kirk's influence in politics",
      "Kirk was shot while he was speaking at a \"Prove Me Wrong\" debate, a trademark event for Kirk's Turning Point USA, which is a conservative organization focused on young people. He would hold political debates with a group that usually consisted of left-leaning attendees.",
      "Kirk had visited the Utah university as part of a nationwide tour of college campuses that was scheduled to continue for the next two months. About 3,000 people attended the outdoor event where he was assassinated, the Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump called Kirk legendary, saying, \"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.\"",
      "Kirk was a close Trump ally and was credited with galvanizing younger voters during his campaign. He made it his mission to engage more young people in politics and register them to vote. Kirk was also a close friend of the president's son, Donald Trump Jr.",
      "Kirk was the host of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" a daily conservative talk radio show and amassed millions of followers on social media.",
      "Kirk's politics, however, weren't without controversy. He pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",
      "He was a friend of JD Vance, who said Kirk advocated \"in public and private\" for Mr. Trump to pick him as his running mate last year.",
      "\"So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,\" Vance said after Kirk was killed. \"He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump linked the beheading of a Dallas motel manager to immigration policies, blaming the Biden administration for allowing the Cuban national accused in the killing to remain in the U.S. despite prior arrests.",
      "Chandra Nagamallaiah died last week, and Dallas police identified Yordanis Cobos-Martinez as the suspect. Cobos-Martinez is being held in the Dallas County Jail for capital murder and has an immigration hold, jail records show.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed it has lodged a detainer with the Dallas County Jail for Cobos-Martinez's federal arrest and removal. In a statement, ICE said he is a Cuban national and in the U.S. illegally.",
      "In a\u00a0post on his Truth Social account\u00a0Sunday evening, Mr. Trump said, \"I am aware of the terrible reports regarding the murder of Chandra Nagamallaiah, a well respected person in Dallas, Texas, who was brutally beheaded, in front of his wife and son, by an ILLEGAL ALIEN from Cuba who should have never been in our Country. This individual was previously arrested for terrible crimes, including child sex abuse, grand theft auto, and false imprisonment, but was released back into our Homeland under incompetent Joe Biden because Cuba did not want such an evil person in their Country.\"",
      "While Cobos-Martinez has an extensive arrest history, he was not convicted in every case. Court records show the child indecency case against Cobos-Martinez was dropped due to insufficient evidence, and Cobos-Martinez was acquitted of grand theft auto after a trial in California.",
      "According to ICE, Cobos-Martinez was under a final order to be deported but Cuba would not take him back due to his criminal record. He was released from the Bluebonnet Detention Center in the final days of the Biden administration under an order of supervision, ICE said.",
      "In response to a request for comment from CBS News Texas, a former Biden administration official said, \"The Order of Supervision was issued seven days before President Biden left office and therefore managed by the Trump administration. If the Order of Supervision was not upheld for 8 months and they somehow lost track of the individual allegedly responsible for this heinous crime, then the Trump administration should answer to this.\"",
      "Since taking office, the Trump administration has implemented a new policy to deport nationals from countries without deportation agreements to third countries that are willing to accept them. Those countries include Guatemala, South Sudan, Eswatini and Rwanda.",
      "\"Rest assured, the time for being soft on these Illegal Immigrant Criminals is OVER under my watch! Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Border Czar Tom Homan, and many others in my Administration, are doing an incredible job in, MAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN,\" Mr. Trump's post said.",
      "Grisly attack, beheading at Dallas motel",
      "On Sept. 10, Dallas police responded to the Downtown Suites motel on Samuell Boulevard in Old East Dallas. According to an arrest affidavit, Cobos-Martinez became upset with Nagamallaiah, pulled out a machete and started attacking.",
      "Nagamallaiah's wife and son, who were in the motel office, tried to intervene several times, police said, but Cobos-Martinez pushed them away and continued the attack. Cobos-Martinez then took Nagamallaiah's cell phone and key card from his pockets before again resuming the attack until Nagamallaiah's head \"was removed from his body,\" police said.",
      "Mr. Trump said Cobos-Martinez would be charged with murder in the first degree, which is not a charge in Texas. The equivalent charge is capital murder, which carries a mandatory life sentence with the possibility of the death sentence.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit declined to grant the Trump administration emergency relief and clear the way for Mr. Trump to remove Cook from her position.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Monday rejected a bid from President Trump's administration to allow the president to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, leaving intact a lower court order that reinstated her to the post.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit divided 2-1 in declining to grant the Trump administration emergency relief and clear the way for Mr. Trump to remove Cook from her position. The Trump administration is likely to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. But absent an 11th-hour order from the high court, the decision all but ensures Cook will remain a governor on the seven-member Fed board through a two-day meeting of its interest rate-setting committee, which Cook sits on and is set to begin Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to oust Cook from the Fed's Board of Governors last month over allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook denies any wrongdoing.",
      "Judge Bradley Garcia wrote in a concurring opinion joined by Judge Michelle Childs that Cook is likely to succeed in arguing that Mr. Trump's attempt to remove her violated her due process rights. Judge Gregory Katsas dissented.",
      "\"Given that Cook has a property interest in her position, she is entitled to 'some kind' of process before removal,\" Garcia wrote. \"Before this court, the government does not dispute that it provided Cook no meaningful notice or opportunity to respond to the allegations against her. The government argues only that Cook 'does not explain what difference a hearing would have made.' Even accepting that premise, Cook's entitlement to process stands apart from whether she would succeed in securing a different outcome.\"",
      "Garcia added that since Cook has continued to serve in her role despite her purported termination by Mr. Trump, granting the administration's request for emergency relief would \"upend\" the status quo.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said the agency \"does not comment on current or prospective litigation including matters that may be an investigation.\"",
      "The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit for emergency relief after U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that Cook's firing likely violated the Federal Reserve Act and her due process rights.",
      "The Federal Reserve Act specifies that the president can only remove a Fed governor \"for cause.\" While the term is not defined in the law, Cobb found \"for cause\" refers to in-office conduct. Because Cook's alleged misrepresentations on mortgage documents predate her tenure as a Fed governor, Cobb ruled that Mr. Trump lacked \"cause\" to remove Cook.",
      "The judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Fed to allow Cook to remain a member of its Board of Governors during the litigation.",
      "\"President Trump's stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cook's conduct before she began serving on the Federal Reserve Board,\" the judge wrote in her decision, adding that \"such allegations are not a legally permissible cause.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized the Fed for moving too slowly in cutting interest rates, though economists expect the central bank will announce a rate cut this week. If Cook's firing is ultimately allowed \u2014 a decision that will likely be made by the Supreme Court \u2014 and the president appoints a successor, it would mean he will have appointed the majority of the seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Mr. Trump announced on social media last month that he was firing Cook, appointed by former President Joe Biden, from the Fed Board of Governors and had \"sufficient cause\" to oust her. Cook's 14-year-term on the Fed is set to end in January 2038.",
      "The president cited as grounds for her removal claims made by Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that Cook made false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "Pulte alleged in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that Cook claimed two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence on mortgage documents from 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Pulte, who was appointed to lead the FHFA by Mr. Trump, has continued to make accusations against Cook related to mortgage documents.",
      "Cook has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Her lawyers said in court papers that she may have \"erred\" in filling out a form for a private mortgage, but said the events took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor and in her capacity as a private citizen.",
      "\"Governor Cook did not ever commit mortgage fraud,\" they wrote.",
      "Reuters reported Friday that a loan estimate for the property in Atlanta, dated May 28, 2021, showed that Cook declared that residence as a \"vacation home.\"",
      "Cook filed a lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump's effort to fire her, alleging that the move violated the Federal Reserve Act.",
      "While the law does not define \"cause,\" Cook's lawyers argued \"cause\" constitutes what is set out in other laws shielding officials at independent agencies from being fired at-will: instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "They said Mr. Trump relied on \"thinly-veiled pretext\" in an effort to oust Cook because she has not supported lowering the benchmark interest rate.",
      "\"[T]hose unsubstantiated allegations cannot camouflage the President's real reason for attempting to remove Governor Cook: he disagrees with her policy decisions,\" Cook's legal team wrote.",
      "The Fed said it is not taking a position on whether Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook is lawful and said it will follow any court orders.",
      "In defending Mr. Trump's move, Justice Department lawyers have said that Congress gave the president broad discretion to remove a Fed governor for \"cause\" through the Federal Reserve Act and argued that making \"contradictory statements\" on financial filings is sufficient ground for removing her.",
      "\"When Governors by misconduct or gross neglect erode the foundations of such confidence, the President acts properly and lawfully by removing them,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "They argued that the president's power of for-cause removal is discretionary, and the exercise of that authority is unreviewable by the courts. Justice Department lawyers also rejected the district court's conclusion that the public interest in the Fed's independence weighed in favor of Cook's reinstatement to her role on the Board of Governors.",
      "\"Even with the Federal Reserve's unique structure and history, its Governors are subject to removal for cause, and the President's actions to remove Cook based on her misconduct should strengthen, not diminish, the Federal Reserve's integrity,\" they wrote.",
      "Cook is one of several Democratic appointees at independent agencies who have been fired by Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House in January.\u00a0 But her removal is unprecedented, as no president has fired a member of the Fed board in the central bank's 112-year-history.",
      "Critics of the move have warned that Mr. Trump's attempt to terminate Cook threatens the independence of the Fed and, if allowed, the stability of markets and the U.S. economy.",
      "Among the other officials Mr. Trump has fired are members of the Federal Trade Commission, Merit Systems Protection Board, National Labor Relations Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, who have all sued to challenge their firings.",
      "The Supreme Court has allowed the president to oust members of the NLRB, MSPB and CPSC while their cases move forward, but it has drawn a line around the Fed. In a May decision, the high court said the central bank is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",

    "summary": "Kash Patel and his deputy Dan Bongino are challenging the FBI's fierce allegiance to message control.",
    "story": [
      "Toward the end of his remarks about the killing of Charlie Kirk last Friday, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox warned about the ills of America's increasingly vitriolic online culture.",
      "\"Social media is a cancer on our society right now,\" he said, imploring citizens to \"log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member and go out and do good in your community.\" Standing next to him was a stony-faced FBI Director Kash Patel, a heavy social media user who posts far more frequently than his predecessors in the job, Christopher Wray and James Comey.",
      "The juxtaposition did not go unnoticed by bureau veterans.",
      "\"You can be a social media influencer, or you can be FBI director,\" one recently retired special agent told CBS News. \"But you can't be both.\"",
      "But Patel is both, upending the agency's cautious communication culture with a steady flow of online observations and updates.",
      "That clash in cultures has never been more clear than it was last week, when the FBI chief faced intense scrutiny for his handling of the high-profile case. Repeatedly, he turned to social media to tout major developments in the case \u2014 in some cases prematurely. Hours after the shooting, he posted to his nearly 2 million followers on X at 6:21 p.m. ET, \"The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody.\" Then, less than two hours later, at 7:59 p.m., he had to backtrack, posting, \"The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement.\" Patel sought to address the quick \u2014 and misleading \u2014 initial post during a Fox News interview Monday.",
      "\"I was being transparent with working with the public on our findings, as I had them,\" he said on \"Fox and Friends.\"",
      "\"I stated in that message that we had a subject and that we were going to interview him, and we did and he was released,\" Patel told Fox News. \"Could I have worded it a little better in the heat of the moment? Sure. But do I regret putting it out? Absolutely not.\"",
      "Asked for comment, the FBI referred CBS News to Patel's interview on Fox News.",
      "FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino also defended Patel's and his own efforts to publish FBI developments as soon as something new to share.",
      "\"We are clinging to transparency,\" Bongino said on Fox News' \"America's Newsroom\" Monday. \"The era of Cronkite and Jennings generation is over. New media now is media and we want to be sure we can do everything in our power to share what we can when we can while still balancing the needs of the investigation.\"",
      "Dribbling out information in real time about a highly complex, sensitive and fast-moving investigation is a startling departure from past FBI directors, whose public messaging traditionally has been spare and buttoned-up.",
      "J. Edgar Hoover's vaunted publicity machine occupied a whole wing of the bureau dedicated to writing articles, issuing press releases, tending to Hollywood directors and TV producers \u2014 all in an effort to buff the reputation of the FBI and its legendary G-man. But according to Yale historian Beverly Gage, Hoover was particularly cautious about publicizing active investigations.",
      "\"Hoover himself was contained and buttoned-down,\" said Gage, author of the Pulitzer Prize winning biography \"G-Man: J. Edgar Hoover and the Making of the American Century.\" \"He did everything through elaborate bureaucratic procedure, so it's very hard to imagine him being unfiltered enough to be on social media in quite this way.\"",
      "Patel is a departure from previous FBI directors. He eschews the standard-issue uniform of past FBI chiefs \u2014 conservative suits and spit-polished shoes \u2014 in favor of bold ties and European-cut suits. A close friend says he sees himself as a \"disruptor\" intent on radically changing enforcement priorities \u2014 \"let cops be cops\" is one of his favorite slogans \u2014 while shaking up the bureau's staid culture.",
      "A former colleague who worked with Patel during the first Trump term says he has a \"bias for action,\" which may explain his exuberance on social media. \"He wants to get s*** done,\" this source said.",
      "Those harboring a less charitable view argue that Patel is an attention seeker who thrives on the spotlight. One former FBI agent pointed to an earlier episode that he said echoes Patel's rush to post details of the Kirk investigation on social media.",
      "During his confirmation hearing to be FBI director, a whistleblower told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that when Patel was working for the National Security Council in 2020, he violated government protocols by leaking to a newspaper the details of a hostage deal involving American citizens being held in Yemen. FBI officials were furious at the time, accusing Patel of jeopardizing the lives of the hostages so he could claim credit with the media. At the time, the White House and a source close to Patel denied the allegation.",
      "Last week, Patel's social media activity renewed similar concerns.",
      "\"In a sensitive investigation you don't want to tip your hand to things the public doesn't already know so that active evidence that is vital to the court process not get or disclosed unnecessarily to hinder the investigation,\" said Stephen Laycock, a former executive assistant director at the FBI who retired in 2021.",
      "Or as a former special agent said, \"Being the first to get 'likes' or clicks is not beneficial to the investigative process.\"",
      "The eventual arrest of a suspect in the Kirk shooting has staunched some of the initial chatter about Patel's comments. Still, on Tuesday he is expected to face a grilling from the Senate Judiciary Committee. A Senate source told CBS News that Democrats are preparing to go on the attack. And they believe they'll have plenty to work with.",
      "Even before Kirk's killing, the FBI was reeling from an unprecedented purge of some of the most experienced FBI executives and line agents, depleting the agency of decades of experience, critics say. Mehtab Syed, the highly regarded head of the FBI's Salt Lake City field office, was among the agents forced out at the end of July. Robert Bohls, the new head of the office that was on the front lines of the shooting investigation, started his job on Sept. 2, days before the Kirk shooting, a source familiar with the Salt Lake City FBI office confirmed.",
      "Three elite former agents filed a lawsuit last week accusing Patel of summarily firing them at the direction of the White House. The lawsuit highlighted Patel's focus on social media, arguing the agents' dismissals came in response to criticism on social media from right-wing influencers. At the same time, according to the complaint, Patel has urged FBI field agents to be more active on social media to tout \"FBI wins.\"",
      "One of the fired agents, former Washington field office Assistant Director Steven Jensen, expressed concern about Bongino's \"intense focus on increasing online engagement.\" Jensen alleged that the \"emphasis Bongino was placing on creating content for his social media feed could risk outweighing more deliberate analyses of investigations.\"",
      "It's a concern that has been circulating quietly among longtime bureau veterans.",
      "\"You aren't doing your job or leading an organization for the social media glory,\" said Laycock.",
      "Some officials who have interacted in person with Patel, say the director is misunderstood. As one law enforcement official described it to CBS News, Patel's brash online personality stands in contrast to a low-key, friendly demeanor that he exhibits in meetings.",
      "\"He's highly personable and even earnest,\" one law enforcement official said of his multiple meetings with Patel.",
      "Perhaps the most important person evaluating the director's performance over the past week, however, appeared to approve of it. President Trump made clear he is backing his FBI director.",
      "\"I am very proud of the FBI,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview with Fox News Digital on Saturday. \"Kash \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 they have done a great job.\"",

      "It has undergone a months-long renovation, costing nearly $60 million, adding six new galleries as well as classrooms and interactive experiences, changing a relatively static museum into a dynamic place where people are encouraged to take action in support of civil and human rights, racial justice and the future of democracy, said Jill Savitt, the center's president and CEO.",
      "The center has stayed active ahead of its Nov. 8 reopening through K-12 education programs that include more than 300 online lesson plans; a LGBTQ+ Institute; training in diversity, equity and inclusion; human rights training for law enforcement; and its Truth & Transformation Initiative to spread awareness about forced labor, racial terror and other historic injustices. It is these same topics that have often been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration and its supporters, amid what many historians see as an effort to wrest greater control over the national narrative and play down some of the darker episodes in America's past.",
      "Dreamed up by civil rights icons Evelyn Lowery and Andrew Young, the center opened in 2014 on land donated by the Coca-Cola Company, next to the Georgia Aquarium and The World of Coca-Cola, and became a major tourist attraction. But ticket sales declined after the pandemic.",
      "Now the center hopes to attract more repeat visitors with immersive experiences like \"Change Agent Adventure,\" aimed at children under 12. These \"change agents\" will be asked to pledge to do something \u2014 no matter how small \u2014 that \"reflects the responsibility of each of us to play a role in the world: To have empathy. To call for justice. To be fair, be kind. And that's the ethos of this gallery,\" Savitt said. It opens next April.",
      "\"I think advocacy and change-making is kind of addictive. It's contagious,\" Savitt explained. \"When you do something, you see the success of it, you really want to do more. And our desire here is to whet the appetite of kids to see that they can be involved. They can do it.\"",
      "This ethos is sharply different from the idea that young people can't handle the truth and must be protected from unpleasant challenges but, Savitt said, \"the history that we tell here is the most inspirational history.\"",
      "\"In fact, I think it's what makes America great. It is something to be patriotically proud of. The way activists over time have worked together through nonviolence and changed democracy to expand human freedom \u2014 there's nothing more American and nothing greater than that. That is the lesson that we teach here,\" she said.",
      "\"Broken Promises,\" opening in December, includes exhibits from the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, cut short when white mobs sought to brutally reverse advances by formerly enslaved people. \"We want to start orienting you in the conversation that we believe we all kind of see, but we don't say it outright: Progress. Backlash. Progress. Backlash. And that pattern that has been in our country since enslavement,\" said its curator, Kama Pierce.",
      "On display will be a bullet-riddled historical marker from the site of the 1918 lynching of Mary Turner in Georgia, which was donated by her descendants to keep it from being vandalized again.",
      "\"There are 11 bullet holes and 11 grandchildren living,\" Pierce said, noting that some of the family's words will be incorporated into the exhibit to show their resilience.",
      "The center hosts many Items from the Morehouse College Martin Luther King Jr. collection, which will have a much more prominent place in a room that recreates King's home office, with family photos contributed by the center's first guest curator: his daughter, the Rev. Bernice King. \"We wanted to lift up King's role as a man, as a human being, not just as an icon,\" Savitt explained.",
      "Gone are huge images that used to be featured of historical figures associated with mass atrocities such as Hitler, Stalin and Mao, with details of the millions of people killed under their orders. In their place will be examples of human rights victories by groups working around the world.",
      "\"The research says that if you tell people things are really bad and how awful they are, you motivate people for a minute, and then apathy sets in because it's too hard to do anything,\" Savitt said. \"But if you give people something to hope for that's positive, that they can see themselves doing, you're more likely to cultivate a sense of agency in people.\"",
      "And doubling in capacity is an experience many can't forget: Joining a 1960s sit-in against segregation. Wearing headphones as they take a lunch-counter stool, visitors can both hear and feel an angry, segregationist mob shouting they don't belong. Because this is \"heavy content,\" Savitt says, a new \"reflection area\" will enable people to pause afterward on a couch, with tissues if they need them, to consider what they've just been through.",
      "The center's expansion was seeded by Home Depot co-founder and Atlanta philanthropist Arthur M. Blank, the Mellon Foundation and many other donors, for which Savitt expressed gratitude: \"The corporate community is in a defensive crouch right now - they could get targeted,\" she said.",
      "But she said donors shared concerns about people's understanding of citizenship, and they saw a long-term investment in the teaching of civil and human rights as a way to address this.",
      "\"It is the story of democracy \u2014 Who gets to participate? Who has a say? Who gets to have a voice?\" she said. \"So our donors are very interested in a healthy, safe, vibrant, prosperous America, which you need a healthy democracy to have.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 More than 300 lawsuits challenging many of President Trump's second-term plans and his administration's actions have been winding through the federal courts over the past few months. But a handful now may be poised for review by the Supreme Court, or are getting close to it.",
      "The cases involve major policies enacted by Mr. Trump in the months since he returned to the White House, and several of them have already been before the high court, though during earlier stages in the proceedings.",
      "In those instances, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to grant it emergency relief, allowing it to enforce its immigration policies, in some instances, or terminate officials at independent agencies, in others.",
      "In the wake of those interim decisions, lower courts have continued to hold proceedings and issue rulings addressing the merits of the Trump administration's actions. If the Supreme Court agrees to step into these disputes, they will present the initial opportunities for the justices to address the legality of Mr. Trump's plans.",
      "\"I'm expecting this to be the term of Trump,\" Dan Epps, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said of the new Supreme Court term set to begin Oct. 6.",
      "The justices are already set to hear blockbuster cases on redistricting, campaign finance and state laws barring transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "Many of the disputes involving Mr. Trump's actions test the limits of the president's power, and rulings could have massive implications for his policies on the economy and immigration, as well as his reshaping of the executive branch.",
      "The Trump administration has sought emergency intervention from the Supreme Court roughly two dozen times so far, and it has fared well in its bids to continue enforcing its plans while legal challenges continue.",
      "But whether the president will prevail when the Supreme Court examines the lawfulness of his actions remains to be seen. Still, in some instances \u2014 like his efforts to fire certain executive officers \u2014 the Supreme Court has signaled that Mr. Trump may have the power to terminate members of certain independent agencies.",
      "\"What's at stake is the country's commitment to the rule of law,\" Epps said. He added that the new term could also bring a \"huge sweeping victory\" for executive power, particularly if the Supreme Court finds that courts should give broad deference to the president on matters like immigration.",
      "Tariffs",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed on nearly every U.S. trading partner will be the first in which the Supreme Court will decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's key policies.",
      "The high court said Tuesday that it is taking up two cases involving the global tariffs, which question whether Mr. Trump has the power to impose the sweeping duties under a federal emergency powers law. The justices will hear arguments in early November, a rapid timeline for the court.",
      "The Justice Department had asked the Supreme Court to step into the legal battle after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled late last month that many of Mr. Trump's tariffs issued under the emergency powers law are illegal.",
      "The Federal Circuit divided 7-4 in finding that the law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not authorize the president's global tariffs. But the duties remain in place for now, as the Federal Circuit wiped away a permanent injunction granted by a lower court that blocked the Trump administration from imposing the levies.",
      "The dispute tests a major centerpiece of the president's economic agenda, and the Justice Department has warned that a ruling against the government would put the frameworks of trade deals negotiated with half a dozen countries at risk.",
      "Termination of temporary legal protections for Venezuelan migrants",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump took office, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took steps to end legal protections that had been granted to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants by the Biden administration through a program known as Temporary Protected Status.",
      "In response to a lawsuit filed by the National TPS Alliance and seven individuals who were shielded from threat of deportation, a federal judge granted preliminary relief and postponed the date Noem's plan was set to take effect.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to put that decision on hold while proceedings moved forward, but the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration emergency relief, allowing Noem to end the legal protections for now.",
      "Meanwhile, the 9th Circuit heard arguments in July on the Trump administration's effort to terminate the TPS designation for Venezuela, and late last month, a three-judge panel sided with the plaintiffs.",
      "The judges found that the TPS holders were likely to succeed in their argument that Noem lacked the authority to set aside an earlier extension of the program for Venezuelan migrants.",
      "The impact of that decision, however, is limited because the interim relief granted by the Supreme Court at an earlier stage in the case is still in place.",
      "Alien Enemies Act removals",
      "Mr. Trump issued a proclamation in March that invoked the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport Venezuelan migrants who are suspected of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants it claims are gang members under the wartime law, which gives the president the authority to remove citizens of a \"hostile nation\" if it is engaged in an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "A \"60 Minutes\" investigation found that many migrants deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act didn't have criminal records.",
      "The proclamation immediately sparked litigation, including two court fights that have already been up to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket. In the first case, brought in federal district court in Washington, D.C., the high court said any challenges to removals under the Alien Enemies Act must be brought in the judicial district where a migrant is being held.",
      "But the Supreme Court also said that migrants at risk of deportation under the 1798 law must receive notice that they are subject to removal and the opportunity to challenge it.",
      "In the wake of that decision, judges in Texas, Colorado, New York and California have blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants being held in their regions.",
      "The second case to reach the Supreme Court arose when Venezuelan migrants detained by immigration officials at a facility in the Northern District of Texas sued to challenge their removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The high court temporarily blocked the migrants' deportations in April and later\u00a0sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit for further review after finding the Trump administration had not provided the migrants with enough notice \u2014 24 hours \u2014 of their impending deportations.",
      "The Supreme Court did not address the lawfulness of the removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "After holding additional proceedings, a divided three-judge panel on the 5th Circuit rejected Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove Venezuelan migrants in the Northern District of Texas. The court said in its 2-1 decision that there was no predatory incursion or invasion by Tren de Aragua \u2014 preconditions to invoking the law.",
      "The 5th Circuit is the first appeals court to address whether Mr. Trump properly invoked the 18th century-law.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the Trump administration will appeal, saying the 5th Circuit's decision \"will not be the final say on the matter.\"",
      "Firings of members of independent agencies",
      "Mr. Trump has spent his months back in the White House pushing the bounds of executive power, including by firing officials at independent agencies appointed by former President Joe Biden.",
      "Mr. Trump's attempts to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Trade Commission, to name a few, have all led to legal challenges by the ousted officials.",
      "In cases brought by Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, members of the NLRB and MSPB, respectively, a lower court ordered them to be reinstated to their roles. Federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled their firings violated federal laws that shielded them from being terminated without cause and cited a 1935 Supreme Court decision that said Congress could enact removal protections for members of multi-member boards that met certain criteria.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court for emergency relief allowing it to fire Wilcox and Harris while their cases proceed, and the court gave the president the green-light to remove the officials for now.",
      "Meanwhile, the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., heard oral arguments on Mr. Trump's bid to fire Wilcox and Harris in May but has not yet issued a decision.",
      "But in a different case, involving Mr. Trump's attempt to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the removal protections for members of the trade commission violate the separation of powers. The administration wants the high court to take up the dispute over Slaughter's removal before the appeals court has ruled.",
      "At least one justice, Brett Kavanaugh, believes it's time for the Supreme Court to address the legality of removal restrictions for members of independent agencies. In a concurring opinion in a case involving Mr. Trump's firing of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Kavanaugh said there is a \"at least a fair prospect\" that the Supreme Court will either narrow or overrule Humphrey's Executor v. United States, that 1935 decision that upheld removal protections for certain executive officers.",
      "\"[W]hen the question is whether to narrow or overrule one of this Court's precedents rather than how to resolve an open or disputed question of federal law, further percolation in the lower courts is not particularly useful because lower courts cannot alter or overrule this Court's precedent,\" he wrote.",
      "Birthright citizenship",
      "The president's plan to end birthright citizenship has already been before the Supreme Court, but the justices did not address the constitutionality of his executive order. Instead, the dispute involved whether federal judges have the ability to issue nationwide injunctions, or orders that universally block enforcement of a policy beyond the plaintiffs in a case.",
      "The high court said judges are limited in their ability to grant that sweeping relief, but left open other avenues like class-action lawsuits or challenges to an agency rule brought under the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law governing the agency rule-making process.",
      "Following that June decision, several groups of plaintiffs amended their initial lawsuits and asked district courts to certify as classes children covered by Mr. Trump's executive order and would be denied birthright citizenship.",
      "In one of those cases, brought by a group of four states \u2014 Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon \u2014 a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled 2-1 in July that Mr. Trump's executive order is unconstitutional.",
      "The White House said in response to the decision that it looks forward to \"being vindicated on appeal.\"",
      "The ruling from the 9th Circuit was the first from an appeals court to address the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's executive order.",

      "Scientists have discovered what's thought to be the oldest known mummies in the world in southeastern Asia dating back up to 12,000 years.",
      "Mummification prevents decay by preserving dead bodies. The process can happen naturally in places like the sands of Chile's Atacama Desert or the bogs of Ireland where conditions can fend off decomposition. Humans across various cultures also mummified their ancestors through embalming to honor them or send their souls to the afterlife.",
      "Egypt's mummies may be the most well-known, but until now some of the oldest mummies were prepared by a fishing people called the Chinchorro about 7,000 years ago in what's now Peru and Chile.",
      "A new study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences pushes that timeline back.",
      "Researchers found human remains that were buried in crouched or squatted positions with some cuts and burn marks in various archaeological sites across China and Vietnam and to a lesser extent, from the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.",
      "Studying the bones further, scientists discovered the bodies were likely exposed to heat. That suggested the bodies had been smoke-dried over a fire and mummified by hunter-gatherer communities in the area.",
      "The practice \"allowed people to sustain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors, bridging time and memory,\" study author Hirofumi Matsumura with Sapporo Medical University in Japan said in an email.",
      "The results were \"a great surprise,\" said Hsiao-chun Hung, senior research fellow at Australian National University.",
      "\"The bones are so ancient, and it is remarkable to discover that this tradition is so old, connecting the practices of ancient peoples with those still found in some communities today,\" Hung said.",
      "The process allowed relatives to maintain contact with the deceased, and in some cases was believed to allow the spirit to roam freely during the day and return to a body at night.",
      "\"I believe this reflects something deeply human \u2014 the timeless wish that our loved ones might never leave us, but remain by our side forever,\" Hung told Agence France-Presse.",
      "The researchers theorize that the practice may have been common in ancient Asian civilizations.",
      "\"This tradition may have been known among hunter-gatherer societies across a vast region, for many millennia,\" they wrote in the study,",
      "Dating methods used on the mummies could have been more robust and it's not yet clear that mummies were consistently smoke-dried across all these locations in southeastern Asia, said human evolution expert Rita Peyroteo Stjerna with Uppsala University in Sweden, who was not involved with the research.",
      "The findings offer \"an important contribution to the study of prehistoric funerary practices,\" she said in an email.",
      "Mummies are far from a thing of the past. Even today, Indigenous communities in Australia and Papua New Guinea smoke-dry and mummify their dead, scientists said.",

      "\"Early Tuesday morning, Cygnus XL's main engine stopped earlier than planned during two burns designed to raise the orbit of the spacecraft for rendezvous with the space station,\" NASA said in a blog post. \"All other Cygnus XL systems are performing normally.\"",
      "No other details were provided.",
      "The Cygnus was launched Sunday from Cape Canaveral atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The cargo ship was released from the booster's upper stage as planned, kicking off a precisely planned sequence of rendezvous rocket firings to catch up with the space station.",
      "Unlike SpaceX's cargo Dragon and Russian Progress freighters, which carry out autonomous dockings at their respective ports, the Cygnus was designed to be captured by the station's robot arm and pulled in for berthing.",
      "The Cygnus XL capture had been planned for Wednesday morning, but it's now on hold while engineers work to understand the problem and develop an alternate rendezvous plan.",
      "\"The Cygnus XL will not arrive to the space station on Wednesday, Sept. 17, as originally planned, with a new arrival date and time under review,\" NASA said in its blog post.",
      "A Progress launched last week successfully docked at the station Saturday. The Cygnus XL launch was a long-awaited milestone for Northrop Grumman after an earlier Cygnus was damaged during transit from a subcontractor in Europe to Cape Canaveral. That vehicle is still grounded pending analysis and repairs.",
      "Sunday's launch was the third of at least four SpaceX flights purchased by Northrop Grumman while the company recovers from the transit setback and presses ahead with work to develop a new booster of its own.",
      "And it was the maiden flight of the Cygnus XL, so named because the upgraded cargo ship has been lengthened to carry more cargo to the station per flight.",
      "\"We've been partnering with Northrop Grumman on this update, and we're excited that Northrop is ready to deliver this incredibly beneficial increase in capacity,\" Dina Contella, deputy manager of the space station program for NASA, said before launch. \"It's about 1.6 meters (5 feet) longer and it carries about 2,600 additional pounds more cargo.\"",
      "For its first flight, the XL ship is loaded with more than five-and-a-half tons of needed spare parts, research material and crew supplies, including holiday treats for the station crew.",
      "\"The (Cygnus) is packed with consumables, like nitrogen, oxygen, food and toilet parts, and it has a large number of spare parts that are required for systems like, for example, our urine processor,\" said Contella. \"We're stocking up on these items since we were short over the past year, and we'd like to have a good reserve for the future.\"",
      "NASA pays for cargo delivery flights using Cygnus and Dragon spacecraft. To date, SpaceX has successfully carried out 32 Dragon resupply missions while Northrop Grumman has completed 20 successful flights not counting the current mission.",
      "Both companies suffered one in-flight failure each due to launch mishaps early in the commercial resupply program.",

    "story": [
      "The sun has become more and more active over the last 16 years, in a turn that surprised scientists and could affect space weather and technology on Earth, NASA announced\u00a0this week.",
      "A new research, conducted by two NASA scientists and published earlier in September in the peer-reviewed\u00a0Astrophysical Journal Letters, shows that solar activity has ramped up after 2008 \u2014 an unexpected reversal following a decades-long decline that was initially thought to foreshadow a period of historic inaction on the surface of the sun.",
      "\"All signs were pointing to the Sun going into a prolonged phase of low activity,\" Jamie Jasinski, a space plasma physicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the study's lead author, said in a statement. \"So it was a surprise to see that trend reversed. The Sun is slowly waking up.\"",
      "An uptick in solar activity could influence space weather, potentially leading to more solar storms,\u00a0solar flares\u00a0and coronal mass ejections, the researchers found. Space weather patterns have the potential to directly impact spacecraft operations and the safety of astronauts, but\u00a0they may be felt on Earth, too, as space weather can affect power grids, GPS systems and radio communication, according to NASA.",
      "The downward trend was documented from the 1980s until 2008, when the space agency determined that the sun had reached its weakest point on record. The sun's action, or inaction, tends to fluctuate in 11-year cycles, according to NASA, although some patterns draw on longer.",
      "Earth is currently in\u00a0Solar Cycle 25, which began in 2020. The last cycle maintained an average length of 11 years and was the weakest solar cycle to occur in a century, according to the National Weather Service. Scientists thought the sun would stay in what they dubbed \"deep solar minimum,\" believing that the stretch of quietness from the sun would continue, eventually leading to a new phase of record low activity.",
      "\"But then the trend of declining solar wind ended,\" Jasinski said in NASA's announcement.",
      "His study, co-authored by Marco Velli, a fellow researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, instead tracked increasing bursts of solar plasma and stronger magnetic field measurements throughout the solar system, which are all affected by the sun.",
      "Solar Cycle 26 is expected to begin some time between January 2029 and December 2032, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said, but the agency has not yet produced a prediction for the next cycle.",
      "In order to better track space weather, NASA announced that it will launch the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) and\u00a0Carruthers Geocorona Observatory\u00a0missions, as well as the NOAA's\u00a0SWFO-L1\u00a0mission, from Falcon 9 as early as next week. It comes just a few months after\u00a0SpaceX helped NASA launch TRACERS twin satellites which are studying how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"Space weather predictions are critical for supporting the spacecraft and astronauts of NASA's Artemis campaign, as understanding the space environment is a vital part of mitigating astronaut exposure to space radiation,\" NASA said Monday.",
      "In May 2024, NASA officials recorded the\u00a0strongest geomagnetic storm in more than 20 years. Several X-class solar flares \u2014 the largest of B-class, followed by C and M \u2014 sent the\u00a0northern lights\u00a0to far lower latitudes than normal,\u00a0as far south as Mexico.",
      "Geomagnetic storms have the ability to impact how and whether technology functions on a massive scale, electrical engineer David Wallace explained in\u00a0The Conversation\u00a0last year.",
      "\"Internet service providers could go down, which in turn would take out the ability of different systems to communicate with each other. High-frequency communication systems such as ground-to-air, shortwave and ship-to-shore radio would be disrupted,\" Wallace wrote.",

      "Users of the chatbot identified as under the age of 18 will automatically be directed to a version of ChatGPT governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules, OpenAI said in a\u00a0statement. This under-age edition includes protection policies such as blocking sexual content and \u2014 \"in rare cases of acute distress\" \u2014 law enforcement to ensure a user's safety, according to the company.",
      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said in the announcement.",
      "OpenAI also said it is introducing parental controls, such as enabling parents to link their account to their teen's account, manage chat history, set blackout hours and more. The safeguards will be available by the end of September.",
      "The announcement comes just days after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a probe into the potential negative effects of AI chatbot companions on children and teens. OpenAI said that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved.",
      "A spokesperson for OpenAI recently told CBS News that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone.\"",

TikTok has long denied that the Chinese authorities exert any influence on the platform.",
      "The concerns stretch back to Mr. Trump's first term. The president signed an executive order to ban TikTok in the U.S. in 2020 on national security and data privacy grounds, but the move was blocked by a judge.

      "Tesla said in a regulatory filing that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world's first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.",

      "\"We're stocking up on these items since we were short over the past year, and we'd like to have a good reserve for the future.\"",
      "Among the more mouth-watering items being delivered \"are what I'd call specialties,\" Contella said. \"The crew can eat these during any of the upcoming holidays or at any time really, but these are foods like clams, oysters, crab, roast turkey and smoked salmon, plus treats like candies, cookies and ice cream.\"",
      "\"We also have a high school breakfast competition food called ... shakshuka scramble. It's based on a popular dish throughout North Africa and the Middle East made of eggs cooked in spicy sauce.\"",
      "Mounted atop pad 40 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, the Falcon 9's first stage engines thundered to life at 6:11 p.m. EDT, generating 1.7 million pounds of thrust to push the rocket up into the early evening sky on a northeasterly trajectory matching the space station's orbit.",
      "After powering out of the thick lower atmosphere, the first stage separated, reversed course and flew itself back to a spectacular landing at the Space Force station to chalk up SpaceX's 67th Florida touchdown and its 505th successful booster recovery overall.",
      "The Falcon 9's second stage, meanwhile, put the Cygnus into the planned preliminary orbit and released it to fly on its own 14-and-a-half minutes after liftoff. If all goes well, the spacecraft will catch up with the space station early Wednesday for capture by the lab's robot arm.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House GOP leaders on Tuesday announced a plan to avoid a shutdown and keep the government funded until Nov. 21, unveiling legislation that also includes funds for additional security to lawmakers and other officials in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said the bill is not \"partisan\" but a \"short-term, clean continuing resolution that will keep the government funded and operating at current levels while we continue all this work and doing our jobs and getting the remaining bills done.\"",
      "The speaker said a Friday vote is expected in the House, giving lawmakers the standard 72 hours to review the legislation. But he later said a vote could happen before then \"if there's an appetite to do it sooner.\"",
      "The House Rules Committee quickly advanced the legislation Tuesday to tee it up for a floor vote.",
      "Lawmakers have a Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government. But party leaders appeared far apart even as the legislation was unveiled Tuesday. Adding to the pressure, Congress is scheduled to be in recess next week for Rosh Hashanah.",
      "Democrats have pushed for bipartisan negotiations on the bill, demanding that enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace be extended. The subsidies were originally passed in 2021 during the pandemic and extended in 2022 for another three years.",
      "Johnson has dismissed the inclusion of an extension in the short-term funding bill, saying it's \"a December policy issue, not a September funding issue.\"",
      "With a narrow Republican majority in the House, Republicans could approve a funding measure without support from Democrats, though it would require near-unanimous approval from the GOP conference. And a handful of Republicans have already pledged to oppose the measure.",
      "Getting the bill through the Senate is another story. Though Republicans also have a majority in the upper chamber, with 53 seats, the legislation requires a 60-vote threshold to advance, making the support of at least seven Democrats necessary.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has argued that a \"clean\" extension of government funding would \"ensure there is no reason for Democrats to oppose this bill and delay passage.\" He cited Democrats' demands during previous funding fights that any extension be free of divisive policy measures and current funding levels maintained.",
      "\"Leader Thune wants to wonder what has changed? A lot.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on the Senate floor Monday.",
      "Schumer cited the passage of a massive tax and spending bill earlier this year that included cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, the president's tariffs and the cancellation of previously appropriated funding by Congress.",
      "In a joint statement Tuesday, Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said the bill House Republicans unveiled \"fails to meet the needs of the American people and does nothing to stop the looming healthcare crisis.\"",
      "\"By refusing to work with Democrats, Republicans are steering our country straight toward a shutdown,\" Schumer and Jeffries said. \"Instead of governing, Republicans are once again taking orders from Donald Trump, hurting the American people and recklessly marching our nation to the brink of a shutdown.\"",
      "On Monday, President Trump put pressure on Republicans to fall in line on a clean continuing resolution, claiming in a post on Truth Social that Democrats \"want the Government to shut down.\"",
      "\"In times like these, Republicans have to stick TOGETHER to fight back against the Radical Left Democrat demands, and vote 'YES!' on both Votes needed to pass a Clean CR this week out of the House of Representatives,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In wake of Kirk's assassination last week, lawmakers attached an additional $30 million in funding for their security to the bill, along with $58 million that the White House requested for executive and judicial branches. Johnson outlined Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he has been speaking with members and \"trying to calm the nerves to assure them that we will make certain that everyone has a level of security that's necessary.\"",
      "The speaker said House GOP leaders were \"evaluating all the options\" to ensure resources will be available for lawmakers' residential security and personal security. But he noted that \"it does take a certain measure of courage to step out and to lead.\"'",
      "The legislation also includes a budget fix for the District of Columbia, after lawmakers effectively blocked around $1 billion in funds earlier this year.",
      "A bipartisan Russia sanctions measure was not attached to the funding bill. Spearheaded by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the sanctions bill received fresh momentum after Russian drones entered Poland's airspace during an attack on Ukraine earlier this month. But it has not yet received the green light from Mr. Trump, which lawmakers have been waiting for to move ahead on a vote.",
      "The measure has the expressed support of 85 senators and nearly a quarter of House lawmakers, who have been pushing for months for a vote on the legislation that would impose new economic sanctions on countries that import Russian energy to dial up pressure on the Kremlin to end its war in Ukraine.",
      "\"Time is of the essence. We urge our colleagues to consider attaching this legislation to the CR,\" Graham and Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who sponsored similar legislation in the House, said in a statement Saturday.",
      "Graham said Tuesday there could be a resolution to the Russia sanctions legislation soon.",

      "According to the ADL report, several school shooters in the past year, including Holly, had been active on the same website, which the organization says is known for hosting content backing white supremacist ideas as well as material portraying graphic violence against both people and animals. People can navigate to the website, WatchPeopleDie, and access a forum where they can watch real images of beheadings, shootings and other violence. The site started on Reddit before being banned in March 2019.",
      "\"We're talking about thousands of people who are on these spaces,\" ADL Senior Vice President of Counter-Extremism and Intelligence, Oren Segal, told CBS News. \"There's no friction to access \u2014 anybody can do it.\"",

They include 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow, who shot and killed a student and a teacher at Abundant Life Christian school in Wisconsin last year, and Solomon Henderson, a 17-year-old who committed a shooting that killed one and wounded another at Antioch High School in Nashville in January.",
      "Holly, who posted a photo of Rupnow on TikTok, appeared to have joined the site in December 2024, in the month between the Madison and Nashville shootings, according to the ADL.",
      "\"Many of these online spaces are glorifying these young, violent shooter types, where they're even referencing one another,\" Segal said.",
      "Kingston said, \"When people are radicalized to violence, it's much harder to intervene at those stages than it is at the earlier stages.",
      "\"The best thing we could be doing is preventing someone from even having an interest in going into any of those sites in the first place,\" Kingston told CBS Colorado. \"We want to find a way for them to feel connected, to belong, to be on the pro-social side.\"",
      "Holly's most recent profile photo on TikTok was of Elliot Rodger, who killed six people in California in 2014 and had a history of engaging in and spewing misogynistic content online, according to the\u00a0Southern Poverty Law Center.",
      "The 16-year-old posted a photo of himself holding a gun next to a box of ammunition on his X account two hours before the shooting. On social media, Holly showcased his collection of tactical gear, which featured extremist symbols. In a now-deleted TikTok post that contained references to a 2019\u00a0mass shooting at a mosque\u00a0in Christchurch, New Zealand, he engaged with a comment encouraging him to \"make a move,\" according to ADL.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office to see whether the department's findings were consistent with those in the ADL report. A spokesperson said they cannot comment as the investigation remains open.",
      "The domain of Watchpeopledie is registered by proxy, according to a search of the \"whois\" registration database \u2013 and hides the names of the owners. Cloudflare is used as the registrar for their main domain, Segal at the ADL said, and uses Cloudflare-owned IP addresses, which means that WPD is either hosted on Cloudflare or they are using their passthrough services.",
      "Segal said Cloudflare allows it to remain \u2026 that it's basically a service provider not taking action and \"allowing the hosting of the site.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Cloudflare told CBS News that it is not the hosting provider for the website, adding that the company \"typically does not host websites and doesn't have the capacity to remove content that is hosted by others.\"",
      "Segal said that ADL shares their findings with law enforcement agencies across the country. He did not specify an agency or the specific report. Segal said understanding incidents perpetrated by people influenced by nihilistic online spaces as a broader trend rather than one-offs could be a step toward preventing violence.",
      "\"We need to see that there's a connection there, there's a through line,\" Segal said. \"There's a common theme and a common thread, which are these online platforms.\"",

    "summary": "Court documents show the suspect's roommate found a note in their apartment that read, \"I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it.\"",
    "story": [
      "The man charged with murder in the slaying of conservative activist Charlie Kirk during a public event at Utah Valley University in Orem last week admitted in a text message to his roommate on the day of the shooting that he had committed the crime, courts documents allege.",
      "According to a criminal information document filed Tuesday by Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Gray, the roommate of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson questioned him about the incident in a text message exchange on Wednesday, Sept. 10, after the shooting had occurred earlier that day.",
      "Prosecutors said Robinson first texted his roommate, whose name has not been released, to \"drop what you are doing, look under my keyboard\" at the apartment they shared in St. George, a city in southwestern Utah where Robinson is from.",
      "The roommate found a note under the keyboard that read, \"I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it,\" the court documents state. Police found a photo of that note, the attorney's office said. Authorities did not say in the documents if the note itself was destroyed.",
      "Robinson then texted his roommate that he was \"stuck in\" Orem \"for a little while longer,\" the documents state.",
      "\"Shouldn't be long until I can come home, but I gotta grab my rifle still,\" Robinson wrote in the text exchange that the roommate provided to investigators.",
      "The \"bolt-action rifle\" that is believed to have been used in the shooting was found wrapped in a towel hidden in a wooded area nearby the campus, Gray stated in the court documents.",
      "\"To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age,\" Robinson allegedly wrote in a text.",
      "When the roommate asked Robinson if he was Kirk's shooter, Robinson replied, \"I am, I'm sorry,\" the court documents state.",
      "\"I thought they caught the person?\" the roommate wrote.",
      "Robinson allegedly replied that \"no, they grabbed some crazy old dude, then interrogated someone in similar clothing,\" seemingly in reference to two persons of interest who had been detained by law enforcement in connection with the shooting prior to Robinson's arrest.",
      "One of those people was released, and the second, identified as George Zinn, was charged with obstruction of justice because he falsely claimed to be the shooter, the Utah Department of Public Safety said Tuesday. There was no evidence, however, that Zinn colluded with Robinson, Utah DPS said.",
      "When his roommate asked why he had carried out the shooting, Robinson responded, \"I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out,\" the court documents state.",
      "In the text exchange, Robinson allegedly repeatedly expressed concern about whether he will be able to retrieve the hidden rifle, which he indicated originally belonged to his grandfather.",
      "\"I had planned to grab my rifle from my drop point shortly after, but most of that side of town got locked down,\" Robinson wrote, according to the court documents.",
      "He texts that he's \"worried what\" his father \"would do if I didn't bring back grandpas rifle.\" He also says he's unsure if the rifle has a serial number, but that he doesn't believe it would be traced to him regardless, according to the court documents.",
      "\"I worry about prints I had to leave it in a bush where I changed outfits,\" Robinson allegedy wrote. \"I didn't have the ability or time to bring it with. ... I might have to abandon it and hope they don't find prints.\"",
      "When asked by his roommate how long he had planned the attack, Robinson replied, \"a bit over a week I believe,\" documents state.",
      "He allegedly later asks his roommate to \"delete this exchange\" and avoid speaking to the media. He also writes that \"Im gonna turn myself in willingly.\"",
      "According to the court documents, Robinson's parents recognized their son from the surveillance photos released of the shooting, and eventually his father was able to convince Robinson to come to their St. George home, and with the help of a family friend, surrender to authorities on Friday, Sept. 12.",
      "According to the documents, Robinson's mother told investigators that her son had started dating his roommate, whom she said was transitioning from male to female. Two law enforcement sources told CBS News over the weekend that Robinson's roommate was cooperating with investigators and is not expected to be charged at this point.",
      "Robinson, who authorities allege shot Kirk from the roof of a campus building before fleeing \u2014 sparking a two-day manhunt, appeared virtually Tuesday in his first court appearance. He is charged with one count each of aggravated murder and felony discharge of a firearm, and two counts each of obstruction of justice and witness tampering. He also faces one misdemeanor count of committing a violent offense in the presence of a child.",
      "Following Robinson's initial court appearance, the state of Utah filed its intent to seek the death penalty.",
      "A spokesperson for Discord\u00a0also confirmed\u00a0to CBS News on Monday that Robinson appeared to admit to committing the shooting in messages posted to the social media platform last week.",

    "title": "Will the Fed cut rates this week? These charts may determine its decision.",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-decision-september-17-fomc-meeting-interest-rates-cut/",
    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 19:44:42 -0400",
    "summary": "With the U.S. economy facing headwinds, the Federal Reserve faces pressure to trim interest rates this week for the first time since December 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's rate decision on Wednesday is shaping up to be its most consequential of the year, with most economists predicting the first cut of 2025. The real suspense is over how deep the reduction could be \u2014 and whether the Fed might signal a broader pivot that could set the course for the rest of the year.",
      "So far, the Fed has resisted calls from President Trump to cut its benchmark interest rate, which helps determine borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Mr. Trump has pointed to the fact that inflation has remained\u00a0relatively muted, so far this year, as evidence the central bank has been too late in lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Apart from Mr. Trump's push for a cut, the Federal Reserve is facing growing economic uncertainty ahead of its Sept. 17 meeting, raising the stakes for a rate decision.",
      "On the one hand, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with hiring slowing to a standstill, which would argue for a cut. But inflation is also creeping higher under the weight of the Trump administration's tariffs, an issue that the Fed has pointed to as its reason for keeping the benchmark rate unchanged so far this year.",
      "Adding to the complications is Mr. Trump's pressure on the Fed to reduce rates. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has responded by stressing the independence of the Federal Reserve, pointing out that the Federal Open Market Committee, its 12-member rate-setting group, relies on economic data to make its policy decisions, rather than political pressure.",
      "\"The committee tries to get a complete picture of the biggest downside risks for the economy, and then at the end of the meeting, there needs to be some sort of weighting \u2014 it's an art as much as science,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, an economics professor at Villanova University.",
      "When will the Fed announce its rate decision?",
      "The Fed will announce its next rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Sept. 17.",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point cut stands at 96%, according to CME FedWatch, which relies on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices to determine the likelihood. There's only a 4% probability of a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, the tracker says.",
      "Economists will also be listening for whether the Fed provides guidance on whether it expects additional rate cuts at its next two meetings in 2025, set for Oct. 29 and Dec. 10.",
      "What data will determine the Fed's decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep inflation low while also ensuring full employment.",
      "But those two goals can be in conflict with each other because rising inflation requires the Fed to boost interest rates, which tamps down spending by making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow. The Fed's best weapon for fighting high unemployment, however, is to cut rates, as that makes it cheaper for businesses to expand and hire more workers.",
      "Fed officials will be closely scrutinizing inflation and jobs data as they determine which side of the dual mandate needs more attention.",
      "While the inflation rate has receded from its 2022 peak, it's still far above the Fed's goal for a 2% annual rate, and has inched up in recent months as the Trump administration's tariffs ripple through the economy, pushing some prices higher.",
      "Meanwhile, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with many sectors \u2014 including manufacturing, which Mr. Trump has vowed to revive \u2014 shedding jobs in August. The result is a marked slowdown in hiring, with employers adding an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus about 106,000 workers each month in 2024.",
      "\"It's going to be very difficult, but it will be weighing these two conflicting objectives,\" Kersting noted.",
      "How does the Fed compare with other central banks?",
      "Mr. Trump's has criticized the Fed's decision to hold off on cutting this year by pointing to decisions by other central banks, such as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, to reduce their borrowing costs.",
      "\"Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had ZERO. No inflation, great economy \u2014 We should be at least two to three points lower,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media in June.",
      "Yet the U.S. is facing an issue that isn't as pressing for other nations: Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "Because the tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. businesses directly to the federal government, the cost is largely borne by American companies and consumers \u2014 not other nations. The White House has said exporters abroad bear the brunt of tariffs, while Trump administration officials make the case that more balanced trade with U.S. economic partners over the longer term will create jobs, energize the manufacturing sector and generate federal revenue.",
      "Fed Chair Powell has pointed to the tariffs as a reason the Fed has wanted to keep its powder dry, given that many economists believe the import duties will reignite inflation in the U.S.",
      "The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a closed watched inflation gauge, rose at annual rate of 2.9% in August, the sharpest pickup since January. Heavily imported goods, such as coffee, audio equipment and household furniture, saw some of the steepest price hikes last month, CPI data shows.",
      "How are American consumers holding up?",
      "Many Americans are souring on the economy, feeling pressured by higher costs for everything from housing to groceries.",
      "A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that two-thirds of Americans said prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise, and about the same share said they expect that to continue. More than half of consumers said the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only about one-quarter said they believe it's improving.",
      "The CPI has steadily risen since April, when it fell to an annual rate of 2.3%, or just above the Fed's 2% target.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has pointed to mortgage rates that were close to 7% for much of 2025 as a reason for a faltering housing market.",
      "\"Could somebody please inform Jerome 'Too Late' Powell that he is hurting the Housing Industry, very badly? People can't get a Mortgage because of him. There is no Inflation, and every sign is pointing to a major Rate Cut,\" the president wrote\u00a0in an Aug.19 post on social media.",
      "But mortgage rates are determined by several factors beyond the Fed's benchmark rate, including the strength of the U.S. economy and the 10-year Treasury note. Already, rates have declined in recent weeks, dipping to 6.35% for the week of Sept. 11, in anticipation of the Fed's cut and weaker economic data.",
      "Even so, a rate cut could help some consumers by lowering their borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"A declining interest rate environment will provide some relief for borrowers,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"Whether it's a homeowner with a 7% mortgage or a recent graduate hoping to refinance student loans and credit card debt, lower rates can ease the burden on many indebted households by opening opportunities to refinance or consolidate.\"",

    "story": [
      "Academy Award-winning actor and director Robert Redford, one of the biggest movie stars to ever grace the screen and whose startlingly magnetic charisma in such films as \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" \"The Way We Were\" and \"The Sting\" made him an icon, has died. He was 89.",
      "Cindi Berger, CEO of the publicity firm Rogers & Cowan PMK, confirmed Redford's death to CBS News in a statement. Berger said he died Tuesday at his home in the mountains of Utah surrounded by those he loved. She didn't provide details about the circumstances surrounding his death.",
      "Barbra Streisand, who starred alongside Redford in the 1973 romantic drama \"The Way We Were,\" said the Hollywood legend was \"one of the finest actors ever\" in a tribute on social media.",
      "\"Every day on the set of The Way We Were was exciting, intense and pure joy,\" Streisand said. \"We were such opposites: he was from the world of horses; I was allergic to them! Yet, we kept trying to find out more about each other, just like the characters in the movie.\"",
      "Actor Robin Wright, who worked with Redford on his 2010 film \"The Conspirator,\" praised the actor and director during an interview on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" after news of his death was announced.",
      "\"He was amazing,\" Wright said. \"I mean, what an icon, and his body of work will live on forever. And to be able to be directed by an actor, that was fantastic, and that's such a rarity. And he's an icon that's going to be greatly missed.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters outside the White House before traveling to the U.K., President Trump said, \"I'll tell you, Robert Redford was great. He had a series of years that he was \u2014 there was nobody better.\"",
      "Redford burst into the Hollywood stratosphere in the late 1960s, when he was paired with Paul Newman in the Western \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" Their charm playing lovable outlaws was undeniable, but it would be Redford's nonchalance about his striking good looks that helped sell his characters \u2014 in comedies, dramas and adventures \u2014 making him one of the leading box office draws of the 1970s and '80s.",
      "Then, as founder of the Sundance Institute, he used his celebrity to help nurture independent films while promoting generations of young filmmakers, as well as environmental and social justice issues. Since 1985, the institute has hosted the internationally famous Sundance Film Festival, which has been the launching pad for innumerable talents, from Quentin Tarantino, John Sayles and Christopher Nolan to the Coen brothers. In 1989, the New York Times called Redford \"a godfather to the American independent film movement.\"",
      "In a joint statement with other Sundance Institute leadership, acting CEO Amanda Kelso said, \"Today is a sad day for the Sundance Institute community. Bob's vision launched a movement that, over four decades later, has inspired generations of artists and redefined cinema in the U.S. and around the world.\"",
      "\"The vibrant storytelling landscape we cherish today, both as artists and audiences, is unimaginable without his passionate drive and principled leadership. Beyond Bob's enormous contributions to culture at large, we will miss his generosity, clarity of purpose, curiosity, rebellious spirit, and his love for the creative process,\" the statement said, in part.",
      "According to Redford, his fame was hardly predictable.",
      "\"I was so much the last choice\" for the role of the Sundance Kid, he told CBS' \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006. \"They tried everything to keep me out of the picture because I wasn't known, compared to Paul [Newman].\"",
      "His performance changed all that. The comedy-drama, directed by George Roy Hill, topped the box office chart for 1969.",
      "Four years later, Redford and Newman teamed up again in Hill's caper \"The Sting,\" which won seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Redford was also nominated for best actor for his performance as a small-time con artist out for revenge against a big-city gambler (played by Robert Shaw).",
      "Redford would star in 16 features between 1969 and 1980, many of them hits that traded on his remarkable screen presence: \"Downhill Racer,\" \"The Hot Rock,\" \"Jeremiah Johnson,\" \"The Candidate,\" \"The Great Gatsby\" with Mia Farrow, \"The Great Waldo Pepper,\" \"Three Days of the Condor\" with Faye Dunaway, \"The Electric Horseman\" with Jane Fonda and \"Brubaker.\" So bright was his star power that he reportedly earned a $2 million paycheck for what was barely a walk-on in the World War II epic \"A Bridge Too Far.\"",
      "But his most surprising film was one which he produced and fought for: the acclaimed 1976 drama \"All the President's Men,\" the story of Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who uncovered the Watergate scandal.",
      "\"It took four years, and the studio, they said, 'Politics? I don't think so,'\" Redford said in 2006. \"You know, 'Watergate is a dead issue.' And I said, 'It's not. It's a detective story about investigative journalism and about the American trait of hard work, and hard work led to something that spared us the loss of our First Amendment. That, to me, is worth making.'\"",
      "The film was nominated for eight Oscars and won four, including for its screenplay by William Goldman, and for Jason Robards' performance as Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.",
      "Redford starred in hit after hit, but he told \"Sunday Morning \" in 2018 many of those films he's never watched. Really? \"I don't know. I haven't ever counted 'em, but a lot,\" Redford said. \"'Cause I thought if I look at myself too much, I'm gonna be too aware of myself and that means when I go to do something new, I won't be able to do it without being slightly aware of what I'm doing rather than just being free.\"",
      "He moved on to a job where he wouldn't have to look at himself \u2014 behind the camera, as director of \"Ordinary People.\" Based on the novel by Judith Guest, it tells of an affluent family whose veneer of stability is shattered after one son dies in a boating accident and another attempts suicide. It starred Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore in a rare dramatic role, Judd Hirsch and Timothy Hutton, who won a best supporting actor Academy Award for his feature film debut. The film also won best picture, and for Redford a best director Oscar.",
      "In the decade following \"Ordinary People,\" he appeared on screen only a few times \u2014 in the baseball tale \"The Natural,\" the Oscar-winning \"Out of Africa\" opposite Meryl Streep, and the romantic comedy \"Legal Eagles.\"",
      "He would also return to the director's chair eight times, with an eclectic mix of stories and genres: \"The Milagro Beanfield War,\" about a land war pitting a Hispanic farmer against real estate interests; \"A River Runs Though It,\" a period drama of family and fly-fishing, with Brad Pitt; \"Quiz Show,\" about TV's quiz show scandal in the 1950s; \"The Horse Whisperer,\" about a horse trainer with a remarkable gift; \"The Legend of Bagger Vance,\" a golf fable with Will Smith and Matt Damon; \"Lions for Lambs,\" a political drama of wartime co-starring Tom Cruise and Streep; \"The Conspirator,\" about the Confederate plot surrounding Lincoln's assassination; and the political thriller \"The Company You Keep.\"",
      "\"One of the lions has passed,\" Streep said in a statement Tuesday. \"Rest in peace my lovely friend.\"",
      "Scarlett Johansson, who said Redford cast her in \"The Horse Whisperer\" when she was just 11 years old, remembered him as someone who was \"patient and warm and kind.\"",
      "\"Every day before each scene, he would take the time to sit with me and walk me through all of the beats that led my character up until that particular point in the story. No matter the reality of the days rush, I always felt he had all the time in the world for our work,\" Johansson said. \"Bob taught me what acting could be, and it was from his generosity and patience that I was inspired to pursue the possibilities of the craft.\"",
      "Redford made perhaps his biggest contribution to movies by founding the Sundance Institute, which developed and fostered the work of young and diverse independent filmmakers outside of mainstream Hollywood. Begun in 1981, Sundance encompassed workshops with writers, directors and actors, and later hosted the internationally recognized film festival.",
      "Asked by Collider in 2019 his reasons for founding the institute, Redford said, \"The goal for me was very simple: to celebrate people who don't get celebrated, who are ignored or undiscovered and who deserve to be discovered.\"",
      "The road to stardom",
      "Charles Robert Redford Jr. was born on Aug. 18, 1936, in Santa Monica, California. Raised in Van Nuys, Redford described his neighborhood as \"lower working class.\" Though he lived in the shadow of Hollywood, he had no interest in a career in the movies.",
      "\"I grew up in kind of a rough neighborhood,\" he said. \"We'd go to matinees, any time there was a love scene on the screen, we'd go, 'Oh boo, you tell 'em lover,' you know, and make fun of the scene. The idea that I would be that guy is just too much for me to take!\"",
      "He attended the University of Colorado in Boulder, where he had an athletic scholarship, but was kicked out after his freshman year for drinking, shortly after the death of his mother, Martha, in 1955.",
      "He ventured to Europe, studying art in France, Italy and Spain, before settling in New York City, where he took art classes at the Pratt Institute while also studying acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He described being self-conscious in his early experiences onstage, but soon recognized \"something unfamiliar was clicking inside.\" He performed in school productions of \"The Seagull\" and \"Antigone,\" attracting an agent, and was soon on Broadway in \"Tall Story\" and \"The Highest Tree,\" before starring with Julie Harris in \"Little Moon of Alban,\" in 1960.",
      "He also made guest appearances on TV shows such as \"Maverick,\" \"Playhouse 90,\" \"Perry Mason,\" \"Naked City,\" \"Route 66\" and \"The Twilight Zone.\" He co-starred with Jason Robards in a 1960 TV version of Eugene O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh,\" directed by Sidney Lumet.",
      "In 1961 he starred on Broadway in \"Sunday in New York,\" and two years later in the Neil Simon comedy \"Barefoot in the Park,\" directed by Mike Nichols. It was a role he repeated in the 1967 film, opposite Jane Fonda.",
      "\"I held some fantasy out in my head that I would return to art, and I carried that maybe five years into my acting career,\" Redford said, \"and then finally one day just looked at myself in the mirror, and I said, 'Who are we kidding? This is what you do. This is what you do well and like it. Give up the idea that you're going to maintain this career in art.'\"",
      "His film appearances grew following a big screen debut in the 1962 World War II drama \"War Hunt\" (co-starring future director Sydney Pollack).",
      "But Redford wasn't considered a big enough name to co-star with Paul Newman in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" \u2014 the studio wanted anyone but him, even after the film's director and screenwriter went to bat for him. It wasn't until Newman, 11 years his senior and already a big name, met with Redford and told the studio he wanted Redford to co-star, that he got the part.",
      "It was a generosity that Redford returned some years later, when he went to bat for Newman to co-star in \"The Sting.\"",
      "\"Follow the money\"",
      "While on a press tour for \"The Candidate,\" his 1972 satire about a California lawyer's run for Senate against a popular incumbent, Redford sought out Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward after reading some of the reports he and Carl Bernstein had written on the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. The movie star was rebuffed. [Bernstein feared Republican backlash to their reporting if it was found out they were talking with Hollywood.] They finally met up in 1973, along with screenwriter William Goldman, and in 1974 Redford bought the film rights to the pair's yet-to-be-published book, \"All the President's Men,\" for $450,000.",
      "Starring Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, and directed by Alan J. Pakula, the film captured the intensity of the reporters' hunt for answers as they sought to \"follow the money\" and unravel the Watergate scandal.",
      "Never mind that audiences knew how the story ended (Nixon resigned); the film was a critical and commercial hit, and became an inspiration for generations of young journalists.",
      "Once Redford had gotten the taste of directing with \"Ordinary People,\" his appearances in front of the camera grew fewer: \"Havana,\" \"Sneakers,\" \"Indecent Proposal,\" \"Up Close & Personal,\" \"The Last Castle,\" \"Spy Game,\" and \"An Unfinished Life\" filled out his acting resume for the years between 1990 and 2005. He also narrated the 1992 documentary \"Incident at Oglala,\" about Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier. Redford's companies, Wildwood Enterprises and Sundance Productions, produced at least two dozen feature films.",
      "Meanwhile, much of his energy was devoted to the success of the Sundance Institute and its film festival, held in the mountains of Utah each January.",
      "Welcome to Sundance",
      "In 1978 the Utah Film Commission established the United States Film Festival as a means to draw visitors to the Wasatch Mountains for something other than skiing. The festival was co-created by Sterling Van Wagenen, who was a cousin of Redford's then-wife, Lola Van Wagenen. Advocating to include independent features in the program, Redford agreed to show up at the festival and participate in a panel. Afterwards, he formed the Sundance Institute, to aid filmmakers wishing to make stories that could not find a home among Hollywood studios that were chasing hugely commercial pictures.",
      "In 1985 the U.S. Film & Video Festival was struggling financially, and so Sundance took it over, eventually replacing the name with its own. Moved to Park City, the festival drew ever-increasing numbers of filmmakers, buyers, agents, publicists, journalists and fans to the tiny town. Beyond the festival, industry professionals would mentor young filmmakers in workshops and screenwriting labs. Wes Anderson's \"Bottle Rocket,\" Kimberly Peirce's \"Boys Don't Cry,\" Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Hard Eight,\" and Miranda July's \"Me and You and Everyone We Know\" were all developed in the Sundance Labs.",
      "In 1989 the festival blew up with the success of Stephen Soderbergh's \"sex, lies, and videotape,\" which won the Audience Award and was picked up by Miramax. Its subsequent theatrical release earned the low-budget dramedy a cool $25 million and an Oscar nomination.",
      "Since then, films and filmmakers who have broken out at the festival have included Quentin Tarantino (\"Reservoir Dogs\"), Robert Rodriguez (\"El Mariachi\"), Kevin Smith (\"Clerks\"), Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\"), Todd Solandz (\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\"), Ryan Coogler (\"Fruitvale Station\"), Damien Chazelle (\"Whiplash\"), Jordan Peele (\"Get Out\"), and the audience favorites \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" and \"The Blair Witch Project.\"",
      "Sundance also started a program to develop theatrical works, which has resulted in such productions as \"The Laramie Project,\" \"Light in the Piazza,\" and \"Angels in America.\"",
      "Not quite retiring",
      "In 2012 Redford was executive producer and narrator of the documentary \"Watershed,\" about the politics surrounding the Colorado River \u2014 the environmental and cultural damage from misuse of a vital natural resource. Asked by ThinkProgress whether his films can make a difference, Redford said, \"I've given up the idea that I can really change anything, and I just do the best I can. It's either that or do nothing, and we know that nothing doesn't work.\"",
      "The following year Redford starred in \"All Is Lost,\" playing a solo sailor facing disaster at sea when his small craft is crippled in an accident. He did much of the stunt work himself, in a \"storm-tossed\" water tank (the spray from fire hoses cost him partial hearing in one ear). He was hailed for his remarkable performance in which he uttered virtually no dialogue.",
      "\"All in all, it was worth it,\" he told the Salt Lake Tribune. \"I'm proud of the work. I felt it was a chance to do something at this point that was different and bold.\"",
      "Redford also added his name to the roster of Hollywood stars recruited for the Marvel Universe, appearing in \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" and \"Avengers: Endgame\" as (spoiler alert) the leader of a plot against S.H.I.E.L.D. He also starred opposite Nick Nolte in \"A Walk in the Woods,\" played Dan Rather in \"Truth,\" and appeared opposite an animated creature in the Disney film \"Pete's Dragon.\" He also reteamed with Jane Fonda in the romance \"Our Souls at Night,\" their fourth film together.",
      "In 2018 he starred in \"The Old Man & the Gun,\" as an aging bank robber on the run. Redford told \"Sunday Morning\" that he connected very easily with the protagonist as an outlaw: \"I think probably I must've been born with an outlaw sensibility, in terms of my nature, yeah. Because from the time I was just a little kid, I was always wanting to go away from the rules. I wanted to \u2014 I didn't want to break any, I just didn't want to be held by them. In kindergarten, I ran away three times!\"",
      "With the film's release he announced he would be retiring from acting \u2014 but he remained active with voice work and producing documentaries.",
      "In addition to his Oscar win for \"Ordinary People,\" Redford was nominated for directing and producing \"Quiz Show,\" and in 2002 he received an honorary Academy Award for his impact on the industry. Three years later he was named a Kennedy Center honoree. At the Washington ceremony, Paul Newman ribbed Redford, referring to his reputation for lateness: \"Backstage they think the only reason he's even in the vicinity was because they told him this whole thing was yesterday.\"",
      "In 2016 Redford received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The citation read: \"His art and activism continue to shape our nation's cultural heritage, inspiring millions to laugh, cry, think, and change.\" At the presentation ceremony, President Barack Obama remarked, \"As an actor, director, producer, and as an advocate, he has not stopped \u2014 and apparently drives so fast that he had breakfast in Napa and dinner in Salt Lake.\"",
      "Redford was married to Lola Van Wagenen in 1958; they divorced in 1995. They had four children: Scott, who died at age 2 months from sudden infant death syndrome; Shauna, an artist; James (Jamie), a filmmaker and environmental activist, who died of cancer in 2020; and Amy, a director.",
      "In 2009, Redford married artist and environmental activist Sibylle Szaggars.",
      "In 2018, the private Redford reflected to \"Sunday Morning\" on a favorite saying by T.S. Eliot: \"'There's only the trying. The rest is not our business.' It's one of my favorite phrases. Because you can't guarantee where the trying is going to get you. So, you can't guarantee the result. The only thing there is in its place is the trying. That's where the action is.\"",

      "Users of the chatbot identified as under the age of 18 will automatically be directed to a version of ChatGPT governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules, OpenAI said in a\u00a0statement. This under-age edition includes protection policies such as blocking sexual content and \u2014 \"in rare cases of acute distress\" \u2014 law enforcement to ensure a user's safety, according to the company.",
      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said in the announcement.",
      "OpenAI also said it is introducing parental controls, such as enabling parents to link their account to their teen's account, manage chat history, set blackout hours and more. The safeguards will be available by the end of September.",
      "The announcement comes just days after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a probe into the potential negative effects of AI chatbot companions on children and teens. OpenAI said that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved.",

Raine's family allege that ChatGPT led their teen to commit suicide.",

    "story": [
      "Not only low-income shoppers are hunting for deals these days. Better off consumers are also flocking to discount stores to save a few bucks.",
      "Since 2021, budget retailers have seen a large influx of more affluent shoppers, according to data from GlobalData Retail. This year, nearly 28% of high-income people have shopped at discount chains Aldi, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Five Below, Family Dollar, Lidl, Ollie's, PopShelf or Walmart, up from around 20% four years ago, the research and consulting firm found.",
      "A key catalyst for the shift is one that has plagued Americans up and down the income ladder in recent years, experts told CBS MoneyWatch: inflation.",
      "Emerging from the pandemic, many middle- and even upper-income consumers had extra savings after receiving federal stimulus checks and because they chopped their spending on categories like travel and dining out, said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData.",
      "But since then, the financial cushion wealthier consumers once enjoyed has shrunk while the cost of living has risen, leading many to seek out more affordable stores.",
      "\"They don't like the fact that more and more of their money is absorbed by essentials and the basics of life,\" Saunders told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So what has happened is they have sought out better value for money, and they've especially done that in grocery and household essentials.\"",
      "GlobalData defines middle-income as households with annual income of $56,501 to $169,750, while high-income households are those earning more $169,751. The market research firm taps a range of data sources \u2014 including consumer surveys, credit card spending and retailer data \u2014 to build a national picture of the retail landscape.",
      "The migration of higher income consumers to discount retailers has \"accelerated since the pandemic, and especially since the bout of inflation that started in 2021,\" added Saunders, noting that a similar trend followed the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "One of the biggest winners of this trend has been Walmart, according to Saunders. More than 17% of Americans earning six figures today shop at the Arkansas-based company, the world's biggest retailer, up from less than 15% in 2021, GlobalData found.",
      "To be sure, wealthier consumers don't face the same financial constraints as low-income people. But high- and middle-income Americans are also looking for ways to beat inflation and stretch their dollar, experts said.",
      "Inflation is well below its 2022 peak, but remains sticky for food and other essentials. Will Auchincloss, an Americas retail sector partner at EY Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch that elevated prices for many goods and services are forcing consumers across the income spectrum to \"muscle through.\"",
      "Inflation isn't the only thing driving more people to discount retailers. Better brand selection and a more diverse assortment of products has made budget chains more appealing to a wider audience, Saunders said, noting that retailers like Walmart and Aldi are actively courting more upscale shoppers.",
      "\"One of the things Walmart has been doing is refurbishing a lot of its stores, putting a bit more effort into presentation, because it knows that higher-income consumers expect a nicer experience,\" he said. \"If you provide that, the lower-income consumers like it, too.\"",
      "Walmart remodels around 650 stores nationwide on an annual basis, according to a company spokesperson. The\u00a0upgrades\u00a0typically include updated layouts, newly painted exteriors and interiors, interactive displays, new signage and checkouts, and interactive displays \u2014 reminiscent what you might see in an IKEA store \u2014 that allow customers to touch and feel merchandise.",

      "CASE UPDATE:  In May 2025, Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to 50 years to life with the possibility of parole. Due to that resentencing, they are now eligible for parole hearings under youth offender parole laws. \u00a0In August 2025, the brothers' first\u00a0bids for parole were denied. In September 2025, a judge rejected the brothers' habeas petition for a new trial.",
      "This article was originally posted on March 1, 2024.",
      "Lyle and Erik Menendez have been behind bars in California for more than three decades for the 1989 killing of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez. They were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in the notorious case that captured the nation's attention. Now, the brothers are hoping that new evidence will reopen their case and set them free.",
      "\"48 Hours\" contributor Natalie Morales speaks to Lyle Menendez from prison as he awaits a judge's decision in an encore of\u00a0\"The Menendez Brothers' Fight for Freedom,\"\u00a0now streaming on Paramount +.",
      "The Menendez brothers admit that they killed their parents. Instead, the focus of the case has long been on why they did it. They insist that they killed out of fear and in self-defense after a lifetime of physical, emotional and sexual abuse suffered at the hands of their parents.",
      "One of their lawyers, Cliff Gardner, tells \"48 Hours\" that new evidence corroborates those longstanding claims and lessens their culpability. Gardner argues that Lyle and Erik Menendez should have been convicted of manslaughter instead of first-degree murder, and that if they had been, they would have received a much shorter sentence and been out of prison a long time ago.",
      "The new evidence includes a letter that Gardner says was written by Erik Menendez to Erik's cousin, Andy Cano, in December 1988, about eight months before the crime. The letter reads, in part, \"I've been trying to avoid dad. It's still happening, Andy, but it's worse for me now. \u2026 Every night I stay up thinking he might come in. \u2026 I'm afraid. \u2026 He's crazy. He's warned me a hundred times about telling anyone, especially Lyle.\"",
      "Andy Cano did testify at the brothers' trials. He said that Erik Menendez at age 13, years before the killings, told him that his father was touching him inappropriately. Prosecutors at trial suggested that Cano was lying.",
      "The brothers were tried twice. Their first trial ended in a mistrial when two juries, one for each brother, couldn't reach a unanimous decision as to whether Lyle and Erik Menendez were guilty of manslaughter or murder. When they were tried a second time, prosecutors attacked the abuse allegations more aggressively. They referred to the allegations as \"the abuse excuse.\" That trial resulted in the brothers' convictions for first-degree murder.",
      "Gardner says this letter is proof that the abuse allegations were not made up. He says the letter was never presented at either trial, and that it was discovered in storage within the last few years by Andy Cano's mother. Andy Cano died in 2003.",
      "The letter isn't the only piece of evidence that has surfaced. Roy Rossello, a former member of the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, has come forward claiming that he was also sexually abused by Jose Menendez, back in the early 80s, when Rossello was a minor and a member of the band. At the time, Jose Menendez was working as an executive at RCA Records, and RCA signed Menudo to a recording contract.",
      "Rossello is now 54 years old. He says in a sworn affidavit filed in 2023 that he went to Jose Menendez's home in the fall of 1983 or 1984. Rossello would have been between 14 and 15 years old at the time. He says he drank \"a glass of wine,\" then felt like he had \"no control\" over his body. He says Jose Menendez took him to a room and raped him. Rossello also states in the affidavit that he was sexually abused by Jose Menendez on two other occasions, right before and right after a performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York.",
      "\"When I first heard about it \u2026 I cried,\" Lyle Menendez told Morales. \"For me, it was very meaningful to just have things come out that caused people to really realize, OK \u2026 at least this part of what it's about is true.\"",
      "The Menendez brothers' attorney, Cliff Gardner, filed a habeas petition in May 2023 citing the letter and Rossello's affidavit as new evidence that proves his clients' convictions should be vacated.",
      "\"The boys were abused as children. They were abused their whole life. \u2026 And this is a manslaughter case, not a murder case. It's just that simple,\" Gardner said to \"48 Hours\" about the Menendez brothers. \"My hope in the case is that the judge will realize that this new evidence is indeed credible and persuasive, and he'll vacate the convictions.\"",
      "If that happens, it would be up to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office whether to retry the case. In a statement, the district attorney's office told \"48 Hours\" it is investigating the claims made in the habeas petition. It is unclear when a judge will rule in the case.",
      "On Oct. 3, Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said the Men\u00e9ndez murder case is being reviewed by his office, naming two new factors that prosecutors are looking at ahead of a court hearing next month.",

    "story": [
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is looking into reports that faulty electronic door handles on 2021 Tesla Model Y SUVs prevented owners from entering and exiting the vehicles, according to filing on the regulator's website. In several cases, parents describe situations in which they were unable to access children inside the car.",
      "The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received nine reports on \"inoperable door handles,\" with the most commonly reported issues involving parents' inability to reenter the car after placing their child in the back seat before going on a drive, or to remove their child from the back seat at the end of a drive.",

    "title": "Which form of energy is the cheapest? CBS News asked experts to find out.",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/form-of-energy-cheapest-lazard-lcoe/",
    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:28:07 -0400",
    "summary": "CBS News looked at the cost of producing coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar energy to determine which is the cheapest.",
    "story": [
      "The emergence of renewable energy like wind and solar as a viable alternative to oil, gas and other fossil fuels has raised critical questions about which form of power offers the best value today \u2014 a debate made all the more urgent by the ravages of climate change.",
      "In the U.S., where energy policy has been shaped by politics for more than a century, the battle continues to play out at the highest levels of government. Former President Biden delivered one of the biggest endorsements of renewable energy in the form of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offered tax credits and rebates to businesses, organizations and households that invest in solar, wind and geothermal technologies.",
      "By contrast, President Trump has been a staunch supporter of the oil and gas industry. During his inauguration speech in January, he reaffirmed his commitment to fossil fuel production, saying, \"We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet. That will help to do it.\"",
      "Within six months of taking office, Mr. Trump signed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" into law, which phases out clean energy tax incentives while simultaneously expanding tax breaks for the oil and gas industries. Separately, his administration has pared back offshore wind leasing and made it more difficult for clean energy projects to qualify for federal dollars.",
      "On the global trade front, Mr. Trump has issued a flurry of tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, which experts say will translate into higher costs for energy projects that rely on imports. The White House is pushing these policies amid concerns over rising U.S. energy prices, with average electricity costs up 5.5% from a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "To get to the bottom of which form of energy is the cheapest, CBS News analyzed the cost to produce coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar energy, including the impact of tax incentives, tariffs and other factors.",
      "Determining the cheapest form of energy",
      "Multiple criteria come into play in trying to assess the cheapest form of energy. These include consumers' monthly costs; the cost to produce energy; and the potential social cost energy production can have on a community's health and the environment. External factors like tax incentives and fluctuations in the economy also can affect the price it costs to heat and cool our homes.",
      "CBS News set out to answer the question using what's called the Levelized Cost of Energy, or LCOE, a commonly cited benchmark for wholesale energy costs. LCOE is the price that a power-generating facility must receive for its electricity to cover all its expenses \u2014 including capital, equipment, maintenance and other financing costs \u2014 over the lifespan of a project.",
      "A 2025 LCOE report from investment bank Lazard shows the cost to produce energy without any government subsidies and how that changes when you layer in other factors, such as tax subsidies provided under the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Yet while LCOE calculations are widely used, they don't offer a full picture when it comes to evaluating the cost and value of energy, experts told CBS News. Other factors, such as interest rates and federal regulations, can also have a major impact on the cost of building and operating energy infrastructure.",
      "LCOE also doesn't account for the value a given form of energy delivers. For example, because solar and wind are affected by the weather, they tend to be less consistent than oil and gas, meaning a backup source of energy may be necessary.",
      "\"You have to talk about, what is the additional cost of balancing that production from a resource that doesn't produce all the time?\" Severin Borenstein, faculty director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, told CBS News.",
      "How tax subsidies factor in",
      "The U.S. government has a long history of using tax subsidies to encourage energy production. Oil and gas companies have benefited from such support for more than a century. One example is a tax deduction known as Intangible Drilling Costs, or IDCs, which allows companies to deduct certain expenses associated with finding and preparing an oil or gas well.",
      "By comparison, only in recent decades have renewable energy projects drawn a larger share of federal dollars. The push for renewables accelerated in the 1970s, when the U.S. was facing an energy crisis defined by fuel shortages and high prices,\u00a0according\u00a0to Congress.gov.",
      "Lazard's report shows how the LCOE for renewable energy fluctuates when you account for certain provisions of the IRA aimed at lowering the cost of developing clean energy projects. Those include the investment tax credit (ITC), production tax credit (PTC) and energy community bonus, which increases the value of the ITC and PTC by 10% for projects in certain areas.",
      "Lazard's calculations assume these credits will be in place for 10 years. Notably, however, the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law by Mr. Trump this summer is slated to phase out those credits over the next two years.",
      "Although Lazard examines how the IRA affects renewable energy prices, it doesn't factor in any government subsidies flowing to the oil and gas industry, which vary widely and can be difficult to assess.",
      "The Environmental and Energy Study Institute, a bipartisan nonprofit research group,\u00a0estimates that direct U.S. subsidies to the fossil fuel industry amount to at least $20 billion per year. However, the FracTracker Alliance, a nonprofit focused on the impact of fossil fuels,\u00a0says the industry receives an estimated $760 billion annually in government subsidies and tax breaks.",
      "More benefits will go to the oil and gas industries under the \"big, beautiful bill.\" A June report from the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the legislation will funnel nearly $18 billion in tax incentives to the oil and gas industry over the next 10 years.",
      "Oil and gas companies have lauded the new law as a win for the industry. Sunil Mathew, chief financial officer of Occidental Petroleum, said during a recent company earnings call that the measure \"will provide significant cash tax benefits to Oxy.\" He expects the law will save Occidental $700 million to $800 million in \"cash taxes\" by the end of next year.",
      "How do tariffs factor into energy production costs?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are also projected to alter the cost it takes to fund energy projects in the U.S. To gauge the impact of tariffs on energy costs, CBS News turned to a model created by global data and analytics company Wood Mackenzie.",
      "In the following chart, dark green indicates a scenario in which the U.S. hasn't applied any country-level tariffs, but still maintains levies on copper, steel and aluminum imports; the medium shade of green represents current baseline tariffs imposed by the U.S. since Mr. Trump resumed office in January through August 7; and the light green indicates if trade relations with a U.S. economic partner is likely to worsen or deteriorate.",
      "As depicted, U.S. tariffs are projected to hit battery storage production the hardest. Chris Seiple, vice chairman of the power and renewables group at Wood Mackenzie, noted that while some energy equipment is produced domestically, other tech, such as battery cells, mostly comes from abroad, making them more susceptible to tariffs.",
      "\"The vast majority of our battery cells come from China,\" he said. \"And so the cost of a battery project is going to go up by a certain percentage.\"",
      "This could lead to what Seiple described as a \"whack-a-mole\" effect, in which over time companies move their manufacturing to non-tariffed countries to avoid an additional financial burden.",
      "What is the cheapest form of energy?",
      "Given these multiple and interconnected factors, what ends up being the cheapest form of energy to produce?",
      "According to Lazard, renewables remain the most cost-competitive form of generating and distributing energy. Onshore wind, which runs from $37 to $86 per megawatt-hour ($/MWh), is the most affordable on a baseline level and when tax subsidies are included.",
      "Utility scale solar \u2014 what most people think of when they hear about solar energy \u2014 is the next most cost-effective approach, with costs ranging from $38 to $78 per megawatt-hour.",
      "Fossil fuel and nuclear energy sources are more expensive to generate. Coal costs $71 to $173 per megawatt-hour; gas costs $48 to $109; and U.S. nuclear costs $141 to $220, Lazard found.",
      "The main reasons for these differences in cost? Experts told CBS News that while the capital cost for renewable projects is steep, the expense of operating and maintaining such facilities tends to be lower than that associated with fossil fuel production.",
      "\"Wind and solar you basically do all the investment up front, and then it operates \u2014 not quite for free \u2014 but at extremely low operating costs per kilowatt hour,\" Borenstein said.",
      "With fossil fuels, the cost of oil, gas and coal \u2014 which can be volatile \u2014 is another key factor.",
      "\"For a natural gas-fired power plant, you have to buy the natural gas,\" he explained. \"And likewise, a coal-fired power plant, you have to buy the coal. And so the price\u2026 is going to fluctuate.\"",
      "Experts who spoke with CBS News agreed that renewable energy ends up being the most competitive when it comes to costs. Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a Washington, D.C. consulting firm, concurred that solar and wind are the cheapest to run. Natural gas is the most affordable source of backup energy, which is necessary to make sure power is available around the clock, he said.",
      "Seiple said if you need a small amount of inexpensive electricity, solar is the way to go. It's \"low cost to build, it can be deployed quickly and modularly, the fuel is free and not volatile in price, and the ongoing maintenance costs are minimal,\" he said. \"And if the U.S. didn't penalize it with tariffs, it would be even lower cost.\"",
      "Despite such advantages for renewable energy, experts say the U.S. shouldn't put all of its eggs in one basket. Multiple sources told CBS News that what's needed is a diversity of energy options that can meet the country's\u00a0rising demand for electricity. Taking certain forms of energy out of the mix would compromise the system as a whole, they note.",
      "\"There is no one cheapest form that you can run the whole system on, and in fact, it depends on combining them in ways to [get] the cheapest possible cost,\" Borenstein said.",

      "This story originally aired on April 14, 2018.",
      "Etan Patz walked out of his New York City home headed for a school bus stop just two blocks away. The 6-year-old never made it to school that day in 1979 \u2013 and he's never been found.",
      "His disappearance is a story that shocked New York City and to this day haunts law enforcement investigators who have spent decades trying to find him. The disappearance of the young boy is more than a missing person's case. Indeed, it changed the way parents watched over their kids.",
      "\"I think this was one of the most significant unsolved cases in the history of New York City,\" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. tell \"48 Hours\" correspondent Richard Schlesinger.",
      "\"Every missing child case is very important, but this was one of the oldest ones we had,\" says NYPD Lieutenant Chris Zimmerman.",
      "Etan Patz disappeared at a time long before social media and every storefront had a video camera. He had asked his parents to let him do the short walk to the bus stop alone for the first time. He had a dollar to buy a soda at a corner deli. His parents were unaware he was missing until he didn't return home after school. Since then, Patz's smiling image used on missing person's fliers is seared into the minds of people around the country.",
      "\"That photo will always haunt me. And every single day that I sent my son out to school, I thought of Etan Patz,\" says attorney Brian O'Dwyer. \"And I was one of eight million New Yorkers like that.\"",
      "Police began searching for Patz by going door to door. Over the years, the case would grow cold. But there was one neighborhood man police suspected of being a pedophile, whom they had their eye on almost from the beginning: Jose Ramos. Ramos, according to law enforcement, had said he took a child back to his apartment and molested him. Ramos told them he was 90 percent sure it was Patz. The case against Ramos, however, lacked corroboration, and never moved forward, says Vance.",
      "Vance vowed to take a fresh look at Etan's disappearance when he took office in 2010. \"I was on the hunt for the Patz family to find the killer,\" he says.",
      "Then in 2012, the NYPD got a tip from a relative of Pedro Hernandez, saying Hernandez had talked about hurting a boy around the time Patz disappeared. During questioning by police, Hernandez told them he choked a boy. He later took them to locations near the Patz home. Was Hernandez telling the truth?",
      "\"The facts of that confession make no sense,\" says Hernandez's attorney Harvey Fishbein. \"He's unreliable because of his psychiatric condition.\"",
      "What happened to Etan Patz?",
      "THE SEARCH FOR ETAN",
      "After more than 30 years, it took a new team of investigators and a new prosecutor to breathe new life into an old case \u2013 trying to find out what happened to Etan Patz.",
      "District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.:\u00a0 You really should never close the book on a case if you think there's the possibility that it can be solved.",
      "In 2012, investigators were literally digging for clues just blocks away from where Etan was last seen. \u00a0After thousands of dead-end leads, the public held its collective breath hoping, this time, the case might finally be solved.",
      "Etan Patz was just 6 years old, and like many kids that age, he wanted some independence. It was 1979, the last day of school before the Memorial Day weekend, and Etan's mother, Julie, finally agreed to let Etan walk alone to the school bus stop. It was just two blocks away from their Manhattan apartment.",
      "Julie Patz | Etan's mother [1980]: Yes, I wish I hadn't let him go to the bus stop that morning alone. \u2026My feelings that morning were very positive about his going.",
      "Etan was carrying a book bag and a dollar to buy a soda at a corner store near the bus stop \u2013 and then, he seemed to vanish.",
      "Julie and her husband Stan didn't realize their son was missing until that afternoon when he didn't come home from school. Julie called the school and learned Etan never arrived and his friends never saw him at the bus stop. So she called the police.",

      "Patrick Eanniello: More than I could imagine. He was very, very tied into the case.",
      "In 1986, Bill Butler took his own life. There was speculation Butler's frustration with this case may have been part of the reason why.",

      "Stuart GraBois: In June 1988, Ramos was brought to my office \u2026 and proceeded to state \u2026 that he was 90 percent sure that the young boy he took that day, May 25,1979, was the same boy whose picture he saw both in the newspaper and on television\u00a0 -- \u00a0that being Etan Patz.",
      "Investigators learned Ramos had sexually molested children around the country.",
      "Stuart GraBois: One of the things he did is travel around the United States in a converted school bus, giving out Matchbox cars and toys and baseball cards to children -- to young boys to entice them onto the bus.",
      "GraBois wanted to prosecute Ramos even if it wasn't for the Etan Patz case. He succeeded in Pennsylvania. In 1990, Ramos pleaded guilty to molesting an 8-year old boy and was sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: You've got a known pedophile who says he was 90 percent sure he picked up Etan Patz, you know-- around the time he disappeared. Why didn't you just go,\" OK, case closed\"?",
      "Phil Mahony: Because we didn't have that corroborated evidence -- didn't have that one person who said, \"Yeah, I saw him and Etan in Washington Square Park.\"",
      "Investigators hunted for more evidence. In 2000, Mahony ordered a search of an apartment building Ramos lived in when Etan disappeared. Ramos had allegedly told a fellow inmate this is where he disposed of Etan's body.",
      "Phil Mahony: When he was in jail, Jose Ramos said \u2026 that he put Etan into the furnace in the basement.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Of this building?",
      "Phil Mahony: Of this building, and you know, burned up the body.",
      "But like so many tips in the Etan Patz case, nothing came of it.",
      "Phil Mahony: \u2026there was just never that next thing to make you say, \"Yup, that's it. Close the books, we got the guy.\"",
      "Mahony felt they didn't have enough on Ramos to charge him with Etan's disappearance. Neither did the Manhattan D.A. at the time. But Stan Patz and Stuart GraBois were becoming more convinced Ramos was their man.",
      "Stan Patz [2000]: I believe this man stalked my son. I believe he lured him back to his apartment. I think he used him like toilet paper and I think he threw him away [emotional].",
      "Brian O'Dwyer is a prominent N.Y. attorney and started representing the Patz's. He was friends with Stuart GraBois, and in 2000 he approached GraBois with an idea.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: And I said, you know, you have an opportunity -- you may not have \u2026 thought about it, but of taking a civil case against Ramos.",
      "It would be a wrongful death suit. O'Dwyer hoped Ramos would be subpoenaed and might say something incriminating to help bring a criminal case. But before the wrongful death case could proceed, O'Dwyer had to ask the Patz's to officially give up hope. They would have to ask a court to declare their son dead.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: It's one of the toughest things I've ever done in my practice.",
      "And, on June 19, 2001, a judge declared that Etan Patz was officially dead.",
      "Stan Patz [2000]: I used to have fantasies of a taxi cab -- pulling up in front, and Etan coming out of it. But -- that was a long time ago. I don't entertain those fantasies any more.",
      "The Patz's attorney went to the Pennsylvania prison where Ramos was being held to interview the man he believed had killed Etan Patz.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: This was evil incarnate. \u2026If I had met him on the street I would have been very scared.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: And what did he say?",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: He said that yes, indeed, he was on the street that day. And he picked up a little boy by the name of Jimmy.",
      "This time, Ramos did not say Etan's name.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Were you convinced that Ramos was the guy?",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: Absolutely.",
      "Ramos would never answer more questions or testify in court, and the Patz's won the civil case against him.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer [to reporters in 2001]: Once and for all we have a final declaration by a court of law that Jose\u00a0 Antonio Ramos caused the death of Etan Patz.",
      "It was a victory, but it was not the end of the fight.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: The ultimate objective was to get a criminal prosecution",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Did you think it was enough to prosecute him criminally?",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: I did.",
      "The Manhattan D.A. disagreed. He still would not charge Jose Ramos.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: He thought he couldn't prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Do you keep thinking about this case, or did you move on?",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: No, I never moved on. Never moved on --",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Really?",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: No. Jose Antonio Ramos was in prison, unpunished, for what I believed was the death of Etan Patz.",
      "But 33 years after Etan disappeared there was a tip -- and it could change everything in this case.",
      "A TURNING POINT",
      "Stan Patz [2000]: I \u2013 [sighs, emotional] I think about my son every day. He's -- gone, but I will never forget him.",
      "As time passed for Stan and Julie Patz, Etan was, and is, frozen in time as a 6-year-old gone missing. They remained convinced that Jose Ramos, the pedophile who was behind bars in Pennsylvania, was responsible for Etan's death.",
      "Stan Patz [2000]: I send him a -- poster twice a year. \u2026and I write on the back, \"What did you do to my little boy?\"",
      "From the time Etan disappeared in 1979 until 2009, one man held the position of Manhattan District Attorney: Robert Morgenthau. He never felt there was enough evidence to indict Ramos. But Morgenthau was retiring, and Cyrus Vance Jr. was running for the office.",
      "Cyrus Vance Jr.: The Patz family reached out to me. \u2026And Stan \u2026 asked me if I would -- look into the case.",
      "And when Vance became Manhattan D.A. in 2010, he did look into it.",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman: Cy Vance was like, \"Listen, we'd like to re -- you know, fresh set of eyes, relook at it, go backwards, see what was missed.\"",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman headed the Missing Persons Squad at the time, and part of the fresh look included another look at Jose Ramos.",
      "D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr.: We looked at the case for quite a while and I never was convinced \u2026 that there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Jose Ramos was Etan's killer.",
      "And so the search for another suspect continued.",
      "The FBI had been involved on and off since Etan's disappearance.\u00a0 In April 2012, investigators took another look at a handyman who used to work for the Patz's. Along with the NYPD, they started that dig. It was at the former site of the handyman's workshop.",
      "FBI Agent\u00a0[to reporters]: We're executing a search warrant regarding the disappearance of Etan Patz.",
      "It was not far from where the Patz's still lived.",
      "The dig went on for five days, as investigators sifted through subterranean spaces and decades-old dirt. It was starting to look like there might finally be some answers. In the end, nothing was found. The handyman was cleared. But this was not just another dead end \u2013 it was far from it. In fact, it led to the first major turning point in this case.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: The call comes into our office, onto the phone right next to my desk.",
      "It came from Jose Lopez, who called police after he watched news coverage of the dig. He said his brother-in-law might be involved in the case.",
      "Detective Dave Ramirez helped lead the investigation.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Who was his brother-in-law?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Pedro Hernandez.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Had you ever heard the name Pedro Hernandez before?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: No, sir, no.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: What did he tell you about his brother-in-law?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: That he had made -- statements to various people about him having done something really bad to a child in New York.",
      "Pedro Hernandez worked as a stock boy at that corner store by the bus stop. He was 18 when Etan disappeared. And soon after, Hernandez left that job and moved home to New Jersey. \u00a0Over the years, he had been divorced, remarried and had children. He worked on and off at menial jobs and had no criminal record. But he had told people about hurting an unnamed child.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: So who had Hernandez spoken to?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: There was a religious group, apparently there was a retreat that they had gone on \u2026 they all had \u2013 information \u2026 to the fact that Mr. Hernandez did something to this child.",
      "Ramirez learned Hernandez also told his ex-wife and a friend, similar stories. \u00a0Detective's notes from 1979 show police at the time knew Hernandez worked at the store, but it is unclear if he was ever questioned.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Why do you suppose he was not a suspect before?",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman: I don't have the answer for it. I wasn't there. You know, I -- I never got clarity on that and I don't think he did either.",
      "About two weeks after they learned about Hernandez, on May 23, 2012, police went to his New Jersey home to talk to him.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: I had -- told him that we were investigating an old \u2026 missing persons case \u2026 in New York City. \u2026At that point, he like, he lost all the color in his face.",
      "Still, Hernandez readily agreed to go to the prosecutor's office in Camden, N.J. to be questioned.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Was it hard to get him talking?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: No, no.",
      "He talked for six hours without a lawyer or a recording of the conversation. During that time, he was shown a missing poster of Etan Patz. Later, the video camera was turned on and Hernandez told them about seeing a boy outside the store where he worked:",
      "INVESTIGATOR: Can you start telling us again exactly what you just told us before, about what happened.",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: He was waiting for the school bus.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: Who was waiting for the school bus?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: The kid.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: What's his name?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: Etan Patz.",
      "These are the words that changed the course of one of America's most heartbreaking cold cases. Hernandez went on, telling police he offered Etan a soda:",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: And then I ask him -- I ask him to go to the, in the basement with me to get the soda.",
      "It is hard to listen to his story:",
      "SECOND INVESTIGATOR: And then what happened after that?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: And then I choke him \u2026 Yeah, when I choked him he went like this [puts his hands to his throat, then goes limp and drops his arms to his side].",
      "INVESTIGATOR: What made you do this?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: I don't know.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: You don't know?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: \u2026It was something that it just happened.",
      "He signs Etan's missing poster, writing: \"I am sorry \u2026 and \"choke him\"",
      "INVESTIGATOR: And you recognize this to be the boy that you choked that day?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: Yes.",
      "After the confession, Hernandez showed investigators where he said it happened 33 years earlier.\u00a0 Lt. Zimmerman recorded the walk with his cellphone:",
      "Richard Schlesinger: So Hernandez told you here that this was the basement entrance\u2026",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Yes.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: So according to Hernandez, Etan was \u2026 that way from where we are.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Yes.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: And he lured him in -- into the basement through this door.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Yes, sir.",

      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Put him in a box.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: And then put the box on his shoulder.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Carry the box up out here \u2026 At this point, I said \"could you show us exactly the way you walked that day?\" We crossed the street to the other side.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: And how far down did he go?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: And then he went down to the corner.",
      "Hernandez showed them where he says he disposed of a box with Etan's body.",
      "Police believe the box was picked up by garbage collectors. Hernandez was interviewed again hours after the SoHo walk, this time by a prosecutor in the Manhattan D.A.'s office:",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ [to Asst. DA]: Then I choked him. And I tried to let go, but I just couldn't let him go.",
      "He repeated the same story. And later that day, Pedro Hernandez was arrested.",

      "Cyrus Vance Jr:\u00a0 He had confessed to killing Etan Patz. It was a credible confession.",
      "So says the prosecutor. But soon, questions were being asked about the six hours when Hernandez was questioned before the videotaping began.",
      "Richard Schlesinger [to Vance]: Why weren't those first hours videotaped?",
      "UNDER ARREST",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman: It was a day or two shy of the 33rd anniversary. It was a day or two shy that we made the arrest.",

      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman [to reporters]: \u00a0Mr. Patz was taken aback, a little surprised and I would say\u00a0 overwhelmed.",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman: You know, it had to sink in. You know, 30-something years, it had to sink in. \u2026I can't imagine not having an answer for that many years.",
      "For decades, Stan and Julie Patz believed another man was responsible for their son's disappearance in 1979.",

      "Now, someone was admitting it. But it was Pedro Hernandez.",

      "Richard Schlesinger: You think? Are you sure?",
      "Harvey Fishbein: It's hard to look into someone's mind, which is one of the real problems we have here.",
      "The diagnosis of mental illness would be a major part of Hernandez's defense. \u00a0In January 2015, two- and-a-half years after his arrest, Hernandez went on trial for the murder of Etan Patz.",
      "NEWS REPORT: Etan Patz's father walked silently past reporters in the courthouse ... finally hoping to see justice served nearly 36 years after his young son's disappearance.",

      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ [to investigators]: He was waiting for the school bus.",
      "Harvey Fishbein: Pedro says, \"I saw him standing there.\"",
      "Harvey Fishbein: Yet, no parent that was at the bus stop that morning who knew Etan, saw Etan that morning. \u2026So the fact that Pedro said that he saw the child there when no one else did immediately raises questions as to did this actually happen or not?",
      "Hernandez told investigators he tried to hide Etan's book bag in the store's basement.",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ [to ADA] So I took the book bag and I threw it behind the freezer.",
      "But Fishbein says the police would have searched that store and, if they did, should have found the bag or some other evidence.",
      "Harvey Fishbein: That bag was never recovered.",
      "The defense also argued that Hernandez has a low IQ and is susceptible to suggestions.",
      "Harvey Fishbein: We -- argued to the jury that \u2026 He's unreliable because of his low intellect. \u2026because of his psychiatric condition. And \u2026 'cause the story in the end does not make sense.",
      "But the prosecution experts interviewed Hernandez and concluded he is not mentally ill, and that the jury could believe his words.",
      "Prosecutors had home videos showing Hernandez socializing like anyone else. And they pointed out that Hernandez never reported any mental illness on a driver's license renewal form he filled out.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Do you believe that he was competent to confess?",
      "D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr.: Absolutely. \u2026I think there was ample evidence that Pedro Hernandez was not \u2013 fabricating \u2013 this -- homicide as the product of mental illness, but that he in fact was -- admitting to something that had tortured him \u2026 and he confessed.",
      "But Fishbein wants the jury to wonder what happened during those six hours before the videotaping began.",

      "Richard Schlesinger: How do you know that they didn't feed him information? How do you know they didn't berate him?",
      "D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr.: The way you assure yourself is by talking to the witnesses who were there. \u2026 after speaking to those who were present and being informed of what happened, I did not doubt that there was anything but a fair handling of Mr. Hernandez and appropriate questioning of him.",

      "But Fishbein told the jury those accounts varied and Hernandez may have been making them up to look tough. And he offered the jurors another suspect; the man many, including the Patz's, first thought killed Etan: Jose Ramos, the known pedophile whose girlfriend knew Etan.",

      "Scientists have identified the origins of the blue color in one of Jackson Pollock's paintings with a little help from chemistry, confirming for the first time that the abstract expressionist used a vibrant, synthetic pigment known as manganese blue.",
      "\"Number 1A, 1948,\" showcases Pollock's classic style: paint has been dripped and splattered across the canvas, creating a vivid, multicolored work. Pollock even gave the piece a personal touch, adding his handprints near the top.",
      "The painting, currently on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, is almost 9 feet wide. Scientists had previously characterized the reds and yellows splattered across the canvas, but the source of the rich turquoise blue proved elusive.",
      "In a new study, researchers took scrapings of the blue paint and used lasers to scatter light and measure how the paint's molecules vibrated. That gave them a unique chemical fingerprint for the color, which they pinpointed as manganese blue.",
      "The analysis, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first confirmed evidence of Pollock using this specific blue.",
      "\"It's really interesting to understand where some striking color comes from on a molecular level,\" said study co-author Edward Solomon with Stanford University.",
      "The pigment manganese blue was once used by artists, as well as to color the cement for swimming pools. It was phased out by the 1990s because of environmental concerns.",
      "Previous research had suggested that the turquoise from the painting could indeed be this color, but the new study confirms it using samples from the canvas, said Rutgers University's Gene Hall, who has studied Pollock's paintings and was not involved with the discovery.",
      "\"I'm pretty convinced that it could be manganese blue,\" Hall said.",
      "The researchers also went one step further, inspecting the pigment's chemical structure to understand how it produces such a vibrant shade.",
      "Scientists study the chemical makeup of art supplies to conserve old paintings and catch counterfeits. They can take more specific samples from Pollock's paintings since he often poured directly onto the canvas instead of mixing paints on a palette beforehand.",
      "To solve this artistic mystery, researchers explored the paint using various scientific tools \u2014 similarly to how Pollock would alternate his own methods, dripping paint using a stick or using it straight from the can.",
      "In the study, researchers call the artwork \"a quintessential example of his action painting technique where ropes of color, drips of black, and pools of white coalesce into the layered dynamism that defines his style.\" While the artist's work may seem chaotic, Pollock rejected that interpretation. He saw his work as methodical, said study co-author Abed Haddad, an assistant conservation scientist at the Museum of Modern Art.",
      "\"I actually see a lot of similarities between the way that we worked and the way that Jackson Pollock worked on the painting,\" Haddad said.",
      "Artwork by Pollock, who became a sensation on the New York art scene in the 1940s, has popped up in unusual places over the years.",
      "In 2023, authorities in Bulgaria said a painting seized by police during a raid was likely a little-known work by the artist.",

      "The court also issued an arrest warrant for Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, the commissioner for children's rights in the Office of the President, accusing her of committing the same crimes.",
      "Zelenskyy said last week that he would raise the issue of abducted Ukrainian children during the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York next week. He said he would host the event along with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and that \"many leaders will join us.\"",
      "In August, after meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders in Washington, President Trump said in a social media post that he and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had discussed \"the massive Worldwide problem of missing children,\" with a goal of \"bringing them home to their families.\"",
      "Von der Leyen, in her own post, thanked Mr. Trump, and added that \"every single Ukrainian child abducted by Russia must be returned to their families.\"",
      "Mr. Trump didn't mention Russia specifically in his own remarks. First lady Melania Trump, several days before the White House meetings, had penned an open letter to Putin pleading with the Russian leader to protect \"the innocence of these children,\" though not specifying which children she was referring to.",
      "Mr. Trump handed that letter to Putin in person when the two men met in Alaska last month, according to The Wall Street Journal.",
      "Russia's state-run media did not indicate any response from the Kremlin to the allegations made in the Yale lab's report. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.",
      "Two years ago, in a report published during the Biden administration that was titled \"The Kremlin's War Against Ukraine's Children,\" the State Department noted the ICC arrest warrants, and said Russia's response included \"threats of nuclear strikes, false claims about Western 'experiments on children' and anti-Russian 'hysteria,'\" as well as \"calls for the arrest of ICC judges, and claims that Ukraine's children were taken away 'for their safety.'\"",
      "Putin's government \"appears determined to erase Ukraine's existence as a state by attempting to rob it of its future,\" the Biden-era State Department report said, adding that \"mounting evidence shows Russia uses forcible relocation, re-education, and, in some cases, adoption of Ukraine's children as key components of its systematic efforts to suppress Ukraine's identity, history, and culture.\"",
      "CBS News has asked the State Department if it accepts the findings presented by the Yale lab, whether the Trump administration has any new plans to address the matter of abducted Ukrainian children as it continues pushing for a diplomatic resolution to the war in Ukraine, and whether the U.S. will be represented at the meeting hosted by Zelenskyy and Carney during the U.N. General Assembly next week. The State Department did not immediately respond to CBS News' requests for comment.",

Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adree announced the expansion of Israel's operation in a post on X, renewing a warning for Gaza City's famine-stricken residents to evacuate.",
      "Many Palestinians \u2014 tens of thousands of whom had sought shelter in Gaza City after fleeing areas further north amid Israel's offensive against Hamas \u2014 have said they're unable to evacuate due to overcrowding in southern Gaza and the high price of transport.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces announced the launch of the next stage of \"Operation Gideon Chariots,\" saying two divisions had begun pushing into the heart of Gaza City, with two regular divisions operating in the surrounding area. It said a third division would join the operation in the coming days.",

      "After weeks of threatening an expansion of the Israeli military operation in Gaza City, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz also signaled on Tuesday that it had begun.",
      "\"Gaza is burning,\" he said early in the morning. \"The (Israel military) is striking with an iron fist at the terrorist infrastructure and soldiers are fighting heroically to create the conditions for the release of the hostages and the defeat of Hamas. We will not relent and we will not go back \u2014 until the completion of the mission.\"",
      "The United Nations estimated on Monday that over 220,000 Palestinians have fled northern Gaza over the past month, after the Israeli military warned that all residents should leave Gaza City ahead of the operation. An estimated 1 million Palestinians were living in the region around Gaza City before the evacuation warnings.",
      "Palestinian residents reported heavy strikes across Gaza City on Tuesday morning. The city's Shifa Hospital said it received the bodies of 20 people killed in a strike that hit multiple houses in a western neighborhood, with another 90 wounded arriving at the facility in recent hours.",
      "\"A very tough night in Gaza,\" Dr. Mohamed Abu Selmiyah, director of Shifa Hospital, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The bombing did not stop for a single moment,\" he said. \"There are still bodies under the rubble.\"",
      "The Israeli military did not respond to immediate requests for comment on the strikes but in the past has accused Hamas of building military infrastructure inside civilian areas, especially in Gaza City.",
      "Rubio visits Qatar, says time for peace deal \"running out\"",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio traveled Tuesday from Israel to the energy-rich nation of Qatar for talks with its ruling emir, whose country is still incensed over Israel's strike last week that killed five Hamas members and a local security official.",
      "Arab and Muslim nations denounced the strike at a summit Monday but stopped short of any major action targeting Israel, highlighting the challenge of diplomatically pressuring any change in Israel's conduct.",
      "Egypt, however, escalated its language against Israel, with President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi describing the country as \"an enemy\" in a fiery speech on Monday in Qatar during the Arab leaders' summit.",
      "It was the first time an Egyptian leader had used the term since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1979, said Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt's State Information Service.",
      "\"Egypt is being threatened,\" Rashwan told the state-run Extra News television late Monday.",
      "El-Sisi's remark comment played prominently across Egyptian newspapers' front pages on Tuesday through Cairo has taken no steps to change its formal diplomatic status with Israel.",
      "Rubio spent about an hour meeting with Qatar's leader before heading back to the airport, where he was next scheduled to fly to the United Kingdom, where President Trump is set to arrive for an official state visit on Tuesday evening.",
      "\"We have a very short window of time in which a deal can happen\" to end the war in Gaza, Rubio warned before arriving in Doha. \"It's a key moment \u2014 an important moment.\"",
      "Rubio said \"a negotiated settlement\" still remained the best option, while acknowledging the dangers an intensified military campaign posed to Gaza.",
      "\"The only thing worse than a war is a protracted one that goes on forever and ever,\" Rubio said. \"At some point, this has to end. At some point, Hamas has to be defanged, and we hope it can happen through a negotiation. But I think time, unfortunately, is running out.\"",

    "story": [
      "An independent panel of experts commissioned by the United Nations Human Rights Council has concluded \"on reasonable grounds that the Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces have committed and are continuing to commit\" acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "In its report published Tuesday, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel \u2014 which was established by the HRC in 2021 \u2014 said it had collected and analyzed evidence in relation to alleged human rights violations committed by all parties in the Israel-Hamas war, which Israel launched in response to the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack.",
      "\"Today, we witness in real time how the promise of 'never again' is broken and tested in the eyes of the world. The ongoing genocide in Gaza is a moral outrage and a legal emergency,\" Navi Pillay, Chair of the Commission, said at a Tuesday news briefing. \"There is no need to wait for the International Court of Justice to declare it a genocide. All states are obligated to use whatever means within its (their) power to prevent the commission of genocide. And so we urge member states to ensure accountability for any crimes that have been committed and prevent further crimes from being committed, not just in Gaza, but the entire occupied Palestinian territory.\"",
      "Israeli's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called the report \"fake.\"",
      "\"The report relies entirely on Hamas falsehoods, laundered and repeated by others,\" Saar said, echoing the language used in past Israeli government statements responding to accusations it is committing genocide. \"In stark contrast to the lies in the report, Hamas is the party that attempted genocide in Israel \u2014 murdering 1,200 people, raping women, burning families alive, and openly declaring its goal of killing every Jew.\"",
      "Genocide is defined under international law as the commission of certain acts against a group \"with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\"",
      "Those acts include \"causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,\" and \"forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\"",
      "In its report, the commission said it found that Israeli authorities and security forces, \"have committed and are continuing to commit the following actus reus of genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, namely (i) killing members of the group; (ii) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (iii) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; and (iv) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.\"",
      "The commission also said statements made by Israeli authorities have demonstrated \"direct evidence of genocidal intent,\" and that, alongside circumstantial evidence of similar intent, \"the Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces have had and continue to have the genocidal intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "Based on its analysis, the commission said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Isaac Herzog and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had, \"incited the commission of genocide and that Israeli authorities have failed to take action against them to punish the incitement.\"",
      "\"The Commission concludes that the State of Israel bears responsibility for the failure to prevent genocide, the comission of genocide and the failure to punish genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip,\" the report said.",
      "\"The commission has not fully assessed statements by other Israeli political and military leaders, including Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir and Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich, and considers that they too should be assessed to determine whether they constitute incitement to commit genocide,\" the commission added.",
      "The report said Israel should \"immediately end the commission of genocide in the Gaza Strip\" and implement a permanent ceasefire, allowing the free flow of humanitarian aid into the Palestinian territory. It also called on other U.N. member states to \"employ all means reasonably available to them to prevent the commission of genocide in the Gaza Strip,\" including stopping the transfer of arms and other equipment to Israel.",
      "A number of scholars and international and Israeli human rights groups had previously accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "In August, the International Association of Genocide Scholars \u2014 a group of academics specializing in the subject \u2014\u00a0declared in a resolution that Israel's actions in Gaza since the 22-month war began constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The group has in turn faced heavy criticism from Israeli officials and Jewish groups about the way they operate and acquire members, though they have since suspended their membership system in response to what they call a \"campaign of spam and harassment.\"",
      "In July, Israeli rights group B'Tselem and the Physicians for Human Rights organization accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "The International Court of Justice is also hearing a case, brought by South Africa's government, that accuses Israeli forces of committing genocide.",

    "summary": "The ongoing fallout over Epstein is likely to follow Trump on his formal state visit to the U.K., which just lost its ambassador in D.C. to the scandal.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump arrived in London on Tuesday for a historic second official state visit to the U.K., and he can look forward to the pomp and pageantry of a formal state dinner at Windsor Castle on Wednesday evening, hosted by King Charles III.",
      "But the timing of his visit is potentially awkward for Mr. Trump and his host, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and will likely bring more unwanted questions for the U.S. leader, coming immediately on the heels of the Starmer's decision to fire his ambassador in Washington, Peter Mandelson, in response to new revelations about his past friendship with the late convicted sex offender .",
      "Trump to get an unprecedented second royal reception",
      "In the early weeks of Mr. Trump's second term, Starmer had an ace in the hole to gain some favor as he arrived for a visit at the White House. Starmer came armed with a royal invitation from King Charles for an unprecedented second official state visit.",
      "It was seen as a savvy diplomatic move, with Starmer recognizing Mr. Trump's admiration for the British monarchy and royal family.",
      "\"My relationship is very good with the U.K. and King Charles is my friend. This is the first time this has ever happened, to be honored twice,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before his departure on Tuesday.",
      "The president is set to be greeted Wednesday with the full pomp, regalia and public spectacle offered by the U.K.'s royals. When they arrive Wednesday in Windsor, just west of London, Mr. Trump and first lady Melania will be taken by royal carriage, alongside King Charles, Queen Camilla and the Prince and Princess of Wales, to Windsor Castle, escorted by three different military bands and a regiment of the British Army on horseback.",
      "Events on the day will include a flypast by British and American F-35 fighter jets, as well as other Royal Air Force planes, all capped by a state banquet at the castle in the evening.",
      "\"I hate to say it, but nobody does it like you people in terms of the pomp and the ceremony,\" Mr. Trump told Starmer at a joint news conference during a visit to one of his golf courses in Scotland in July.",
      "The second official state visit for Mr. Trump is a rarity in modern times. Historically, second-term U.S. presidents have not been offered new full state visits, and have instead generally been invited for tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle.",
      "\"Ultimately, it's happening because, you know, the royal family \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 is the biggest trump card this government can play at big moments of international statesmanship and diplomacy,\" Roya Nikkhah, the royal editor for the Sunday Times newspaper, told CBS News ahead of Mr. Trump's arrival. \"There's a lot in it for us and our government in terms of national interest, and President Trump will get all those images that he desperately wants to have again.\"",
      "Growing divisions in the United Kingdom",
      "While Mr. Trump is briefly leaving behind a United States still rattled by the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk last week, he's touching down in a nation facing its own political divisions.",
      "Mr. Trump's visit comes as Starmer faces the most significant political headwinds of his one-year premiership. His government has come under mounting pressure from an ascendant right-wing political movement at home, against a backdrop of growing polarization in Britain. Powerful outside voices, including tech billionaire and former close Trump ally Elon Musk, have been accused of stoking these divisions",
      "A demonstration in London organized by far-right, anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, drew more than 110,000 people on Saturday, billed as a rally to \"Unite the Kingdom\" and for free speech. Musk himself addressed the rally by video-link. Eight people were arrested, and a small number of Robinson supporters clashed with police officers who were keeping them apart from counterprotesters.",
      "As CBS News' Haley Ott reported from the protest on Saturday, among the Union Jacks and England flags carried by many members of the crowd, there were also MAGA hats and American flags.",
      "\"Britain is a nation proudly built on tolerance, diversity and respect. Our flag represents our diverse country and we will never surrender it to those that use it as a symbol of violence, fear and division,\" Starmer said in a social media post on Sunday, rebuking some of the behavior seen at the march.",
      "There has also been much criticism of the rhetoric employed by Musk when he addressed the weekend demonstration.",
      "\"Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die,\" the billionaire, who has been a vocal critic of Starmer since he took office in July 2024, told the crowd.",
      "While Mr. Trump may no longer be on friendly terms with Musk, his administration is ideologically aligned with the two central themes of Saturday's demonstration in London: advocating for free speech and an aggressively nationalist immigration policy.",
      "That could make discussions with Mr. Trump diplomatically challenging for Starmer to navigate when they meet later this week.",
      "U.K. ambassador's dismissal over Epstein badly timed for Starmer and Trump",
      "The man who would have had a key role in the organization of the president's state visit is no longer in his post. Peter Mandelson was fired by Starmer as British Ambassador to the United States last week after new details emerged of his ties to Epstein. That also helped put the issue and questions around Mr. Trump's own past relationship with Epstein back in the headlines, a subject he has dismissed as a Democrat-inspired \"hoax.\"",
      "Starmer removed Mandelson from the key post after days of drip-fed revelations about Mandelson's years-long friendship with convicted sex offender Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell in New York in 2019.",
      "Pressure started mounting on Starmer to take action when messages written by Mandelson to Epstein were released by the U.S. House Oversight Committee earlier this month, as part of a redacted 2003 \"birthday book\" to the late financier. They included a series of short notes accompanied by photos.",
      "Among other personal messages, Mandelson wrote that Epstein was known for \"taking you by surprise... in one of his glorious homes he likes to share with his friends (yum yum),\" and that \"wherever he is in the world, he remains my best pal!\"",
      "The final straw for Starmer, however, came after Bloomberg published a selection of emails on Sept. 10, from about 100 emails said to have been exchanged between Mandelson and Epstein between 2005 and\u00a0 2010. Their contents, including suggestions by Mandelson that Epstein vigorously defend himself against the sexual misconduct allegations, led to Starmer promptly firing the ambassador.",
      "In a podcast interview, Mandelson acknowledged the veracity of his correspondence with Epstein and expressed his deep regret that he had ever interacted with him, insisting he never saw evidence of the financier's crimes and had believed previous rebuttals issued by his attorneys.",
      "The \"birthday book\" in question is the same document The Wall Street Journal first reported the existence of in July, prompting Mr. Trump, who is also alleged to have written a message for Epstein in the book, to file a lawsuit against the newspaper and the owner of its parent company, Rupert Murdoch.",
      "The Wall Street Journal published the full document, showing Mr. Trump's alleged signature, last week.",
      "Mr. Trump denies writing the message, calling it and the signature \"fake.\"",

      "The Biden administration in 2021 imposed restrictions on Hungarian passport holders born outside of Hungary and reduced the timeframe of authorized travel permitted under the Visa Waiver Program, citing a simplified naturalization policy backed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban that extended citizenship to people born abroad who claimed Hungarian ancestry.",
      "Officials said at the time that nearly 1 million people were granted citizenship between 2011 and 2020 without adequate vetting.",
      "Under the Visa Waiver Program, most citizens of participating countries are allowed to visit the United States for 90 days or fewer, if they obtain approval within the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). Citizens from more than 40 countries are eligible to travel to the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program, according to the State Department's\u00a0website.",
      "While ESTA approvals typically allow travel over a span of two years, restrictions added by the U.S. in 2023 had reduced that validity period for the Hungarian travelers born outside the country from two years to one, and limited the authorization to only one entry into the U.S.",
      "Beginning Sept. 30, the Trump administration is restoring the validity period back to two years and allowing Hungarians to make multiple entries into the U.S. within that time.",
      "\"The United States and Hungary have a strong security partnership, and that commitment is reflected in the actions that Hungary has taken to meet the security standards of the Visa Waiver Program,\" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.",

      "While Mr. Trump has embraced Orban, the Biden administration had a colder relationship with the NATO ally. Then-President Biden criticized the Hungarian leader in 2024 as \"looking for a dictatorship.\" Hungary for months delayed the expansion of NATO to include Sweden and Finland, arguing their additions would antagonize Russia.",

      "The Culture Ministry in Greece said Monday that an 11-member deep-sea diving team conducted a weeklong operation in May to recover artifacts including the ship's bell and the port-side navigation light. The ministry released a video on social media showing divers exploring the wreckage and retrieving objects.",
      "The White Star Line's Britannic, launched in 1914, was designed as a luxury cruise liner, but was requisitioned as a hospital ship during World War I. It was heading toward the island of Lemnos when it struck a mine and sank off the island of Kea, about 45 miles southeast of Athens, on Nov. 21, 1916.",

    "story": [
      "Some of the biggest American names in comedy have signed up to perform at a festival in Saudi Arabia, and they're being urged to speak out against the country's human rights abuses \u2014   and not to be \"complicit in covering up the abuses of a repressive regime,\" by the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch organization.",
      "Saudi Arabia will host the Riyadh Comedy Festival, which organizers say will be the \"world's largest comedy festival,\" from Sept. 26 to Oct. 9. Some of North America's most popular comedians, along with comics from Europe and elsewhere, are featured on the bill, including Dave Chapelle, Kevin Hart and Bill Burr.",
      "The festival will be the latest in a series of sports and cultural events hosted by Saudi Arabia's government that critics say amount to an effort to obscure the country's reputation for rampant human rights abuses.",
      "\"The Saudi government has invested billions into high profile entertainment events like these in a deliberate effort to whitewash the country's human rights record and deflect from the egregious abuses that continue to happen inside of the country,\" Human Rights Watch researcher Joey Shea told CBS News. \"These investments are a part of the broader strategy to... have people thinking about a comedy event, for example, rather than the soaring number of executions that are happening inside of the country.\"",
      "HRW noted specifically the state execution of journalist Turki Al-Jasser, who was killed in June following seven years of detention after reportedly being identified as the author of several anonymous tweets criticizing the Saudi royal family.",
      "Al-Jasser had been convicted of terrorism and high treason on the basis of posts he was accused of authoring, according to UNESCO.",
      "UNESCO's director general Audrey Azoulay condemned his execution, saying: \"A death sentence imposed on journalists constitutes a serious attack on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. Journalists must be able to report without fear for their lives or safety.\"",
      "Reporters Without Borders, an organization that works to protect journalists, branded the charges against Al-Jasser as \"false.\"",
      "\"This execution of a journalist went forward to very little international criticism and this is clearly a result of these billions that had been invested in the country's whitewashing strategy,\" Shea told CBS News.",
      "When asked whether they believed the comedians would be able to freely tell jokes at the festival, the HRW researcher predicted there would be clear red lines drawn by organizers to prevent any criticism of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, who has already taken over as ruler of the highly conservative Islamic kingdom, as well as his policies and the broader royal family.",
      "Shea called on the high-profile entertainers attending the event \u2014 funding for which comes from the Saudi government's General Entertainment Authority \u2014   to mitigate the positive effect that their presence might have on the country's reputation for human rights abuses, including by \"speaking out about the abuses.\"",
      "Tim Dillon, one of the comedians scheduled to perform at the Riyadh festival, claimed on his podcast that he's being paid $315,000 for a single show, and that some of his more famous colleagues would receive around $1.6 million for their appearances.",
      "CBS News has contacted the publicists representing billed attendees Bill Burr, Mark Normand, Kevin Hart, Sebastian Maniscalco, Dave Chapelle, Louis C.K., Whitney Cummings, Tom Segura, Andrew Schulz and Jim Jeffries, but has received no comment from any of them regarding their expected appearances in Saudi Arabia.",
      "CBS News asked Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment on HRW's assertions, but has not received a response.",
      "One of the highest-profile cases of the Saudis' purported efforts to change their image came in 2021, with the launch of LIV Golf, a golf league that saw seasoned professionals defect from the famed PGA Tour in exchange for highly profitable contracts.",
      "Critics accused the golfers of helping the Saudi government to \"sportswash\" its reputation, only three years after Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, an outspoken critic of the county's leadership, was brutally murdered inside a Saudi diplomatic office in Istanbul, Turkey.",
      "A CIA report concluded with a medium to high degree of confidence that the killing was likely carried out at bin Salman's orders.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have discovered what's thought to be the oldest known mummies in the world in southeastern Asia dating back up to 12,000 years.",
      "Mummification prevents decay by preserving dead bodies. The process can happen naturally in places like the sands of Chile's Atacama Desert or the bogs of Ireland where conditions can fend off decomposition. Humans across various cultures also mummified their ancestors through embalming to honor them or send their souls to the afterlife.",
      "Egypt's mummies may be the most well-known, but until now some of the oldest mummies were prepared by a fishing people called the Chinchorro about 7,000 years ago in what's now Peru and Chile.",
      "A new study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences pushes that timeline back.",
      "Researchers found human remains that were buried in crouched or squatted positions with some cuts and burn marks in various archaeological sites across China and Vietnam and to a lesser extent, from the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.",
      "Studying the bones further, scientists discovered the bodies were likely exposed to heat. That suggested the bodies had been smoke-dried over a fire and mummified by hunter-gatherer communities in the area.",
      "The practice \"allowed people to sustain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors, bridging time and memory,\" study author Hirofumi Matsumura with Sapporo Medical University in Japan said in an email.",
      "The results were \"a great surprise,\" said Hsiao-chun Hung, senior research fellow at Australian National University.",
      "\"The bones are so ancient, and it is remarkable to discover that this tradition is so old, connecting the practices of ancient peoples with those still found in some communities today,\" Hung said.",
      "The process allowed relatives to maintain contact with the deceased, and in some cases was believed to allow the spirit to roam freely during the day and return to a body at night.",
      "\"I believe this reflects something deeply human \u2014 the timeless wish that our loved ones might never leave us, but remain by our side forever,\" Hung told Agence France-Presse.",
      "The researchers theorize that the practice may have been common in ancient Asian civilizations.",
      "\"This tradition may have been known among hunter-gatherer societies across a vast region, for many millennia,\" they wrote in the study,",
      "Dating methods used on the mummies could have been more robust and it's not yet clear that mummies were consistently smoke-dried across all these locations in southeastern Asia, said human evolution expert Rita Peyroteo Stjerna with Uppsala University in Sweden, who was not involved with the research.",
      "The findings offer \"an important contribution to the study of prehistoric funerary practices,\" she said in an email.",
      "Mummies are far from a thing of the past. Even today, Indigenous communities in Australia and Papua New Guinea smoke-dry and mummify their dead, scientists said.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in nearly three decades.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, a stinging rebuke to a traditional U.S. ally that reflects a recent surge in cocaine production and fraying ties between the White House and the country's leftist president.",
      "Even as it determined that Colombia had failed to comply with its international counternarcotics obligations, the Trump administration issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered major aid cuts, citing vital U.S. national interests.",
      "Nonetheless, it is a major step against one of the United States' staunchest allies in Latin America, and it could further hamper efforts to restore security in the countryside, according to Adam Isacson, a security researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he regretted the decision, which overlooked decades of bloodshed by Colombian security forces and civilians all in the name of a U.S.-led drug war.",
      "\"Everything we do has nothing to do with the Colombian people,\" Petro said during a televised address Monday night. \"It is to prevent the American society from smearing its noses in order to work, work and work, because this drug is a stimulant.\"",
      "The U.S. last added Colombia to the list, through a process known as decertification, in 1997 when the country's cartels \u2014 through threats of violence and money \u2014 had poisoned much of the nation's institutions.",
      "It \"is a blunt tool and a huge irritant in bilateral relations that goes well beyond drug issues and makes cooperation far harder in any number of areas,\" Isacson said. \"That's why it's so rarely used.\"",
      "The president at the time, Ernesto Samper, was facing credible accusations of receiving illicit campaign contributions from the now-defunct Cali cartel, and a plane he was set to use for a trip to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly session was found carrying 4 kilograms of heroin.",
      "A remarkable turnaround began once Samper left office. Successive U.S. administrations \u2014 both Republican and Democrats \u2014 sent billions in foreign assistance to Colombia to eradicate illegal coca crops, strengthen its armed forces in the fight against drug-fueled rebels and provide economic alternatives to poor farmers who are on the lowest rungs of the cocaine industry.",
      "That cooperation started to unravel following the suspension a decade ago of aerial eradication of coca fields with glyphosate. It followed a Colombian high court ruling that determined the U.S.-funded program was potentially harmful to the environment and farmers.",
      "A 2016 peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest rebel group known as FARC, also committed Colombia to rolling back punitive policies likened to the U.S. spraying of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War in favor of state building, rural development and voluntary crop substitution.",
      "Since then, cocaine production has skyrocketed. The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. That is almost triple the size of New York City.",
      "Along with production, drug seizures have also soared to 654 metric tons so far this year. Colombia seized a record 884 metric tons last year.",
      "But unlike past governments, manual eradication of coca crops under Petro's leadership has slowed, to barely 5,048 hectares this year \u2014 far less than the 68,000 hectares uprooted in the final year of his conservative predecessor's term and well below the government's own goal of 30,000 hectares.",
      "Petro, a former rebel himself, also has angered senior U.S. officials by denying American extradition requests, as well as criticizing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and its efforts to combat drug trafficking in neighboring Venezuela.",
      "\"Under my administration, Colombia does not collaborate in assassinations,\" Petro said on Sept. 5 after the U.S. military carried out a deadly strike on a small Venezuelan vessel in the Caribbean that the Trump administration said was transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\"The failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership,\" Trump said in a presidential memo submitted to Congress. \"I will consider changing this designation if Colombia's government takes more aggressive action to eradicate coca and reduce cocaine production and trafficking, as well as hold those producing, trafficking, and benefiting from the production of cocaine responsible, including through improved cooperation with the United States to bring the leaders of Colombian criminal organizations to justice.\"",
      "Under U.S. law, the president annually must identify countries that have failed to meet their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months.",
      "In addition to Colombia, the Trump administration listed four other countries \u2014 Afghanistan, Bolivia, Myanmar and Venezuela \u2014 as among 23 major drug transit or drug-production countries that have failed to meet their international obligations. With the exception of Afghanistan, the White House determined that U.S. assistance to those countries was vital to national interests and therefore they would be spared any potential sanctions.",
      "The redesignation of Venezuela as a country that has failed to adequately fight narcotics smuggled from neighboring Colombia comes against the backdrop of a major U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean that has already led to two deadly strikes on small Venezuelan vessels that the Trump administration said were transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\"In Venezuela, the criminal regime of indicted drug trafficker Nicol\u00e1s Maduro leads one of the largest cocaine trafficking networks in the world, and the United States will continue to seek to bring Maduro and other members of his complicit regime to justice for their crimes,\" Trump's designation said. \"We will also target Venezuelan foreign terrorist organizations such as Tren de Aragua and purge them from our country.\"",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Monday in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as close U.S. ally Qatar gathered other Arab nations' leaders for a summit to issue unified condemnation of last week's Israeli airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in the Qatari capital.",
      "On Sunday, President Trump urged Netanyahu's government to be \"very careful\" following the airstrike in Doha.",
      "\"They have to do something about Hamas, but Qatar has been a great ally to the United States,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at Morristown airport in New Jersey.",
      "Speaking Monday alongside Rubio, Netanyahu heaped praise on the Trump administration for its staunch, increasingly unique international support of Israel's tactics in its ongoing war against Hamas \u2014 which has long been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and the European Union \u2014 in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"Your presence here today sends a clear message that America stands with Israel,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "The Israeli leader has vigorously defended last week's strike in Doha, saying Israeli fighter jets targeted senior Hamas leaders responsible for the Hamas-led, Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that killed some 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza.",
      "Hamas has said that five of its members were killed, but that Israel failed to kill its intended targets \u2014 senior members of the group's political negotiating team, who have long been based in Doha, with the knowledge and backing of both Israel and the U.S.",
      "Rubio, pressed to respond to the anger in Doha over the strike last week, told reporters at the news conference with Netanyahu that \"we have strong relationships with our Gulf allies\u2026 We have been engaged with them consistently before what happened and after what happened.\"",
      "\"Irrespective of what has occurred, the reality is we still have 48 hostages. We still have Hamas that is holding Gaza hostage and using civilians as human shields\u2026 as long as they are around there will be no peace in this region,\" Rubio said.",
      "A senior State Department official told CBS News Monday that Rubio will travel to Qatar after his Israel visit, before flying to the United Kingdom for President Trump's state visit there.",
      "Addressing reporters Saturday at Joint Base Andrews prior to his departure, Rubio said he would be speaking with Netanyahu to \"get a much better understanding of what their plans are moving forward.\"",
      "\"What's happened has happened. Obviously, we were not happy about it. The president was not happy with it,\" Rubio said, referring to the strike in Doha. \"Now we need to move forward and figure out what comes next. Because at the end of the day, when all is said and done, there is still a group called Hamas, which is an evil group that still has weapons and is terrorizing.\"",
      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani issued a fresh condemnation of Israel's attack on Sunday, and he called \"for the international community to stop its double standards and punish Israel for its crimes.\"",
      "Qatar is a key U.S. ally and it has long hosted the largest American military base in the Middle East, the Al-Udeid Air Base, where there are thousands of U.S. troops based.",
      "A source familiar with the discussions at the emergency Arab and Muslim leaders summit in Doha on Monday told CBS News a draft resolution would see them condemn, Israel's \"hostile acts including genocide, ethnic cleansing, [and] starvation\" in Gaza, which, it will say, threatens \"prospects of peace and coexistence\" in the region.",
      "Israel has vehemently denied multiple accusations that its war in Gaza amounts to a genocide against Palestinians, arguing that its military campaign is solely against Hamas militants whom it accuses of putting civilians in harms way by using them as human shields.",
      "The source familiar with the draft statement from the Doha summit said the resolution would call \"on the international community to coordinate efforts to impose international sanctions on Israel \u2014 suspending the supply of weapons, munitions, and military material, and reviewing diplomatic and economic relations \u2014   to stop its crimes against the Palestinian people and attacks on regional countries.\"",
      "Israel's war has killed more than 64,000 Palestinians in the nearly two years since it began, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel rejects that figure but has not offered its own estimate and does not permit foreign journalists to enter Gaza and operate independently.",
      "The United Nations considers the tally from the Gazan health ministry the most reliable information available on the war's death toll.",
      "Last month, Israel declared Gaza City, the Palestinian Territory's biggest population center, a \"dangerous combat zone\" and a Hamas stronghold. In recent days, Israeli military forces have ramped up an aerial assault on the city, toppling several more high-rise buildings on Sunday in what was already an apocalyptic landscape.",
      "The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly voted Friday to support a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict \u2014 the long-standing call for an independent Palestinian state to be created alongside Israel as part of a negotiated peace agreement, which has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy for decades.",
      "President Trump, who previously voiced support for a two-state solution, has more recently distanced his administration from adherence to that objective, despite rising support internationally for Palestinian statehood.",
      "Israel and the U.S. were among the 10 countries that voted against the resolution, and before the vote, Netanyahu reiterated his government's stance that, \"there will be no Palestinian state.\"",
      "The U.N. resolution also condemned Israel's alleged attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure in Gaza and its \"siege and starvation, which have produced a devastating humanitarian catastrophe and protection crisis.\"",
      "The non-binding resolution, which 142 nations supported, also called for the release of all remaining Israeli hostages and outlined a vision in which the Palestinian Authority, which currently partially administers the Israeli-occupied West Bank, would govern and control all Palestinian territory, with a transitional administrative committee immediately established under its umbrella after a ceasefire in Gaza.",

    "summary": "Earlier this month, the U.S. deported a group of non-Ghanaian nationals to Ghana, including deportees from Gambia and Nigeria.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Saturday accused the Trump administration of trying to do an \"end-run\" around legal obligations that the U.S. has to protect people fleeing persecution and torture following the deportation of a group of African migrants to Ghana, some of whom are now slated to be returned to their home countries.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan ordered the U.S. government to explain, by 9 p.m. EST on Saturday, what steps it was taking to prevent the deportees \"from being removed to their countries of origin or other countries where they fear persecution or torture.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. deported more than a dozen non-Ghanaian nationals to Ghana, including deportees from Gambia and Nigeria, making Ghana the latest country to accept these so-called third country deportations at the request of the Trump administration. Ghana's government confirmed the deportations.",
      "Attorneys have alleged in a lawsuit that the deportees have been held in \"squalid conditions and surrounded by armed military guards in an open-air detention facility\" in Ghana.",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, told Chutkan during a hearing Saturday that four of the deportees have been told that Ghana will return them to their native nations as early as Monday, despite the fact that they have orders from U.S. immigration judges that bar their deportation to their home countries due to concerns they could be persecuted or tortured there. One man from Gambia, who attorneys say is bisexual, has already been returned to Gambia, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The deportees' legal protections \u2014 which are rooted in the United Nations Convention Against Torture and a provision of U.S. immigration law known as withholding of removal \u2014 prohibit the U.S. from sending foreigners to countries where they would face persecution or torture. But unlike asylum, they still allow the U.S. to send them to other, third-party countries.",
      "The Justice Department lawyer representing the U.S. government during the hearing did not dispute that Ghana plans to return the deportees to their native countries and conceded that the Ghanaian government appears to be violating diplomatic assurances that it allegedly made vowing not to send these migrants to places where they could be harmed.",
      "But the Justice Department attorney said the U.S. could not tell Ghana what to do at this point.",
      "Chutkan appeared frustrated by that position, suggesting it was \"disingenuous.\" She grilled the Justice Department attorney about whether the U.S. knew this could happen and suggested the deportations seemed to be an \"end-run\" to bypass the legal protections the deportees have. She suggested the U.S. can retrieve the deportees and return them to the U.S. or transfer them to another country where they would be safe. Or, she added, it could tell Ghana it is violating its agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"How's this not a violation of your obligation?\" she asked the Justice Department attorney.",
      "But Chutkan acknowledged her \"hands may be tied\" since the deportees are not on American soil nor in U.S. custody. She also implied that the Supreme Court would almost certainly pause any order that required the American government to act to stop the returns.",
      "In a statement Monday, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin rejected claims that the deportations to Ghana violate U.S. immigration law, citing a Supreme Court order earlier this year that lifted restrictions on third country removals.",
      "\"All of these illegal aliens deported to Ghana received due process and had a final order of removal from an immigration judge,\" McLaughlin added. \"Many of these were heinous criminals with rap sheets that included injury to a child, robbery, aggravated assault, and fraud.\"",
      "Gelernt, the ACLU attorney representing the African deportees, hailed Chutkan's mandate.",
      "\"The Court properly recognized that the United States government, with full knowledge that these individuals are going to be sent to danger, cannot simply wash their hands of the matter,\" Gelernt told CBS News.",
      "As part of its mass deportation campaign, the Trump administration has sought to convince countries around the globe to receive deportees who are not their citizens, brokering agreements with nations including El Salvador, Kosovo, Panama and South Sudan.",

    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014\u00a0Christian Brueckner, the convicted sex offender named by German authorities as the prime suspect in the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann almost two decades ago, has refused to be interviewed by U.K. police just days before his expected release from prison.",
      "The 49-year-old German national is due to walk free by Wednesday after serving a seven-year sentence for a separate crime, the rape of a 72-year-old American woman in the same region of Portugal from which McCann vanished during a vacation with her family.",
      "While Brueckner remains under formal investigation over McCann's 2007 disappearance, he has never been charged in connection with the case and he continues to deny any involvement.",
      "His decision to decline the London Metropolitan Police's formal request for an interview is being seen as a setback in the long running search for answers in the case that has frustrated investigators in Britain, Portugal and Germany for years.",
      "British Investigators hoped to question Brueckner to clarify key details about his movements in Praia da Luz, the resort town in Portugal's southern Algarve region from which McCann, then three, disappeared. She vanished from her family's rental apartment while her parents had dinner nearby.",
      "For many connected to the case, Brueckner's looming release represents both a pivotal moment and an obstacle. Authorities have been weighing how much oversight they can reasonably maintain over the convicted sex offender once he is no longer behind bars.",
      "Prosecutors in the city of Braunschweig have petitioned the regional court in Hildesheim for what's known as supervisory oversight, a form of monitoring similar to parole that could allow them to impose strict conditions on Brueckner after his release, possibly including an ankle tracking tag.",
      "Brueckner could also be required to declare a fixed place of residence, inform authorities of any change in address or workplace, and face restrictions on where he is permitted to travel. Such restrictions could include barring him from areas linked to his past crimes. He could also be prohibited from leaving Germany without requesting explicit approval from authorities.",
      "Brueckner's attorney Friedrich Fuelscher declined to comment when asked by CBS News about the possibility of his client being subjected to supervisory oversight measures.",
      "A regional court will ultimately decide what measures, if any, to implement following Brueckner's release.",
      "Even if supervisory oversight measures are granted, they are unlikely to satisfy critics who believe the circumstantial evidence linking Brueckner to the McCann case should dictate more close cooperation with British investigators.",
      "His refusal to answer U.K. detectives' questions means they won't get a chance to push him about inconsistencies in his alibis or to confront him directly with witness statements they have gathered over the last 18 years.",
      "The McCann case remains one of the world's most high-profile missing persons investigations.",
      "Brueckner has been at the center of the inquiry since German prosecutors publicly identified him as a suspect in 2020, citing phone records and his history of violent crimes in Portugal's Algarve region. But no charges have ever been brought against him in the McCann case, as the circumstantial evidence has been deemed insufficient to move forward with charges under German law.",

      "President Lee Jae Myung, visiting the White House in July, pledged $350 billion in new U.S. investment to sweeten a trade-and-tariff deal with President Trump.",
      "\"The sentiment is obviously very, very negative,\" James Kim, Chairman and CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, told CBS News. \"In my office, I usually have my TV turned on to the news \u2014 and this is obviously covered from morning to evening constantly. But everyone who I speak to, they view America as its number-one partner here from South Korea. Yes, we're going to have some challenging times.\"",
      "South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun, was peppered with demands from angry lawmakers during a parliamentary session in Seoul on Sept. 8, before he departed for meetings with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other U.S. officials.",
      "Lawmaker Kim Joon Hyun demanded that Cho respond to the ICE raid by launching investigations into every U.S. national teaching English in South Korea who could be working illegally on a tourist visa.",
      "\"Are we giving our money, technology, and investment to the United States only to be treated like this?,\" Kim asked.",
      "Cho replied by saying he would try to negotiate with Rubio to increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled Korean nationals to work in specialty occupations in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the ICE raid was the biggest single-site enforcement action in the agency's history. ICE alleges that the South Korean workers either overstayed their visa waiver permits, known as ESTAs, which allow business visits of up to 90 days, or were holding visas that did not permit them to perform manual labor, called B-1 business visas.",
      "Kim, at the American Chamber in Seoul, called it a \"blip\" in U.S.-Korea ties and said he was \"very, very optimistic about a much brighter future between the two\" countries.",
      "South Korea's president, however, took a more critical tone.",
      "\"As the president who is in charge of national safety, I feel a great responsibility,\" Lee said Tuesday. \"I hope that the unfair infringement of our people and corporate activities for the joint development of both Korea and the United States will not happen again.\"",
      "A poll conducted in South Korea found that almost 60% of respondents said they were disappointed by the U.S. crackdown and called the measures \"excessive,\" while about 31% said the ICE action was \"inevitable\" and that they could understand the reasoning.",
      "President Trump, in a Sunday post on his Truth Social platform, addressed all foreign companies operating in the U.S., saying \"your investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people.\"",
      "Kim at the chamber of commerce urged companies to heed the advice.",
      "\"My key message is listen to what President Trump said today. He wants to encourage more foreign companies to invest in America. Bring your people, bring your resources into America, but do it legally,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"An opportunity to really fix some things\" with a key U.S. ally",
      "Industry experts caution, however, that it may be difficult to maintain investment levels under those guidelines, as securing visas can take years, while many projects face strict deadlines and delays can drive up costs. There is a shortage of highly skilled workers in the U.S., meanwhile, for battery manufacturing, semiconductor and modern shipbuilding industries \u2014 all arenas in which South Korea has been investing heavily for years.",
      "Such jobs can require years of experience, not just a few months of on-the-job training.",
      "A spokesperson for South Korea's Foreign Ministry told CBS News that since Mr. Trump's second term began, it had already reached out 52 times on the matter of securing more visas for highly-skilled workers.",
      "Kim, the U.S. chamber of commerce leader, said the current upset in relations represented \"an opportunity to really fix some things that could be in the grey area, make it a lot more clear, so that they can have an even better relationship.\"",
      "He said that, given Seoul's importance as an investor in the U.S., it may be a good time for Washington to consider adopting a new policy that allows South Koreans to more easily come and work in the U.S.",
      "\"I think that in the past, Korea may not have been a significant investor in the United States, but now they are,\" he said. \"So I think it's worthy and deserving of that kind of a new status.\"",
      "Mr. Trump gave a nod in his Truth Social post to the notion that the U.S. does need foreign expertise, saying foreign companies should bring people over to help train American workers \u2014 and then hire them to do the work themselves.",
      "Rubio, during his meeting Wednesday in Washington with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho, \"said the United States welcomes ROK (South Korea) investment into the United States and stated his interest in deepening cooperation on this front,\" according to a readout shared by the State Department, which did not mention the ICE raid in Georgia.",
      "Rubio and Cho discussed advancing U.S.-South Korean ties \"through a forward-looking agenda\" that \"revitalizes American manufacturing through ROK investment in shipbuilding and other strategic sectors, and promotes a fair and reciprocal trade partnership,\" the State Department said.",
      "According to South Korea's Foreign Ministry, \"Cho expressed deep concern over the public disclosure of the detention of Korean workers who came to the United States to share technology and know-how and contribute to the Trump administration's efforts to revitalize American manufacturing, which has deeply hurt and shocked all Koreans.\"",
      "The ministry's statement said Cho had \"strongly requested the U.S. administration's special attention and support to ensure that these workers, who are not criminals, can quickly depart the US without physical restraint, such as handcuffs, and that they will not face any disadvantages in future visits to the U.S. He also proposed the establishment of a working group between the U.S. and South Korea to discuss various measures, including the creation of new visa categories, to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\"",

      "She added, \"I would love nothing more than King Charles to enjoy his Sussex grandchildren although I sadly feel this will not happen soon. Prince Harry holds the key here.\"",

      "While it seems clear that Charles is interested in the idea of patching things up with Harry, the same can't be said for William.",
      "\"The senior royals don\u2019t do anything by mistake, especially Prince William,\" royal expert Hilary Fordwich said. \"His having maintained a distance from Harry\u2019s reunion with King Charles, while the palace adopted an understated, cautious approach to public messaging, focusing on privacy and dignity rather than commentary or celebration says it all.\"",
      "Fordwich said that any reconciliation Harry has with his family is now dependent on \"what he does and doesn't say or do.\"",
      "\"His actions are on the line, he must prove he truly wants a closer bond by displaying, finally, dignity and dedication to duty, not just to himself. Harry has repeatedly voiced his desire to have his children know the family of his birthright and country, to know their heritage. The entire family is in \u2018wait and see mode.'\"",
      "Several royal experts believe that Harry's recent trip to the U.K. and Ukraine was an attempt to improve his image. (Chris Jackson/Getty Images for Invictus Games Dusseldorf 2023)",
      "Harry has been estranged from his family since he and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped back as senior royals in 2020 and moved to California. The couple aired their grievances in interviews and documentaries. The royal\u2019s 2023 memoir, \"Spare,\" which exposes embarrassing details about the House of Windsor and his sibling rivalry, worsened tensions.",
      "In July,\u00a0the U.K.\u2019s Daily Mail\u00a0reported that Harry had quietly extended an olive branch by offering to share his official schedule of engagements. The outlet said this was meant to ease tensions with the king.",

      "The outlet also reported that Harry\u2019s aides had a private meeting with the king\u2019s communications secretary in London. Representatives for Buckingham Palace and the Duke and\u00a0Duchess of Sussex did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment at the time.",
      "Prince William and Prince Harry haven't been seen together publicly in over a year. (Getty Images)",
      "Harry and William were last seen together in Aug. 2024 at the funeral of their uncle, Lord Robert Fellowes. The brothers kept their distance.",
      "\"There have been many reports in the British press that William is still extremely angry with Harry and does not want his father softening his position by meeting with him or allowing contact,\" Pelham Turner previously told Fox News Digital. \"[It is understood] that King Charles\u00a0feels it is his Christian duty\u00a0to welcome Harry, Meghan Markle and their family back into the fold.\"",

      "Apple Watch Series 11 now includes FDA-cleared hypertension notification. (Apple)",
      "Apple Watch hypertension alerts explained",
      "Hypertension is often called the \"silent killer\" because it can strike without symptoms. Left unchecked, it increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and kidney disease. By adding passive blood pressure monitoring, Apple Watch aims to help millions detect early warning signs.",
      "Using its optical heart sensor, the watch reviews how your blood vessels respond to heartbeats over 30-day periods. If it detects consistent patterns of hypertension, you'll get a notification. Apple expects the feature could alert more than 1 million people with undiagnosed hypertension in its first year alone.",
      "Apple Watch sends users a \"Possible Hypertension\" alert when heart data shows consistent signs of elevated blood pressure. Paired with the iPhone, users can log blood pressure and follow up with doctors. (Apple)",
      "Clinical validation of Apple Watch hypertension feature",
      "Apple built the new hypertension notification feature on a foundation of years of health research. Since the launch of Apple Watch, heart health tools like ECG, AFib History and irregular rhythm notifications have helped users catch issues early. The hypertension notification now extends that mission by addressing one of the most common and dangerous silent conditions.",
      "The feature works in the background during waking hours, analyzing photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, changes in blood volume under the skin, to detect patterns that suggest chronic high blood pressure. You do not need to calibrate the feature or take direct blood pressure readings with the watch. Instead, the device tracks signals over 30 days and sends a notification if consistent signs of hypertension appear.",
      "CAN YOUR APPLE WATCH DETECT PREGNANCY?",
      "Study results confirm accuracy of hypertension alerts",
      "Apple developed the algorithm using data from more than 100,000 study participants across diverse ages, races, body types, and health statuses. The company then validated its accuracy through a pivotal clinical study with over 2,000 participants, who wore Apple Watch alongside an at-home cuff to compare results.",
      "The validation study showed the feature achieved a specificity rate above 92%, meaning it minimized false positives. Sensitivity rates were especially strong for Stage 2 hypertension, the more severe form of the condition, where the feature identified more than half of users at risk. That accuracy could help prevent strokes, heart attacks and kidney disease in those who may not otherwise know they have hypertension.",
      "Importantly, the study confirmed that the feature performed consistently across age groups, genders, races and skin tones, making it reliable for Apple's global user base. Apple also ran usability testing to fine-tune onboarding and notification language so people understand the alerts and what actions to take next.",
      "By passively monitoring and flagging possible signs of hypertension, Apple Watch helps fill a dangerous gap in diagnosis. Hypertension often goes unnoticed for years, but now, you can be alerted within just one month of wearing the watch.",

Their approach automatically flags signals that suggest you may have high blood pressure and encourages you to check it out. That\u2019s especially important because so many people remain undiagnosed. The feature also provides a way to archive blood pressures, so if people are measuring at home, they can bring that information to their doctor. This isn\u2019t a one-stop solution, but it has the potential to help consumers take charge of their health and identify hypertension earlier.

      "Scientists from the University of Helsinki and the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 have found that you can recover silver from electronic waste using common kitchen ingredients like vegetable oil and hydrogen peroxide. This sustainable, scalable method published in the Chemical Engineering Journal could change how we mine precious metals from our growing piles of electronic junk.",

      "Scientists have discovered a new method of silver extraction from electronics by using cooking oil. (Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How cooking oil recovers silver from electronic waste",
      "Here's how it works. Fatty acids found in oils like sunflower or olive oil are mixed with hydrogen peroxide. When heated slightly, this combo safely dissolves silver from old circuit boards, wires or keyboard connectors. Then, using ethyl acetate, a far less toxic alternative to industrial solvents, researchers pull out the silver in a solid form. Unlike traditional methods that rely on harsh acids or cyanide-based solutions, this technique avoids toxic runoff and air pollution. Think of it as salad dressing meets science lab, without the environmental mess.",
      "Why recycling silver from e-waste is urgently needed",
      "Silver powers the devices you use every day, such as phones, solar panels, electric vehicles and even medical tech. But less than 20% of it gets recycled. As demand rises and natural resources shrink, finding clean ways to reclaim silver isn't just smart, it's necessary. Silver prices have surged sixfold in the last 25 years. At the same time, supply has lagged. That makes e-waste a goldmine, literally, for anyone who can unlock its hidden metals without poisoning the environment.",

      "Fatty acids found in cooking oil can stabilize silver ions for easier extraction. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)",
      "How scientists extract silver using fatty acids and light",
      "To figure out exactly how this all works, researchers used advanced computer models to study how fatty acids interact with silver ions. The process not only stabilizes the silver but also allows for easy recovery using light and simple solvents. Better still, the ingredients can be reused, and there's no chemical waste or massive cost. And it's highly selective. The method targets silver while leaving other metals behind, a major step forward in urban mining. In testing, even silver-coated keyboard connectors were cleanly processed into pure elemental silver powder using this system.",
      "Indian laborers sift through a heap of pre-owned mobile phones in an electronic waste workshop Dec. 5, 2023, in New Delhi, India.\u00a0 (Yawar Nazir/Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "This research brings us closer to safe, at-home or small-scale recycling kits that could recover silver from old gadgets. Recyclers and manufacturers could adopt this method to reduce chemical waste and operating costs, while protecting workers and the environment. This method supports a future where nothing goes to waste. It keeps valuable materials in use, cutting down the need for mining and pollution. Silver is vital for making many of the tech items we use every day. Reusing it responsibly means cleaner energy at a lower cost and less reliance on mined resources.",

      "We've long known that waste is a problem. Now, it might also be the solution.

Review your digital footprint, lock down privacy settings, and reduce what's available on public databases and broker sites.",

AI tools now help criminals generate highly realistic phishing attempts designed to trick you into handing over logins. By enabling\u00a02FA, you add an extra layer of protection that they cannot easily bypass. Choose app-based codes or a physical key whenever possible, as these are more secure than text messages, which are easier for attackers to intercept.",
      "AI-driven attacks often exploit the most basic weaknesses, such as outdated software. Once a hacker knows which companies or individuals are running old systems, they can use automated scripts to break in within minutes. Regular updates close those gaps before they can be targeted. Setting your devices and apps to update automatically removes one of the easiest entry points that criminals rely on.",
      "One of the most alarming details in the Anthropic report was how the hacker used AI to craft convincing extortion notes. The same tactics are being applied to phishing emails and texts sent to everyday users. If you receive a message demanding immediate action, such as clicking a link, transferring money or downloading a file, treat it with suspicion. Stop, check the source and verify before you act.",
      "The hacker in this case built custom malware with the help of AI. That means malicious software is getting smarter, faster and harder to detect. Strong antivirus software that constantly scans for suspicious activity provides a critical safety net. It can identify phishing emails and detect ransomware before it spreads, which is vital now that AI tools make these attacks more adaptive and persistent.",

If you see a command on a website, forum, or GitHub repository, don't execute it unless you fully understand what it does. Instead, confirm with Apple's official support site or the Apple Community forums, where experienced users and moderators can verify safe troubleshooting steps.",

The company's CEO, Tim Cook, led the presentation with sweeping visuals, confident pacing and a clear message: Apple is still betting big on premium innovation. But the real headline wasn't so much the tech; it was the prices.",
      "Earlier this year, President Donald Trump granted Apple a tariff break. Still, the company raised prices across its iPhone lineup. The new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, which Apple positioned as a reinvention of last year's iPhone 16 Plus, jumps to $999. The iPhone 17 Pro begins at $1,099, while the Pro Max tops out at $1,199. The entry-level iPhone 17 starts at $799.",
      "Apple positioned the price hikes as a reflection of breakthrough innovation. The company spotlighted the iPhone Air's sleek redesign, the powerful A19 chip and major camera upgrades. Yet the takeaway was clear: tariff relief didn't lead to consumer savings. Instead, Apple leaned into its premium identity, signaling that cutting-edge tech now comes with a steeper price tag.",

      "iPhone 17 Air: the thinnest iPhone ever",
      "Apple unveiled the iPhone 17 Air, its slimmest model yet at 5.6mm and 165 grams, built with recycled aluminum, glass and titanium. (Apple)",
      "Apple calls the iPhone 17 Air a game-changer. At just 5.6mm thin and weighing around 165 grams, it stands as the slimmest iPhone the company has ever made. The design uses recycled aluminum, glass and titanium to reduce weight while staying durable. Engineers reinforced the frame and applied new drop-test algorithms to make sure it holds up in daily use.",
      "The Air debuts silicon anode battery technology, which allows Apple to shrink the device without cutting power. During the presentation, Apple promised \"all-day battery life,\" but never gave an exact hour count. That vague description raised questions. Moments later, Apple introduced a new low-profile MagSafe battery accessory. When paired with the iPhone 17 Air, Apple says the combo delivers up to 40 hours of video playback. The timing of that announcement made it clear that battery life could still be a concern.",
      "Apple also pushed the Air forward with a new ultra-wide 48MP fusion camera system, which uses advanced image processing to improve detail and low-light performance. The display gained a ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate that makes scrolling and animations feel smoother. Outdoor use should also improve, thanks to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, making it easier to see in direct sunlight. On the durability side, the Air features Ceramic Shield 2 coating, which Apple claims resists scratches and accidental drops better than before.",

      "The iPhone 17 Pro starts at $1,099 and comes with 256GB of base storage. (Apple)",
      "The iPhone 17 Pro introduces a striking unibody design that relies on laser-welded vapor chamber cooling to keep performance steady even under heavy use. Apple gave the back a ceramic shield finish, while the front now features its upgraded seven-layer coating. That change reduces glare both indoors and outdoors, making the display easier on the eyes in all conditions.",
      "At the core of the Pro sits the new A19 Bionic chip built on 3nm architecture. Apple paired it with a 16-core Neural Engine and an updated display engine to push speed and efficiency even further. The company claims this is the most power-efficient iPhone yet and promises the longest battery life ever offered in a Pro model.",
      "Apple also turned its attention to the camera system. The Pro camera lineup includes a 48MP main sensor and a 12MP ultra-wide, with ProRes support for high-quality video recording. It even offers Genlock syncing, which professionals can use to line up multiple cameras in studio and live production setups.",
      "To complement the new design, Apple introduced TechWoven cases that feel more like premium accessories than traditional covers. Some versions include optional cross-body straps, a nod to the growing trend of blending technology with fashion.",

      "Apple positioned the iPhone 17 Pro Max as the ultimate model in the lineup. It shares the same unibody design, ceramic shield finish and seven-layer front coating as the Pro, but it stretches everything to a larger scale. The Pro Max delivers the biggest display Apple has ever put on an iPhone, paired with enhanced brightness that makes it more usable outdoors and in direct sunlight.",
      "Inside, it runs on the same A19 Bionic chip with the 16-core Neural Engine, so performance and efficiency mirror the Pro. What sets the Max apart is its endurance. Apple claims it offers the best battery life of any iPhone to date, making it the go-to choice for people who rely heavily on their phone throughout the day.",
      "The Pro Max also carries the full Pro camera system, including the 48MP main sensor and advanced video features like ProRes and Genlock. With its extra size, it appeals most to creators, gamers and anyone who wants the biggest screen possible in an iPhone.",
      "Like the Pro, the Max is available in deep blue, cosmic orange and silver finishes.",

      "The iPhone 17 inherits many of the Pro's features. It comes in five colors and has a thinner profile that feels more refined in hand. The display includes the upgraded coating to cut glare, and the front camera has a square AI-driven sensor with Center Stage for better video calls.",
      "The main camera system also makes a leap forward. The iPhone 17 now carries a 48MP main sensor, supported by Apple's fusion technology to improve clarity and low-light results. Combined with the updated display engine and improved durability from Ceramic Shield 2, the iPhone 17 delivers a more polished experience than previous entry models.",

      "Apple didn't stop with iPhones. The company used its event to refresh its wearables and audio lineup, bringing new features to AirPods and multiple Apple Watch models. Each product builds on familiar designs while adding functions aimed at health, fitness and convenience.",
      "The new AirPods Pro 3 deliver up to eight hours of listening time on a single charge. (Apple)",
      "Apple unveiled the third-generation AirPods Pro, priced at $249, and available starting Sept. 19. The design keeps the iconic stem but introduces foam-infused ear tips that come in five sizes. Apple said it studied 100,000 ear shapes to make them fit more securely.",
      "The new AirPods Pro 3 extend listening time, offering up to eight hours on a single charge, compared with six hours in the previous generation. With the charging case, total listening time stretches to 10 hours with hearing-AI features enabled.",
      "One of the standout additions is heart rate sensing, which turns the AirPods into another health-tracking accessory in Apple's ecosystem. The earbuds also use AI-driven hearing enhancements to improve clarity in noisy environments. Apple said the AirPods Pro 3 now deliver up to four times stronger active noise cancellation (ANC) than the originals, making them far more effective in crowded or loud spaces.",
      "For workouts, users can also track over 50 activity types with the Fitness app on iPhone while wearing them. Perhaps most notably, Apple added live translation.

      "The Apple Watch Series 11 continues Apple's push into health technology. It runs on watchOS 26 and introduces monitoring for possible hypertension and sleep apnea, with alerts designed to prompt users to seek medical care. Apple noted that FDA clearance is still pending for hypertension notifications, but the company clearly sees the watch as a serious medical tool.",
      "The watch also includes Sleep Score, which breaks down sleep stages such as core, deep and awake to give users a clearer picture of rest quality. Battery life reaches up to 24 hours, and the watch remains efficient even with 5G connectivity.",
      "Apple built the Series 11 with 100% recycled aluminum and titanium cases, expanding its sustainability pledge. Color options bring a refreshed look, while pricing\u00a0starts around $399, depending on configuration.",

      "Apple Watch SE 3 remains the lowest-priced entry into the lineup at $249. (Apple)",
      "Apple also refreshed its budget-friendly model, the Apple Watch SE 3. At\u00a0$249, it remains the lowest-priced entry into the lineup. The SE 3 uses the new S10 chip, giving it faster performance and support for Apple's expanding gesture controls.",
      "It also delivers sleep apnea notifications, a feature previously limited to more expensive models. Charging is now up to two times faster, ensuring the watch is ready to go with less downtime. Apple added more health and convenience tools, including wrist temperature sensing for deeper insights in the Vitals app, retrospective ovulation estimates and an Always-On display. It also supports double-tap and wrist flick gestures, plus on-device Siri. Available in two colors, the SE 3 carries forward Apple's strategy of making core health features more accessible.",
      "Apple Watch Ultra 3 debuts with the largest and brightest display ever on a Watch. (Apple)",
      "At the top end, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Ultra 3, starting at $799 and shipping September 19. This model pushes the limits of durability and outdoor performance. The Ultra 3 features the largest and brightest display ever put on an Apple Watch, making it easier to read data during workouts or in direct sunlight.",
      "It includes a redesigned radio and antenna system capable of connecting with satellites orbiting 800 miles above Earth. That means users can send messages or use Find My features even without cell service, making it a true companion for extreme adventures.",
      "The Ultra 3 packs a larger battery that runs up to 42 hours on a single charge. With Low Power Mode enabled, Apple says the battery can extend to as much as 72 hours, making it the longest-lasting Apple Watch to date. It also introduces new Workout Buddy tools for training and enhanced hypertension notifications, further pushing Apple's reputation in health tech. Available in black or natural titanium, the Ultra 3 blends rugged design with cutting-edge features.",
      "iPhone 17 accessories: small add-ons with big impact",
      "Apple showcased new accessories for its iPhones, including a low-profile MagSafe battery pack. (Apple)",

The most talked about was the\u00a0low-profile MagSafe battery pack, created to address the iPhone 17 Air's biggest weakness: vague \"all-day\" battery claims. When attached, the Air can stretch to 40 hours of video playback, turning what could have been a limitation into a selling point for Apple's ecosystem.",
      "To complement the Air's slim profile, Apple also revealed a\u00a0new translucent case and a\u00a0lightweight bumper. The translucent case keeps the 5.6mm design visible while still protecting it, while the bumper adds shock resistance around the edges without adding bulk. Both aim to reassure buyers who worry that the thinnest iPhone yet might be more fragile.",
      "For the Pro and Pro Max models, Apple introduced\u00a0TechWoven cases made from a durable fabric blend. What stood out was the addition of an\u00a0optional cross-body strap, giving users a hands-free way to carry their phones. Apple leaned into the idea of the iPhone as not just a device but also a lifestyle accessory that blends technology with personal style.",
      "Together, the MagSafe battery, translucent Air case, protective bumper and fashion-forward TechWoven cases with cross-body straps showed Apple's strategy clearly. Accessories are no longer secondary; they are central to how Apple expects customers to protect, power and personalize their iPhones.",

Nancy Mace, R-S.C., and Buddy Carter, R-Ga., both running for higher office in 2026, have authored dueling resolutions to strip Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of her committee assignments after she criticized Kirk\u2019s past \u201cwords and actions\u201d immediately after the shooting.",
      "Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., who was close to Kirk, is calling on Rep. Andre Carson, D-Ind., to fire a staffer who re-posted a quote on social media saying Kirk was \u201ca casualty of the violence he incited.\u201d",
      "And Republican Rep. Chip Roy, who is running for attorney general in Texas, is calling for the creation of a special committee to investigate the \u201cmoney, influence, and power behind the radical left\u2019s assault on America\u201d in light of Kirk's death.",
      "On Tuesday, Tyler Robinson was formally charged by Utah prosecutors with felony aggravated murder, two counts of witness tampering and other offenses; he has not yet had an attorney appointed to represent him. While the investigation is ongoing, the suspect\u2019s mother told investigators that Robinson had become \u201cmore political and had started to lean more to the left, becoming more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented,\u201d said prosecutors, who are seeking the death penalty.",
      "Robinson also told his father that he had carried out the shooting because Kirk \"spreads too much hate,\" the father told investigators, according to charging documents.",
      "There have also been numerous efforts by Republicans to lionize Kirk in the Capitol, to mixed results. In addition to her move to censure Omar, which will get a floor vote this week, Mace has also offered a resolution to have Kirk lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda. Luna sent a letter to Johnson urging him to put a statue of Kirk in the Capitol. Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., has offered another to posthumously award Kirk the Congressional Gold Medal. (President Donald Trump has already said he'll award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom).",
      "A moment of silence for Kirk on the House floor hours after the Sept. 10 assassination gave way to a shouting match between Democrats and Republicans. Meanwhile, Democrats, including all of the party\u2019s top leaders, were largely absent from a prayer vigil for Kirk on Monday night led by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.",
      "This week, House GOP leaders will hold a floor vote on a resolution condemning the Kirk assassination; honoring the \u201clife, leadership, and legacy of Charlie Kirk\u201d; and calling on Americans \u201cto reject political violence, recommit to respectful debate, uphold American values, and respect one another as fellow Americans.\u201d",
      "Leaders on both sides of the aisle are urging their members to lower the political temperature in an institution that has seen its share of political violence over the past 15 years, from the Gabby Giffords and Steve Scalise assassination attempts to the Jan. 6 attack and two attempts on President Trump\u2019s life last year.",
      "But in the raucous House of Representatives, that message isn\u2019t getting through to everyone.",
      "In addition to retaliating against Omar, Mace has been tweeting nonstop about the Kirk assassination, specifically calling for the firings of individual educators at universities and other schools who have criticized Kirk on social media.",
      "\u201cGood morning to everyone except the teachers across the country celebrating Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination. May your careers end as fast as your humanity did,\u201d Mace posted on X.",
      "\u201cThere is no unity with those who want us dead,\u201d she wrote in another post.",
      "Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., has done the same, retweeting dozens and dozens of posts about people who criticized Kirk or celebrated his death, as well as lashing out at the press and his Democratic colleagues, while calling for retribution.",
      "Van Orden has also approached the press in person, telling a gaggle of reporters outside the Capitol a day after the shooting that \u201cevery single one of you here\u201d is \u201cresponsible for that assassination.\u201d",
      "When an NBC News reporter responded that the shooter and a motive had not yet been identified, Van Orden interjected: \u201cYou know what? Knock it off. Knock it off.\u201d",
      "The suspect in the Kirk shooting had not yet been apprehended at the time.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said \u201cevery leader has an obligation to lower the temperature right now.\u201d But he singled out Mace and Van Orden as members who are \u201cnot doing their part\u201d to cool things off, adding that Speaker Johnson \u201cneeds to address\u201d them.",
      "And Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., had harsh words for Mace, who he said was seizing on the Kirk shooting for her own political benefit.",
      "\u201cNancy Mace wants to lecture Ilhan Omar and Democrats about civility? Are you kidding me? It\u2019s not a serious effort,\u201d Jeffries told reporters. \"It\u2019s an effort to drive donors into her gubernatorial campaign.\u201d",
      "Omar, in an interview with Mehdi Hasan on his site Zeteo, slammed Kirk defenders who have said the activist was simply engaging in \"civil debate.\"",
      "\u201cThere is nothing more effed up than to completely pretend his words and actions have not been recorded and in existence for the last decade or so ...\" Omar told Hasan. \"These people are full of s---, and it\u2019s important for us to call them out while we feel anger and sadness.\"",
      "Omar, like other Democrats in the Minnesota delegation, was friends with the late state House Speaker Melissa Hortman, who was killed by a gunman in June along with her husband and their dog. The same gunman shot and wounded state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife.",
      "Johnson has urged lawmakers to \u201cturn down the temperature.\u201d A former constitutional lawyer, the speaker said he\u2019s a staunch defender of free speech but that employers have the right to fire workers for saying things that don\u2019t represent their employer.",
      "\u201cWe do not censor and silence disfavored viewpoints. People in America are allowed to say crazy things,\u201d Johnson explained.",
      "\u201cNow, that said, if I\u2019m an employer or I\u2019m a government agency, and I have someone in my employ who is online celebrating the heinous murder of an innocent person, a young husband and father,\u201d he said, \u201cI can make the decision that they don\u2019t deserve to work for me, they shouldn\u2019t represent my company or my agency, and I have every right to do that. And I think that\u2019s appropriate.\u201d",
      "In a statement Tuesday responding to criticism of his staffer's post, Carson\u2019s office said the congressman has repeatedly condemned all political violence but that \u201cevery House staffer has a First Amendment right to share their personal views.\u201d",
      "His office said the post has since been removed but that the staffer was met with \"misogynistic, violent, and hateful comments and threats.\" Carson's office said it also has received multiple death threats, which have been reported to Capitol Police. \"That is also unacceptable,\u201d the office said.",
      "\"Congressman Carson condemns all political violence, and calls on every American to do the same,\" his office said.",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., told NBC News that everyone needs to do \u201csome self-reflection\u201d and work on \u201cregulating our hearts.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at a time when the impulse to a tragedy is to blame somebody else, and in a political situation, to blame an opponent or an adversary, or what you think of as an enemy,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cAnd I think there\u2019s enough responsibility for everybody to bear some of it.\u201d",
      "The day after the shooting, Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., was talking to reporters about how lawmakers need to tone down their rhetoric when he heard another member on the Capitol steps nearby speaking loudly and animatedly about Kirk.",
      "He paused for several seconds to look up at the lawmaker and listen in: It was Mace.",
      "He continued: \u201cAnd so that\u2019s some of the \u2014 some of the problem is, you know, we got to figure out how to bring the temperature down.\u201d"

      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have that hate speech in the world in which we live,\u201d she said. \"There is no place, especially now, especially after what happened to Charlie, in our society,\u201d Bondi said, referring to Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist who was assassinated on a college campus in Utah last week.",

      "Bondi appeared to take a softer stance and attempted to refine her remarks in a lengthy post on X on Tuesday morning, saying she was referring to violent threats. She also seemed to suggest in her post such threats only come from one side of the political aisle.",
      "\"Hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. It\u2019s a crime. For far too long, we\u2019ve watched the radical left normalize threats, call for assassinations, and cheer on political violence. That era is over,\" she said.",

These acts are punishable crimes, and every single threat will be met with the full force of the law. Free speech protects ideas, debate, even dissent but it does NOT and will NEVER protect violence.",

      "PITTSBURGH \u2014 Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro excoriated the recent spate of politically motivated attacks and killings during a speech to the Eradicate Hate Global Summit here on Tuesday, days after conservative activist and commentator Charlie Kirk was assassinated in Utah.",
      "Shapiro, up for re-election next fall and widely considered a contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, has spoken out on political violence repeatedly over the last year following high-profile incidents in his state, including at his own home.",
      "\u201cAs I have made clear each and every time, this type of violence has no place in our society, regardless of what motivates it or who pulls the trigger, who throws the Molotov cocktail or who wields the weapon,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s coming from one side or from the other, directed at one party or another, one person or another, it is all wrong, and it makes us all less safe.",
      "Shapiro\u2019s speech comes less than a week after an assassin\u2019s bullet struck and killed Kirk as he held an open debate with college students at Utah Valley University. The alleged shooter, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was arrested on Friday after a dayslong manhunt. Other political killings this year included former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, a Democrat who was killed in her home along with her husband in June, and two Israeli Embassy staffers who were gunned down in Washington, D.C., outside a Jewish museum in May.",
      "The summit Shapiro spoke at was born out of the Tree of Life massacre, when a white nationalist killed 11 worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018.",
      "\u201cDuring moments like this, I believe we have a responsibility to be clear and unequivocal in calling out all forms of political violence and making clear it is all wrong,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be hard to do. Unfortunately, some from the dark corners of the internet all the way to the Oval Office want to cherry-pick which instances of political violence they want to condemn. Listen: Doing that only further divides us and it makes it harder to heal. There are some who will hear that selective condemnation and take it as a permission slip to commit more violence, so long as it suits their narrative or only targets the other side.\u201d",
      "Speaking with NBC News after the speech, Shapiro criticized the president\u2019s response after the Kirk shooting.",
      "\u201cHe claimed, in the wake of the killing of Charlie Kirk, that he wanted to heal this nation,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cYou don\u2019t heal this nation by attacking your fellow Americans, by calling some of your fellow Americans \u2018scum\u2019 \u2014 his word choice, not mine. \u2026 The president using this as a pretext to go and undermine people\u2019s constitutional rights. That is dangerous, it is wrong, and it needs to stop.\u201d",
      "Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement responding to Shapiro\u2019s remarks that after surviving two attempts on his life and \u201cwatching his dear friend Charlie be assassinated \u2014 no one understands the dangers of political violence more than President Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why, following Charlie\u2019s assassination, President Trump delivered powerful and unifying remarks urging all Americans to \u2018commit themselves to the American values for which Charlie Kirk lived and died. The values of free speech, citizenship, the rule of law, and the patriotic devotion and love of God,\u2019\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBut President Trump, and the entire Administration, will not hesitate to speak the truth \u2014 for years, radical leftists have slandered their political opponents as Nazis and Fascists, inspiring left-wing violence. It must end.\u201d",
      "In light of Kirk\u2019s assassination, top members of the Trump administration have pledged vengeance, saying they will use every lever of power to target left-wing groups and activists they blame for the conditions that led to Kirk\u2019s killing.",
      "Speaking with Vice President JD Vance on Monday as he hosted Kirk\u2019s podcast, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller described \u201cleft-wing political organizations that are promoting violence\u201d as a \u201cvast domestic terror movement,\u201d while Vance urged people to call the employers of people who were \u201ccelebrating Charlie\u2019s murder.\u201d The administration has not provided evidence for left-wing organizations\u2019 involvement in the shooting.",
      "\u201cPolitical violence doesn\u2019t know any boundaries. It impacts Republicans and Democrats,\u201d Shapiro said in an interview when asked about comments from Vance and other Republicans. \u201cIt comes from one side and the other, and we have to be universal in our condemnation. Cherry-picking only certain types of violence to condemn that makes us all less safe.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi, additionally, said on a podcast that aired Monday that the Justice Department will target people who use \u201chate speech.\u201d",
      "\u201cSadly, we\u2019ve even seen some on the internet openly celebrate political violence or issue calls for revenge in the wake of it, giving violence a pass or justifying it or looking the other way,\u201d Shapiro said in his address. \u201cIt only deepens the divide. \u2026 We must reject the rhetoric of vengeance, and instead, focus, as you are today, on the work of healing. We need to create more opportunities for peaceful and respectful dialog, respecting each other\u2019s fundamental rights as Americans. Censorship, using the long arm of government to silence people, silence businesses and nonprofits and restrict their right to free speech \u2014 that will not solve this problem.\u201d",
      "In his interview with NBC News, Shapiro said that \u201cno one should be celebrating\u201d Kirk\u2019s death. He added that he believes \u201cit is dangerous\u201d for the government \u201cto become the thought police or the speech police.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we need freedom of speech in this country to be protected,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a foundational principle of this great nation. It doesn\u2019t mean that we have to agree with the speech. Certainly, if speech is being used to incite violence that crosses a line, that\u2019s not OK. But just sanctioning someone because you disagree with what they said, that\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d",
      "In April, Shapiro\u2019s official residence was firebombed after a man broke into the executive mansion in the early-morning hours as Shapiro and his family were asleep, just hours after they gathered for a Passover seder. The man used Molotov cocktails to set fire to two rooms inside the residence. Police said the man charged with committing the attack, Cody Balmer, would have attacked the governor had he found him inside the residence. Balmer himself dialed 911 soon after the fire and said he was angered by Shapiro\u2019s stance on the war in Gaza, though his social media postings did not place him neatly into the left-or-right political spectrum.",
      "\u201cNot only was my safety threatened, but my wife, her children, and members of our extended family were all at risk,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cI thank God every day we were able to evacuate safely, that no one was physically injured or worse yet killed, that all the staff who worked at the residence, the brave police and firefighters and first responders who ran toward danger were OK. But understand it doesn\u2019t mean that the attack hasn\u2019t left emotional scars.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can attest to that, especially as a father, father to four children, knowing that my life choices put them at risk,\u201d he continued. \u201cViolence in all forms is unacceptable. Political violence is particularly dangerous. Not only does it seek to injure, maim or kill. It seeks to intimidate and terrorize and silence. I\u2019m here today to tell you that I will not be deterred in my work on behalf of the good people of Pennsylvania, and I sure as heck will not be silenced.\u201d",
      "Shapiro had to handle the aftermath of the attempt on President Donald Trump\u2019s life last summer in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a would-be assassin shot the then-candidate in the ear at a rally and shot two others in attendance, killing one person. Shapiro also spoke in his state after Luigi Mangione, the man charged with killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City in December, was captured in Altoona, Pennsylvania. At the time, Shapiro said praise for Mangione online was \u201cdeeply disturbing.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut unfortunately, political violence and the hate that fuels it has become far too common in our society,\u201d Shapiro said in his address, noting the aforementioned violence. \u201cDifferent places, different people, different perspectives. One common thread, people using violence to settle political differences.\u201d",
      "In his interview with NBC News, Shapiro spoke at length on Mangione, saying no matter what someone thinks of the health care system, killing an executive was unacceptable.",
      "\u201cMangione is not some hero, by the way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real hero is the woman in Altoona at that McDonald\u2019s who called the police and made sure Mangione got arrested. We can\u2019t celebrate these people that are taking lives in the name of trying to make some sort of political point or try and make progress. We need to reform our institutions so they work again to solve problems like a broken health care system, but violence is never the answer for being able to effectuate change in our communities.\u201d",
      "A YouGov survey published last week found that 87% of U.S. adults believe political violence is a problem. But the same poll showed larger numbers of younger and more liberal respondents saying that they thought violence can sometimes be justified in order to achieve political goals, though 72% of U.S. adults overall said violence was never justified. (Some academic research has cast doubt on whether public opinion research is accurately capturing support for political violence.)",
      "In his speech, Shapiro said the deeper issue at the heart of the rise of political violence is that too many people feel alienated from U.S. institutions.",
      "\u201cThey feel alone, ignored, shut out by a government that isn\u2019t working for them,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cThis is particularly true of younger Americans. They feel unseen. They feel unheard. They feel unheard in the halls of government. They feel unheard in our elections, in the media, in our nonprofits, our businesses and within the law. Frustrated by a lack of progress and consumed by this feeling of hopelessness, they find refuge often in the dark corners of the Internet where righteous frustration is taken advantage of and used to foment hate.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt leads to a belief among some that the only way they can address their problems is through violence,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey find online those who glorify violence and urge it on. What starts with cowardly keystrokes, too often, ends up with a trigger being pulled in our communities. That is dangerous for our democracy, and we need to turn the tide.\u201d",

      "Consumers report feeling increasingly glum about the economy. Still, data suggests there has been no significant slowdown in their spending habits.",
      "The conflicting trends have made for an increasingly difficult landscape for the Federal Reserve to navigate as it meets Tuesday and Wednesday to decide where to set its key interest rate. Investors say a rate cut is virtually guaranteed amid signs of a weakening labor market.",
      "There are also concerns about what is driving consumer spending. In an interview on CNBC this month, McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski referred to a \u201ctwo-tier economy,\u201d in which upper-income groups spend largely free of financial constraints, while middle- and lower-income households feel squeezed.",
      "The stock market continues to set records, thanks mainly to optimism for returns on big investments in artificial intelligence. Stock holdings are disproportionately concentrated among the more well-off and give them greater financial flexibility. According to data from Moody\u2019s Analytics, the top 10% of household wealth holders now account for about 50% of all spending in the economy.",
      "\u201cThe economy can move forward simply with folks in the top continuing to buy, even if the ones in the middle and lower are struggling, simply because so much spending is done by the well-to-do,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cBut it can\u2019t flourish.\u201d",
      "The question is what happens after the Fed\u2019s rate announcement, including whether it will cut rates at its October and December meetings. The central bank\u2019s benchmark interest rate is used to set other borrowing rates throughout the economy. To determine where to set it, the Fed looks at inflation and unemployment rates.",
      "Right now, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge remains above its 2% target, but it has shown some signs of stability even as it has ticked up. The unemployment rate has been creeping up, too. At 4.3%, it is now at its highest point since October 2021.",
      "In part because of concerns about the inflationary impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, the Fed has left its key interest rate unchanged since December, before Trump returned to office. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday that import prices were up 0.3% in August, an increase from July and evidence that foreign exporters are not eating much tariff costs.",
      "But last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated policymakers were more open to cutting the rate, which he said was at a \u201crestrictive\u201d level, meaning it may be holding back economic activity.",
      "Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica financial services group, said, \u201cLower interest rates will help the economy stabilize into the turn of the year.\u201d",
      "Recent labor reports have shown that just 22,000 jobs were added in August \u2014 far below forecasts \u2014 and the official hiring rate remains stuck at levels last seen in 2013. It now takes about 10 weeks at the median for someone out of a job to find a new one, with the share taking at least six months now making up 26% of all unemployed workers. According to the New York Federal Reserve, workers say there is just a 44.9% probability they would find other jobs if they lost their current ones, the lowest in the survey\u2019s history.",
      "The lackluster jobs market is making consumers feel increasingly concerned about their financial prospects, according to sentiment surveys. The University of Michigan said Friday that its consumer-sentiment gauge deteriorated in early September to a level only slightly above pandemic-era lows, while the Conference Board research group\u2019s consumer-confidence survey reported rising worries about jobs and income.",
      "Cheaper money, but at what cost?",
      "Lowering interest rates would help reduce the cost of interest payments on regular purchases like auto loans and credit cards, which should help increase overall economic activity and ultimately boost employment as businesses are able to borrow money for less.",
      "Trump and others have argued a lower Fed rate would help boost the housing market by making it more affordable to own a home. The Fed\u2019s rate does not directly influence mortgage rates, which instead tend to move in tandem with the rate on the 10-year Treasury note.",
      "Right now, the 10-year rate is near its lowest point of Trump\u2019s second term as investors have dialed back inflation expectations. As a result, mortgage rates are also falling, and at 6.35% they are at their lowest level since April.",
      "A lower Fed rate would help make it cheaper for homebuilders to borrow money, which would directly help lower overall housing costs somewhat.",
      "There is a chance that lowering rates too much, or too quickly, risks causing inflation to surge \u2014 especially as inflation lingers and people keep spending.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balancing act,\u201d said Adams, of Comerica.",
      "Many financial groups continue to report that spending is largely holding up. According to data from Bank of America, spending per household rose 0.4% month-over-month in August \u2014 the third increase in a row.",
      "On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported retail sales for August climbed 0.6%, well ahead of estimates for a 0.2% increase.",
      "\u201cThe consumer at this point appears to be exactly where we were, resilient, doing well, in a good position,\u201d Alastair Borthwick, chief financial officer at Bank of America, said at a conference last week.",
      "What about the job market?",
      "Economists are also keeping an eye on how many new jobs must be created in the economy each month to satisfy demand for goods and services from businesses and consumers. This is also called the \u201cbreakeven rate.\u201d",
      "Because of Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigration, along with an aging population, some analysts say the breakeven rate is rapidly trending downward and may even be close to zero. It is the main reason lower monthly jobs growth has not translated into a rapidly increasing unemployment rate.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, people who want to work are working,\u201d said Jed Kolko, an economist who served in the Biden administration. Most jobs data suggests the economy \u201cis providing jobs for people who want them \u2014 but it\u2019s not overheating,\u201d he said.",
      "At the same time, qualified workers \u201care just harder to come by,\u201d said Holly Wade, executive director of the National Federation of Independent Businesses\u2019 Research Center.",
      "Small businesses, especially those in skilled-trade industries like manufacturing and construction, have continually cited challenges with labor quality as their top concern, according to the NFIB. Many businesses have been forced to leave roles unfilled, even as they have also beefed up training courses, since many immigrant workers caught up in Trump\u2019s crackdown have skilled-trade experience.",
      "College graduates now account for an increasing share of the long-term unemployed population, suggesting the need for knowledge and administrative work may be declining. That has created concerns that artificial intelligence is eliminating certain jobs \u2014 though there remains debate about how significant the technology\u2019s impact is.",
      "There is also evidence that Trump\u2019s federal job cuts have disproportionately affected college-educated workers.",
      "Many of those workers may be further along in their careers while also handling child care and elder care responsibilities, which make it more difficult for them to take on roles in sectors with more open positions, said Kira Khazatsky, president and CEO of JVS Boston, a job placement and workforce development agency.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t flip a switch and say, \u2018We\u2019re going to train these people because they\u2019re standing by and waiting to be trained,\u2019\u201d she said."

    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 21:21:15 GMT",
    "summary": "In interviews, Tesla drivers who use FSD said they experienced problems with the technology at rail crossings.",
    "story": [
      "Italo Frigoli was trying out the Full Self-Driving software of his Tesla one evening in June when he came upon a railroad crossing. The arms were descending and lights were flashing as a train barreled toward the intersection.",
      "For most human drivers, the gate arms and lights are clear signals to stop, but for Frigoli\u2019s Tesla, which was driving in a semiautonomous mode, the potentially deadly situation didn\u2019t seem to register.",
      "\u201cIt felt like it was going to run through the arms,\u201d he said. \u201cSo obviously I just slammed on the brakes.\u201d He stopped just a few feet from the crossing near his home in North Texas, barely avoiding disaster.",
      "Video from the car\u2019s cameras, reviewed by NBC News, appears to support his account. And this month, when NBC News accompanied him to the same railroad crossing, his Tesla software had the same problem. While cameras were rolling, his Tesla\u2019s software failed to detect an oncoming train, forcing Frigoli to manually brake.",
      "Frigoli avoided the potential crashes, but his experiences highlight a recurring complaint among some Tesla drivers about the company\u2019s self-driving technology: The software sometimes mishandles railroad crossings, including by failing to stop for them.",
      "Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software is an add-on package of driver-assistance features that the company touts as \u201cthe future of transport,\u201d capable of navigating \u201calmost anywhere with your active supervision.\u201d",
      "In interviews, six Tesla drivers who use FSD said they experienced problems with the technology at rail crossings, and four of them provided videos. NBC News also found seven other Tesla driving videos posted online showing similar mishaps dating back to June 2023 through August. Those drivers declined to be interviewed.",
      "The complaints are even more widespread on Tesla internet forums, where drivers describe similar mishaps without usually posting videos. NBC News found 40 examples on Reddit, X and YouTube since 2023, including posts as recent as August.",
      "Regulators with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) told NBC News in a statement that they had raised the issue with Tesla.",
      "\u201cWe are aware of the incidents and have been in communication with the manufacturer,\u201d the agency said.",
      "\u201cNHTSA discusses issues frequently with manufacturers and prioritizes the safety of all road users,\u201d the statement went on. \u201cThe agency continuously analyzes consumer complaints to determine whether a potential vehicle safety defect trend exists. We will continue to enforce the law on all manufacturers of motor vehicles and equipment, in accordance with the Vehicle Safety Act and our data-driven, risk-based investigative process.\u201d",
      "Musk has said autonomous technology is crucial to Tesla\u2019s future, and he has bet the company\u2019s future on the success of self-driving cars and artificial intelligence-powered robots. Tesla robotaxis are on the road in Austin, Texas, and planned for other cities. In July, Musk said that an unsupervised version of FSD \u2014 one that doesn\u2019t require monitoring by a human driver \u2014 could be available this year \u201cin certain geographies\u201d and that his goal is to have Tesla robotaxis available to half the U.S. population by the end of the year.",
      "But questions remain about the technology the company is using to guide its vehicles. Experts said that Tesla\u2019s FSD software is a black-box AI model in which errors can\u2019t be easily explained even by its creators and that Tesla engineers most likely hadn\u2019t included enough railroad crossing examples in the videos they used to train the FSD software.",
      "Tesla and Musk didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on the railroad crossing complaints. Musk doesn\u2019t appear to have spoken about the complaints, but he has said Tesla is planning a major update to the FSD software as soon as late September.",
      "Drivers described a range of malfunctions. Frigoli and other drivers said their vehicles didn\u2019t recognize flashing lights or lowering gate arms. Some said their Teslas haven\u2019t slowed down even when there are trains in front of them. Other drivers said their cars have stopped on top of railroad tracks when there are red lights ahead, which could pose a danger if the arms come down before the lights turn green. In one video posted online, a Tesla initially stops at a crossing, but then, after the gate arms begin to lower, a set of traffic lights farther down the road turns green and the car tries to proceed through the arms seconds before a train arrives. Still other drivers reported that their cars turned onto the tracks themselves.",
      "Experts warn that Tesla and Musk are courting disaster.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s having trouble stopping at rail crossings, it\u2019s an accident waiting to happen,\u201d said Phil Koopman, an associate professor emeritus of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of which driver gets caught at the wrong time,\u201d he said.",
      "Tesla FSD doesn\u2019t mishandle every railroad crossing every time, and some drivers have posted videos online to celebrate successful instances. But an error can lead to catastrophic effects. One of the six drivers who spoke to NBC News said his vehicle handled a rail crossing appropriately in August after it failed to do so earlier this year; he said the more recent experience led him to think Tesla may have resolved the problem, but experts said there\u2019s no way to be sure.",
      "In June, a Tesla in FSD mode drove itself onto a set of train tracks in eastern Pennsylvania and was hit minutes later by a Norfolk Southern freight train, according to local authorities who spoke with the driver. That driver was lucky: The train struck only a glancing blow to the car\u2019s side, and the driver and his passengers had exited the car before the crash."

      "Barbra Streisand has shared an emotional tribute to late Hollywood legend Robert Redford, who she famously co-starred with in the classic romantic drama \"The Way We Were\" (1973).",
      "Streisand, 83, posted a black-and-white image on Instagram of her and Redford, who died Sept. 16 at his Utah home at age 89. In her caption, she called him \u201cone of the finest actors ever.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery day on the set of \u2018The Way We Were\u2019 was exciting, intense and pure joy. We were such opposites: he was from the world of horses; I was allergic to them! Yet, we kept trying to find out more about each other, just like the characters in the movie,\u201d she recalled.",
      "Streisand went on to describe Redford as \u201ccharismatic, intelligent, intense, always interesting \u2014 and one of the finest actors ever.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last time I saw him, when he came to lunch, we discussed art and decided to send each other our first drawings,\u201d she wrote, adding, \u201cHe was one of a kind and I\u2019m so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him.\u201d",
      "In Streisand\u2019s 2023 memoir, \u201cMy Name is Barbra,\u201d she detailed how she persuaded Redford to take on the role of Hubbell, the star-crossed lover of her character, Katie, after he initially declined it.",
      "Streisand wrote that she wanted Redford for the role because he was a \u201crare combination\u2026 an intellectual cowboy\u2026 a charismatic star who is also one of the finest actors of his generation,\u201d according to an excerpt from the book published by Vanity Fair.",
      "Redford turned down the role, she wrote, because he felt the character of Hubbell was \u201cshallow and one-dimensional.\u201c His refusal prompted Streisand to urge director Sydney Pollack to \u201cgive him whatever he wants.\u201d",
      "Pollack brought in two new writers who breathed life into the Hubbell character, infusing his \u201cgolden-boy exterior\u201d with inner depth.",
      "\u201cThe negotiations went down to the wire,\u201d Streisand recalled in her memoir. \u201cI was in the middle of filming \u2018Up the Sandbox\u2019 in Africa, and one day I got a telegram from (Hollywood agent) Sue Mengers that simply said: \u2018Barbra Redford!\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when I knew he\u2019d finally said yes\u2026 and I was so thrilled! The courtship had been tough, but Bob\u2019s reluctance had a big influence on the script and ultimately resulted in a richer, more interesting character,\u201d wrote Streisand.",
      "\u201cThe Way We Were\u201d went on to become a box-office success. It was also nominated for six Academy Awards, winning two, including one for best song for Streisand\u2019s rendition of the theme song \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201d",
      "Streisand and Redford reunited publicly several times over the years, including in 2002 when Streisand presented Redford with the Honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement.",
      "\"He's always interesting. He's always interested. He's very smart. Very private. He's self-assured but shy, and I adored working with him,\" Streisand said during her speech.",
      "In 2015, she lauded Redford again when she presented him with the Film Society of Lincoln Center\u2019s Chaplin Award.",
      "\u201cYou never quite know what he\u2019s really thinking, and that makes him fascinating to watch on screen,\u201d Streisand said during the ceremony, according to Entertainment Weekly. \u201cBob understands the power of restraint. You\u2019re never going to get it all, and that\u2019s the secret, I think. That\u2019s the mystery. That\u2019s what makes you want to keep looking at him.\u201d",
      "For his part, Redford also had fond memories of working with Streisand on \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember the fun we had,\u201d he recalled when he and Streisand sat for a 2010 joint interview with Oprah Winfrey. \u201cI remember liking her energy and her spirit; it was wonderful to play off of. I also really enjoyed kidding her. She was fun to kid.\u201d"

    "summary": "Actress Melissa Joan Hart talks about how she is shifting her parenting strategies with her three sons.",
    "story": [
      "When it comes to raising kids, actress Melissa Joan Hart wishes she would have done one thing sooner: leaning in to \"natural consequences.\"",
      "\"I'm very much about natural consequences now, and I feel like I kind of missed the boat a little bit on my older kids,\" she tells TODAY.com. Hart, who starred as the title characters in \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" and \"Clarissa Explains it All,\" is raising three boys with her husband, musician Mark Wilkerson: Mason, 19, Braydon, 16, and Tucker, 12.",
      "\"We saved them in a lot of cases, especially when it comes to school,\" she says. \"And that's detrimental to their development when they don't have to problem-solve or troubleshoot.\"",
      "Natural consequences as a parenting strategy means that parents let kids experience real-world accountability for their actions, rather than swooping in to solve their problems. So if your child forgets their soccer cleats, for example, you let them figure it out \u2014 and maybe they don't get to play in the game or they get in trouble with the coach \u2014 rather than \"saving\" them by bringing their cleats to school.",
      "Rather than taking charge of school projects as she might have done with older sons Mason and Braydon, Hart says she tries to be less of a leader and more of a helper with Tucker's sixth grade homework.",
      "The actress is spilling secrets as part of Pop Secret\u2019s \u201cSpill Everything\u201d campaign that encourages people to share their popcorn-worthy confessions. Hart, who is the \u201cChief of Butter\u201d for the campaign, lets another secret fly: She loves popcorn so much that she insisted on a year\u2019s supply before agreeing to the role.",
      "Popcorn may be consistent, but parenting attitudes can change, and Hart certainly seems to be shifting her view on handling situations with her sons. \"I let them get away with stuff, or helped them through stuff, when they probably need to figure it out themselves,\u201d she says.",
      "It can be hard for parents to allow kids to experience natural consequences.",
      "\"You kind of give up on it,\" she acknowledges. \"They're your personal baby, so of course you want to forgive them and move on and let them go to that football game. We should normalize saying, 'My kids can't sleep over because they're being grounded.'\"",
      "Like many parents, Hart struggles with finding the appropriate consequences for her kids' actions. \"As they get older, they get smarter and wiser and more crafty,\" she says, groaning that when she turned off the wifi as a consequence, they found a way to turn it right back on without her knowledge.",
      "Hart also stops to poke fun at herself, because as she touted the benefits of natural consequences, she was waiting at the pharmacy to pick up a prescription for her 19-year-old son that he could have retrieved himself.",
      "\"But he had work and I didn't want him to leave work, so ... \" she says with a laugh."

      "\"High Potential\" isn\u2019t your typical crime drama.",
      "Kaitlin Olson (\"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\") plays a brilliant single mom of three whose photographic memory catapults her from a job as a cleaner to one as the LAPD's secret weapon.",
      "In the first season, Morgan Gillroy juggled motherhood and solving cases that stumped seasoned detectives. She also uncovered secrets about one of her ex-husbands, who disappeared 15 years ago.",
      "As fans prepare for Season 2's premiere on Sept. 16, here\u2019s what you need to remember from last season.",
      "What Happened to Morgan's Ex-Husband, Roman?",
      "At the heart of the series is Morgan\u2019s first ex-husband, Roman, who vanished 15 years ago during a late-night trip to buy diapers.",
      "For years, Morgan feared the worst \u2014 that Roman was dead. Her eldest daughter, Ava, believed Roman had abandoned them. Over the course of Season 1, the mystery surrounding Roman\u2019s disappearance continued to shape Morgan\u2019s personality and Ava\u2019s resentment.",
      "The season finale brought a breakthrough: Detective Karadec (Daniel Sunjata) discovered Roman\u2019s whereabouts, confirming he is alive. This sets the stage for emotional reunions and potentially explosive confrontations in Season 2, as the truth behind Roman\u2019s long absence remains unclear.",
      "Morgan re-married and had two children with her second husband, Ludo Radovic (Taran Killam) \u2014 though they've also split.",
      "Ava\u2019s Perspective on Her Dad Changed",
      "Ava (Amirah J.) grew up without her father and, for years, assumed Roman had abandoned the family.",
      "Her perspective began to shift after overhearing a conversation between Morgan and Selena (Judy Reyes), her mother\u2019s boss: Roman\u2019s car had been found shortly after his disappearance, impounded with a pack of diapers inside; a clue that he likely didn\u2019t leave voluntarily. The revelation brought Ava to tears.",
      "In Episode 9, Morgan asked Ava if she had taken some of Roman\u2019s belongings while going through his things, telling her she shouldn\u2019t have to sneak around. Ava confessed she had overheard the earlier conversation about the diapers, signaling that she no longer believed her father had abandoned them.",
      "By the season finale, Episode 13, Ava had created photo albums and artwork for Roman, preparing to catch him up on everything he had missed if he ever returns. Her emotional preparation highlights her longing and hope for reconciliation, and the mother-daughter dynamic promises to remain central in Season 2.",
      "A Love Triangle Brewed Between Morgan, Karadec and Tom",
      "Season 1 teased a slow-burn romance between Morgan and Detective Adam Karadec, as well as Morgan\u2019s growing connection with Tom (JD Pardo), a former janitor-turned-nurse. Tom becomes Morgan\u2019s romantic interest due to their shared down-to-earth nature and witty banter, offering a contrast to Karadec\u2019s intensity.",
      "At the season-ending police gala, Karadec\u2019s feelings for Morgan were clear, though she remained unaware. Awestruck by her appearance, he called her stunning before becoming flustered. During a slow dance, he expressed concern about Morgan meeting Gio, a dangerous man linked to Roman\u2019s case, and offered to go in her place. Calling her \u201cpartner\u201d and asking her to trust him, Karadec\u2019s willingness to risk danger marked a turning point in their relationship, and Morgan\u2019s acceptance showed deep trust after 15 years of grief.",
      "Their intimate moment was cut short when Tom, attending the gala as Morgan\u2019s date, interrupted the dance, teasing a love triangle in the making.",
      "A New Villain Enters the Scene",
      "Season 1 ended on a chilling note with the introduction of a new, and still unnamed, villain referred to as the \"gamer\" (David Giuntoli).",
      "Unlike Morgan\u2019s usual cases, this adversary targeted her personally, leaving cryptic messages and forcing detectives to solve elaborate puzzles.",
      "In the finale, the gamer confronted Morgan at a grocery store, declaring, \u201cYou\u2019re the one, Morgan. We shall play again, me and you.\u201d",
      "His obsession with childhood games, coded messages, and psychological manipulation sets up a serialized storyline with darker and more personal stakes for Season 2."

      "The same month, the two Oscar winners appeared together at the premiere of \u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d at the Venice Film Festival. While speaking to reporters, Fonda opened up about her decades-long attraction to Redford.",
      "\u201cIn 'Barefoot in the Park,' I couldn\u2019t keep my hands off of him,\u201d she said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cI was constantly forcing myself on him. In 'Our Souls at Night,' the dynamic of my character to his character was somewhat similar. I just love the fact that these films bookend our careers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe played that young love just getting married (in 'Barefoot') and now we play old people love and old people sex,\u201d Fonda continued, joking, \u201cAlthough, in my opinion, (director Batra) Ritesh cut the sex scene too soon.\u201d",
      "\u201cI live for sex scenes!\u201d Fonda added. \"He\u2019s a great kisser. It was fun to kiss him in my 20s and then to kiss him again in my almost-80s.\u201d"

      "The Academy Award-nominated actor (he did win an Oscar, but it was for directing \u201cOrdinary People\u201d) appeared in a wide range of thoughtful and entertaining films, covering a wide swath of subject matter, showcasing an ability to keep moviegoers enthralled while also making them think.",
      "Here are some of Redford\u2019s most notable movies:",
      "'Barefoot in the Park' (1967)",
      "Redford had previously appeared in the stage production of \u201cBarefoot in the Park\u201d and had already gained traction on the big screen when he starred in the film adaptation of the Neil Simon play, about newlyweds with different personalities who move into a five-flight walkup apartment. It marked one of multiple collaborations with Jane Fonda, who played his wife in the movie.",
      "'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' (1969)",
      "Redford played the Sundance Kid. Paul Newman was Butch Cassidy. Together, these two icons made movie history in one of the defining Westerns in cinema history. The beloved film won four Oscars.",
      "'The Candidate' (1972)",
      "In this Oscar-winning effort, Redford played an idealistic candidate running for Senate with no realistic shot of winning who hits the campaign trail. His idealism is put to the test as he gains steam in the polls.",
      "'The Way We Were' (1973)",
      "There are tearjerkers and then there\u2019s \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201d Redford and Barbra Streisand play a couple whose love cannot overcome their ideological and political differences. Streisand earned an Oscar nomination for her role in the movie, which marked Redford\u2019s third collaboration with director Sydney Pollack. The movie also won a pair of Oscars for Marvin Hamlisch\u2019s music.",
      "'The Sting' (1973)",
      "A winner of seven Academy Awards, including best picture, Redford and Newman teamed up again in this classic that was helmed by George Roy Hill, who also directed them in \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d This time, Redford and Newman play con men working on grifting a mob boss. Redford netted his lone acting Oscar nomination for \u201cThe Sting,\u201d while Hill won best director for the movie.",
      "'All the President\u2019s Men' (1976)",
      "Watergate was still very much fresh in the country\u2019s mind when this drama about how the scandal was covered by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward (Redford) and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) came out. The film, which continued a run of Academy Award-winning and -nominated movies featuring Redford, collected four Oscars.",
      "'Ordinary People' (1980)",
      "Redford stepped behind the camera to direct this heartbreaking drama about an upper-class family coping with the death of a son and the subsequent suicide attempt of another.",
      "'The Natural' (1984)",
      "Baseball movies were hardly in vogue when Redford emerged for his first film role since 1980\u2019s \u201cBrubaker\u201d in this drama, about an older baseball player who gets a second chance with a sad sack major league team. The film received four Oscar nominations.",
      "'Out of Africa' (1985)",
      "Redford and Meryl Streep made movie magic in this drama about a plantation owner (Streep) who has a torrid romance with a hunter (Redford). The movie won seven Academy Awards, including best picture and best director for Pollack."

      "Part of Ronson's teenage years and his early 20s was defined by his obsession with music and DJing, as well as the partying and nightlife that came with it.",
      "Ronson, now a father of two, tells TODAY.com he wants his children to read his book one day, even though it does show what he was really doing as a teen.",
      "\"I realize I wrote a lot about the things that I did and maybe the behavior that was not so great, that I feel like one of them is going to throw it back in my face when they're 15,\" Ronson says. \"'Dad, you were doing all of that \u2014 you're way worse than us!' But I do. I wouldn't want anything in my life that I wasn't comfortable telling them about.\"",
      "Ronson married Grace Gummer, the daughter of Meryl Streep and Don Gummer, in 2021, and the couple welcomed their first child in 2023 and their second daughter earlier this year.",
      "\"Night People: How to Be a DJ in '90s New York City\" published on Sept. 16, and recounts how Ronson became part of the hip-hop DJ scene in Manhattan.",

      "One of those guests? Robin Williams, Ronson wrote in his book and also shared on TODAY on Sept. 15.",
      "\u201cSo my earliest childhood memory, are all of the night,\u201d he said on TODAY. \u201cMy parents, they liked to go to the club too. And one night, my mom brought Robin Williams back from the club, and I\u2019m sure she probably said, \u2018You got to come into my son\u2019s room. He loves \"Mork & Mindy,\" that\u2019s his favorite show.'",
      "\u201cAnd I remember just waking up and Robin Williams is over my bed, and he was leaving,\u201d he continued. \u201cI was like, \u2018Mr. Williams, you forgot!\u2019 He was like, \u2018Nanu, nanu.\u2019 ... He knew what I wanted to hear, it was so sweet.\u201d",
      "While Ronson loved being part of the DJ scene, he quickly replies \"no\" to a question about whether the 1990s were the best years of his life.",
      "\"I think the past few years \u2014 having two young girls, my wife and family \u2014 this has been the best part,\" he tells TODAY.com. \"But it was certainly the most exciting, and it was this exciting era. It was the last era of its kind in New York, and, obviously, when you're in it ... you don't realize, 'This isn't going to be here forever.'\"",
      "Ronson says he decided to revisit that time in his life due to nostalgia for the music from the time, and what his life was like.",
      "\"I love the music from that era, the '90s and early 2000s \u2014 it was a time in my life where I was so excited. You know, you're 18, 19, finding your passion and your craft,\" he says. \"And then, to be honest, a lot of my friends in that era were passing, so I wanted to find a way to remember them and this amazing little scene that we made.\"",
      "The book ends before Ronson's producing career took off in the late 2000s, producing hits like Winehouse's \"Rehab\" and her cover of the Zutons' \"Valerie.\" He's since gone on to produce songs like \"Perfect Illusion\" by Lady Gaga, \"Uptown Funk\" with Bruno Mars and \"Electricity\" with Dua Lipa and Diplo.",
      "Ronson says he thinks he would do another book about that era of his life, but he wants to take a break after \"Night People.\"",
      "\"I mean, this took me so long, took so much out of me that I would need to take a little bit of space and get back to making music for a while,\" he says. \"But I would love to, at some point, make something about the people I worked with.\"",
      "Ronson says there isn't anyone he's \"dying to work with,\" but he would work with some of the artists he's worked with in the past \"in a heartbeat.\"",
      "\"I mean, I love all of them. I would do a song with any of those people again. You know, sometimes there's this thing where you have this moment where you capture a little magic, and then to try and go back in and you're trying to chase something that you did,\" Ronson says. \"But, I mean, there's people like Bruno and Miley \u2014 I would go in a heartbeat.\"",
      "For now, Ronson says he's working with \"Barbie\" director Greta Gerwig again on the music for her new Netflix film. (Netflix did not respond to a request for comment on if Ronson was referring to Gerwig's new film adaptation of C.S. Lewis' \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" series.)",
      "And Ronson couldn't leave TODAY without giving a shoutout to beloved weatherman Al Roker.",
      "\"I have a memory of the '90s. I feel like I saw you out on the dance floor. Like, it probably wasn't often, but I know that there was a night I was like, 'Holy crap \u2014 that's Al Roker,'\" Ronson said during his show appearance.",

      "Fatherhood was a rewarding challenge for Redford. He told People in 1998, \"The hardest thing in the world is when your children have problems. There have been so many hits on our family that no one knows about, and I don\u2019t want them to, for my family\u2019s sake.\"",

She attended the University of Colorado Boulder, where her boyfriend, journalism student Sid Wells, was  murdered in his off-campus apartment in 1983. More than four decades later, the case remains unsolved. In 1984, the following year, Shauna survived a serious car accident near Salt Lake City, Utah, when her car plunged into a river; wearing a seatbelt, she sustained only minor injuries.",

      "\u201cI am able to talk to my dad in a way a lot of people can\u2019t,\" Amy told the New York Times in 2008. \"He still drives me nuts, he\u2019s still my dad, but I have to say, in light of what his universe was, he had his eye on the ball in terms of having kids, and part of that was being raised in Manhattan.\u201d",

Considered one of the best Westerns of all time, it was the highest-grossing film of the year and was selected in 2003 for inclusion in the National Film Registry.",
      "\u201cThe combination of (my and Newman\u2019s) friendship, and the weirdness of that song \u2014 I think you put all that together and there was just something indelible about it,\u201d Redford told The Salt Lake Tribune in 2019, referring to the hit song \u201cRaindrops Keep Fallin\u2019 on My Head\u201d that appeared in the movie.",
      "In 1972, he starred in \u201cThe Candidate,\u201d kicking off a run in which he was a box office force.",
      "Redford next appeared with Barbra Streisand in \u201cThe Way We Were,\u201d considered by many to be one of the most romantic movies ever, focusing on a couple with different beliefs who fall in love.",
      "Redford followed that up with \u201cThe Sting\u201d \u2014 which netted him his lone Oscar nomination for best actor and reunited him with Newman \u2014 \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d \u201cThe Great Waldo Pepper,\u201d \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d and \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men.\u201d All of those films, with the exception of \u201cThe Great Waldo Pepper,\u201d were nominated for Oscars.",
      "\u201cThe Sting\u201d won seven Academy Awards, including best picture, while \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d teamed Redford up with Dustin Hoffman to tell the story of Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\u2019s uncovering of the Watergate scandal. That film won four Oscars and was nominated for four more.",
      "Redford\u2019s hot streak didn\u2019t end there, though. He again co-starred with Fonda in 1979\u2019s \u201cThe Electric Horseman.\u201d The 1980s continued his growth as an artist and entertainer, beginning with him portraying a prison warden in 1980\u2019s \u201cBrubaker.\u201d",
      "Redford took a break from the big screen for a few years before returning in 1984\u2019s \u201cThe Natural,\u201d playing a mysterious middle-aged baseball player who joins a hapless team and propels them into the pennant race.",
      "A year later, he starred in \u201cOut of Africa,\u201d which won seven Academy Awards. He would also star in \u201cHavana,\u201d \u201cSneakers\u201d and \u201cIndecent Proposal,\u201d as a billionaire whose offer to spend the night with a married woman tests the mettle of her marriage.",
      "Redford would also join the superhero universe, starring as Alexander Pierce in \u201cCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\u201d and \u201cAvengers: Endgame.\u201d",
      "Redford\u2019s penchant for thoughtful films was not limited to his work as an actor, either. His first directorial effort was 1980's \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d about a family coping with the loss of a child. That movie won him the Oscar for best director, while the drama also won best picture and two other Academy Awards.",
      "\u201cI never dreamed in a million years that it would have the result that it did. I kind of thought it would be buried,\u201d he told Entertainment Weekly in 2016.",
      "Redford struck gold again with 1994\u2019s \u201cQuiz Show,\u201d about the game show scandal of the 1950s. He earned another Oscar nomination for best director, while the movie was nominated for three other Academy Awards, including best picture.",
      "Redford also directed \u201cThe Legend of Bagger Vance\u201d and helped put stars on the map, helming a young Scarlett Johansson in \u201cThe Horse Whisperer\u201d and Brad Pitt in \u201cA River Runs Through It,\u201d one of the movies that signaled the arrival of the young actor. Redford and Pitt would later appear on camera together in 2001\u2019s \u201cSpy Game.\u201d",
      "Redford, who told TODAY in 2015 he didn\u2019t watch his own movies, announced his retirement from acting in 2018. He is also credited with founding the Sundance Film Festival in 1984, which is one of the first and premier independent film festivals in the world.",
      "\u201cIt was a big idea with a small smart,\u201d he told \u201cDemocracy Now\u201d in 2015.",
      "\u201cIt started as just a hope. Then, when it became a reality, it started to have its own momentum,\u201d he added.",
      "Redford was married twice. He was married to Lola Van Wagenen in 1958, but they later divorced. They had four children, two of whom died. In 2009, he married Sibylle Szaggars, whom he was still with at the time of his death."

      "Happily for the president, he will see a lot of King Charles III and little of everyday Britons in a two-day trip where he\u2019ll make history as the first elected leader to receive not one but two state visits courtesy of the royal family.",
      "Looming over Trump\u2019s arrival in Europe is the war playing out on the east end of the continent. Hostilities between Russia and Ukraine took an escalatory turn last week when Russian drones entered Poland\u2019s airspace and were shot down.",
      "The incident renewed fears that Russian President Vladimir Putin may widen the conflict and threaten other European democracies unless he is stopped. As the war grinds on, Trump\u2019s effort to make peace has stalled, giving rise to complaints among some diplomats and members of Congress that he is not putting enough pressure on Putin to halt the attacks.",
      "The war figures to come up when Trump meets privately on Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers, his official country residence outside London. There, the two leaders will view the archives of former Prime Minister Winston Churchill.",
      "The symbolism is unmistakable. Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt forged an invaluable friendship as they joined to fight Nazi Germany in World War II. Russia was part of the troika that defeated Adolf Hitler.",
      "Now, the West faces threats from a Russian dictatorial regime, and Europe again is beseeching the U.S. president to come to its aid.",
      "Whether Trump is on board seems to depend on the day. He has sent mixed signals about responsibility for the war, which began in 2022 when Russia sent tanks and troops rolling into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rallied his country and prevented a quick rout. In a post on his social media site Saturday, Trump wrote that the war is not his. Rather, he wrote, \u201cit is [former President Joe] Biden\u2019s and Zelenskyy\u2019s war.\u201d He did not mention Putin.",
      "But speaking to reporters the following day, he cast Russia as the \u201caggressor.\u201d",
      "Trump said over the weekend that he is prepared to slap \"major\" sanctions on Russia, but first wants all 32 nations in the NATO military alliance to stop buying Russian oil.",
      "\u201cI hope that the leaders who meet Trump these days behind closed doors are very frank about it,\u201d Marko Mihkelson, who chairs the foreign affairs committee in Estonia\u2019s Parliament, said in an interview. \u201cIf Mr. Trump thinks that this is not his war or that he can run away and that Ukraine is somehow a faraway country, that would be an epic mistake.\u201d",
      "First, though, comes the pomp. World leaders have long used flattery in attempting to win favor with Trump. In this instance, Starmer hand-delivered an invitation from King Charles during a meeting in the Oval Office in February. Trump\u2019s last state visit, in 2019, was a \u201ctremendous success,\u201d gushed Starmer, who is relying on Trump to stand up for Ukraine and prevent further Russian aggression.",
      "\u201cEvery time the European Union tries to push against Trump, they\u2019ve gone to incredible efforts to butter him up,\" said Michael Bociurkiw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank. He mentioned that Mark Rutte, secretary-general of the NATO military alliance, called Trump \"Daddy\u201d at a summit in June and how European leaders praised Trump during a visit to the White House in August to discuss the war, likening them to a \u201ccheerleading squad meeting with the football coach.\u201d",

      "\"I'm not surprised that they [the British] are going to do it, and because of our cultural and historical connections, they can do it like virtually no other country in the world,\" he continued.",
      "A group called the \u201cStop Trump Coalition\u201d is staging a protest during the president's visit, but he isn\u2019t likely to see it. He\u2019ll be an overnight guest of the king and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle on Wednesday and will join the royal couple for a carriage procession inside the private estate. By contrast, when French President Emmanuel Macron visited earlier this year, his carriage ride took him through the town of Windsor."

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian children have been taken to over 200 different facilities across Russia, including locations where they have been subjected to forced \u201cre-education\u201d and military training in a clear violation of international law, according to new research.",
      "Eight different types of facilities, ranging from summer camps to religious sites to military academies stretching across the entire expanse of Russia, have been identified in the report from the Yale School of Public Health Humanitarian Research Lab published Tuesday.",
      "The study was initiated at Ukraine\u2019s request to better understand the full size of the network of facilities where children are held, to help them eventually return to their homeland, Nathaniel Raymond, the executive director of the research lab, said in a telephone interview Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that all the people involved in different ways to bring the kids back have the most accurate geospatial information possible, and this is it,\u201d he said.",
      "Using open-source intelligence, news reports and Russian government documents, as well as satellite imagery, the Yale report identified 210 different locations where children are taken. Some are brought to locations temporarily, while others are given Russian citizenship and coerced into forced adoption, the report says.",
      "At most sites, children go through \u201cre-education\u201d programs to enforce Russian patriotism, including lectures in Russian history and singing the national anthem, it adds.",
      "Others, particularly older children, have received military training at cadet academies and a military base, including \u201cdrone control and tactics training,\u201d and have participated in shooting and grenade-throwing competitions, according to the report.",
      "The researchers said they cannot verify if any of the children given military training were ever conscripted into the Russian military or were otherwise deployed in the war in Ukraine.",
      "Russia\u2019s children\u2019s rights commissioner, Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, and the country\u2019s foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s official \u201cBring Kids Back\u201d program, which partners the government with other countries and international organizations to return kids from Russia, has recorded nearly 20,000 cases of unlawful deportations and forced transfers of children.",
      "The new report does not estimate the number of children who have been held either temporarily or indefinitely in Russia. But Raymond said identifying the locations gives a better sense of the scale, comparing it to the carnival game of trying to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar.",
      "\u201cRight now, with this report, we volumetrically know as much as we\u2019re probably going to know how big the jar is, and the jar is gigantic,\u201d he said.",
      "The report builds on research that has helped support allegations of war crimes against Russian President Vladimir Putin issued by the International Criminal Court, which has issued an arrest warrant accusing him of overseeing the forced abductions and deportations. The ICC has also accused Lvova-Belova of committing similar crimes.",
      "The Kremlin has previously denied the allegations and said the warrants were \u201coutrageous.\u201d",
      "Ukraine has made the return of abducted children central to any talks with Russia to end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy raised the issue with President Donald Trump during a meeting at the White House last month, days after Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska.",
      "Last week, Zelenskyy announced plans to hold a \u201chigh-level event\u201d on abducted children during the meeting of the U.N. General Assembly later this month.",
      "The research was hampered after State Department funding for the Conflict Observatory program, which Yale was part of, was cut by executive order by Trump. It has not been restored. All of the data would have been lost, but a contractor working on the project in Florida protectively kept a backup, according to Raymond.",
      "The lab\u2019s repository of data has been transferred to Europol, a European law enforcement agency.",
      "The researchers have also stopped directly sharing their findings with the ICC after the Trump administration-imposed sanctions on the court in February.",
      "Previously, Raymond said, the lab had cooperated with the ICC on investigations of allegations of war crimes committed in Ukraine on the basis of an agreement put in place during the Biden administration.",
      "Now, he said, researchers are operating under the assumption that the previous agreement is no longer valid. \u201cWe no longer believe that it is safe for us to attempt to share information with them, given the lack of clarity legally from the Trump administration,\u201d he said.",
      "However, a new bipartisan push in the Senate is underway to label Russia a state sponsor of terrorism unless it returns Ukrainian children taken during the war. Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; and Katie Britt, R-Ala., introduced a bill last week threatening to add both Russia and Belarus to the list, which currently includes only Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria."

      "LONDON \u2014 Prince Harry has said his tell-all memoir was \u201cnot about revenge,\u201d defending his decision to go public with royal disputes as he worked to mend ties with his family \u2014 and the British public.",
      "Harry also signaled a desire to see more of his father, King Charles III, after their first meeting in almost two years. The brief tea was a step toward reconciliation after Harry\u2019s 2023 memoir, \u201cSpare,\u201d revealed new details about the royal family\u2019s bitter internal feud, including claims that his brother, Prince William, physically attacked him.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe that I aired my dirty laundry in public,\u201d Harry told The Guardian newspaper in an interview published Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt was a difficult message, but I did it in the best way possible. My conscience is clear,\u201d Harry said during a trip to Ukraine after several days in the U.K. that included his sit-down with the king.",
      "Harry visited the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, with a team from his Invictus Games Foundation following an invitation from the Ukrainian government.",
      "\u201cIt is not about revenge, it is about accountability,\u201d Harry added of his book. \u201cYou cannot have reconciliation before you have truth.\u201d",
      "Harry, the Duke of Sussex, who turned 41 on Monday, described the book as \u201ca series of corrections to stories already out there.\u201d",
      "His relationship with his family has long been strained, but it became publicly fractious after he and his wife, Meghan Markle, quit front-line royal duties in 2020 and moved to California to launch a mix of media projects and charitable work.",
      "Last week, Harry met Charles for a private tea at the king\u2019s residence \u2014 the first time the pair had seen each other in 19 months. Details of the meeting remain quiet, but Harry suggested he wants, and needs, to see his father more often.",
      "Over the coming year, he said, \u201cthe focus really has to be on my dad.\u201d",
      "Charles was diagnosed with cancer in February 2024 and has kept many of the details private.",
      "Harry added that his trip to the U.K. had brought him closer to the idea of spending more time there \u2014 and even one day bringing his children, despite unresolved disputes over his security arrangements.",
      "\u201cThis week has definitely brought that closer,\u201d he said.",
      "Just 33% of Brits have positive opinions of Harry, according to a recent poll, making him one of the least popular prominent royals, ahead of only his wife, at 21%, and Prince Andrew, at 9%.",
      "After Harry stepped down from royal duties, his U.K. protection was downgraded from full-time cover to case by case. He lost an appeal in court to overturn that decision this year.",
      "In May, he told the BBC that his father would not speak to him \u201cbecause of this security stuff,\u201d but he said that he was eager to reconcile with the royal family and that \u201cthere\u2019s no point in continuing to fight people.\u201d",
      "Relations with his brother, the heir to the throne, do not appear to have improved. The pair have not met since February 2024."

      "The North Korean government has intensified repression inside the isolated, nuclear-armed state, expanding electronic surveillance and publicly executing people for sharing foreign media, the United Nations said in a major new report.",
      "\u201cNo other population is under such restrictions in today\u2019s world,\u201d said the report, which was released Friday by the U.N. Human Rights Office.",
      "The 16-page report examined the state of human rights in North Korea since 2014 and came to grim conclusions, describing a totalitarian state that under leader Kim Jong Un has effectively cut off its population of about 26 million from the rest of the world.",
      "\u201cToday, the death penalty is more widely allowed by law and implemented in practice,\u201d the U.N. said in a statement on the report, which was based on interviews with 314 victims and witnesses who have left the country since 2014.",
      "The North Korean diplomatic mission in Geneva and its embassy in London did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment outside of business hours.",
      "Aided by advances in technology, surveillance of the population has become even more pervasive in North Korea, a communist state where all media is controlled by the government and there are no independent civil society organizations.",
      "The report said every person is also required to participate in weekly self-criticism sessions that are \u201cprimarily aimed at collective surveillance and indoctrination.\u201d",
      "\u201cEnjoyment of freedom of expression and access to information have significantly regressed, with the implementation of severe new punishments, including the death penalty, for a range of acts including the sharing of foreign media\u201d such as popular South Korean dramas, the U.N. said.",
      "Crackdowns on access to foreign information are believed to have intensified starting in 2018 and become even harsher since 2020, the U.N. said, and the government has held public trials and executions \u201cto instill fear in the population and as a deterrent.\u201d",
      "A government task force has increasingly carried out inspections of computers, radios and televisions and house searches without advance notice or warrants, citing the need to curb \u201canti-socialist\u201d behavior and protect national security, the report said.",
      "One escapee told researchers that the tightened surveillance was intended \u201cto block the people\u2019s eyes and ears.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a form of control aimed at eliminating even the smallest signs of dissatisfaction or complaint,\u201d the person said.",
      "The public has almost no access to the internet, the report said, adding that the government operates \u201ca tightly controlled national intranet\u201d that is used mainly by research institutions and government officials.",
      "According to the U.N. report, new laws \u201ccriminalize access to unauthorized foreign information and prohibit the consumption or dissemination of information (through, for example, publications, music and movies) from \u2018hostile\u2019 nations and the use of linguistic expressions that do not conform with prescribed socialist ideology and culture.\u201d",
      "The laws, which provide for severe punishments up to and including the death penalty, \u201craise serious concerns\u201d about restrictions on the right to free expression, the report said.",
      "It said reports suggest that North Koreans continue to consume prohibited information despite the growing risks."
