      "Rival studios on Sunday estimated that the Netflix film, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d led all films in the box office this weekend with $16-18 million in ticket sales",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Netflix appears to have its first No. 1 box-office title in the streaming company\u2019s 18-year history thanks to the sensation of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "Rival studios on Sunday estimated \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d led all films over the weekend with $16-18 million in ticket sales. Distribution executives from three studios shared their estimates for the Netflix phenomenon on condition of anonymity because the streaming company has a policy of not reporting ticket sales.",
      "Following a dominating few weeks as one of the most popular Netflix releases ever, the streamer put the film into 1,750 theaters for sing-along screenings Saturday and Sunday. Studios are able to accurately estimate ticket sales for all releases on Sunday morning, though the uncommon nature of the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d releases means a wider variance. Some estimates were as high as $20 million.",
      "It amounted to a victory lap for \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d arguably the biggest hit of Hollywood\u2019s summer, and an ironic success for Netflix, whose emphasis on streaming, not theatrical release, upended the movie industry. Another sore spot for Hollywood: The film was developed and produced by Sony Pictures, which sold it to Netflix.",
      "Not all exhibitors went along. AMC, the largest theater chain in North America, declined to show the movie. But that didn\u2019t stop Netflix from claiming the box-office title its more traditional competitors typically own.",
      "David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm FranchiseRe, called it \u201ca completely unique two-day musical event.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt may turn out to be higher,\u201d said Gross. \u201cTheater owners are quick on their feet and can add capacity according to demand.\u201d",
      "The theatrical release, though limited, is out of the ordinary for the streaming giant, which has long stressed a commitment to subscriber releases. The movie debuted on the platform in late June and is currently Netflix's most-watched animated original film.",
      "The film centers on Huntr/x, a KPop superstar trio who double as demon hunters. The members, Rumi (Arden Cho), Mira (May Hong) and Zooey (Ji-young Yoo), must protect their fans and face their biggest enemy yet: a rival boy band made up of demons in disguise.",
      "Zach Cregger's horror hit \u201cWeapons\u201d maintained strength in the box office during its third weekend, bringing in $15.6 million domestically. The buzzy horror movie has proved its staying power, raking in over $100 million globally since its release.",
      "Disney's \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d landed behind the horror movie once again, earning $9.2 million in North American theaters.",
      "The two films are \u201creal bright spots\u201d as the box office heads into a \u201crather quiet finish\u201d for the summer, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore. Both films, which premiered simultaneously earlier this month, had a minimal 36% drop from last weekend.",
      "\u201cI think we have to look at the currency of the goodwill generated by people having these great summer moviegoing experiences,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cWe have to look at that as a more important metric than just the bottom-line dollars and cents.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\" earned $5.9 million domestically during its fifth weekend. The movie enjoyed a strong $118 million debut but has experienced a steady decline.",
      "Newcomer \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!\u201d opened in 1,317 North American theaters with a weekend gross estimate of $3 million, in line with expectations. The movie made it to the top 10, right above \u201cThe Naked Gun.\"",

      "Actor Jerry Adler has died at 96",
      "NEW YORK -- Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \u201cpassed peacefully in his sleep,\u201d Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a creature of nepotism,\u201d Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \u201cI got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\u201d",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \u201cSanta Barbara.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \u201cThe Public Eye\u201d and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \u201cchills\u201d when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \u201cNorthern Exposure\u201d paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d",

      "Films included Woody Allen's \u201cManhattan Murder Mystery,\u201d but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \u201cRescue Me,\u201d \u201cMad About You,\u201d \u201cTransparent\u201d and guest spots on shows ranging from \u201cThe West Wing\u201d to \u201cBroad City.\u201d",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \u201cTaller Than a Dwarf\u201d in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \u201cFish in the Dark.\u201d",
      "\u201cI do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\u201d Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\u201d",
      "Adler published a memoir, \u201cToo Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\u201d last year. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \u201ctoo goofy-looking\u201d to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m immortal,\u201d he said.",

      "This Coen brothers joint, co-starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, premiered out of competition at the 60th Venice Film Festival, alongside titles like \u201cMatchstick Men,\u201d \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Mexico\u201d and \u201cThe Dreamers.\u201d Clooney\u2019s nearby Italian residence was already as famous as him, and a stakeout spot for amateur and professional paparazzi.",
      "In a profile that fall, while shooting \u201cOcean\u2019s Twelve,\u201d Vanity Fair writer Ned Zeman observed: \u201cThat an affable, self-effacing Kentucky-born Hollywood actor is fast becoming the most popular public figure in Italy says a little about Italy and a lot about Clooney, who isn\u2019t Italian, doesn\u2019t speak Italian, and lives here only in summertime.\u201d",
      "Clooney\u2019s acclaimed black-and-white dramatization of journalist Edward R. Murrow\u2019s clash with Joseph McCarthy began its successful run in competition at the 62nd Venice Film Festival. Though it lost the Golden Lion to Ang Lee\u2019s \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d it did go on to pick up six Oscar nominations including for Clooney\u2019s directing.",
      "During the trip, he also inspired a cocktail still served at the ritzy Belmond Hotel Cipriani on Giudecca. One night he retreated to the hotel\u2019s Gabbiano Bar where his friend, the legendary bar manager Walter Bolzonella, mixed him a drink of lemon, sugar, vodka, cranberry juice, ginger and Angostura bitters and named it Buona Notte in honor of the film. The two would later name a prosecco, passionfruit and elderflower cocktail La Nina after Clooney\u2019s mother, which was served at his wedding.",

      "Daniel Dae Kim is known for roles in spy thrillers and sci-fi epics but he still hopes to play a romantic lead",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- After three decades in Hollywood, Daniel Dae Kim has done spy thrillers, sci-fi epics and medical dramas. But there\u2019s one role that\u2019s eluded the Korean American actor: romantic leading man. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting to play a romantic lead after all these years,\u201d Kim says with a laugh.",
      "His latest project, \u201cButterfly,\u201d which features a star-studded cast including top Korean actors Kim Tae-hee and Park Hae-soo (\u201cSquid Game\u201d), follows a former U.S. intelligence operative in South Korea whose past catches up with him. It premiered on Amazon Prime in the U.S. and elsewhere earlier this month, but makes its Korean debut Friday.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press in Seoul, South Korea, Kim revealed one of his biggest regrets, reflected on cultural lessons from the Korea-U.S. co-production, and opened up about what it\u2019s really like being the bridge between two cultures while pursuing his mission to tell stories \u201cthat haven\u2019t been told yet.\u201d The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "KIM: As an EP, I\u2019m a job creator. I am a person responsible for a lot of people, and I will fight so much harder for others than I often fight for myself. When I feel like one of the cast, or one of the crew, or one of the writers is not being taken care of, I\u2019m not afraid to talk to anybody and have a hard conversation.",
      "KIM: Every day, there was something that needed to be translated literally through language but also working styles. In Korea, because it\u2019s a more Confucian society, the hierarchy of departments is very clear. We had to learn to talk to the head of the department who would then talk to the staff, as opposed to if you have an issue with one of the staff, you go directly to the staff. This kind of thing was new to the Americans.",
      "KIM: I think in 2007 I got a DUI when I was working on \u201cLost,\u201d and I regret that night every day of my life. At the time, I felt so much shame, so much guilt, so much regret. I felt terrible to my parents, because that\u2019s not the way I think they wanted me to be raised. I think with the right perspective, these things, these mistakes that you made can actually be helpful for your life because they can guide you in certain ways.",
      "KIM: We\u2019re already seeing it. If you look at what happened with Paramount and CBS News, we\u2019re seeing a chilling effect on free speech and journalism and DEI. \u201cDEI\u201d is a bad word these days, but to me, DEI\u2019s not a fad. The idea of inclusion is not something that\u2019s a political trend. It\u2019s my life. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve lived every decade I\u2019ve been in this business.",

      "KIM: I got so much criticism when I did \u201cLost\u201d that I had to learn how to not take it so personally because it hurt a lot at the time. When I came to Korea when I was 18, cab drivers would give me such a hard time because I couldn\u2019t speak fluent Korean. And they were like, \u201cYou\u2019re Korean, your face is Korean, why don\u2019t you speak Korean?\u201d They had never thought about an immigrant experience from another country. But now Korea is so used to that kind of thing that people are much more understanding.",
      "KIM: I have a lot of sympathy for actors who take stereotypical roles when they\u2019re starting out because you need some way to break into the business. It\u2019s much easier once you\u2019re more successful and more established because you have more financial stability. It\u2019s something that, if you\u2019re not a person of color, or someone who\u2019s a minority in the United States, you don\u2019t have to think about. You don\u2019t think about what this role means for the rest of a nation or an ethnicity. You just do what you\u2019re drawn to, and that\u2019s very liberating. I am lucky enough now where I can also make those same choices. But I don\u2019t ever escape the fact that whatever I do will be watched and seen by so many people and judged through their own lens and filters.",

I\u2019ve never gotten the opportunity and it\u2019s one of those interesting things because I look the way I do as an Asian American and Asian men were never considered handsome or sexy. That\u2019s changing now though. I\u2019m friends with Jimmy O. Yang and, a few years ago, he got to play a romantic lead in a rom-com.

      "Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98",
      "WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said.",
      "Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. \u201cPolitics Today\u201d began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001.",
      "Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation.",
      "Through his long career, Witcover had a remarkable front seat to history, some of it tragic. He watched Robert F. Kennedy steady first lady Jackie at President John F. Kennedy's grave in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, he pushed his way through a crowded hotel kitchen in Los Angeles after hearing shots and saw Robert F. Kennedy bleeding on the floor. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book \u201c85 Days.\u201d",
      "Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as \u201cfriendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains\u201d who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse\u2019s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, \u201cBoys on the Bus.\u201d",
      "When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, \u201cwe often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. But sometimes, too, one of us would take the bullet for the other when it unjustly came our way. That was the nature of playing duet pianos in the house of ill repute called political writing,\u201d Witcover wrote in The Sun after Germond\u2019s death in 2013.",
      "At its peak, the syndicated column ran five times a week and appeared in about 140 newspapers.",
      "In his final years as a columnist, Witcover relentlessly hammered President George W. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it \u201cthe most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.\u201d But he did not blame that view for The Sun\u2019s dropping his column. Editorially, the newspaper also opposed the war, although less vigorously.",
      "\u201cThe war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,\u201d he wrote for the Poynter Institute\u2019s blog.",

      "A classmate on his high school basketball team persuaded him to apply to Columbia, which he attended for a semester before joining the Navy. He then re-enrolled in the college after the war ended and obtained a master's degree at Columbia's graduate school of journalism.",
      "Years later, he told a reporter that he thought his ship had come in when a newspaper in the Boston area offered him a starting job covering the Boston Braves in spring training. Before he could get started the team decided to move its franchise to Milwaukee and the opportunity died.",
      "By 1962, 11 years after graduation, he had become a senior correspondent and the chief political writer for the Newhouse News Service.",
      "Witcover lived in Washington with his second wife, Marion Elizabeth Rodgers, a biographer of the journalist H.L. Mencken. His first marriage, of nearly four decades, to Marian Laverty, ended in divorce.",
      "\"Jules was the hardest working newsman I ever knew,\" said Walter Mears, who as the chief political writer for The Associated Press traveled extensively with Witcover. \"On the road, you could hear him banging the typewriter before dawn, working on one of his books. He never stopped writing columns and political histories long after most of us had retired.\"",

      "Fandom is a funny thing in the age of social media. Spend enough time scrolling and it\u2019s easy to feel like you really know a celebrity, and all their friends. The new film \u201cLurker,\u201d a Sundance breakout in theaters Friday, explores the question of what might happen if a certain type of fan got a foot in the door, and what they might do to stay there.",
      "Archie Madekwe\u2019s Oliver hardly knows what\u2019s coming when he walks into a trendy Los Angeles clothing shop. A rising music star, Oliver seems already accustomed to a certain amount of attention wherever he goes, with asks for selfies and autographs just part of the deal. So of course he\u2019s taken aback when one of the employees, Th\u00e9odore Pellerin\u2019s Matthew, doesn\u2019t seem to know or care who he is. Oliver doesn\u2019t see that it\u2019s an act and is soon asking this stranger to come around and hang with his entourage.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning Matthew thinks Oliver has this god-given place of celebrity and success,\u201d Pellerin said. \u201cHe quickly understands that he will have to give things to serve a certain purpose in Oliver\u2019s world and his ego. But also that they\u2019re not dissimilar. They\u2019re both playing by a certain rule book that is written by Oliver. If the power becomes Matthew\u2019s, he can also write the rules.\u201d",
      "The film is the directorial debut of Alex Russell, whose own star is rising. He wrote \u201cForks,\u201d widely considered one of the best episodes of \u201cThe Bear,\u201d and won an Emmy for co-executive producing the Netflix series \u201cBeef.\u201d His script for \u201cLurker,\u201d which he wrote sort of as a challenge for himself during COVID lockdowns, immediately became a hot commodity. Madekwe remembers being bummed when he didn\u2019t hear back after he put himself on tape to play the hanger-on.",
      "A few years later, Madekwe\u2019s agent called and said Russell wanted to meet him. Not for Matthew, but for Oliver.",
      "\u201cI had to completely rethink the film and the structure and the what it was about,\u201d Madekwe said. \u201cBut it was most daunting to imagine myself needing to go and meet Alex and convince him that I could play somebody like this cool character.\u201d",
      "He needn\u2019t have been so worried. Unbeknownst to Madekwe, Russell had been doing some stealth behind-the-scenes work. After someone recommended his name, Russell saw Madekwe in a coffee shop one day and just watched him for 20 minutes. His conclusion: This is Oliver.",
      "Russell was cognizant of the limitations he was faced with as a first-time director making an independent film, where things like casting and hiring are often rushed.",
      "\u201cMy goal was to get what I felt like were underrated actors,\u201d Russell said. \u201cPeople who could come in and really hit it out of the park. Then people would look at this movie and be like wow they really took a step up here. That\u2019s kind of where you can punch above your weight if you\u2019re making your first movie and don\u2019t have a huge budget.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t just his leads either, but the full ensemble including Sunny Suljic, Havana Rose Liu, Zack Fox and Daniel Zolghadri \u2014 faces you might recognize, but names you might not yet know. Putting it together was hard work, with strict limits on budget and time, but Russell said the experience of \u201cLurker\u201d was charmed nonetheless.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s only because I got so lucky with decisions I made early on with casting and hiring,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much of it is like I\u2019m just a kid with a screenplay and everyone else has to be really good at their job.\u201d",

      "It'll surely carry weight in modern society, but the phrase is referencing events from nearly a century ago. Based on a true story, \u201cEden\u201d retraces what happened when a group of Europeans attempted to start anew on the remote island of Floreana, only to encounter the earthly failings they hoped to escape: chaos, blackmail, betrayal and even murder.",

      "1920s Germany, haunted after accepting blame for World War I, was on the brink of demise, as mass poverty and broad social unrest laid ground for the extremism that birthed the Nazi party.",
      "\u201cEden\u201d shows us none of that, instead dropping us on a small island of the Gal\u00e1pagos, where Dr. Friedrich Ritter ( Jude Law ) and his loyal partner, Dore Strauch Ritter ( Vanessa Kirby ) found solace after fleeing their native country. The idealist doctor is inspired by a newfound purpose of penning radical philosophy that will \u201csave humanity from itself.\u201d",
      "Yet the historical resonance, which could have provided pointed commentary on the parallels between today and the 1920s, falls flat amid the film\u2019s overlong runtime, unlikable characters and shaky accents that most actors stumble in and out of. In the midst of the film\u2019s crafted chaos, the story inevitably loses focus. Still, \u201cEden\u201d made room for some memorable performances.",

      "The film lacks depth in exploring questions of morality and human nature while depicting Ritter\u2019s lofty goals to save humanity.

      "Prosecutors said in papers filed shortly before midnight Wednesday that Combs masterminded elaborate sexual events for two ex-girlfriends between 2008 and last year that involved hiring male sex workers who sometimes were required to cross multiple state lines to participate.",
      "A jury in July exonerated the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that carried the potential penalty of a mandatory 15 years in prison up to life behind bars. But it convicted him of two lesser Mann Act charges that prohibit interstate commerce related to prostitution.",
      "The Mann Act charges each carry a potential penalty of 10 years behind bars. Combs has been denied bail despite his lawyers' arguments that their client should face little to no additional jail time for the convictions. Prosecutors said he must serve multiple years behind bars.",

      "\u201cEvidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt on the Mann Act counts was overwhelming,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "They noted that the multiday, drug-fueled sexual marathons that Combs demanded of his girlfriends involved hiring male sex workers and facilitating their travel across multiple states for what became known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",

She said she participated in hundreds of \u201cfreak-offs.\u201d",
      "A woman who testified under the pseudonym \u201cJane\u201d said she participated in \u201chotel nights\u201d when she dated Combs from 2021 to last September and that the events sometimes lasted multiple days and required her to have sex with male sex workers, even when she was not well.",

      "On \u201cBig Money,\u201d Super Bowl-sized singer Jon Batiste opts for a surprisingly intimate sound.",
      "The just over 32-minute, nine-song set will be released Friday, and it\u2019s not nearly as loud as the New Orleans' jazzman's eye-popping wardrobe. The stripped-down, mostly acoustic arrangements create a chill vibe. Simplicity somehow only intensifies the songs\u2019 swing and sway.",
      "Batiste pairs lyrics about devotion, values, angels and ecology with music that mixes folk and funk, gospel and the blues. The range is such that Batiste even plays a little fiddle and mandolin, but he shines brightest on two songs featuring his solo piano.",
      "The first is a wonderful duet with Randy Newman, another piano man with New Orleans roots, who in recent years has been slowed by health issues and kept a low profile. They cover Doc Pomus\u2019 \u201cLonely Avenue,\u201d and Newman\u2019s legendarily froggy tenor provides a comical contrast to Batiste\u2019s vocal sheen. \u201cI could die, I could die, I could die,\u201d Newman sings. \u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m dying.\u201d",
      "Also stellar is \u201cMaybe,\u201d a ballad filled with thick chords and questions about the big picture. \u201cOr maybe we should all just take a collective pause,\u201d Batiste sings, before launching into a keyboard exploration worthy of Jelly Roll Morton.",

      "Like in their 2020 comedy \u201cThe Climb,\u201d Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin's \u201cSplitsville\u201d is full of first sharp turns in relationship roller coasters that unfold in clattering one-take set pieces mixed with nakedly frank heart-to-hearts",
      "You can say this: Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin know how to start a movie.",
      "Their 2020 breakout film, \u201cThe Climb,\u201d begins with two best friends on a bike ride just before Kyle (Marvin) is to be wed. Mid-climb, Mike (Covino) confesses he slept with the bride-to-be. In one long take, an argument on two wheels ensues, with huffing and puffing in between.",
      "Their new follow-up to that film, \u201cSplitsville,\u201d likewise kicks off with heartbreak on the open road. This time, Carey (Marvin), a gym teacher, is driving along a highway with his life coach wife, Ashley (Adria Arjona). They seem happy enough, though there are hints of trouble. When Ashley says she wants to have new experiences, Carey suggests pottery. Ashley corrects him: \u201cI meant sexual.\u201d",
      "When an erratic driver careens off the road, they run to check on the passengers. Finding the woman thrown clear of the car, Ashley \u2014 faced with her own mortality \u2014 decides then and there to get a divorce.",
      "In both \u201cThe Climb\u201d and \u201cSplitsville,\u201d these are just the first sharp turns in relationship roller coasters that unfold in clattering one-take set pieces mixed with nakedly frank heart-to-hearts. Their movies \u2014 Covino directs; they write together \u2014 are a little like Wile E. Coyote versions of a rom-com. And part of their considerable appeal is in how much Marvin and Covino are willing to put themselves through the ringer.",
      "Like \u201cThe Climb,\u201d \u201cSplitsville\u201d is a relationship farce that keeps amplifying and recycling. From the scene of the accident, as the credits unspool, Carey trudges seemingly aimless across the countryside. (Splitsville is Nowheresville.) Eventually, though, he arrives at the handsome lakeside home of his childhood best friend, Paul (Covino), who lives there with his wife Julie (Dakota Johnson) and young son Russ (Simon Webster).",
      "Paul and Carey have a close enough relationship that Paul comes right into the shower to check for ticks on Carey. Later that night, he and Julie casually acknowledge that they have an open marriage. Julie, for instance, could sleep with anyone. Even Carey, they note.",

From there, the four central characters of the film \u2014 Carey, Paul, Julie and Ashley \u2014 will take various turns in less of a romantic triangle than an adult game of musical chairs.",
      "Though there are elaborately choreographed long takes that smack of contemporary moviemaking, \u201cSplitsville\u201d belongs more to a screwball tradition stretching back to the 1930s. This is \u2014 even here in the low ebb of late summer \u2014 an uncommonly adult farce of infidelity that Cary Grant and Irene Dunne might have chuckled at, even if they didn\u2019t get the \u201cVanilla Sky\u201d reference, the digs about New Balance sneakers or the delight of seeing Nicholas Braun turn up, late in the film, as a mentalist.",
      "I\u2019m convinced, though, that the performer here who would have been most at home in that bygone comedy heyday is Johnson. For the second time this year, following \u201cMateralists,\u201d she finds herself caught between the affections of two men. Here, just her watchful poise brings a welcome perspective on the mostly male mayhem around her.",
      "The twists and turns of \u201cSplitsville\u201d can grow a little tiresome. Reversals pile on top of each other. But in a movie about infidelity where everyone is lying more to themselves than to their partners, those patterns effectively lead back to where everyone started.",

Air Canada saw its passenger numbers fall by 33% in June compared to the same time a year ago, while WestJet had a 31% drop. The low-cost carrier Flair reported a whopping 62% decline.",
      "Travel agents in Canada said there's been a significant downturn in clients wanting to visit the U.S. overall, and Las Vegas in particular.

      "The type and extent of disciplinary actions were not spelled out, and board member Matt Heilala, an Anchorage podiatrist who was helping write the proposed regulations, declined to discuss the details Thursday with The Associated Press ahead of the meeting.",

      "Heilala declined to discuss the specific language stemming from that directive that the board would consider Friday but told the AP that the proposed rules would go through a deliberate and transparent process for the public. Such processes can take months, he said.",
      "Gender-affirming care includes a range of medical and mental health services to support a person\u2019s gender identity, including when it\u2019s different from the sex they were assigned at birth. It encompasses counseling, medications that block puberty and hormone therapy to produce physical changes as well as surgeries to transform chests and genitals, though those are rare for minors.",

      "Variations of such cases are commonly reported by Ugandan health workers who witness stillbirths or feverish babies that die within days from undiagnosed malaria. The deaths are part of a wider death toll tied to the mosquito-borne disease, the deadliest across Africa, but one easily treated in adults who seek timely medical care.",
      "Until recently, a major gap in malaria treatment was how to care for newborns and infants infected with malaria who weren\u2019t strong enough to receive regular medication. That changed last month when Swiss medical regulators approved medicine from the Basel-based pharmaceutical company Novartis for babies weighing between 2 and 5 kilograms (nearly 4\u00bd to 11 pounds).",

      "The drug approved by Swiss authorities, known as Coartem Baby in some countries and Riamet Baby in others, is a combination of two antimalarials. It is a lower dose version of a tablet previously approved for other age groups, including for older children.

      "TALATAN, China -- Chinese government officials last month showed off what they say will be the world's largest solar farm when completed high on a Tibetan plateau. It will cover 610 square kilometers (235 square miles), which is the size of Chicago.",
      "China has been installing solar panels far faster than anywhere else in the world, and the investment is starting to pay off. A study released Thursday found that the country's carbon emissions edged down 1% in the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier, extending a trend that began in March 2024.",
      "The good news is China's carbon emissions may have peaked well ahead of a government target of doing so before 2030. But China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will need to bring them down much more sharply to play its part in slowing global climate change.",
      "For China to reach its declared goal of carbon neutrality by 2060, emissions would need to fall 3% on average over the next 35 years, said Lauri Myllyvirta, the Finland-based author of the study and lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.",
      "\u201cChina needs to get to that 3% territory as soon as possible,\u201d he said.",
      "China's emissions have fallen before during economic slowdowns. What's different this time is electricity demand is growing \u2014 up 3.7% in the first half of this year \u2014 but the increase in power from solar, wind and nuclear has easily outpaced that, according to Myllyvirta, who analyzes the most recent data in a study published on the U.K.-based Carbon Brief website.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking really for the first time about a structural declining trend in China\u2019s emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "China installed 212 gigawatts of solar capacity in the first six months of the year, more than America's entire capacity of 178 gigawatts as of the end of 2024, the study said. Electricity from solar has overtaken hydropower in China and is poised to surpass wind this year to become the country's largest source of clean energy. Some 51 gigawatts of wind power was added from January to June.",
      "Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, described the plateauing of China's carbon emissions as a turning point in the effort to combat climate change.",
      "\u201cThis is a moment of global significance, offering a rare glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak climate landscape,\u201d he wrote in an email response. It also shows that a country can cut emissions while still growing economically, he said.",
      "But Li cautioned that China's heavy reliance on coal remains a serious threat to progress on climate and said the economy needs to shift to less resource-intensive sectors. \u201cThere's still a long road ahead,\u201d he said.",

      "Shortly after the Russian announcement, Zelenskyy said \u201cour people are coming home.\" He said that those being exchanged included members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the National Guard, the State Border Guard Service and civilians. \u201cMost of them had been in captivity since 2022,\u201d he said.",
      "Zelenskyy did not confirm the number of prisoners involved in the exchange.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A trial opened Monday for a man accused of murdering five people in Wellington, New Zealand, by deliberately setting fire to a boarding house that was nearly full when the blaze swept through the building.",
      "The 50-year-old man, whose name was suppressed for the duration of the trial at the High Court in Wellington, has pleaded not guilty to murder and arson charges for allegedly starting the May 2023 fire that killed five men at Loafers Lodge, a 92-bed hostel.",
      "His lawyers have indicated they will rely on an insanity defense, which would mean he was incapable of understanding what he was doing or that it was wrong when he allegedly lit two fires in the multistorey boarding house. The defense team will not make a case until later in the trial, which is expected to run for five weeks.",
      "Prosecutor Stephanie Bishop rejected the case for an insanity defense during opening arguments Monday. She said the defendant lived in the building for a week but did not want to stay there and lit the fires in an attempt to seek a transfer to other accommodation.",
      "Bishop told the jury that the accused knew the potential consequences of his actions, New Zealand news outlets reported. The prosecutor said the man set a couch ablaze late in the evening, prompting an evacuation of the building.",
      "After residents put out the fire, the man returned and placed cushions and a blanket in a cupboard before setting them alight, Bishop said, adding that the man left the building without raising the alarm or calling emergency services.",
      "Some of the boarding house residents included social services clients and older, disabled and otherwise vulnerable people, as well as nurses working at a nearby hospital. The burned-out building remains standing in the district of Newtown, near the central city of New Zealand\u2019s capital.",

      "Thousands of people will paint a town red with tomato pulp Wednesday, flinging the fruit at one another in the 80th anniversary of Spain\u2019s famous \u201cTomatina\u201d tomato street fight.",
      "The hourlong event brings 120 tons of overripe tomatoes to the eastern town of Bu\u00f1ol, where tarp-covered buildings flank a crowd of up to 22,000 participants awaiting their ammo. Non-local attendees pay 15 euros ($17.50) for a ticket and arrive from countries across the globe or cities a bus ride away.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s going on, it\u2019s just a blur of tomatoes,\u201d said Adrian Columb of Ireland, who attended in 1999. \u201cIt was a blast.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the \u201cTomatina\u201d festival:",
      "Held on the last Wednesday of August, the event was inspired by a food fight between local children who pelted each other with tomatoes in 1945.",
      "After becoming a yearly tradition, \u201cTomatina\u201d was briefly banned in the 1950s by Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, a decision locals protested. Televised media attention in the 1980s turned the festival into a national event, eventually drawing an international crowd.",
      "In 2002, Spain officially recognized the festival as an international tourism attraction. Since then, the event has only been suspended twice, in 2020 and 2021, because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "The tomatoes thrown aren\u2019t from crops treated like those used for food. That\u2019s because they\u2019re grown exclusively for the festival, said Bu\u00f1ol Deputy Mayor Sergio Galarza.",
      "\u201cIf \u2018Tomatina\u2019 didn\u2019t exist, these tomatoes wouldn\u2019t be cultivated because there wouldn\u2019t be a need for them,\u201d Galarza said.",
      "This year\u2019s supply hails from Don Benito, a town over 5 hours away.",
      "There are no teams, no points and no referees, but there is a guideline: To avoid injuries, participants are encouraged to squash the tomatoes before hurling them (and of course, refrain from hurling anything else).",

      "\u201cYou finish exhausted,\u201d said Galarza, who grew up going to the festival before becoming its chief councilor. \u201cYour arms are worn out, everything is worn out from moving and launching it all.\u201d",

Three to four hours later, the streets are sometimes left cleaner than before.",
      "Similar tomato-flinging festivals have taken place in Florida, London, Amsterdam, the Colombian town of Sutamarch\u00e1n and, most recently, Hyderabad, India.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Oleksandr Donii was one of the leaders of student-led protests for sovereignty and political reform in 1990 that preceded Ukraine\u2019s declaration of independence. He remembers thinking the fight for autonomy would take decades.",
      "Instead, it came much sooner than he ever imagined. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Ukraine quickly declared independence in 1991 and later conducted a referendum backed by more than 90% of voters.",
      "\u201dI was preparing myself for prisons and labor camps, and I thought the struggle would last about 20\u201330 years,\u201d Donii told The Associated Press.",
      "As the country marks 34 years since that monumental event Sunday, Donii and others from Ukraine\u2019s first generation of lawmakers and activists describe how despite separation from the Soviet Union, Moscow's grip endured. Russia used political pressure, social division and the sidelining of pro-Western voices. That eventually paved the way for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine three decades later and Ukraine\u2019s current fight for independence and identity in the face of its aggressive neighbor.",
      "Back in 1990, Donii and other student leaders of a hunger strike were calling not only for breaking away from Moscow but also for renewing the political system at home.",
      "Their first proposal was to conduct snap elections for Ukraine\u2019s Parliament, which Donii saw as essential for clearing out the Soviet-era lawmakers still in office. The idea, however, failed to gain broad support even among pro-independence forces.",
      "\u201cUkraine, having won independence, did not win the removal of the Communist ruling class,\u201d he said.",
      "In his view, opportunities that were within reach in the early 1990s slipped away, leaving Ukraine to pay a high price today as it presses toward the European Union and NATO not as distant aspirations but as urgent necessities for safeguarding sovereignty and securing an independent path.",
      "Oleksandr Nechyporenko, a lawmaker from the first Ukrainian Parliament, remembers how fragmented society was on the verge of independence.",
      "\u201cA very large part was neutral, it included people who wavered, who didn\u2019t have enough information,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThere was also a big and powerful core that was categorically in favor of preserving the Soviet Union, communist rule, ties with Russia, and so on.\u201d Nechyporenko says the \u201cpassionate change-makers\u201d were a minority.",
      "In his view, Ukraine\u2019s tolerance toward agents of Russian influence since the early days of its independence was a major mistake. \u201cWe should have been more firm, more radical,\u201d he said.",

One of the most consequential was the choice to surrender the vast nuclear arsenal left on Ukrainian soil after the Soviet collapse.",
      "\u201cThe path we were supposed to take with the world\u2019s third-largest nuclear arsenal \u2014 about five thousand nuclear warheads \u2014 that path should have given us the opportunity to effectively use this potential for integration with the West,\u201d said Yurii Kostenko, a scholar and politician who led negotiations on Ukraine\u2019s nuclear disarmament in the early 1990s.",
      "He says that while leading the negotiation process, his vision of nuclear disarmament included the U.S. assisting Ukraine financially and technologically to turn nuclear warheads into fuel for nuclear power plants. Accession to NATO would have been Ukraine\u2019s guarantee of security. The American side was ready to make it happen, Kostenko says.",
      "But instead of cooperation with the U.S., Kostenko recalls Ukraine being eventually pressured into surrendering its warheads to Russia, receiving almost nothing in return. He said to achieve that, then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin demanded Kostenko\u2019s dismissal as leader of the negotiations by Ukraine\u2019s then-President Leonid Kravchuk. That demand was granted.",
      "No longer led by Kostenko, Ukraine\u2019s delegation dropped the initial plan codesigned with the U.S. and chose to cooperate with Russia instead. Kostenko says that in exchange for its nukes, Ukraine received $1.5 billion in nuclear fuel and natural gas from Russia, which, he says, was worth around 1% of what Ukraine gave up.",
      "Instead of NATO accession, Ukraine received the Budapest Memorandum, an agreement in which Ukraine was granted assurances of sovereignty and territorial integrity from the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia. For many Ukrainians, it has become a symbol of promises that carried no weight. Moscow shredded the agreement first with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and then with the full-scale invasion in 2022. Three decades later, as Ukraine once again negotiates its future with Western partners under the shadow of Russian aggression, the choices and compromises of the 1990s still loom large, shaping its search for lasting security.",

      "Shares in China Evergrande, the real estate developer whose downfall led a collapse in the country\u2019s property market, have been delisted from Hong Kong's stock exchange as creditors work to wind up debts that totaled over $300 billion",
      "BANGKOK -- Shares in China Evergrande were removed from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday, marking another step in the retreat of the giant real estate developer whose downfall contributed to a prolonged crisis in China's property market.",
      "Evergrande's creditors are still working to wind up debts that amounted to more than $340 billion. Once China's second-largest developer, it ran into trouble when Chinese regulators cracked down several years ago on what they deemed to be excess borrowing by developers.",
      "That caused dozens of property companies to default on their debts, triggering a downturn in the property market that is still dragging on the world's second-largest economy.",
      "Here's what to know about Evergrande:",
      "The Hong Kong Exchange said Monday that Evergrande's shares were delisted as of Monday morning, as expected. The shares were last traded on January 29, 2024, and then suspended after a court in Hong Kong ordered liquidation of the company when it failed to provide a viable debt restructuring plan.",
      "Rules of the exchange stipulate that a company's share listing may be canceled if trading in its securities is suspended for 18 straight months.",
      "After years of warnings that led to global rating agencies cutting the Chinese government\u2019s credit rating in 2017, the ruling communist party cracked down on real estate debt in 2020. It imposed controls known as \u201cthree red lines\u201d that prohibited heavily indebted developers like Evergrande from borrowing more to pay off bonds and bank loans as they matured.",
      "Fears of a possible Evergrande default in 2021 rattled global markets, but they eased after the Chinese central bank said its problems were contained and Beijing would keep credit markets functioning. Evergrande was one of the biggest of many developers that failed to repay their creditors.",
      "Chinese home buyers often pay up front for apartments before they're even built. The credit crunch for Evergrande and other developers led them to suspend construction, leaving many projects in limbo. The slowing of home purchases and building rippled throughout the economy, hitting demand for construction materials, appliances and even vehicles at a time when China was also contending with disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Since most Chinese families have their wealth tied up in property, the anemic housing market has been a major factor crimping consumer spending.",
      "There has been some recovery in the housing sector, but home prices and investment have continued to fall.",
      "Before the crackdown on borrowing, real estate accounted for some 20% of China\u2019s economy. When spending on steel and copper for construction, furniture and other related purchases was added in, estimates of its share of the economy rose to about a third.",

      "Evergrande, headquartered in southern China's Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, was founded by entrepreneur Hui Ka Yan, who is also known as Xu Jiayin, in 1996. Its ascent and decline have mirrored the boom and bust in China's property market after housing reforms allotted apartments built by state-owned industries to employees, creating a nation of home owners.",
      "The company's shares were listed in Hong Kong in 2009.",
      "Evergrande filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in New York City in 2023, but that case was later withdrawn. Although a Hong Kong court ordered a winding up of the company's debts, more than 90 percent of its assets are on the Chinese mainland, making it difficult to enforce repayment to its creditors.",
      "Its liquidators said in a recent progress report that they had received debt claims totaling $45 billion as of Jul. 31, much higher than the some $27.5 billion of liabilities disclosed in December 2022, and that the new figure was not final. They also had taken control of more then 100 companies within the group with collective assets valued at $3.5 billion as of Jan. 29, 2024.",

      "The nonprofit that manages Central Park has thrown its support behind a proposal to end the horse-drawn carriages that have been fixtures in the greenspace for more than 150 years",
      "NEW YORK -- For more than 150 years, horse-drawn carriages have been trotting through Manhattan's Central Park, weathering the arrival of the automobile, years of criticism from animal rights activists and even a mayoral administration that vowed to ban the tourist activity.",
      "But now the influential nonprofit that manages the 843-acre park \u2014 and has previously stayed out of the debate \u2014 has now thrown its support behind a proposal to wind down the industry as early as next summer.",
      "The Central Park Conservancy argued in an Aug. 12 letter to the City Council that horse carriages have an outsized impact on public safety and road infrastructure in the increasingly crowded park.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t be just frozen in time,\u201d said Elizabeth Smith, the conservancy's CEO, in an interview this week. \u201cHorses are too unpredictable and the roadways are too busy with too many different kinds of users now \u2014 bikers, runners, pedestrians, strollers.\u201d",
      "Smith noted other cities have done away with the nostalgic rides, including San Antonio, which passed a five-year phase out of the industry last year. Chicago banned it starting in 2021 and Montreal did the same the year prior.",
      "The carriage industry argues it\u2019s being unfairly singled out, despite the number of horses in the park barely budging since World War II.",
      "There are currently 68 licensed carriage owners with a total of about 200 horses and 170 drivers, according to the Transport Workers Union, which represents industry employees.",
      "Meanwhile, Central Park sees some 40 million visitors annually, many of them increasingly zipping around on rental bikes or hitching a ride on one of the human-powered pedicabs that line the park\u2019s entry points. Cars were banned from the park's drives in 2018.",
      "Eliminating carriage horses also goes against famed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s vision for the park, with its hilly paths and undulating roads tailor-made for leisurely carriage rides, argues Christina Hansen, a longtime carriage driver and industry spokesperson.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the park the way it was meant to be seen,\u201d she said as she gave a recent tour, which runs about $72 for the first 20 minutes and $29 for each additional 10 minutes.",
      "Animal rights groups have long complained the horses can get easily spooked on city streets, leading to accidents and injuries. They also claim the horses are overworked and live in inadequate stables and their drivers flaunt city regulations, including leaving behind piles of horse manure. All animals are supposed to be fitted with manure-catching devices.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s simply no way to operate horse-drawn carriages and have it be safe or humane for the horses,\u201d said Edita Birnkrant, executive director of the animal rights group New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets. \u201cNo amount of regulation can change that. Lord knows we have tried.\u201d",
      "The conservancy\u2019s call came after a carriage horse collapsed and died near its stables earlier this month, with videos and photos of the animal\u2019s body in a city street circulating widely online.",
      "But the organization, which was formed to revitalize the park in the 1980s, didn\u2019t weigh in on the animal welfare concerns in its letter to the council.",
      "Smith said the tipping point was two recent incidents of carriage horses running amok: in May, a spooked horse bolted from its handler and ran loose through the park. Days later, two more horses broke free from their drivers and crashed into a fleet of parked pedicabs, breaking a driver\u2019s wrist and causing other injuries.",

      "ESPN is nearing a deal with Major League Baseball to distribute out-of-market games",
      "When ESPN opted out of its contract with Major League Baseball in February, the network was hoping to get a reworked package at a lower cost while Commissioner Rob Manfred thought the sport could optimize its rights in the short term for Home Run Derby and Wild Card round.",
      "In the end, both parties may get what they want.",
      "According to people familiar with negotiations, ESPN is nearing a deal to distribute out-of-market games while NBC/Peacock, Netflix, Apple TV are in talks for regular-season packages, the Wild Card round and Home Run Derby.",
      "All sides hope to have everything finalized by the end of the regular season next month, three people told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the contracts have not been finalized or announced by either side.",
      "The negotiations around the three-year deals is complicated due to the fact that MLB is also trying not to slight two of its other rights holders. MLB receives an average of $729 million from Fox and $470 million from Turner Sports per year under deals which expire after the 2028 season.",
      "While ESPN would be losing the playoffs and Home Run Derby, it would be gaining something it considers more valuable \u2014 the MLB.TV streaming package of out-of-market games as part of the direct-to-consumer service that launched on Thursday. ESPN would also sell the in-market rights to the five teams whose games are produced by MLB \u2014 San Diego, Colorado, Arizona, Cleveland and Minnesota.",
      "\u201cWe are engaged. We are having healthy conversations with them. Nothing to announce today, but we\u2019re very interested in baseball in general,\u201d ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said on Tuesday during a presentation about the network's DTC service.",
      "ESPN, which has carried MLB games since 1990, opted out of the final three years of a seven-year deal in February. The package averaged $550 million per season and also included the Home Run Derby and Wild Card games.",
      "Baseball would be the second league that would have its out-of-market digital package available in the U.S. on ESPN\u2019s platform. The NHL moved its package to ESPN in 2021.",
      "It would also be a win-win situation for MLB and ESPN. Manfred wrote in a memo to owners after ESPN opted out of its contract: \u201cWhile ESPN has stated they would like to continue to have MLB on their platform, particularly in light of the upcoming launch of their DTC product, we do not think its beneficial for us to accept a smaller deal to remain on a shrinking platform. In order to best position MLB to optimize our rights going in to our next deal cycle, we believe it is not prudent to devalue our rights with an existing partner but rather to have our marquee regular season games, Home Run Derby and Wild Card playoff round on a new broadcast and/or streaming platform.\u201d",
      "The moves keep ESPN involved in baseball, but at a point where it can benefit while MLB could benefit from other partners in a short-term deal.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Now that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the central bank could soon cut its key interest rate, he faces a new challenge: how to do it without seeming to cave to the White House's demands.",
      "For months, Powell has largely ignored President Donald Trump's constant hectoring that he reduce borrowing costs. Yet on Friday, in a highly-anticipated speech, Powell suggested that the Fed could take such a step as soon as its next meeting in September.",
      "It will be a fraught decision for the Fed, which must weigh it against persistent inflation and an economy that could also improve in the second half of this year. Both trends, if they occur, could make a cut look premature.",
      "Trump has urged Powell to slash rates, arguing there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and saying that a cut would lower the government\u2019s interest payments on its $37 trillion in debt.",
      "Powell, on the other hand, has suggested that a rate cut is likely for reasons quite different than Trump's: He is worried that the economy is weakening. His remarks on Friday at an economic symposium in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming also indicated that the Fed will move carefully and cut rates at a much slower pace than Trump wants.",
      "Powell pointed to economic growth that \u201chas slowed notably in the first half of this year,\u201d to an annual rate of 1.2%, down from 2.5% last year. There has also been a \u201cmarked slowing\u201d in the demand for workers, he added, which threatens to raise unemployment.",
      "Still, Powell said that tariffs have started to lift the price of goods and could continue to push inflation higher, a possibility Fed officials will closely monitor and that will make them cautious about additional rate cuts.",
      "The Fed\u2019s key short-term interest rate, which influences other borrowing costs for things like mortgages and auto loans, is currently 4.3%. Trump has called for it to be cut as low as 1% \u2014 a level no Fed official supports.",
      "However the Fed moves forward, it will likely do so while continuing to assert its longstanding independence. A politically independent central bank is considered by most economists as critical to preventing inflation, because it can take steps \u2014 such as raising interest rates to cool the economy and combat inflation \u2014 that are harder for elected officials to do.",
      "There are 19 members of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee, 12 of whom vote on rate decisions. One of them, Beth Hammack, president of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Cleveland branch, said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press that she is committed to the Fed\u2019s independence.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m laser focused ... on ensuring that I can deliver good outcomes for the for the public, and I try to tune out all the other noise,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cInflation is too high and it\u2019s been trending in the wrong direction,\u201d Hammack said. \u201cRight now I see us moving away from our goals on the inflation side.\u201d",

But Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that was likely a deliberate choice and intended, ironically, to demonstrate the Fed's independence.",

And even if it pleases the president, we\u2019re going to make the right call.\u201d",
      "It was against that backdrop that Trump intensified his own pressure campaign against another top Fed official.",
      "Trump said he would fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook if she did not step down from her position. Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to head the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, alleged Wednesday that Cook committed mortgage fraud when she bought two properties in 2021. She has not been charged.",

      "Trump had previously threatened to fire Powell, but hasn\u2019t done so. Trump appointed Powell in late 2017. His term as chair ends in about nine months.",
      "Powell is no stranger to Trump's attacks. Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, noted that the president also went after him in 2018 for raising interest rates, but that didn't stop Powell.",
      "\u201cThe president has a long history of applying pressure to Chairman Powell,\u201d Strain said. \u201cAnd Chairman Powell has a long history of resisting that pressure. So it would be odd, I think, if on his way out the door, he caved for the first time.\u201d",
      "Still, Strain thinks that Powell is overestimating the risk that the economy will weaken further and push unemployment higher. If inflation worsens while hiring continues, that could force the Fed to potentially reverse course and increase rates again next year.",

      "As AI becomes a part of everyday life, its massive energy and water needs are coming more into focus",
      "Marissa Loewen first started using artificial intelligence in 2014 as a project management tool. She has autism and ADHD and said it helped immensely with organizing her thoughts.",
      "\u201cWe try to use it conscientiously though because we do realize that there is an impact on the environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Her personal AI use isn't unique anymore. Now it\u2019s a feature in smartphones, search engines, word processors and email services. Every time someone uses AI, it uses energy that is often generated by fossil fuels. That releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and contributes to climate change.",
      "And it's getting harder to live without it.",
      "AI is largely powered by data centers that field queries, store data and deploy information. As AI becomes ubiquitous, the power demand for data centers increases, leading to grid reliability problems for people living nearby.",
      "\u201cSince we are trying to build data centers at a pace where we cannot integrate more renewable energy resources into the grid, most of the new data centers are being powered by fossil fuels,\u201d said Noman Bashir, computing and climate impact fellow with MIT's Climate and Sustainability Consortium.",
      "The data centers also generate heat, so they rely on fresh water to stay cool. Larger centers can consume up to 5 million gallons (18.9 million liters) a day, according to an article from the Environmental and Energy Study Institute. That's roughly the same as the daily water demand for a town of up to 50,000 people.",
      "It\u2019s difficult to imagine, because for most users the impact isn\u2019t visible, said AI and Climate Lead Sasha Luccioni with the AI company, Hugging Face.",
      "\u201cIn one of my studies, we found that generating a high-definition image uses as much energy as charging half of your phone. And people were like, \u2018That can\u2019t be right, because when I use Midjourney (a generative AI program), my phone battery doesn\u2019t go down,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Jon Ippolito, professor of new media at the University of Maine, said tech companies are constantly working to make chips and data centers more efficient, but that does not mean AI\u2019s environmental impact will shrink. That\u2019s because of a problem called the Jevons Paradox.",
      "\u201cThe cheaper resources get, the more we tend to use them anyway,\u201d he said. When cars replaced horses, he said, commute times didn\u2019t shrink. We just traveled farther.",
      "How much those programs contribute to global warming depends on a lot of factors, including how warm it is outside the data center that's processing the query, how clean the grid is and how complex the AI task is.",
      "Information sources on AI's contributions to climate change are incomplete and contradictory, so getting exact numbers is difficult.",
      "But Ippolito tried anyway.",
      "He built an app that compares the environmental footprint of different digital tasks based on the limited data he could find. It estimates that a simple AI prompt, such as, \u201cTell me the capital of France,\u201d uses 23 times more energy than the same question typed into Google without its AI Overview feature.",
      "\u201cInstead of working with existing materials, it's writing them from scratch. And that takes a lot more compute,\u201d Luccioni said.",

A 3-second video, according to Ippolito's app, uses 15,000 times as much energy. It's equivalent to turning on an incandescent lightbulb and leaving it on for more than a year.",
      "It's got a big impact, but it doesn't mean our tech footprints were carbon-free before AI entered the scene.",
      "Watching an hour of Netflix, for example, uses more energy than a complex AI text prompt. An hour on Zoom with 10 people uses 10 times that much.",
      "\u201cIt's not just about making people conscious of AI's impact, but also all of these digital activities we take for granted,\u201d he said.",
      "Ippolito said he limits his use of AI when he can. He suggests using human-captured images instead of AI-generated ones. He tells the AI to stop generating as soon as he has the answer to avoid wasting extra energy. He requests concise answers and he begins Google searches by typing \u201c-ai\u201d so it doesn't provide an AI overview for queries where he doesn't need it.",
      "Loewen has adopted the same approach. She said she tries to organize her thoughts into one AI query instead of asking it a series of iterative questions. She also built her own AI that doesn\u2019t rely on large data centers, which saves energy in the same way watching a movie you own on a DVD is far less taxing than streaming one.",
      "\u201cHaving something local on your computer in your home allows you to also control your use of the electricity and consumption. It allows you to control your data a little bit more,\u201d she said.",
      "Luccioni uses Ecosia, which is a search engine that uses efficient algorithms and uses profits to plant trees to minimize the impact of each search. Its AI function can also be turned off.",
      "ChatGPT also has a temporary chat function so the queries you send to the data center get deleted after a few weeks instead of taking up data center storage space.",
      "But AI is only taking up a fraction of the data center's energy use. Ippolito estimates roughly 85% is data collection from sites like TikTok and Instagram, and cryptocurrency.",
      "His answer there: make use of screen time restrictions on your phone to limit time scrolling on social media. Less time means less personal data collected, less energy and water used, and fewer carbon emissions entering the atmosphere.",
      "\u201cIf you can do anything that cuts a data center out of the equation, I think that's a win,\u201d Ippolito said.",

No farmer wants to switch and then find that matcha fever has died.",

      "Washington, D",
      "WASHINGTON -- The seasonably adjusted unemployment rate in Washington, D.C., was the highest in the nation for the third straight month, according to new data released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "D.C.'s jobless rate reached 6% in July, a reflection of the mass layoffs of federal workers, ushered in by President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, earlier this year. An overall decline in international tourism \u2014 which is a main driver of D.C.\u2019s income \u2014 is also expected to have an impact on the climbing unemployment rate in the District.",
      "Neighboring states also saw an uptick in unemployment rates in July \u2014 with Maryland at 3.4% (up from 3.3%) and Virginia at 3.6% (up from 3.5%), according to the state-by-state jobless figures.",
      "Since the beginning of Trump's second term, federal workers across government agencies have been either laid off or asked to voluntarily resign from their positions. Those actions have drawn litigation across the federal government by labor unions and advocacy groups.",
      "In July, the Supreme Court cleared the way for Trump administration plans to downsize the federal workforce further, despite warnings that critical government services will be lost and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be out of their jobs.",
      "The latest D.C. Office of Revenue Analysis figures show that payments made to unemployed federal workers have been climbing month-over-month. In April, unemployed workers received $2.01 million in unemployment payments. By June, that figure reached $2.57 million.",

      "In addition, international tourism, a major source of D.C., to the U.S. is declining. Angered by Trump's tariffs and rhetoric, and alarmed by reports of tourists being arrested at the border, some citizens of other countries are staying away from the U.S. and choosing to travel elsewhere \u2014 notably British, German and South American tourists, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.",
      "A May report from the organization states that international visitor spending to the U.S. is projected to fall to just under $169 billion this year, down from $181 billion in 2024 \u2014 which is a 22.5% decline compared to the previous peak.",

      "In a Wednesday complaint, the FTC accused Fitness International and its subsidiary Fitness & Sports Clubs of illegally charging consumers \u201chundreds of millions of dollars in unwanted recurring fees\u201d as a result of cumbersome cancellation processes. The agency said that tens of thousands of customers have reported difficulties with these policies to date.",
      "\u201cThe FTC\u2019s complaint describes a scenario that too many Americans have experienced \u2014 a gym membership that seems impossible to cancel,\u201d Christopher Mufarrige, director of the agency\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "Beyond LA Fitness, California-based Fitness International operates brands like Esporta Fitness, City Sports Club, and Club Studio \u2014 spanning across more than 600 locations with over 3.7 million members nationwide. And the FTC pointed to two \u201cunfair and unlawful\u201d cancellation processes that it says these gyms have used for years: in-person cancellation or cancellation by mail.",
      "Both of these options require consumers to print out a form on the gym\u2019s website, which includes logging in with credentials that the agency says some customers don\u2019t have or remember. And if a customer opts for in-person cancellation, there\u2019s limited hours and often difficulty finding a manager to process the forms, the complaint notes \u2014 while mailing the form comes with additional costs.",
      "\u201cEach of these cancellation methods is opaque, complicated, and demanding \u2014 far from simple,\u201d the FTC writes in its complaint. It also alleges that the company doesn\u2019t adequately disclose cancellation offerings when consumers sign up for memberships, and that some will be signed up for additional services with recurring charges without realizing there may be different cancellation requirements.",

      "SAN DIEGO -- A heckler next to the Los Angeles Dodgers' dugout spent his entire Sunday giving an earful to the visitors, including a nonstop barrage of digs and chirps at Shohei Ohtani for his hitless performance in a portentous weekend series against the San Diego Padres.",
      "When Ohtani crushed his 45th homer and delivered the knockout blow in the ninth inning of the Dodgers' 8-2 victory, the normally decorous three-time MVP detoured on his way back to the dugout to slap hands \u2014 and get the last word \u2014 with the chagrined Padres fan.",
      "The Dodgers loved to see it, along with just about everything else that transpired in the final four innings of a win that evened the NL West race yet again with 31 games left.",
      "\u201cIt was very out of character from Shohei, (but the heckler) was wearing him out the whole game,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cSo it was good to see Shohei initiate a high-five from him. That was great. That was fun. It was good to see Shohei show his personality.\u201d",
      "Ohtani didn't speak to reporters afterward, but he didn't need a loudmouth fan to tell him that he was 0 for 10 with two walks in the series before his 409-foot homer off Yuki Matsui.",
      "His fellow Dodgers had already delivered by then, with rookie Dalton Rushing's tiebreaking three-run shot in the seventh inning sandwiched between clutch homers in back-to-back innings by Freddie Freeman.",
      "\u201cI think he was just kind of talking to Shohei the whole game, so I\u2019m glad Shohei was able to give him a little something else to cheer about,\u201d Freeman said with a grin.",
      "Freeman and the rest of the Dodgers heard plenty of yapping from the stands during the weekend in the latest chapter of what might currently be the liveliest rivalry in the sport. The noise intensified as Los Angeles lost the first two games while managing just five combined hits \u2014 but the defending champs still managed to head home smiling and even with the Padres at 74-57.",
      "When asked if the rivalry is the best in baseball, Rushing replied: \u201cI think so. I think it\u2019s pretty safe to say. You see the atmosphere we play in, whether it\u2019s here or in LA. I think it\u2019s pretty special. There\u2019s something to it. There\u2019s a lot of superstars on the field, and it\u2019s fun to play in these games.\u201d",
      "Both teams could find reasons to be optimistic after wrapping up the regular season matchups between two World Series contenders that have also met in three of the past five postseasons, with the Dodgers winning two of those matchups.",
      "The Dodgers have already won the season series with San Diego 9-4, giving them the tiebreaker if the clubs are still even 31 games from now.",

Didn't happen for us. We couldn't be more thrilled. We're tied for our division lead and expect to go win it.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to treat the next however many games until the regular season is over like we're neck-and-neck with them,\" Rushing said. \u201cWhether we're tied in the division or we're eight games out, we're going to treat it like it's the same, and I think it's a good thing. You hold a competitive edge finishing out the regular season, and that's what you kind of carry into the postseason.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere was a lot of excitement out there and some of those passes were not sticking,\u201d New Zealand captain Alana Bremner said. \u201cBut first game we weren't expecting perfection.\u201d",
      "With nine players from the 2022 final and another nine making their World Cup debut, New Zealand didn't click in its first test in six weeks until Jorja Miller scored from out of nothing.

      "The world's best sevens player was over again four minutes later, then player of the match Liana Mikaele-Tu'u crashed over and it was 21-0 after 24 minutes. But the Black Ferns couldn't score another try until the second half.",

      "Both teams, in the same pool as New Zealand and Spain, targeted their tournament opener at sunny Franklin's Gardens as a key step toward making the quarterfinals. Japan gave away height and weight advantages to higher-ranked Ireland but won their last matchup in 2022 and was buoyed by wins this year over the U.S. and Spain.",

But he also knew these were the last words he\u2019d ever speak as the voice of the Brewers, and his voice was not as strong, and he wasn\u2019t quite as sharp, but it was still Bob Uecker. When you listen to that, even though he doesn\u2019t frame it that way, that\u2019s about as poignant a valedictory as any broadcaster has ever given.\u201d",

      "Kansas has opened its new $450 million on-campus stadium with a dominant 31-7 win over Fresno State",
      "LAWRENCE, Kan. -- Sixth-year senior Jalon Daniels threw for 176 yards and three touchdowns, two of them to newcomer Cam Pickett, and Kansas opened its rebuilt, $450 million on-campus stadium with a 31-7 rout of Fresno State on Saturday.",
      "Daniels finished 18 of 20 while running for 47 yards, and Iowa transfer Leshon Williams had a long touchdown run, helping the Jayhawks pile up nearly 400 yards of total offense and win their fifth consecutive season-opener.",
      "\u201cI thought he had great leadership. He was in command. He didn't get rattled, made people miss and made the throws,\u201d Kansas coach Lance Leipold said of his quarterback. \u201cJust everything you want in that, and you've seen him play. He just seemed really confident in what's going on. And that's what you need out of an experienced quarterback.\u201d",
      "E.J. Warner had 179 yards passing with two interceptions for Fresno State. Elijah Gilliam had a touchdown run.",
      "This one had all the pomp and circumstance of a homecoming \u2014 and, well, it was one after the Jayhawks spent all of last season playing home games at stadiums in the Kansas City area. In the meantime, their 104-year-old stadium was razed and the majority of it was rebuilt, with only the east side where the students sit awaiting a facelift this coming offseason.",
      "Then the Jayhawks got busy as they seek to rebound from a 5-7 finish a year ago.",
      "Daniels quickly led them downfield after the opening kickoff, hitting Pickett with a 21-yard touchdown throw. After Fresno State answered with Gilliam's TD run, the Jayhawks' longtime quarterback \u2014 a one-time Heisman Trophy candidate whose career has been slowed by injuries \u2014 helped Kansas reel off 17 points and take a 24-7 lead into halftime.",
      "Pickett, a transfer from Ball State, finished with six catches for 77 yards and his two scores.",
      "Daniels added a touchdown throw to Keaton Kubecka in the third quarter that put the game out of reach.",

What a night that way. But again, for us to come out and play the way we did, I'm very proud of them.\u201d",
      "Just about the only thing that Leipold was critical about afterward was penalties. The Jayhawks had nine for 72 yards.",
      "Fresno State got off to a quick start under new coach Matt Entz, and Warner was 5 of 5 for 81 yards in the first quarter. But he was just 13 of 24 for 98 yards the rest of the way while turning the ball over three times.",
      "Kansas dominated both lines of scrimmage. The defense of new coordinator D.K. McDonald was especially disruptive, holding the Bulldogs to just 37 yards on 29 carries while totaling 10 tackles-for-loss.",

      "Now the younger Carr has a chance to create a new legacy for the family that grew up in college football's winningest program \u2014 with one of the sport's most prestigious schools, No. 6 Notre Dame.",
      "Coach Marcus Freeman ended the quarterback competition Tuesday by selecting Carr as the starter and putting the former Michigan prep star under the spotlight in next Sunday night's season opener at No. 10 Miami.",
      "Carr already sounds like a natural.",
      "\u201cOne of my strengths is understanding where to go with the ball and what the defense is doing,\u201d he said when summer camp opened. \u201cI think I\u2019ve grown a lot with that since my first year here. Another strength is the relationship I have with my teammates. The quarterbacks and the coaches get all the glory, but it\u2019s really the (offensive) line and the receivers who are out there making all the plays.\u201d",
      "Neither Carr nor his top competitor, Kenny Minchey, have been available to reporters since Freeman made the decision. Freeman also has not yet spoken about it.",
      "Carr appeared in one game last year, mop-up duty in a 66-7 rout at Purdue. But he has never thrown a college pass or logged a carry.",
      "He replaces Riley Leonard, who led the Irish to 13 straight wins last season before falling 34-23 to Ohio State in the CFP national championship game. Leonard was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in April.",
      "Initially, some thought the more experienced Steve Angeli, Leonard's backup in 2024, would be in the mix. But Angeli transferred to Syracuse in the spring, making it a two-man competition between Carr and Minchey.",
      "And like so many times before, Carr won.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about decision-making,\u201d Freeman said, explaining what factors he'd consider in making the decision. \u201cI always say it, we\u2019ll give the quarterback credit when things are good, we\u2019ll blame him if things are bad. But the one thing they control is their decision-making and the ability to get everybody on the same page.\u201d",
      "At 6-foot-3, 210 pounds, Carr has prototypical size for a QB. He was a highly touted, strong-armed prospect coming out of Saline High School in Michigan. The scouting report also says he has exceptional accuracy and outstanding mechanics.",

      "But when summer camp opened, Carr struggled. He threw three early interceptions.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve struggled with in the past,\u201d he said. \"I\u2019m a very competitive person, and when it doesn\u2019t go your way, you just want to know why right away, and when you\u2019re out there (on the field) and you throw a pick, it\u2019s like you don\u2019t have time to go out and watch the tape. You\u2019ve got to go play the next play. And I think that\u2019s a place I\u2019ve grown.\u201d",
      "Freeman also wanted to test his young, inexperienced quarterbacks in high-pressure situations.",
      "Carr is in only his second season on campus, while Minchey is in his third. Minchey completed his only pass last season for 4 yards, also against Purdue, and completed both of his passes for 12 yards in 2023.",
      "Both may get one more chance to compete against Angeli, too. He was recently selected as the Orange\u2019s starter, and Notre Dame hosts Syracuse on Nov. 22.",
      "But what Freeman saw in camp was two improving quarterbacks, hoping to lead the Irish to their first national championship since 1988.",
      "\"The best thing I love is they\u2019ve both gotten better,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of having a competition. Competition can raise the level of the people in the competition, and that\u2019s what has happened. Both of those two have really elevated their play.\u201d",

      "Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Canada are learning to live with great white sharks",
      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- Rick Clough spent some four decades fishing for lobsters and sea urchins off the Maine coast before spotting one of the ocean's most recognized predators \u2014 a great white shark.",
      "The approximately 8-foot (2.4-meter) shark, seen off the beach town of Scarborough in July, surprised Clough, but didn\u2019t make him fear the ocean \u2014 though he admitted, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to go urchin diving now.\u201d",
      "Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen like Clough who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Atlantic Canada are learning to live with great white sharks, the creatures made famous by the 1975 film \u201cJaws.\u201d Sightings of the apex predators are up in places like Maine, where they were once very rarely spotted.",
      "Scientists link the white shark sightings to increased availability of the seals the sharks feast on, and say beachgoers are generally very safe from shark bites. The sharks can grow close to 20 feet (6 meters) long, though most don't get that big.",
      "David Lancaster, a commercial clam digger in Scarborough, used a drone to get a look at an approximately 12-foot (3.6-meter) shark near the town\u2019s famed beaches earlier this month. He described the animal as \u201cmagnificent\u201d and \u201creally amazing\u201d to see. But he also said the shark's presence reminded him that swimmers need to look out for the big fish.",
      "Sightings of great whites off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, have become increasingly frequent in recent years, and the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy has documented hundreds of the animals over more than a decade. But new data shows the sharks are heading even farther north into New Hampshire, Maine and beyond, said Greg Skomal, a senior fisheries biologist with the Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries and a veteran white shark researcher.",
      "The number of white sharks detected off Halifax, Nova Scotia, increased about 2.5 times from 2018 to 2022, according to a paper published by Skomal and others in May in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series. Even farther north, the number detected in the Cabot Strait that separates Nova Scotia and Newfoundland increased nearly four times over, the paper said.",
      "Skomal said the average residency in these northern waters has also increased from 48 days to 70 days, suggesting that white sharks appear to be increasingly comfortable farther north.",
      "A key reason for the shift seems to be the successful conservation of seals off New England and Canada via laws such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which has allowed seals to thrive and provide a food source for the predatory sharks, Skomal said.",
      "\u201cIt could be a function of a growing prey base,\u201d Skomal said. \u201cAnd that would be seals.\u201d",
      "Great white sharks also benefit from protections, including a ban on fishing for them in U.S. federal waters that has stood since 1997. They are still considered vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.",
      "In Massachusetts, the marine fisheries department said it strengthened its fishing laws after fishermen in 2024 chose to target white sharks anyway. The state prohibited the use of certain kinds of heavy fishing gear in shoreline areas where white sharks are most commonly found.",

      "Despite the size and strength of the sharks, dangerous encounters between white sharks and humans are vanishingly rare.

      "Climate change is fueling conditions across several states that make watching the corn grow a nail-biter for farmers",
      "PAW PAW, Mich. -- Robb Rynd and his brother grew up farming and wanted to do more of it outside their day jobs, so they went in together on what's now a little over 200 acres of corn, soybeans, wheat and sorghum. Last year was a good year, and Rynd said he enjoyed walking the fields with his kids to see how the corn was doing.",
      "This year is a different story.",
      "All summer he's been scouting for brown and wilting leaves or ears of corn with kernels missing, and now it's becoming clear that every kernel will count this harvest. \u201cIt\u2019s almost kind of depressing to go out there and look at it and say, \u2018oh yep, it does look bad,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Across major corn-growing states, climate change is fueling conditions that make watching the corn grow a nail-biter for farmers. Factors like consistently high summer overnight temperatures, droughts and heavier-than-usual rains at the wrong time can all disrupt the plants\u2019 pollination \u2014 making each full ear of corn less of a guarantee and more of a gamble.",
      "Overall, corn growers got lucky this year with late-season weather that contributed to what is now predicted to be a record bumper crop. But experts say bouts of extreme weather are intensifying the waiting game during a critical time of year between planting and harvest.",
      "Human-caused climate change has worsened multiple U.S. extreme heat events this year and has steadily increased the likelihood of hotter overnight temperatures since 1970, according to Climate Central, an independent group of scientists who communicate climate science and data to the public.",
      "\u201dThe hot nights too, like the corn's never getting a break. It\u2019s just hot all the time,\" Rynd said. \u201cI know it\u2019s wearing on me.\u201d",
      "As a corn plant grows, the leaves unroll to reveal the tassel, the part that sheds pollen, explained Mark Licht, an associate professor of agronomy and an extension cropping systems specialist at Iowa State University. If the plant grows too fast, which can happen when it's consistently very hot, the tassel may be wrapped too tightly by the leaf, meaning less pollen gets released.",
      "That can lead to patchy ears of corn. Tight tassel wrap was reported in pockets across parts of the Midwest and the Plains, according to some agricultural trade publication reports during the growing season. Licht said he'd only seen tassel wrapping issues once before in his 20 years as an agronomist.",
      "High temperatures can stress corn in other ways, lowering pollen production, reducing pollen's viability or drying out other parts of the plants, reducing fertility. \"I think any of the pollination issues that we might be having are more because the nights have been so exceedingly warm,\" said Larry Walton, who farms near Rynd in southwestern Michigan, where many farmers irrigate because it's a drier area.",
      "\u201cWe tend to see pollination issues being more problematic when we have high temperatures and drought conditions or lack of rainfall,\u201d Licht said. Yet Iowa had plenty of rain and still saw some pollination issues. Excessive moisture can cause corn smut, a type of fungus that grows on the ears.",
      "He said farmers are having to pay more attention to this because \u201cthere's just more variable weather.\"",
      "This winter, the U.S. drought monitor reported drought in nearly 60% of corn production areas in the Midwest. But near or above normal rainfall nearly everywhere east of the Rockies this summer brought that down to just 3% as of the beginning of August, said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "That, combined with consistent heat, means that \"we are expecting a monster U.S. corn crop in 2025,\" Rippey said.",

He planted his corn and soybeans 60 days behind schedule because it rained nearly every day for two months.",
      "They lost some fertilizer and some plants died in standing water, Good said, but they made up for it with some lucky weather later in the season.",
      "\u201cThe rain does fall in heavier bursts,\u201d Rippey said.

It runs off and carries fertilizer with it, which is a problem for rivers' health and farmers' pocketbooks.",
      "The trend toward higher humidity levels and warmer ocean temperatures, contributing to hotter nights, could be a bigger issue going forward, putting stress on crops like corn and soybeans, Rippey added.",

      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration",
      "BANGKOK -- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday that the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration.",
      "Huang was asked about a possible \u201cB30A\u201d semiconductor for artificial intelligence data centers for China while on a visit to Taiwan, where he was meeting Nvidia's key manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., the world's largest chip maker.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m offering a new product to China for ... AI data centers, the follow-on to H20,\u201d Huang said. But he added that \"That\u2019s not our decision to make. It\u2019s up to, of course, the United States government. And we\u2019re in dialogue with them, but it\u2019s too soon to know.\u201d",
      "Such chips are graphics processing units, or GPUs, a type of device used to build and update a range of AI systems. But they are less powerful than Nvidia\u2019s top semiconductors today, which cannot be sold to China due to U.S. national security restrictions.",
      "The B30A, based on California-based Nvidia's specialized Blackwell technology, is reported to operate at about half the speed of Nvidia's main B300 chips.",
      "Huang praised the the Trump administration for recently approving sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China after such business was suspended in April, with the proviso that the company must pay a 15% tax to the U.S. government on those sales. Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, was told to pay the same tax on its sales of its MI380 chips to China.",
      "As part of broader trade talks, Beijing and Washington recently agreed to pull back some non-tariff restrictions. China approved more permits for rare earth magnets to be exported to the U.S., while Washington lifted curbs on chip design software and jet engines. After lobbying by Huang, it also allowed sales of the H20 chips to go through.",
      "Huang did not comment directly on the tax when asked but said Nvidia appreciated being able to sell H20s to China.",
      "He said such sales pose no security risk for the United States. Nvidia is also speaking with Beijing to reassure Chinese authorities that those chips do not pose a \u201cbackdoor\u201d security risk, Huang said.",
      "\u201cWe have made very clear and put to rest that H20 has no security backdoors. There are no such things. There never has. And so hopefully the response that we\u2019ve given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said that Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business.",
      "Speaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan \u2014 which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.",
      "\u201cI said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe agreed, and they\u2019ve agreed to do it.\u201d",
      "Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the agreement.",

      "The official announcement is expected to come later Friday, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of an announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel\u2019s largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world\u2019s largest economy.",
      "In his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country\u2019s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",

      "That\u2019s what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan\u2019s past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \u201camazing story.\u201d",
      "The company isn\u2019t commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Although rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel\u2019s business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration\u2019s financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company\u2019s chips.",
      "Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn\u2019t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.",
      "The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program \u2014 money that Lutnick derided as a \u201cgiveaway\u201d that would better serve U.S. taxpayers if it\u2019s turned into Intel stock. \u201cWe think America should get the benefit of the bar",

      "BANGKOK -- China released new interim measures Friday tightening controls on mining and processing of rare earths that are used in many high-tech products including electric vehicles, smartphones and fighter jets.",
      "The rules released Friday by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology apply both to rare earths originating in China and those that are sent to China for refining.",
      "They require companies to comply with quotas for various minerals. Companies must have government approval to deal with rare earths and must accurately report the amount of rare earths products being handled. Violators will face legal penalties and also have their quotas for rare earths reduced.",

      "The 17 rare earth elements, including such minerals as germanium, gallium and titanium, aren\u2019t actually rare. But they're hard to find in a high enough concentration to make mining them worth the investment. China has been gradually tightening restrictions on exports of such materials, partly in response to U.S. controls on its access to American advanced technology.",
      "In April, just after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a raft of tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, Beijing announced permitting requirements for seven more rare earths: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium, citing the need to \u201cbetter safeguard national security and interests and to fulfill global duties of non-proliferation.\u201d",
      "Those limits raised worries that manufacturers in the U.S. and elsewhere would run short of vital materials needed for production, an issue in China-U.S. trade talks. In response to U.S. concessions on access to computer chip design software and jet engines, Beijing announced in June that it was speeding up approvals of rare earths exports.",

      "China has agreed to issue some permits for rare earth exports but not for military uses, and much uncertainty remains about their supply.",

      "A federal website that informs the public about data collection has gone down, causing concern among advocates",
      "A federal website that informs the public about what information agencies are collecting and allows for public comment went down last weekend, and it has only been partially restored. The outage has raised concerns among advocates who already were troubled by the disappearance of data sets from government websites after President Donald Trump began his second term.",
      "The https://www.reginfo.gov/public/ website went offline at the end of last week and was partially restored this week. Data was missing after Aug. 1, according to dataindex,us, a collective of data scientists and advocates who monitor changes in federal data sets.",

      "In February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s official public portal for health data, data.cdc.gov, was taken down entirely but subsequently went back up. Around the same time, when a query was made to access certain public data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s most comprehensive survey of American life, users for several days got a response that said the area was \u201cunavailable due to maintenance\u201d before access was restored.",
      "Researchers Janet Freilich and Aaron Kesselheim examined 232 federal public health data sets that had been modified in the first quarter of this year and found that almost half had been \u201csubstantially altered,\u201d with the majority having the word \u201cgender\u201d switched to \u201csex,\u201d they wrote last month in The Lancet medical journal.",

      "Hurricane Erin is creating potentially deadly water conditions all along the U.S. East Coast days before the largest waves are expected, with high winds and waves anticipated in North Carolina by Wednesday night.",
      "Erin lost some strength Tuesday and dropped to a Category 2 hurricane as it moves northward roughly parallel to the East Coast. However it could get stronger again on Thursday before finally weakening by Friday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) as of Wednesday morning.",
      "The hurricane was about 400 miles (640 kilometers) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and 560 miles ( 901 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda as of Wednesday morning. Forecasters said Erin was moving north-northwest at 13 mph (21 kph).",
      "Although the weather center was confident Erin would not make direct landfall in the United States, authorities have warned that water conditions along the East Coast remain dangerous. Beachgoers were cautioned against swimming due to life-threatening surf and rip currents.",
      "Officials on a few islands along North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks issued evacuation orders and warned that some roads could be swamped by waves of 15 feet (4.6 meters).",
      "In the Caribbean, heavy rainfall was forecast for parts of the southeast Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands, the weather center said.",
      "Here is what to know about Hurricane Erin:",
      "Erin poses the biggest threat to the barrier islands of North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks. Gov. Josh Stein declared a state of emergency Tuesday in advance of the storm, delegating powers to government officials to mobilize workers and equipment along the coast.",
      "The governor said the storm is expected to bring tropical storm force winds, dangerous waves and rip currents to the state. Tropical storm conditions were expected to begin Wednesday.",
      "At least 75 people were rescued from rip currents through Tuesday in Wrightsville Beach, near Wilmington, North Carolina, officials said.",
      "Evacuations were ordered on Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island on the Outer Banks. The orders come at the height of tourist season on the thin stretch of low-lying barrier islands that juts far into the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "There are concerns that several days of heavy surf, high winds and waves could wash out parts of the main highway running along the barrier islands, the National Weather Service said. Some routes could be impassible for several days.",
      "Warnings about rip currents have been posted from Bermuda and Florida all the way up to the New England coast.",
      "Nantucket is the closest spot in New England to Erin\u2019s anticipated path and was likely to see the strongest winds, gusting about 25 to 35 mph (40 to 55 kph) at peak with waves potentially reaching a height of 10-13 feet (3-4 meters).",
      "Citing treacherous waters, officials prohibited swimming at all beaches in New York City as well as some in Long Island and New Jersey through Thursday.",
      "Bermuda won\u2019t feel the full intensity of the storm until Thursday evening, and the island\u2019s services will remain open in the meantime, acting Minister of National Security Jache Adams said. Storm surge could reach up to 24 feet (7.3 meters) by Thursday, Adams said.",

About 100 people drown from rip currents along U.S. beaches each year, according to the United States Lifesaving Association. And more than 80% of beach rescues annually involve rip currents.",
      "Storm surge is the level at which seawater rises above its normal level.",
      "Much like the way a storm\u2019s sustained winds do not include the potential for even stronger gusts, storm surge doesn\u2019t include the wave height above the mean water level.",
      "Surge is also the amount above what the normal tide is at a time, so a 15-foot storm surge at high tide can be far more devastating than the same surge at low tide.",
      "A year ago, Hurricane Ernesto stayed hundreds of miles offshore from the Eastern Seaboard yet still produced high surf and swells that caused coastal damage.",
      "Erin\u2019s strength has fluctuated significantly over the past week.",
      "The most common way to measure a hurricane\u2019s strength is the Saffir-Simpson Scale that assigns a category from 1 to 5 based on a storm\u2019s sustained wind speed at its center, with 5 being the strongest.",
      "Erin reached a dangerous Category 5 status late last week with 160 mph (260 kph) winds before weakening.",
      "Although Erin is the first Atlantic hurricane of the year, there have been four tropical storms this hurricane season already. Tropical Storm Chantal made the first U.S. landfall of the season in early July, and its remnants caused flooding in North Carolina that killed an 83-year-old woman when her car was swept off a rural road.",

    "story": [
      "The voting technology company suing Fox News for defamation is now entangled in a widening bribery investigation",
      "MIAMI -- Smartmatic, the elections-technology company suing Fox News for defamation, is now contending with a growing list of criminal allegations against some of its executives \u2014 including a new claim by federal prosecutors that a \u201cslush fund\u201d for bribing foreign officials was financed partly with proceeds from the sale of voting machines in Los Angeles.",
      "The new details about the criminal case surfaced this month in court filings in Miami, where the company's co-founder, Roger Pinate, and two Venezuelan colleagues were charged last year with bribing officials in the Philippines in exchange for a contract to help run that country's 2016 presidential elections. Pinate, who no longer works for Smartmatic, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "To buttress the case, federal prosecutors are seeking to introduce evidence they argue shows that some of the nearly $300 million the company was paid by Los Angeles County to help modernize its voting systems was diverted to a fund controlled by Pinate through the use of overseas shell companies, fake invoices and other means.",
      "Smartmatic itself hasn't been charged with breaking any laws, nor have U.S. prosecutors accused Smartmatic or its executives of tampering with election results. Similarly, they haven't accused Los Angeles County officials of wrongdoing, or said whether they were even aware of the alleged bribery scheme. County officials say they weren\u2019t.",
      "But the case against Pinate is unfolding as Smartmatic is pursuing a $2.7 billion lawsuit accusing Fox of defamation for airing false claims that the company helped rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Fox says it was legitimately reporting newsworthy allegations.",
      "Smartmatic said the Justice Department\u2019s new filing was filled with \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d and is \u201cuntethered from reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet us be clear: Smartmatic wins business because we\u2019re the best at what we do,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe operate ethically and abide by all laws always, both in Los Angeles County and every jurisdiction where we operate.\u201d",
      "Still, Fox has gone to court to try to get more information about L.A. County's dealings with Smartmatic. The network has long tried to leverage the bribery allegations to undermine Smartmatic\u2019s narrative about its business prospects \u2013 a key component in calculating any potential damages \u2014 and portray it as a scandal-plagued company brought low by its own legal problems, not Fox's broadcasts.",
      "South Florida-based Smartmatic was founded more than two decades ago by a group of Venezuelans who found early success working for the government of the late Hugo Chavez, a devotee of electronic voting. The company later expanded globally, providing voting machines and other technology to help carry out elections in 25 countries, from Argentina to Zambia.",
      "It was awarded its contract to help with Los Angeles County elections in 2018. The contract, which Smartmatic continues to service, gave the company an important foothold in what was then a fast-expanding U.S. voting-technology market.",
      "But Smartmatic has said its business tanked after Fox News gave President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers a platform to paint the company as part of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election.",
      "Fox itself eventually aired a piece refuting the allegations after Smartmatic\u2019s lawyers complained, but it has aggressively defended itself against the defamation lawsuit in New York.",
      "\u201cFacing imminent financial collapse and indictment, Smartmatic saw a litigation lottery ticket in Fox News\u2019s coverage of the 2020 election,\u201d the network\u2019s lawyers said in a court filing.",
      "Smartmatic has disputed Fox's characterization in court filings as \u201clies\u201d and \u201canother attempt to divert attention from its long-standing campaign of falsehoods and defamation.\"",

      "Fox's lawyers also questioned Logan in a deposition about a dinner a Smartmatic executive bought for him at the members-only Magic Castle club and restaurant in Los Angeles and a Smartmatic-paid trip that Logan made to Taiwan in 2019 to oversee the manufacturing of equipment by a Smartmatic vendor. U.S. prosecutors claim that vendor was deeply involved in the alleged kickback scheme in the Philippines. The five-day trip included business class airfare, hotel and numerous meals as well as time for sightseeing, Fox said.",
      "\u201cThe trip\u2019s itinerary demonstrates that the trip was not a financial inspection or audit. It was a boondoggle,\u201d Fox said in court filings.",
      "Logan, who did not report the gifts in his financial disclosures, said in his 2023 deposition that the meal at the Magic Castle was a \u201csocial occasion\u201d unrelated to business and that he was not required to report the trip to Taiwan because his visit was covered by the contract.",
      "Mike Sanchez, a spokesman for Logan's office, said in a statement that the bribery allegations are unrelated to the company\u2019s work for L.A. County and that the county had no knowledge of how the proceeds from its contract would be used. All of Smartmatic\u2019s work has been evaluated for compliance with the contract\u2019s terms, Sanchez added, and as soon as Pinate was indicted he and the other defendants were banned from conducting business with the county.",
      "As for the trip to Taiwan, Sanchez said another county official joined Logan for the trip and the two conducted several on-site visits and conducted detailed reviews of electoral technology products that were required prior the start of their manufacturing.

      "Minnesota has joined a wave of states suing TikTok, claiming the app uses addictive algorithms that harm young people's mental health",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Minnesota on Tuesday joined a wave of states suing TikTok, alleging the social media giant preys on young people with addictive algorithms that trap them into becoming compulsive consumers of its short videos.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t about free speech. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re gonna holler that,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a news conference. \"It\u2019s actually about deception, manipulation, misrepresentation. This is about a company knowing the dangers, and the dangerous effects of its product, but making and taking no steps to mitigate those harms or inform users of the risks.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in state court, alleges that TikTok is violating Minnesota laws against deceptive trade practices and consumer fraud. It follows a flurry of lawsuits filed by more than a dozen states last year alleging the popular short-form video app is designed to be addictive to kids and harms their mental health. Minnesota's case brings the total to about 24 states, Ellison's office said.",
      "Many of the earlier lawsuits stemmed from a nationwide investigation into TikTok launched in 2022 by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general from 14 states into the effects of TikTok on young users\u2019 mental health. Ellison, a Democrat, said Minnesota waited while it did its own investigation.",
      "Sean Padden, a middle-school health teacher in the Roseville Area school district, joined Ellison, saying he has witnessed a correlation between increased TikTok use and an \u201cirrefutable spike in student mental health issues,\u201d including depression, anxiety, anger, lowered self-esteem and a decrease in attention spans as they seek out the quick gratification that its short videos offer.",
      "The lawsuit comes while President Donald Trump is still trying to broker a deal to bring the social media platform, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance, under American ownership over concerns about the data security of its 170 million American users. While Trump campaigned on banning TikTok, he also gained more than 15 million followers on the platform since he started sharing videos on it.",
      "No matter who ultimately owns TikTok, Ellison said, it must comply with the law.",

      "\u201cThis lawsuit is based on misleading and inaccurate claims that fail to recognize the robust safety measures TikTok has voluntarily implemented to support the well-being of our community,\" company spokesperson Nathaniel Brown said in a statement. \"Teen accounts on TikTok come with 50+ features and settings designed to help young people safely express themselves, discover and learn.",
      "\"Through our Family Pairing tool, parents can view or customize 20+ content and privacy settings, including screen time, content filters, and our time away feature to pause a teen\u2019s access to our app,\u201d Brown added.",
      "Minnesota is seeking a declaration that TikTok's practices are deceptive, unfair or unconscionable under state law, a permanent injunction against those practices, and up to $25,000 for each instance in which a Minnesota child has accessed TikTok. Ellison wouldn't put a total on that but said, \u201cit's a lot.\u201d He estimated that \u201chundreds of thousands of Minnesota kids\u201d have TikTok on their devices.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to shut them down, but we are insisting that they clean up their act,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cThere are legitimate uses of products like TikTok. But like all things, they have to be used properly and safely.\u201d",
      "Minnesota is also among dozens of U.S. states that have sued Meta Platforms for allegedly building features into Instagram and Facebook that addict people. The messaging service Snapchat and the gaming platform Roblox are also facing lawsuits by some other states alleging harm to kids.",

      "Graven, 46, also known as Jean Pormanove, died on Monday in Nice during a broadcast on the Kick livestreaming platform that had been running for more than 298 hours.

      "President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker. If the goal is realized, the investment would deepen the Trump administration's involvement in the computer industry as the president ramps up the pressure for more U.S. companies to manufacture products domestically instead of relying on overseas suppliers.",
      "The Trump administration is in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "In his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "That's what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \u201camazing story.\u201d",
      "The company isn't commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut.",

The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Although rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",
      "Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn\u2019t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.",
      "The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program \u2014 money that Lutnick derided as a \u201cgiveaway\u201d that would better serve U.S. taxpayers if it\u2019s turned into Intel stock. \u201cWe think America should get the benefit of the bargain,\u201d Lutnick told CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s the right move to make.\u201d",

Clinging to a once-successful formula eventually sank the BlackBerry and its physical keyboard when the iPhone and its touch screen came along nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Apple's pricing of the next iPhone will also be under the spotlight, given that the devices are made in China and India \u2014 two of the prime targets in President Donald Trump's trade war.",
      "But Apple appeared to gain a reprieve from Trump's most onerous threats earlier this month by adding another $100 billion on top of an earlier $500 billion investment pledge to the U.S. The tariff relief may enable Apple to minimize or even avoid price increases for the iPhone, just as Google has done with the Pixel 10 models.",

      "The U.S. Open is starting a day earlier than usual",
      "NEW YORK -- Roger Federer and Maria Sharapova made clear they didn't love the idea of starting a Grand Slam tournament on a Sunday instead of a Monday when the French Open was the first to do it nearly 20 years ago and they were on the schedule for the new, earlier Day 1.",
      "Now that the trend has reached the U.S. Open this year, not every current player is exactly a proponent of the switch, either \u2014 even if the crowds were gathering on-site Sunday morning before the start of competition.",
      "\u201cI hate the Sunday start,\u201d said Jordan Thompson, an Australian who's been ranked as high as No. 26 in singles and No. 3 in doubles. \u201cTournaments don\u2019t start on Sunday; they finish on Sunday. Pretty sure no player would like (it), particularly me.\u201d",
      "Alas, Thompson was scheduled to face Corentin Moutet on Sunday \u2014 but did manage to win in four sets \u2014 as things got going at Flushing Meadows, where there will now be 15 days of singles competition instead of 14, and there's little doubt that more money from all sorts of sources was part of the calculus behind the change.",
      "\u201cI'm not really a fan of it. I don\u2019t know why they had to make it even longer. Well, I know why they did it \u2014 they get to sell tickets for an extra day,\u201d said 2024 U.S. Open runner-up Jessica Pegula, this year's No. 4 seed, who beat Mayar Sherif 6-0, 6-4 on Sunday night in Arthur Ashe Stadium. \u201cI'm not really for it. I don\u2019t think a lot of the players were for it, especially those who play the week before a Slam. It makes everything a little longer and a little harder. I don\u2019t think a lot of players want that.\u201d",
      "Pegula cited this move by the U.S. Tennis Association \u2014 which followed the French Tennis Federation's decision to begin on Sunday in 2006, and the Australian Open's move to do the same in 2024 \u2014 as an example of her sport's repeated failure to ask for, or follow up on, athletes' input. Wimbledon is now the lone major that starts on Monday.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, they ask for player feedback and when we do (respond), they don\u2019t listen to anything we say,\u201d said Pegula, one of 20 players who signed a letter in March sent to the people who run the Grand Slam events to ask for better communication, more contributions to player welfare and a higher share of revenue. \u201cThe way they go about announcing these things, sometimes players aren\u2019t aware.\u201d",
      "This also comes at a time that players have complained about the recent shift to longer non-Slam tournaments that last more than a week.",
      "Those in charge of tennis point to higher prize money that comes from those extended tournaments \u2014 and changes such as the extra day have coincided with increases in prize money, which is up to a record $85 million, including $5 million to each singles champion, at the U.S. Open.",

      "Still, there are players, such as Thompson, two-time U.S. Open semifinalist Frances Tiafoe or Matteo Arnaldi of Italy, who said it's a mistake to set things up so someone who makes a tournament debut on Sunday and wins wouldn't play again until Wednesday, a change to the every-other-day rhythm at the Slams.",

If you can make money on a day and get the guys out there, and we\u2019re already all here anyway (on what used to be) kind of a dead day ... it's not a bad thing.

    "story": [
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is key in President Donald Trump's plan for mass deportations",
      "BRUNSWICK, Ga. -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement is an agency inside the Department of Homeland Security that is integral to President Donald Trump\u2019s vision of carrying out the mass deportations he promised during the campaign. Deportation officers within a unit called Enforcement and Removal Operations are the ones who are responsible for immigration enforcement. They find and remove people from the United States who aren\u2019t American citizens and, for a variety of reasons, no longer can stay in the country.",
      "Some might have gone through immigration court and a judge ordered them removed. Or they were arrested or convicted of certain crimes, or they\u2019ve repeatedly entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa. ICE also manages a growing network of immigration detention facilities around the country where it holds people suspected of immigration violations.",
      "Overall, its activities \u2014 and how it carries them out \u2014 have polarized many Americans in recent months.",
      "After years when the number of deportation officers largely remained even, the agency is now rapidly hiring. Congress this summer passed legislation giving ICE $76.5 billion in new money to help speed up the pace of deportations. That\u2019s nearly 10 times the agency\u2019s current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion is for new staff.",
      "Last week, The Associated Press got a chance to visit the base in southern Georgia where new ICE recruits are trained and to talk to the agency's top leadership. Here are details about four things ICE is doing that came out of those conversations.",
      "ICE currently has about 6,500 deportation officers, and it is aggressively looking to beef up those numbers. Acting Director Todd Lyons says he wants to hire an additional 10,000 by year's end.",
      "The agency has launched a new recruiting website, offered hiring bonuses as high as $50,000, and is advertising at career expos. Lyons said the agency has already received 121,000 applications \u2014 many from former officers.",
      "New recruits are trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia. That's a sprawling facility near the coast where federal law enforcement officers \u2014 not just ICE agents \u2014 from around the country live and train. ICE is looking to more than double the number of instructors who train deportation officers.",
      "Caleb Vitello, who runs training for ICE, says it has cut Spanish-language requirements to reduce training by five weeks, and he's been looking for ways to streamline the training and have recruits do more at the field offices where they're assigned.",
      "As Trump\u2019s effort to deport millions of people has intensified, violent episodes have unfolded as ICE seeks to arrest people. Critics have said ICE is being too heavy-handed in carrying out arrests while ICE says its people are the ones being attacked.",
      "Vitello said the agency tracks every time officers use force as well as any time someone attacks its officers. According to the agency's data, from Jan. 21 through Aug. 5 there were 121 reported assaults of ICE officers compared with 11 during the same period last year.",
      "Lyons said that after recent operations in Los Angeles turned violent, ICE is making gas masks and helmets standard issue for new agents. \"Right now we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019re having to adapt to all different scenarios that we were never trained for in the past,\" he said.",
      "Lyons says the agency is also starting to send out security teams to accompany agents making arrests: \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna allow people to throw rocks anymore, because we\u2019re going to have our own agents and officers there to protect the ones that are actually out there making that arrest.\"",

These officers are like a SWAT team \u2014 deportation officers with special training to assist in difficult situations. They also accompany detainees the agency deems dangerous when they are deported.",
      "\u201cEverybody is trained to serve a warrant,\" Vitello said. \u201cThese guys are trained to serve high-risk warrants.\u201d",
      "There are roughly 450 deportation officers with the special training to serve on these teams, and Lyons says they have been deployed to assist with immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon, and Washington.",

Generally when they're seeking someone they're trying to remove from the country, they have an administrative warrant as opposed to a criminal warrant. That administrative warrant doesn't allow them to enter the house without first getting permission.",

      "The summoning to Paris of Ambassador to France Charles Kushner, following his allegations that the country had not done enough to combat antisemitism, marks his host country's formal displeasure with its top diplomat from the U.S.",
      "Kushner \u2014 the father of Jared Kushner, son-in-law to President Donald Trump \u2014 wrote a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron alleging the country did not do enough to combat antisemitism. France\u2019s foreign ministry has summoned Kushner to appear Monday at the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, saying in a statement that his allegations \u201care unacceptable.\"",
      "The diplomatic discord comes as French-U.S. relations have faced tensions this year amid Trump\u2019s trade war and a split over the future of U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon. France and the U.S. have also been divided on support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, but the split has eased with Trump expressing support for security guarantees and a warm meeting with Macron and other European leaders at the White House last week.",
      "Here's what to know about Charles Kushner:",
      "In the letter released late Sunday, Kushner wrote that \u201cpublic statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence and endanger Jewish life in France,\" urging Macron \u201cto act decisively: enforce hate-crime laws without exception, ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses ... and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.\u201d",
      "In response, the French ministry said that Kushner\u2019s allegations violate international law and the obligation not to interfere with the internal affairs of another country.",
      "The dustup follows Macron\u2019s rejection this past week of accusations from Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that France\u2019s intention to recognize a Palestinian state is fueling antisemitism. France is home to the largest Jewish population in Europe; its estimated 500,000 Jews marks the third-largest Jewish population in the world after Israel and the U.S., as well as approximately 1% of the national population.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott on Sunday evening said it stood by Kushner\u2019s comments. The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Monday.",
      "When he announced his intention to nominate Charles Kushner in November, Trump called him \u201ca tremendous business leader, philanthropist, & dealmaker.\u201d",
      "In May, the Senate confirmed Kushner's appointment 51-45. During hearings, he told senators that he is a child of Holocaust survivors who came to the United States after World War II, and his grandmothers and other members of his family were executed by Nazis.",

      "After pleading guilty to 18 counts, Kushner was sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison. It was the highest sentence he could receive under a plea deal, but less than what Chris Christie, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey at the time and later governor and Republican presidential candidate, had sought.",

In 2018, Charles Kushner told The New York Times that he wasn\u2019t interested in clemency, saying he \u201cwould prefer not to have a pardon\u201d because it would garner publicity.",
      "Kushner founded Kushner Companies, a real estate firm. Married to Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka, Jared Kushner was a senior adviser in Trump's first White House, working on a wide range of issues and policies, including Middle East peace efforts.",
      "Inspired by his father\u2019s time in prison, Jared Kushner pushed Trump to back criminal justice reform legislation and was an integral part of the first Trump administration\u2019s clemency efforts. In his early 20s and a law and business school student in the mid-2000s when his father was sentenced, Jared Kushner suddenly found himself having to run the family\u2019s businesses while shuttling back and forth on weekends to see his father in Alabama.",

      "The first in-person meeting between the two leaders could help flesh out details of a July trade deal between the two countries that has Seoul investing hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. The agreement set tariffs on South Korean goods at 15% after Trump threatened rates as high as 25%.",
      "Trump declared at the time that South Korea would be \u201ccompletely OPEN TO TRADE\u201d with the U.S. and accept goods such as cars and agricultural products. Automobiles are South Korea\u2019s top export to the U.S.",
      "Seoul has one of the largest trade surpluses among Washington\u2019s NATO and Indo-Pacific allies, and countries where the U.S. holds a trade deficit has drawn particular ire from Trump, who wants to eliminate such trade imbalances.",
      "Lee\u2019s office said in announcing the visit that the two leaders plan to discuss cooperating on key manufacturing sectors such as semiconductors, batteries and shipbuilding. The latter has been a particular area of focus for the U.S. president.",
      "On defense, one potential topic is the continued presence of U.S. troops in South Korea and concerns in Seoul that the U.S. will seek higher payments in return.",

      "The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott on Sunday evening said it stood by Kushner's comments, adding: \"Ambassador Kushner is our U.S. government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role.\u201d",

      "Kushner urges Macron \u201cto act decisively: enforce hate-crime laws without exception, ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses ... and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.\u201d",
      "Kushner\u2019s allegations violate international law and the obligation not to interfere with the internal affairs of another country, the French ministry said, and, \u201cThey also fall short of the quality of the transatlantic partnership between France and the United States and of the trust that must prevail between allies.\u201d",

      "There was an elderly couple that came to the shelter and talked with us, and they offered us their trailer so we could actually have a space to live. We stayed in that trailer for the remainder of the year, and I finished my high school in Texas, Henderson High School.",
      "One of the reasons I wanted to become a teacher was because of how these teachers treated us at our lowest points. I remember Coach Propes, the soccer coach who got us soccer cleats and took care of us in that way. I remember Mrs. Rains, the English teacher who had us in our class and had all the supplies ready. I remember Ms. Pellon, the Spanish teacher who also had supplies for us. Mr. McGinnis, he would come in in the early hours to tutor me in chemistry because I missed weeks of school.",

The questions that (students) had, those same questions I had after we evacuated during Hurricane Katrina. I remember thinking, \u2018Are we really never coming back to school?\u2019",
      "I went home that weekend and wrote an open letter to seniors, offering some support and advice. I wrote about what it\u2019s like to lose your senior year. I said that folks will downplay the situation, because they don\u2019t know what it feels like to have their senior year stripped. But I do know.

      "The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said groups challenging a 2013 law banning assault weapons and a second gun control law enacted a decade later could not show that the guns they are still able to possess, including several semi-automatic handguns, are not sufficient for self-defense purposes.",

      "CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa -- It was in Cedar Rapids, surrounded by cornfields, where Iowa artist Grant Wood painted \u201cAmerican Gothic,\u201d the iconic 1930 portrayal of a stern-looking woman and a man with a pitchfork in front of a white frame house.",
      "The city presents many different images today, after more than a century of international migration and faith-based resettlement efforts.",
      "To many newcomers as well as lifelong residents, this heartland river city where migrants from present-day Lebanon built the first U.S. mosque is a welcoming microcosm of America\u2019s melting pot at a time when immigration enforcement is disrupting families and communities.",
      "Hundreds of refugee families were resettled by The Catherine McAuley Center, founded by the Catholic Sisters of Mercy, until the nationwide halt ordered by the Trump administration this spring. At a recent class offered by the center, a Guatemalan woman and her son, along with five men from China, Benin, Togo, Sudan and Congo, sang the U.S. national anthem and rehearsed questions for the citizenship test.",
      "\u201cIt is a matter of meshing or integrating \u2014 how do we get around in the community? How do we find our friends? How do we find bridges across cultural divides?\u201d said Anne Dugger, the center\u2019s director.",
      "As Americans struggle to redefine who belongs in the social fabric, these are snapshots of heartland immigrants and their faith communities.",
      "Bob Kazimour goes to Mass at St. Wenceslaus, where he remembers as a child the liturgy was in Latin and the homily in Czech. It\u2019s the language of generations of his ancestors who left what was then Bohemia in Central Europe to work in Cedar Rapids\u2019 meatpacking plants, forming the area\u2019s first large immigrant group in the mid to late 1800s.",
      "Kazimour can still sing a few Czech carols \u2014 and there\u2019s a Czech choir, a Czech school and a goulash festival to commemorate.",
      "He and other parishioners whose great-great-grandparents went to St. Wenceslaus aren\u2019t certain new generations will keep up Czech customs. But the Catholic parish is growing again after merging with Immaculate Conception, a downtown church with a booming Latin American congregation.",
      "\u201cIn Cedar Rapids, unlike the coasts with lots of problems, we\u2019re Iowa nice. We get along pretty darn well,\u201d Kazimour said.",
      "At the beginning of the 20th century, Lebanese Muslims came to the Midwest, often starting as itinerant merchants before establishing grocery stores. In a few decades, Cedar Rapids had dozens of these businesses \u2014 and a mosque.",
      "Within ten months after Mohamed Mahmoud came to the United States from Sudan in 2022, he opened a halal grocery store in a strip mall a few minutes drive from the Islamic Center of Cedar Rapids, where he prays on Fridays.",
      "\u201cReligion is a part of life wherever you go. If you don\u2019t find a mosque, it\u2019s something missing,\u201d he said in-between serving sweets at a counter with Muslim holiday decorations and American flags. \u201cCedar Rapids is the best option for me to live the rest of my life.\u201d",
      "A few blocks from Mahmoud\u2019s shop, the St. Jude Catholic Church\u2019s Sweet Corn Festival was in full swing. And among the many volunteers sporting 50-year-anniversary festival T-shirts were members of the growing African congregation, mostly from Togo and Congo.",
      "While frying funnel cakes and Snickers bars, Bienvenue D\u2019Almeida described a journey shared by many of St. Jude\u2019s parishioners. Wanting better educational opportunities for their children, they applied for and won the so-called green card lottery, a program for countries with low rates of emigration to the United States.",
      "At St. Jude, the migrants found aid on arrival, and soon built French-speaking ministries, from family groups to choir to monthly French Mass.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's administration has been pushing for the death penalty, but judges are blocking attempts to reverse previous decisions against capital punishment",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- President Donald Trump's administration is faltering in its aggressive pursuit of the death penalty as it revisits cases in which predecessors explicitly decided against seeking capital punishment.",
      "Since taking office in February, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has authorized prosecutors to seek the death penalty against 19 people, including nine defendants in cases in which President Joe Biden's administration had sought lesser sentences. But judges have blocked those reversal attempts for all but two defendants, most recently on Monday in a pair of cases in the U.S. Virgin Islands, showing the limits of the Trump administration's power to undo decisions in cases already well underway.",
      "In pursuing capital punishment, the Justice Department is seeking to follow through on a Trump campaign promise to resume federal executions after they were halted by Biden\u2019s Attorney General Merrick Garland. The Republican president's Justice Department has accused the previous Democratic administration of supplanting \u201cthe will of the people with their own personal beliefs\u201d in failing to seek death sentences in many cases involving horrific crimes.",
      "Detailed opinions haven't been issued in the most recent two cases, which involve a man accused of killing a police officer in 2022 and two men accused of armed robbery and murder in 2018. But other judges who have rejected reversal attempts on constitutional and procedural grounds were blunt in their assessment of the Trump administration\u2019s approach.",
      "\u201cThe government has proceeded hastily in this case, and in doing so has leapfrogged important constitutional and statutory rights,\" Trump appointee U.S. Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland wrote in June, striking the notice of intent to seek the death penalty against three alleged MS-13 gang members accused of killing two teenage girls in 2020. \u201cThat is unacceptable.\u201d",
      "Authorization of capital prosecution typically occurs years before trial, but in the Maryland case, prosecutors filed the death penalty notice less than four months before the trial was scheduled to start. None of the defendants were represented by attorneys who specialize in death penalty litigation, which they would have been entitled to under federal law due to the complexity of capital cases and the potential consequences.",
      "\u201cThe government does not hide the ball here \u2014 the only reason for its flip-flop on the death penalty was the change in administration,\u201d wrote Gallagher, who called the government\u2019s \u201cwillful blindness\u201d to the differences between capital and non-capital trials \u201cstartling.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis court will not cast aside decades of law, professional standards, and norms to accommodate the government\u2019s pursuit of its agenda,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOf course, elections have consequences, and this administration is entitled to pursue the death penalty in cases where it can do so in accordance with constitutional and statutory requirements. But this is not one of them.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors in Maryland and in a Nevada case declined to comment, but in court documents they argued that the Justice Department has an \u201cinherent power\u201d to reconsider previous decisions and that the timing of the death notice was \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d given that the defendants had years to prepare for trial.",
      "\u201cThe Attorney General has simply reconsidered an earlier decision, which it is her prerogative to do so, and exercising that inherent authority is not misconduct but basic management and governance,\u201d wrote Maryland\u2019s U.S. Attorney Kelly Hayes. \u201cAt no point did the Government make an enforceable promise. Deciding not to seek certain charges is not a promise not to do so.\u201d",
      "Trump, whose first administration carried out a record-setting 13 federal executions, signed an order on his first day back in the White House compelling the Justice Department to seek the death penalty in appropriate federal cases and support capital punishment in states. Bondi, who has said she will seek the death penalty \u201cwhenever possible,\u201d quickly lifted a Biden-era moratorium on federal executions and ordered a review of decisions made by the previous administration.",

      "The 120-day deadline for that review has passed with no official word on the results, but a senior Justice Department official told The Associated Press that all but about 30 cases have been examined. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under terms set by the department, said roughly 1,400 decisions not to seek the death penalty were issued by Garland, with all but 459 having already been fully adjudicated by the time Trump took office.",
      "Bondi isn\u2019t the first attorney general to review past cases: Not only did Garland authorize just one death penalty case during his tenure, he also withdrew 35 notices of intent to seek the death penalty issued by his predecessors. The Justice Department says the Bondi-ordered review was essentially \u201cthe flip side\u201d of Garland's action and was the right thing to do to ensure consistency and achieve justice for victims and their families.",
      "But Robin Maher, executive of the Death Penalty Information Center, said while the Biden administration\u2019s actions reflected declining public support for the death penalty, Trump has brushed that aside.",
      "\u201cSo his enthusiasm for use of the death penalty is different not only from President Biden\u2019s more cautious approach, it\u2019s different from every other president\u2019s approach in history,\u201d said Maher, whose organization doesn\u2019t take a position on capital punishment but is critical of how it is used.",
      "Whether the reversals will stand remains a question in two of the cases. In the others, courts have sided with defendants who said they reasonably relied on assurances made by the previous administration. In court documents, lawyers for some of the defendants said they would have pursued plea bargains or objected to postponing trial dates had they known the death penalty decision would be reversed.",
      "\u201cIn some of these cases, very different paths were taken when those assurances were given,\u201d Maher said.",
      "In Nevada, prosecutors notified Cory Spurlock of their intention to seek the death penalty just 12 days before he was set to go on trial for the 2021 deaths of a California couple. Striking down that notice in May, Judge Miranda Du said the government fell far short of justifying its \u201cwholesale reversal at the eleventh hour.\u201d The trial began this week after prosecutors withdrew their appeal of her ruling.",
      "\u201cThe government decided \u2014 certainly not by inadvertence or accident \u2014 to reverse course on an issue of critical importance, involving Spurlock\u2019s life, less than two weeks before trial, with full knowledge that the reversal would have a chaotic impact on the progression of this case and would make it impossible to proceed to trial on the scheduled date,\u201d wrote Du, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, a Democrat. \u201cUnder the circumstances, this is certainly tantamount to playing \u2018fast and loose\u2019 with the Court\u2019s orders in particular and the judicial process in general.\u201d",

      "The former Trump national security adviser whose home and office are being searched by federal agents has been a vocal critic of the Republican president",
      "John Bolton, whose home and office were searched by federal agents on Friday, has been one of the most vocal critics of President Donald Trump since serving as a national security adviser in Trump's first administration.",
      "After serving in the White House, Bolton wrote a scathing book that portrayed Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy. FBI agents' searches of Bolton\u2019s Maryland home and Washington office, purportedly part of an investigation into the handling of classified information, raise the question of possible future actions against critics of the Republican president who have voiced their opinions.",
      "Bolton was not detained and has not been charged with any crimes, a person not authorized to discuss the investigation by name told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Here's more information on Bolton, a Republican and foreign policy hawk:",
      "Bolton served as Trump\u2019s third national security adviser, appointed in 2018 after Trump dismissed H.R. McMaster.",
      "Bolton's 17-month tenure was rife with clashes over countries including North Korea and Iran, with him voicing skepticism over Trump's outreach toward and summit with Kim Jong Un. On Iran, Bolton backed Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal but favored regime change and was frustrated when Trump called off a planned military strike in 2019.",
      "Those rifts ultimately led to Bolton's departure, with Trump announcing on social media in September 2019 that he had accepted Bolton's resignation.",
      "Bolton's 2020 book, \u201cThe Room Where It Happened,\u201d painted an unvarnished portrait of Trump and his administration, amounting to the most vivid first-person account at the time of how Trump conducts himself in office. The 577-page book portrayed Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy, with Bolton writing that the president \u201csaw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.\u201d",
      "Bolton wrote that while he was at the White House, Trump typically had only two intelligence briefings a week \u201cand in most of those, he spoke at greater length than the briefers, often on matters completely unrelated to the subjects at hand.\u201d",
      "On Ukraine, Bolton alleged that Trump directly tied providing military aid to the country\u2019s willingness to conduct investigations into Joe Biden, soon-to-be Trump's Democratic 2020 election rival, and members of his family. In one conversation, Trump said \u201che wasn\u2019t in favor of sending them anything until all the Russia-investigation materials related to Clinton and Biden had been turned over,\u201d Bolton wrote.",
      "Bolton also wrote that he felt \u201chard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn\u2019t driven by re-election calculations,\" noting how Trump \u201cpleaded\u201d with China\u2019s Xi Jinping during a 2019 summit to help his reelection prospects.",
      "Trump responded by slamming Bolton as a \u201cwashed-up guy\u201d and a \u201ccrazy\u201d war-monger who would have led the country into \u201cWorld War Six.\u201d Trump also said at the time that the book contained \u201chighly classified information\" and that Bolton \u201cdid not have approval\u201d for publishing it.",
      "The White House worked furiously to block the book, unsuccessfully asking a federal court for an emergency temporary restraining order against its release.",
      "In an interview that aired Wednesday on NPR, Bolton said little has changed in bringing an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, pointing to Trump\u2019s efforts to secure a Nobel Peace Prize as the president's motivation to end the conflict.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no indication at all that Russia has in any way changed its objective, which is to bring Ukraine into the greater Russian Empire,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cNor is there any real sign that Zelenskyy is prepared to do the sorts of things that Russia has demanded of President Trump, such as ceding a substantial part of the Donetsk Oblast or province, which the Russians have not yet been able to conquer militarily.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Bolton posted to X that \u201cPutin\u2019s KGB training and flattery campaign is working Trump over, as seen by Trump\u2019s statement recently about how Ukraine shouldn\u2019t have taken the war on. It\u2019s important to remember: Ukraine didn\u2019t take anything on, they were invaded.\u201d",

      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has dropped an investigation into a buy now, pay later company linked to President Donald Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. The agency says the investigation was politically motivated against firearms companies and T...",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has dropped an investigation into a buy now, pay later company with close ties to President Donald Trump's son Donald Trump Jr., saying the investigation was conducted in a biased manner and based off politics.",
      "The CFPB on Tuesday notified Credova Financial, a subsidiary of Public Square Holdings, where Trump Jr. is a board member and investor, that it was no longer under investigation. Public Square is a directory of businesses that sell American-made products, including financing for firearms and family pets, that market to conservative-leaning customers. Credova provides buy now, pay later services to Trump Jr.\u2019s GrabAGun firearms marketplace, which went public this year.",
      "The agency says the investigation, initiated during Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, was politically motivated against firearms companies and Trump Jr. However, the company has a record of dozens if not hundreds of consumer complaints and settlements over state consumer protection violations.",
      "The closure of the investigation also comes when the CFPB, a watchdog agency that helps oversee the nation\u2019s banks and financial services companies, has been undoing rulemaking, dropping other cases and ending law enforcement work that was done under previous administrations, including Trump's first term.",
      "The CFPB in Trump's second term determined the Credova investigation \u201cexemplifies the type of weaponization against disfavored industries and individuals\" that Trump and the agency's acting director, Russell Vought, are committed to ending, according to a letter sent to the chief counsel of Public Square Holdings. The CFPB during Biden's term ratcheted up settlement demands on the company the day Trump Jr. joined Public Square's board of directors, the letter said.",
      "Former CFPB employees, from during Biden's term, declined to speak about the decision, saying they're not permitted to discuss investigations.",
      "Michael Seifert, chairman and CEO of Public Square, said in a statement that the closure of the CFPB investigation \u201cconfirms the strength and integrity of our company and validates the trust our merchants and consumers place in us\u201d and is \u201da win for our entire company, our board, our customers, and a 2nd Amendment community that has seen years of government attempts to regulate businesses like ours out of existence.\"",
      "However, the firm had for years been accused of charging junk fees to customers or violating state consumer protection rules.",
      "In 2021, Credova and another Nevada-based finance firm reached a settlement with the Massachusetts attorney general's office to waive balances totaling more than $126,000 to resolve allegations they illegally leased dogs in violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act.",
      "In January 2024, Credova and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation entered into a consent order to resolve allegations the firm failed to disclose potential third-party fees to consumers. As a result, Credova was required to pay a $50,000 penalty and disclose potential third-party convenience fees to consumers in the future.",
      "There have also been more than 50 consumer complaints filed against Credova to the CFPB, a search of the database shows. Many of the complaints relate to debt collection practices.",

The findings prompted the Houston transit authority, METRO and other agencies to begin work to redesign their bus stops to provide relief from the heat, Lanza said.",
      "As of June, according to reporting from Houston Public Media, six shelters have been redesigned to allow more airflow, with more stops expected to be replaced over the next six months.",
      "In 2023, Cap Metro, the transit authority in Austin, also used Lanza\u2019s study to develop a plan to mitigate heat impacts by planting more tree across the city and near existing bus stops.",
      "Julia Silver, a lifelong resident of California, used to spend her summers with her family at an outdoor public pool. Now, amid record-breaking heat waves, Silver and her family have spent the majority of the summer inside their Los Angeles home, the local mall or other air-conditioned facilities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of become unbearable during those hot summer days to spend time outside,\u201d said Silver, a researcher at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute.",
      "In June, Institute launched a Latino Climate and Health Dashboard, which creates a centralized source that shows the climate disparities Latino neighborhoods across California. Developed with guidance from a statewide advisory committee of climate justice, public health, and data equity experts, the dashboard shows 90% of California's Latino population faces climate inequities, from higher air pollution to more days of extreme heat than white residents.",
      "\u201cThe disparities shown in the dashboard are not random,\u201d said Silver, a senior research analyst at the LLPI and the project\u2019s leader.",
      "Silver said the main purpose of the dashboard is to ensure local leaders, community groups, government agencies and others have access to trustworthy data that reflects the experience communities in California and so many other states are facing.",
      "\u201cThe more climate change intensifies the more difficult it is for people to live, and the more dangerous it is for people to be outside,\u201d Silver said.",
      "The dashboard will help create a shift to more inclusive climate planning by helping organizations understand who is most affected and where the greatest needs are.",
      "\u201cBy shining a light on these patterns, we can start correcting them,\u201d said Arturo Vargas Bustamante, research faculty director at LPPI and principal investigator for the project.",

      "About 1.2 million people were under extreme heat risk, meaning temperatures were expected to stay dangerously high with no relief overnight.

    "summary": "Jerry Adler's acting credits include \"The Sopranos\" and \"The Good Wife.\" He also had 53 Broadway productions to his name, all behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \"passed peacefully in his sleep,\" Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \"The Sopranos,\" on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \"The Good Wife,\" where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\"I'm a creature of nepotism,\" Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \"I got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\"",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \"My Fair Lady\" and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \"Santa Barbara.\"",
      "\"I was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\" he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \"The Public Eye\" and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \"chills\" when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \"Northern Exposure\" paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \"The Sopranos.\"",
      "\"When David was going to do the pilot for 'The Sopranos' he called and asked me if I would do a cameo of Hesh. It was just supposed to be a one-shot,\" he told Forward in 2015. \"But when they picked up the show they liked the character, and I would come on every fourth week.\"",
      "Films included Woody Allen's \"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\" but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \"Rescue Me,\" \"Mad About You,\" \"Transparent\" and guest spots on shows ranging from \"The West Wing\" to \"Broad City.\"",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \"Taller Than a Dwarf\" in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \"Fish in the Dark.\"",
      "\"I do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\" Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \"I wouldn't know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that's when I'll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\"",
      "Adler published a memoir, \"Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\" last year. \"I'm ready to go at a moment's notice,\" he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \"too goofy-looking\" to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",
      "\"I'm immortal,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A man on trial for organizing the ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph\u00a0at a Memphis bakery in 2021 has been found not guilty.",
      "A Memphis jury deliberated about three hours before finding Hernandez Govan, 45, not guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. He rejected an offer from the state last month to settle with a guilty plea, CBS News affiliate WREG\u00a0reported.",
      "On Thursday, Govan hugged his lawyer and thanked Shelby County Judge Jennifer Mitchell after she told him he was free to go.",
      "Govan was not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claimed he directed the two people who did. The jury was not convinced, however, despite a man's testimony that Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut.",
      "Govan's lawyer questioned the quality of the police investigation and the validity of cellphone communications between Govan and the men who shot Dolph, arguing that nothing in the communications directly incriminated Govan or tied him to the killings.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works.",
      "On the day of the 2021 ambush, the 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Authorities said two men exited a white Mercedes-Benz and began shooting at the rapper at the bakery. He died after being shot about 20 times, according to a medical examiner's report.",
      "Four years earlier, Young Dolph suffered critical injuries\u00a0in a 2017 attack, when three men approached and shot him over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Earlier that same year, he had been involved in a separate shooting where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",
      "Testifying against Govan was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the two shooters who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter.",
      "Smith faces charges for murder and conspiracy to commit murder for his alleged role in Young Dolph's death. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and does not currently have a trial date set. Johnson was originally sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole following his 2024 conviction, plus an additional 35 years for two additional convictions from his trial.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed Young Dolph's killing as part of an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, rapper Yo Gotti. Smith has testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "At Johnson's earlier trial, a prosecutor told jurors Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant in January 2024.",
      "Smith testified Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits,\" including giving Smith guns for the killing, and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the Thanksgiving turkey giveaway, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Prosecutors introduced as evidence dozens of cellphone communications between Johnson, Smith, Govan and Big Jook ahead of the shooting.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said on Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "Govan did not testify in his defense.",
      "Smith is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder but has pleaded not guilty and does not yet have a trial date.",
      "Johnson was sentenced last September to life in prison with the possibility of parole. He was later sentenced for two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",

      "Drugs known as\u00a0GLP-1 receptor agonists\u00a0mimic a hormone in the body known as glucagon-like peptide 1, which helps signal fullness to the brain and regulate blood sugar. Ozempic is typically used for diabetes while Saxenda, Wegovy and Zepbound are approved for weight loss.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mississippi-infant-deaths-public-health-emergency/",
    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 11:42:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Mississippi's infant mortality rate nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health.",
    "story": [
      "Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency after releasing data showing the state's infant mortality rate\u00a0has risen to its highest level in more than a decade.",
      "In Mississippi, 9.7 infants died for every 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health. Since 2014, more than 3,500 Mississippi infants have died before their first birthday.",
      "The decision to declare a public health emergency places Mississippi's struggle within\u00a0a wider national story. Here's what to know.",
      "Infant mortality rate a nationwide concern",
      "Even in cities with strong healthcare systems, such as Boston, Black infants continue to die at far higher rates than their White peers.",
      "In Boston, the city's most recent report showed Black infants dying at more than twice the rate of the overall population and triple the rate of White infants, despite the city's overall infant mortality rate falling below the national average. Public health experts say both examples underscore the limits of focusing only on individual behavior or clinical care when structural inequities are key drivers of infant deaths.",
      "\"Every single infant loss represents a family devastated, a community impacted, and a future cut short,\" said State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney, who announced the Mississippi declaration. \"We cannot and will not accept these numbers as our reality.\"",
      "What is causing higher infant mortality rate?",
      "The leading causes of infant death in Mississippi include congenital malformations, premature birth, low birthweight, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.",
      "Disparities remain stark \u2014 Black infants in Mississippi are more than twice as likely as White infants to die before their first birthday, and recent state data show those racial gaps have widened.",
      "Despite growing concerns, declaring a public health emergency for infant mortality is unusual.",
      "\"This is a novel and necessary step,\" said Dr. Michael Warren, Chief Medical and Health Officer at March of Dimes. \"It elevates infant mortality to the level of urgent crisis response, which it truly is.\"",
      "Why a public health emergency was declared",
      "State officials said the declaration allows them to move more quickly to address gaps in care.",
      "Their plan includes expanding prenatal services in counties without obstetric providers, creating an obstetric system of care to regionalize services and improve emergency transfers, and strengthening home visiting and community health worker programs.",
      "\"Improving maternal health is the best way to reduce infant mortality,\" Dr. Edney said.",
      "Dr. Morgan McDonald, National Director for Population Health at New York-based nonprofit Milbank Memorial Fund, said the declaration \"should draw our attention to a problem that is tragic and preventable.\"",
      "She added: \"We applaud Dr. Edney and his public health team for raising the alarm in a way that honors the families who have suffered this tragedy and also focuses attention on concrete solutions.\"",
      "Experts caution, however, that individual and clinical interventions alone cannot solve the problem.",
      "\"Healthy babies come from healthy moms,\" said Dr. Rebekah Gee, former Louisiana health secretary and now CEO of Nest Health, a New Orleans-based company which provides in-home whole-family care, with a focus on those covered by Medicaid. \"If women can't get continuous healthcare before, during, and after pregnancy, it is no surprise their babies are dying at higher rates.\"",
      "Dr. Stephen Patrick, a neonatologist and professor at Emory University, added that treating infant deaths as a series of isolated medical cases misses the broader reality. \"So much of what we see in neonatal intensive care units reflects challenges that moms face long before delivery \u2014 poverty, access to healthcare, housing, even transportation,\" Patrick said.",
      "Health care programs and infant health",
      "Federal funding cuts are also complicating the state's response to the crisis.",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program that collects state-specific data on maternal and infant health, has been targeted for elimination. CDC staffers who carried out the survey established nearly 40 years ago to improve maternal and infant health outcomes were fired in June.",
      "Mississippi relied on PRAMS to track maternal behaviors before, during, and after pregnancy, and to monitor infant outcomes. Many of CDC's Safe Motherhood initiatives are also in jeopardy of losing funding, which would affect maternal mortality surveillance, infant sleep safety programs, and hospital-based collaboratives designed to standardize care.",
      "\"Without robust data, we are flying blind,\" Patrick said.",
      "Analysts also warn that such cuts could limit the state's ability to detect trends such as unsafe sleep practices or gaps in postpartum care.",
      "\"It's willful ignorance to cut vital maternal and child health programs when we have public health crises of both maternal mortality and infant mortality in this country,\" said a former CDC Division of Reproductive Health staffer who lost their job in a recent reduction in force. \"For many people, it's downright dangerous to be pregnant in the U.S. in the 21st century. And that is shameful.\"",
      "Polling suggests most Americans support maintaining these programs. According to the Emory-Rollins National Child Policy Poll, 65% of Americans say PRAMS is important for improving outcomes for mothers and infants, while fewer than one in ten believe it is not needed.",
      "Similarly, only 16% supported ending federal funding for the long-running \"Safe to Sleep\" campaign, which educated parents about reducing risks of sleep-related infant deaths.",
      "How changes to Medicaid will impact Mississippi",
      "Medicaid\u00a0plays an outsized role in Mississippi, financing almost 6 in 10 of births in the state, compared to about 4 in 10 nationally, according a\u00a0KFF Health News analysis of government data.",
      "In 2023, the state extended postpartum\u00a0Medicaid coverage\u00a0from two months to a full year. But Mississippi has\u00a0not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, leaving many low-income women uninsured before or between pregnancies.",
      "Meanwhile, Congressional proposals could reshape Medicaid coverage, including the reconciliation bill already passed by Congress which would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "Dr. McDonald noted that since Mississippi is not a Medicaid expansion state, it would not be subject to most of the work requirement and frequent redetermination provisions of President Trump's so-called \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "KFF analysts estimate that bill's funding caps and work requirements could raise Mississippi's uninsured rate by 1 to 2%, potentially leaving 20,000 to 40,000 more residents without coverage.",
      "Public health experts say such policies could destabilize rural hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement, in turn limiting access to prenatal and delivery services in regions already described as \"OB deserts.\"",
      "Other states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have seen measurable improvements in infant health.",
      "Arkansas, for example, reported a 29% reduction in Black infant mortality in the five years following expansion. In Louisiana, which expanded Medicaid in 2016, researchers documented increases in early prenatal care and decreases in premature births. Colorado also saw declines in infant mortality, particularly in rural areas, as more women gained access to continuous coverage before, during, and after pregnancy.",
      "Nationally, one analysis found a 50% greater reduction in infant mortality in expansion states compared to those that did not expand Medicaid, with the steepest gains among Black infants. Today, 40 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, while Mississippi remains one of 10 holdouts.",
      "The U.S. has long treated infant mortality as a measure of societal health. More than a century ago, sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that high rates of infant deaths among Black families reflected inequities in living conditions rather than innate differences.",
      "Mississippi's emergency declaration and Boston's persistent disparities suggest those inequities remain deeply entrenched. State officials said the declaration is intended to galvanize coordinated action across hospitals, state agencies, and community groups.",
      "\"It will take all of us working together to give every child the chance to live, thrive, and celebrate their first birthday,\" Dr. Edney said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Kilmar Abrego Garcia is being processed for deportation to Uganda, the Department of Homeland Security said, after he was taken into custody Monday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, days after his release from criminal custody.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, was mistakenly deported to his home country in March and held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months before being returned to the U.S. in June where he was jailed on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.",
      "Abrego Garcia was freed from pretrial detention last Friday. CBS News reported on Saturday that his attorneys were then sent a court-required notice of his potential\u00a0deportation to Uganda. He arrived at the ICE facility on Monday morning to check in, speaking in Spanish to supporters who had gathered in a show of support outside of the facility.",
      "\"There was no need for them to take him into ICE detention. He was already on electronic monitoring from the U.S. Marshals Service and basically on house arrest,\" his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him. To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.\"",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg filed a new lawsuit on Abrego Garcia's behalf on Monday challenging his confinement and deportation to any country \"unless and until he had a fair trial in an immigration court.\"",
      "The U.S. district court in Maryland soon issued an order preventing the government from immediately removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S. or altering his legal status, meaning his deportation is on hold for now. The order will remain in effect until 4 p.m. Wednesday unless Judge Paula Xinis, who is assigned to the case, extends it. The court has issued the standing order in all cases involving migrant detainees challenging the legality of their detentions in recent months, a move the Justice Department is challenging as unlawful.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his family denies.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said\u00a0in a statement that ICE had arrested Abrego Garcia and was \"processing him for deportation.\" DHS said he is \"being processed for removal to Uganda.\" The U.S. reached an agreement with Uganda to accept some deportees last week.",
      "\"President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,\" Noem said.",
      "In a legal filing over the weekend, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he was offered a plea deal that included deportation to Costa Rica. His attorneys said they then received a notice of his possible deportation to Uganda. Sandoval-Moshenberg clarified Monday that Abrego Garcia had stated that he was willing to accept refugee status in Costa Rica.",
      "\"The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a manner that is completely unconstitutional,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Monday.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg said an ICE officer did not answer when asked about the reason for Abrego Garcia's detention and would not say which detention center he would be taken to, or commit to providing paperwork.",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who traveled to El Salvador to advocate for the return of Abrego Garcia earlier this year, met with him Sunday. Van Hollen said in a statement that he was glad to \"welcome him back to Maryland after what has been a long and torturous nightmare.\"",
      "\"The federal courts and public outcry forced the Administration to bring \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to Maryland, but Trump's cronies continue to lie about the facts in his case and they are engaged in a malicious abuse of power as they threaten to deport him to Uganda \u2014 to block his chance to defend himself against the new charges they brought,\" Van Hollen said. \"As I told Kilmar and his wife Jennifer, we will stay in this fight for justice and due process because if his rights are denied, the rights of everyone else are put at risk.\"",
      "An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia may not be deported to El Salvador because he feared persecution by local gangs in the Central American country.",

    "story": [
      "As measles surged in Texas early this year, the Trump administration's actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency's most critical function \u2014 emergency response \u2014 when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows.",
      "The outbreak soon became the worst the United States has endured in over three decades.",
      "In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration interfered with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, stalled the agency's reports, censored its data, and abruptly laid off staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.",
      "\"CDC hasn't reached out to us locally,\" Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. \"My staff feels like we are out here all alone,\" she added.",
      "A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.",
      "\"All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,\" one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. \"All this training and then we weren't allowed to do anything.\"",
      "Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, researchers estimate. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.",
      "The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces as vaccination rates drop, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.",
      "While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fueled doubt in vaccines and exaggerated the ability of vitamins to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The Texas outbreak spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Mexico's Chihuahua state \u2014 at minimum. Together these linked outbreaks have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.",
      "\"This is absolutely outrageous,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \"When you're battling contagious diseases, time is everything.\"",
      "\"The CDC is 'stressed' currently\"",
      "Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in late January had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren't getting tested.",
      "\"I think this may be very large,\" she wrote in a Feb. 3 email to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in another email what she'd learned from conversations with people in the community: \"According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November.\"",
      "In that email and others, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.",
      "One email asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC's recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.",
      "\"Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?\" Wells wrote on Feb. 5.",
      "\"It never hurts to ask the CDC,\" said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.",
      "\"I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified,\" Milton wrote. \"Of course, we know the CDC is 'stressed' currently.\"",
      "Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the Immunization Partnership, a Texas nonprofit.",
      "\"The CDC had gone dark,\" said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. \"We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn't expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit.\"",
      "Technically, the Trump administration's freeze on federal communications had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after.",
      "\"There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,\" one CDC scientist said.",
      "Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. \"Like most public health organizations, we weren't able to get ahold of our program people in February,\" he said. Information trickled out through the CDC's communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. \"The CDC was gagged,\" he said.",
      "Through private conversations, Benjamin said he learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration lay off CDC staffers in droves.",
      "\"It's not that the CDC was delinquent,\" Benjamin said. \"It's that they had their hands tied behind their backs.\"",
      "To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn't need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. \"We would always offer a conversation and ask if there's anything we could do,\" she said.",
      "Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state's correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records \"confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code.\"",
      "Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That's corroborated in emails from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.",
      "\"Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC,\" Zach Holbrooks, the health district's executive director, told KFF Health News.",
      "Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren't already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn't spread measles to others.",
      "Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in close-knit Mennonite communities where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn't want to be tested, didn't want to name their contacts, and didn't want to talk with the health department. \"It doesn't matter what resources I have if people won't avail themselves of it,\" Holbrooks said.",
      "Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against COVID-19 restrictions deepened that mistrust.",
      "Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some live in the U.S. illegally, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. Locals guess the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is far larger than the U.S. Census count.",
      "\"I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don't know how many people are in the community,\" Holbrooks said. \"There's a lot of people in the shadows out here.\"",
      "Public health experts say the situation in Gaines County sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.",
      "About 450 people \u2014 including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers \u2014 helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in Clark County, Washington, in 2018.",
      "Alan Melnick, Clark County's public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. \"We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,\" he said.",
      "Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.",
      "In New York, hundreds of people in the city's health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.",
      "The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City's assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to data from prior outbreaks. Then there's the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and the lasting toll of some measles infections, including deafness or worse.",
      "\"I don't think there's a price tag to put on a child's death that would otherwise be prevented,\" Zucker said.",
      "Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells emailed a colleague: \"I'm so overwhelmed.\"",
      "A death ignites a response",
      "On Feb. 26, Texas announced that a 6-year-old child had died of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a brief notice on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.",
      "In emails, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC's notice might exacerbate a problem: Doctors were treating children with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet reported on a large drugstore where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were \"flying off the shelf.\"",
      "Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and dire abnormalities during fetal development.",
      "Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups \u2014 including one founded by Kennedy \u2014 that diminished the need for vaccination by inaccurately claiming that vitamin A staved off the disease's worst outcomes.",
      "\"How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?\" Milton asked in an email.",
      "Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. \"HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials,\" one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency's notices and alerts. \"If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven't seen those babies born yet.\"",
      "Another CDC official said they've had to \"walk a fine line\" between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS.",
      "While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. \"We're providing vitamin A,\" Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News. \"There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,\" he claimed, \"against serious disease and death.\"",
      "The studies Kennedy referenced were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is seldom useful against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.",
      "Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, saying that any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with numerous inaccurate statements. \"There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year,\" he said. \"It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.\" There is no evidence that measles vaccines \"cause deaths every year.\" Scores of studies show that the vaccine doesn't cause encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.",
      "In another interview, Kennedy said, \"The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.\" The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine does not contain an iota of fetal cells.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.",
      "\"Staff are exhausted\"",
      "Despite national attention after the country's first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.",
      "\"Local hospitals are at capacity,\" wrote Jeffrey Hill, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. \"The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now,\" he added.",
      "\"I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,\" Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in an email, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. \"Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted.\"",
      "The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.",
      "None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It spread to Mexico when an unvaccinated Mennonite child visited relatives in Seminole and returned home with an infection. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen in decades, with at least 3,700 cases and 13 deaths in the state of Chihuahua.",
      "Then another child in West Texas died of measles.",
      "In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine advisory meeting in late April. \"There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,\" Sugarman said. \"We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.\"",
      "Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. \"A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,\" he said, \"and didn't see the need to confirm it.\"",
      "On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas outbreak over, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.",
      "The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.",
      "More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding not to vaccinate their kids, alarmed by unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers lacking expertise in vaccines and infectious disease, including some who have expressed anti-vaccine views. One of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, blamed the deaths of children with measles on \"medical mismanagement,\" without evidence.",
      "At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than $11 billion in public health funds earlier this year.",
      "Amid Lubbock's toughest months, Wells sent an email to the department's exhausted staff. \"The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us,\" she wrote. \"Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience.\"",

    "summary": "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said President Trump's rhetoric on crime is \"purely performative\" as the president offered to send troops to Baltimore amid a broader push to crack down on crime.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday that President Trump's rhetoric on crime is \"purely performative\" as the president has offered to send troops to Baltimore amid a push to crack down on crime that began in the nation's capital in recent weeks and could extend to other major cities.",
      "\"While the President is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime. But it's falling on deaf ears of the president of the United States,\" Moore said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mr. Trump moved to federalize the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department earlier this month and deployed the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement, despite data showing crime has declined in the city in recent years.",
      "Upon announcing the moves, the president outlined that the effort \"will go further,\" saying the administration is \"starting very strongly with D.C.\" and suggesting it could then move to other cities, though the president has unique authority over the D.C. National Guard because the district is controlled by the federal government. He referenced crime rates in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Baltimore and Oakland.",
      "Last week, Moore, a Democrat, sent a letter to Mr. Trump inviting him to attend a public safety walk in Maryland, while touting the state's investments in local law enforcement and other efforts to address crime under his administration. In 2025, Baltimore has seen a 22% decrease in homicides from last year, according to the Baltimore Police Department.",
      "The governor said Sunday that \"the reason that I asked the president to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance, these tropes and these 1980s scare tactics.\"",
      "\"We know we have work to do,\" Moore said. \"If one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work, and what tactics is just theatrics.\"",
      "Moore's appearance on \"Face the Nation\" came shortly after Mr. Trump took aim at the governor on Truth Social Sunday morning, responding to the mayor's request by saying, \"As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a 'walk.'\"",
      "Although Mr. Trump dismissed Moore's suggestion, he said last week that he would be joining federal authorities in D.C. \"on patrol.\" He instead visited a U.S. Park Police facility in Southeast D.C.",
      "\"Wes Moore's record on Crime is a very bad one, unless he fudges his figures on crime like many of the other 'Blue States' are doing,\" the president added. \"But if Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum did in L.A., I will send in the 'troops,' which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime.\"",
      "The push in D.C. followed the president's move to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles in June amid heated protests over immigration raids, prompting a lawsuit from the California governor, who did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces and called it an illegal \"power grab.\" Mr. Trump and Newsom's sparring has escalated as Newsom's public profile as a potential 2028 candidate has grown.",
      "Moore said Sunday that the operation in D.C. is \"not scalable,\" saying \"you're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city.\" He also argued that the crackdown on crime in the district is \"not sustainable,\" \"deeply disrespectful\" to the National Guard, and \"unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"There is a multitude of reasons that I am against this, and I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this,\" Moore added.",
      "The Maryland governor acknowledged that crime must be addressed, while recalling the aftermath of a mass shooting in Baltimore early in his tenure as governor.",
      "\"I said at that point, 'I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer,'\" Moore said. \"And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the president of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods who believe that progress is possible.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. Good to have you here, Congressman, there's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland, and that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The President encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now, California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well. Why do you so strongly oppose this?",
      "REP. MIKE LAWLER: I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong, and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less, and mine wasn't even one of them, despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat, I won by six and a half points. So when you look at the map across the country, the fact is roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts. They're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and therefore they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that obviously reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond. But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here. Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year in 2024 at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become Speaker. They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting, despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution. So now New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the house. So this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states trying to get electoral advantage right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the President's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the President of United States doesn't want it done?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Look, obviously, it's going to be a fight, but this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms, because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974 never held a job outside of elected office. It's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform. So I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties, because frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority. Period. On the question, though, that we have been- also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The President of the United States has mentioned New York is another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars, and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Crime has been a major problem in New York for years, and Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Do you want National Guard troops?-- ,",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized- Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard's troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime. When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80% of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution, that 80% of these individuals are released back out onto the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington DC, 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. So when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime?",
      "[START CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- No, but that's a local--",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- that's a local issue that would need to get changed. But in terms of the question on the troops--",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- No but- it's- no- but Margaret, this why the homicide rate is so high--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You'd rather troops than FBI agents or ATF agents or DEA agents. You don't want federal agents who are trained law enforcement officers in New York City. You would rather National Guardsmen --",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- I want- I want all of the above.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- who have trained to be trained to police?",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "REP. LAWLER: No. No, no, don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above, the FBI, the DEA, ATF. I've met with ATF just a few weeks ago in my office on this very issue of really cracking down on gun crimes and prosecuting criminals who use guns in the commission of a crime. I was proud last year to lead the passage of the Undetectable Firearms Act, a common sense, bipartisan piece of gun safety legislation enacted into law in the 1980s. We extended it seven years to make sure that no gun is manufactured or sold with less than 3.7 ounces of metal. I led that effort, and the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime, and yet, as I pointed out, you look at Washington D.C., only 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. This is why you've seen the homicide rate double in less than a decade. It's outrageous, and it's exactly why the President is cracking down on crime in major cities, and as we saw in California, he is legally authorized to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something in New York State that matters. A good amount of money from that CHIPs bill went to New York. On Friday, the White House announced there's going to be a change to how the government deals with that money that's meant to make America independent of Asian computer chip manufacturing and bring it all back on shore, the President wants to buy a 10% stake in Intel. That company says it's going to now basically have US taxpayers as a shareholder, own 10%. As a conservative, do you think that the government should have ownership stakes in private companies?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Generally speaking, no, I think when you look at prior history, when we've had, for instance, the bank bailouts, when we've had the auto bailouts, you know, in the- in the aftermath of the collapse of the market and '08 the American taxpayer really didn't get a return on that. I think what the President is seemingly trying to do is get a return on these tens of billions of dollars that are being invested by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. taxpayers into companies like Intel to manufacture chips. And so rather than just give the money away, get a return on that investment. Obviously, this is a national security issue. We want to be in control of the manufacturing of semiconductors and that's critical for our foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm being told I have to go to a commercial break, so I'm going to leave it there. We'll be right back."

Can you explain, in real-world terms, what does this mean for the children who live there?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, thank you, Margaret. Let me say this: You know, it's been, now, almost two years since October 7th, and since then, Israeli children have been killed and taken hostage, and now we're seeing Palestinian children finally facing what we've been yelling and screaming about for months and months and months, which is a terrible famine. You know, we've estimated at this point that about 18,000 children in Gaza have already died. And those are children who die from a whole range of issues. But when you think about that, that's about 28 children a day. That's almost a classroom of children every single day who have died since the beginning of this conflict. We have been saying we beware, right, this- this famine is just right around the corner, and it's- it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss, you know. It's so- it's shocking that it's happened, because, as you said, it happens so rarely, but it's not surprising. And what it means, really, is that children have been spending months and months without sufficient food. And we see just a horrible situation where children are on the verge of starvation and ultimately dying from starvation. And I think, you know, for your viewers who haven't seen this, and hopefully many of them have not, it is a haunting image. Children literally waste away. And you see it in rooms where you know suddenly they're all quiet. The children are so quiet because they have no energy even to cry, and to see that happen, and especially in a place where food is not very far away, right? There's no reason for this. This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid in to these children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And as you know, the Israeli government entity that oversees the Palestinian territories, it's called COGAT, says there is no famine. They say the UN data is flawed. The Prime Minister's office says these are fabrications and due to prejudice. Can you explain how you know what you know? We are showing images that we know journalists have shot- journalists who live inside Gaza, because journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report. How do you know that what you're saying is fact?",
      "RUSSELL: Let me say two things about that. One is the IPC, which is the organization that makes this determination, is an independent organization. They're technical people. They're not political people, and they monitor this as they go, and they look at issues like, what are the levels of food deprivation, what's the acute malnutrition level, how many starvation-related deaths, so it's a very technical assessment. And I think we've seen in other places that this is very accurate. I would also say it- to me, it's kind of obscene that we are having these conversations arguing about whether the methodology works or not. We know children are dying, right? I am tired of a discussion about, well, are we giving the right information or not? First of all, let the international press in. Let them make determinations. I mean, we've talked about this, Margaret, of you coming, you should be it yourself. Everyone should be able to get in there. Absent that, we're going to have to rely on the data that we have the people who were there, and I can tell you, from the UNICEF perspective, our people are tortured by this. I mean, I have spoken to our staff, and they are seeing children who are incredibly deprived, many thousands of children who have had amputations, and are, you know, it's just one terrible thing after another for children. And to suggest that there's anything funny going on here is really, in my mind, just- almost making the situation worse, right? Just stop the discussion, stop arguing, and address the problem. Get food in there. Take care of these children, make sure that they have the wherewithal to survive and have a distant future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Israeli government controls who gets in and who gets out. On the question, though, of making sure that the food you do get in gets to the right people: The former US Ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew, and another Mid-East Envoy have said the UN agencies may not like it, but if the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the only thing really allowed to operate, then maybe there needs to be some compromise. Why- why not? The United States government is putting $30 million to work there. Why not work with them?",
      "RUSSELL: You know, look, I- the methodology of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is not something that is consistent with the way humanitarians work. That's a simple answer. And honestly, you know, if you think about it, the UN had 400 places where we would distribute aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had four, okay? And you have seen on television, you have seen this video of these almost apocalyptic situations where people are streaming towards these places, trying to get food, people are getting shot. It's a terrible situation, and it doesn't work. It's not working that well. Now look, I don't- I don't much care if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation does some distribution. Just let us our let us do our work, too. Let us in. We know how to do this distribution. And when I say we, it's not just UNICEF, it's the UN, it's the other international NGOs. We do it all around the world. We've done it for decades. We know how to do it. We know how to do it in a way that it gets to the people who need it. And I, you know, do both. I'm fine with that, but at least make sure that humanitarians can get in there and distribute the aid fairly, and make sure that these children are not dying unnecessarily. Nobody wants that. President Trump has said that nobody wants that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He did indeed. I want to ask you, as well, about Sudan, where there was a massive humanitarian crisis. If the United States is not leading efforts to get aid in there, is anyone else stepping up?",
      "RUSSELL: You know, look, the United States has the ability to be such a force for good, and we need them to step up and do more. Sudan, as you say, is the largest displacement crisis in the world. Millions of children are on the move. They are not in school. We now have a horrible outbreak of Cholera, which is very destructive and kills children within hours if they can't get aid. I mean, it is absolutely horrific. And the United States can be such a force for making positive contributions. And I think, you know, other countries are trying, but the US really can make a much bigger difference if they try to do this work, and do it as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Sudan, what is the generational impact here? When you don't look --",
      "RUSSELL: Oh, it's horrible. First of all, they're not getting food. They're facing horrible sexual violence. I was just in Chad and heard stories that could just break your heart, and it's devastating, and the results, as you say, will last for generations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for sharing that. That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. I'm Margaret Brennan."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to 'Face The Nation.' It's quiet here in Washington as we come on the air this morning, but the debate is heating up over President Trump's calling up of nearly 2300 National Guardsmen, along with federal agents from ICE, the ATF, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and others, to patrol the streets of the city alongside DC police forces. And we're seeing yet another instance of Trump's expanding of the federal government's reach, this time when it comes to control of police in local communities. Will we see pictures like these in other U.S. cities in the future? Well, one of the places President Trump has mentioned is needing help fighting crime is nearby Baltimore, and joining us right now is Maryland's Democratic Governor Wes Moore. Thank you for being here.",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they're here in DC- there are guardsmen from six different states on the street. The mission is, quote, 'beautification, duty and support.' The defense secretary has author- authorized them to carry M4 and M17 rifles, but to date, we have not been able to locate anyone armed within the National Guard on the streets of DC. Why, though, are you so opposed to this deployment?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Well, there's- there's plenty of reasons. You know one, it is not sustainable. You cannot continue this type of pace of operations, particularly when you're when it's costing over a million dollars a day in order to do this. The second, it's not scalable. You're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city, particularly when many of the cities that have the highest crime rates are the places that have actually deployed their national guards to Washington, DC. So who's going to- who's going to go do the work in their cities? The third, it's unconstitutional. It's a direct violation of the 10th Amendment, and for a party that talks about state rights, it's amazing how they're having such a big government approach in the way they're conducting public safety. The fourth reason is because it's deeply disrespectful to the members of the National Guard. As someone who actually deployed overseas and served my country in combat, to ask these men and women to do a job that they're not trained for is just deeply disrespectful. And so when we're thinking about all of these lasting factors, when we're thinking about the fact that it serves as a distraction from the fact that the President's disastrous economic policies are making everything more expensive for everyday Americans- is making life harder for everyday Americans, there is a multitude of reasons that I am against this, and I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the National Guard does say that these troops will be trained and deputized by Federal Marshals. So this is going to be distinct from the military rules of engagement",
      "GOV. MOORE: But it is counter to every bit of training that we received. When- when I joined the military, we joined with a clear intention to fight and win our nation's wars. The members of our National Guard are trained up to be able to address things like emergency situations, situations where you need- where you need a surge of supports for- for traumas and disasters that are happening within individual jurisdictions. That is not this, and this is a direct deflection that the President is authorizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know the President watches the program, and he likely saw the guest listing because he's tweeting about you- or truthing, I guess. He says the Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked in a 'nasty and provocative tone that I walk the streets of Maryland with him,' and he's talking about 'crime ridden Baltimore.' It's quite lengthy, but he goes after your record on crime. He says it's a 'bad one.' He says, if you need help, he will send in the troops, which is being done in nearby DC. I mean, when we saw a few weeks ago the deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the governor of California tried to go to the courts, and he was unable to stop it. Is the reality here is- you can't stop the president from sending troops to Baltimore if he wants to?",
      "GOV. MOORE: The year before I became the governor, in 2022, Baltimore was averaging almost a homicide a day, and I came in and I said, I refuse to be a governor who just offers thoughts and prayers to this situation. So we said we're actually going to work in partnership with Mayor Scott, work in partnership with local elected officials, work in partnership with local- with local law enforcement. We made the largest investments in local law enforcement in our state's history. Over $50 million going to Baltimore City alone\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That came from federal money.",
      "GOV. MOORE: No that came from both federal and state money, and also Maryland became one of the only states that actually helps to fund the U.S. Attorney out of balance sheet, taking many of those gun crimes and actually turning them into federal charges. And the results have been- have been incredibly encouraging, where Maryland's had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime of anywhere in the United States in the past two and a half years. The homicide rate in Maryland is down over 20% since I have been the governor, and the last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet. And so the reason that I've asked the President to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance. This- these tropes, in these 1980s scare- scare tactics. And you know, just last week I was in Baltimore, and I was with a group called 'We Our Us' who is a violence intervention group. And they say we're all we got, we're all we need. And that's exactly how people in this community feel. Because while the President is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime, but it's falling on deaf ears of the President of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the positive trend line. The President's pointing to the FBI statistics, which shows Baltimore is the fifth most instances of violent crime on a per capita basis. Fourth highest murder rate. To your point, the city of Memphis is also on that list, and the Governor of Tennessee sent those National Guard troops here to this city, not to the streets of Memphis--",
      "GOV. MOORE: \u00a0--And we know we have work to do. We know- if one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work and what tactics is just theatrics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But your- the mayor in Baltimore did just say he wants federal help-- he doesn't want National Guard troops, per se, though, he says he wants agents from FBI, DEA and ATF, do you need more federal help in policing if your mayor thinks you do?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Oh, absolutely. And we need the President to stop cutting funding. Because if you look at the President's budget, it actually cuts funding towards violence intervention groups. It cuts funding towards the bureaus of the FBI and the ATF that are supporting local jurisdictions like Baltimore. That it doesn't do anything about things like ghost guns and these extended Glock clips that allow these Glocks to essentially turn into automatic weapons. Those are actually real, tangible things that the President of the United States could do and where you could put capital to actually make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are a Democrat who is- President Trump says so as well, possibly a presidential candidate. He talked about you the other day.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He spent a lot of time talking about you.",
      "GOV. MOORE: I've been on his mind a lot of times.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're spending time talking about crime. Is this something that, as a Democrat, you think the Democratic Party needs to be more vocal and muscular about when running for office? Because I hear you doing that. It's a very big change from 2020 when the you know idea was defund the police.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Absolutely. And yet the President spending all of his time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. And yes, I believe that we have to be able to address the issue of crime. I came up in, and I have existed in neighborhoods and communities that have been chronically neglected. And I remember one of the first things that happened in our first months in, I had to visit Shock Trauma inside of Baltimore, because Baltimore had one of the largest mass shootings in its history. And I visited a young man, a teenager, who was just finished surgery and had one of his testicles shot off, and was talking about, how was he ever going to become a father? And I said, at that point, I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer. And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the President of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods who believe that progress is possible and who are willing to put in the work and we're just simply asking for Washington to be able to acknowledge it and support it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says you're not 'presidential timber' at all. I imagine you disagree with that assessment?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah, I've been very clear. I'm not running for president--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.",
      "GOV. MOORE: But it's interesting that- but it's interesting the President seems to be more concerned about my future than he is about the future of the American people, and that's why I'm asking him to keep his focus. Focus on the things that actually matter right now, which is the fact that his economic policies are driving up prices on everything from electronics, to the clothes that we wear, to the food that we eat. Talk about the fact that he has immigration policies that are knocking out tens of thousands of jobs in the state of Maryland. Talk about the fact that you are about to kick veterans and seniors off of health care. Don't worry about my future. Worry about theirs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, you brought up immigration one of the residents of your state, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was just released from pretrial detention on Friday. But the Trump administration has instructed him to report to ICE within 72 hours for deportation to Uganda. He's originally from El Salvador. He was mistakenly deported to that prison in El Salvador and then returned to the U.S. This is federal policy. This is not state policy. But I do wonder, is there anything that you are doing to help his family stay united?",
      "GOV. MOORE: And the- what we know is that- you know, and all we're asking for, is that the constitution be followed on this. The constitution is very clear about how we deal with these types of issues, and when we look at what's happened in this situation, it's the President manipulating the fact that we have a very broken immigration system inside this country. But instead of actually doing the work that it requires to fix it, actually working in Congress to come up with a comprehensive immigration bill, the President is using to just- working to exploit the brokenness. And I am very clear that there is no higher priority for me than public safety\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want him to face a day in court, in other words.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Absolutely. I want due process. I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the President of the United States or the Secretary of Homeland Security who is trying to be judge, Juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case. I believe in the Constitution, and I believe that that's what we should follow for this case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something your party is tinkering with here, redistricting or gerrymandering, as some people know it. You've said you don't like talking about it, but all options are on the table when it comes to your state. There's only one- one seat here that is actually Republican, and it's a seat held by Representative Andy Harris. Are you considering trying to redraw lines in Maryland?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah. When I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actively looking at it now?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah because and I think- and I think we have to--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yes, and I think- and I think we have to, because I think what's happened is this is what people hate about politics in the first place, the fact that the President of the United States very similar to what he did in Georgia, where he called up a series of voter registrants and said, I need you to find me more votes. We're watching the same thing now, where he's calling up legislatures around the country and saying, I need you to find me more congressional districts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's doing it. That may be different, but Democrats redistrict you know this, Gavin Newsom is doing it right now. A few years ago in New York, we saw this. This can backfire. Do you really want to go down this road?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don't have situations where- where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials. We need to be able to have fair maps. And we also need to make sure that if the President of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections, because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't think that one district where they represent- they have a Republican representative that they are actively being represented in Maryland?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I think if you look at maps across the country, less than 10% of congressional seats are actually competitive by nature. Less than 10%. And so if you look at the average win margin in our state and so many states, the average win margin is upwards of 20 to 30% so that means we already have so many gerrymandered areas that we have to be able to add a measure of fairness in the way that it's applied. And so yes, all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're looking at it, you said.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yes we are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 'Face the Nation' will be back in a minute. Stay with us."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the U.S. economy. Mohamed El-Erian is the Chief Economic Advisor at Allianz, and he joins us this morning from Greenwich, Connecticut. Good morning to you.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we saw the Federal Reserve chair signal on Friday that the Fed is going to, as expected, begin lowering rates very soon, but he's also cited slowing economic growth and a cooling job market. So why then did the financial markets rally?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Because he finally pivoted to the risk that matters most for the U.S. economy right now. By construct the Fed has to deliver two things, maximum employment and price stability, and the Fed is looking at slightly higher inflation and a weakening labor market. And what Powell finally did, and many of us feel he should have done this earlier, is he said the risk to the employment side is higher than the risk to the inflation side, and therefore an interest rate cut is warranted. As you know, many of us felt he should have cut last month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed chair said significantly higher tariffs are remaking the entire global trade system. Tighter immigration policy has slowed labor growth, and there are big tax and regulation changes you can't quite, you know, quantify at this point, but it's a lot of uncertainty. Since economists have to build off of models and data, how do you predict where we're going if, basically, he's saying throw out your models?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So one of the problems is he hasn't looked forward enough. He's been very data dependent, and therefore he has tended to be late. Look, there is something promising in our future, and that is productivity enhancement that comes from exciting innovation in AI in life sciences and robotics and other areas. We just have to manage a challenging few months in the period ahead. And if that challenge is mishandled, we will not be able to get the opportunities that we have that offset a lot of structural headwinds, and that includes high debt and high deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something we were discussing with Congressman Lawe- Lawler just before you, and that is this unusual decision for the U.S. government to take a stake in chip maker Intel. That company has been struggling of late and its CEO was criticized by the president United States. He was criticized by the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton. President Trump mentioned all of that on Friday, and he said this.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE STARTS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:",
      "He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States. So we picked up $10 billion. And we do a lot of deals like that.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said the CEO wanted to keep his job, so he offered a 10% stake in his company. Is this signaling a new era for U.S. policy? I mean, central planning of the economy?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: I don't think so, Margaret. Look, as the congressman said, it's good to send the message that companies will not get something for nothing, and that is what they've gotten used to since 2008, all the bailouts. And what they are saying now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Which were paid back--",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Which were paid back, but at the time, the government took enormous risk in many, many areas. The most important distinction, if I may, here, is between ownership and control. Yes, the government can own 10% but it must not control how this company manages its affair, because once we go down that road that is a really dangerous road, and that would eat away at what makes America really special, which is a dynamic, entrepreneurial economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I believe the Commerce Secretary said there won't be control, but that is something to watch for. I want to also ask you about political pressure, not just on the Federal Reserve Chair, which you've nodded to, but the President is also now threatening to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. They're accusing her without publicly disclosed evidence of mortgage fraud and urging an investigation. In fact, the Justice Department wrote a letter to Chair Powell, encouraging her to be removed. Are you concerned that this is starting to be a pattern here of political interference with the Federal Reserve?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So these allegations are unproven, and it's important to stress that. Having just said that, this is the fifth time in the last five years that there has been allegations against a Fed official. And already four of them have had to resign. So what I'm concerned about is that there seems to have been a culture that has developed at the Fed that has resulted in these four resignations. But I am very worried about preserving Fed independence. And an independent central bank is critical to the well being of the economy, and there's lots of reasons for that. So you know, one has to disting- distinguish between the two. I can't speak to the unproven allegations, but I do think it's really important to defend the central bank independence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as I understand it, the governor has said she wants to, you know, share information, and is denying wrongdoing here. But just the fact that it is the President directing the attention towards her doesn't this suggest that even if Jerome Powell steps aside as head of the Federal Reserve, that this isn't going to stop this big spotlight on the central bank that is so powerful, and that the fear you have of political interference may not go away?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and I- my fear and my concern is that the longer Chair Powell is in his position, and it runs out in May, the longer he's in his position until then, the more this acts as a magnet for attacking, not only deeper attacks from the president, but much broader from the political system. And that's one thing that quite a few people are worried about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mohamed El-Erian, thank you so much for sharing your insight today. We'll leave it there. We'll be back in a moment."

    "published": "Sat, 23 Aug 2025 17:48:31 -0400",
    "summary": "The Justice Dept. released transcripts of Deputy AG Todd Blanche's two-day interview with convicted sex trafficker and Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department on Friday released transcripts of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's two-day interview with convicted sex trafficker and Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "The transcripts \u2014 which run for over 300 pages \u2014 came after Blanche traveled to Florida last month to meet with Maxwell, following pushback over the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein case's fallout. The release of the transcripts came as the Justice Department also turned over thousands of pages of files in the Epstein case to the House Oversight Committee, which said it would publish, after child sexual abuse material and any information identifying victims is redacted.",
      "The Justice Department also released audio recordings of the Blanche-Maxwell conversation.",
      "The interview came as Maxwell serves a 20-year prison sentence on charges that she helped Epstein recruit and abuse underage victims. She is asking the Supreme Court to review her case, arguing she should be covered by a non-prosecution deal that federal prosecutors cut with Epstein almost two decades ago.",
      "At the outset, Blanche told Maxwell the interview was not part of a \"cooperation deal.\" He said that she had immunity during their conversations, meaning the government wouldn't use anything she said against her, but he made no promises to ask the judge in Maxwell's case for leniency. He did say that the government could prosecute her if she made false statements during the interview.",
      "\"By you meeting with us today, we're really just meeting, I'm not promising to do anything,\" he said.",
      "What do the Maxwell-Blanche transcripts say?",
      "Throughout the interviews, Blanche asked Maxwell about her relationship with Epstein and others in the late financier's orbit. He also asked about some of the allegations made against her and Epstein, who died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.",
      "In some cases, the names of accusers appear to be redacted.",
      "Maxwell said she may have first met President Trump in 1990. She said her father, British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell, was \"friendly with him and liked him very much,\" and he was fond of Mr. Trump's ex-wife Ivana Trump.",
      "Later in the interview, Blanche asked about Maxwell and Epstein's relationships with famous people, including Mr. Trump. She said Mr. Trump \"was always very cordial and very kind to me,\" adding that \"I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the President now.\" She also said Mr. Trump and Epstein \"seemed friendly,\" but she \"only ever saw them in social settings,\" not private settings.",
      "She said she \"never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way.\"",
      "She also claimed she \"can't ever recollect\" recruiting somebody from Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club to give Epstein a massage. Late Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre had alleged that Maxwell recruited her while she worked at Mar-a-Lago in the early 2000s. Mr. Trump told reporters last month he cut off ties with Epstein after he \"stole\" employees from Mar-a-Lago, including Giuffre.",
      "She also spoke about former President Bill Clinton, whom she claimed was \"my friend, not Epstein's friend.\" She noted that she attended Chelsea Clinton's wedding with her then-boyfriend, Ted Waitt. She said she did not believe Clinton ever received a massage while the former president was with Epstein. And she told Blanche that Clinton flew on Epstein's private plane, but did not visit Epstein's private island.",
      "Maxwell did not appear to accuse Clinton or Mr. Trump of inappropriate behavior.",
      "Maxwell also appears to address Prince Andrew's relationship with Epstein and a person whose name is redacted. From context, that person appears to be Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew sexually assaulted her as a minor after she traveled to London with Epstein. Andrew had denied the allegations, but settled a lawsuit brought by Giuffre out of court.",
      "When asked about Andrew's relationship with the accuser, she responds, \"what's an even bigger word than bullshit?\" She claimed a famous photo showing Andrew with his arm around Giuffre as Maxwell smiles in the background was \"fake.\" She said \"categorically\" that she \"never, at any time, set Andrew up to have relations with her or any other human being ever.\"",
      "Blanche asked her briefly about several other people whom she claimed to know, including Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Alan Dershowitz and now-Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with whom she said she went \"dinosaur bone hunting.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News on Saturday through a spokesperson, the Giuffre family, the family said they are \"outraged\" by what they heard, and alleged that: \"The content of these transcripts is in direct contradiction with felon Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction for child sex trafficking.\"",
      "\"During DAG Todd Blanche's bizarre interview, she is never challenged about her court-proven lies, providing her a platform to rewrite history,\" the Giuffre family's statement said. \"This travesty of justice entirely invalidates the experiences of the many brave survivors who put their safety, security, and lives on the line to ensure her conviction, including our sister.\"",
      "The Giuffre family also said that by sending Maxwell to a minimum security prison, the Justice Department sends \"a disturbing message that child sex trafficking is acceptable and will be rewarded.\"",
      "Maxwell describes her relationship with Epstein",
      "In 1991, Maxwell said she struck up a friendship with Epstein. Maxwell was asked by Blanche in detail about her sexual relationship with Epstein, which she says started in 1992. She told the deputy attorney general that it is a \"misnomer\" that she was with Epstein consistently as a partner, and that she did not know he had other girlfriends until the Epstein flight logs were released.",
      "\"Contemporaneously, I absolutely did not know,\" about other women Epstein was with, Maxwell said, adding that by 1999, their relationship had \"foundered.\"",
      "Maxwell told Blanche that despite their physical relationship ending, she was still being paid by the disgraced financier, and that the two occasionally shared a bed together as \"friends with benefits, if you will, just not sex.\"",
      "Maxwell said at first she was paid $25,000 a year to work for Epstein, starting in 1992, and by the end of the payments in 2009, she was being paid $250,000 per year. Between 2010 and Epstein's 2019 death, Maxwell said her relationship with him was \"almost nonexistent,\" though she acknowledges they exchanged occasional phone calls and emails.",
      "She acknowledged to Blanche that she helped Epstein find people to give him massages at home \u2014 but she said she met them in \"legitimate spas\" and did not believe any of the people she found were under the age of 18. She also claimed it \"never would cross my mind\" that those people were asked to perform sexual favors for Epstein.",
      "At other points, Blanche asked Maxwell about Epstein's career on Wall Street \u2014 a persistent focus of speculation. She noted former Victoria's Secret CEO Lex Wexner was \"one very famous\" financial client of Epstein's, and said former JPMorgan Chase banker Jes Staley was \"business partners\" with Epstein. But she said she was \"not part of Epstein's business world, except tangentially.\"",
      "Maxwell addresses Epstein's case \u2014 and death",
      "Maxwell told Blanche there is \"no list,\" referring to the conspiracy theory that Epstein maintained a black book of clients who engaged in sexual activity with minors on his properties.",
      "She speculated that she does not believe that Epstein died by suicide in jail, but she also doesn't think anybody on the outside caused him to be killed. She noted that, in the prison where she served at the time, \"somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary\" (she was moved to a lower-security facility following the interview).",
      "\"If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal situation,\" Maxwell said, adding that she does \"not have any reason to believe that\" he was killed to cover up information Epstein had.",
      "\"I also think it's ludicrous, because if that -- I also happen to think if that is what they wanted, they would've had plenty of opportunity when he wasn't in jail. And if they were worried about blackmail or anything from him, he would've been a very easy target,\" Maxwell said.",
      "Maxwell said law enforcement did not contact her during an initial investigation into Epstein in Florida in the 2000s, and she didn't discuss the case with Epstein. That probe controversially ended with federal authorities in Miami agreeing not to prosecute him, in exchange for Epstein pleading guilty to prostitution in state court. That deal is now key to Maxwell's efforts to appeal her criminal conviction, as she claims she's covered by a clause in the non-prosecution agreement that covers \"any potential co-conspirators.\"",
      "Maxwell's attorney David Oscar Markus thanked the Trump administration for releasing the transcripts in a statement posted to X. He also insisted that Maxwell is innocent.",
      "\"Ms. Maxwell answered every question. She did not refuse to respond and did not dodge any question. She supported her answers with documents and other objective evidence. Her demeanor and credibility are clear for anyone to hear,\" Markus wrote.",

      "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from cutting off federal funding to dozens of \"sanctuary\" cities and counties \u2014 covering several of the largest cities in the U.S.",
      "The judge had previously ruled in April that it was unconstitutional for President Trump to freeze funding for local governments that limit their cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 commonly known as sanctuary cities. That ruling applied to more than a dozen cities and counties that had sued the Trump administration for threatening to cut off funding, including San Francisco, Sacramento, Minneapolis and Seattle.",
      "On Friday, San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge William Orrick extended his order to dozens of other places that joined the lawsuit. Those include the second- and third-largest cities in the U.S. \u2014 Los Angeles and Chicago \u2014 as well as Boston, Baltimore, Denver and Albuquerque.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement: \"The government \u2014 at all levels \u2014 has the duty to protect American citizens from harm. Sanctuary cities interfere with federal immigration enforcement at the expense of the safety and security of Americans citizens. We look forward to ultimate vindication on the issue.\"",
      "As Mr. Trump seeks to dramatically boost arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants, top administration officials have pushed local governments to assist \u2014 and they've sought to punish so-called sanctuary jurisdictions with laws on the books that prevent police from helping ICE.",
      "Within hours of returning to office in January, Mr. Trump ordered\u00a0his administration to ensure sanctuary jurisdictions \"do not receive access to Federal funds.\" Weeks later, the president ordered that federal funding shouldn't \"facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration,\" and Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department will not offer grants to sanctuary cities. The administration argues sanctuary cities are interfering with federal law enforcement and making it harder for ICE to arrest undocumented immigrants, including violent criminals.",
      "The cities and counties that are suing the administration call those policies an \"abuse of power\" and allege they violate the Tenth Amendment, which says any powers that aren't given to the federal government should be reserved to the states. They argue that local governments are entitled to choose not to assist ICE, often casting sanctuary policies as a way of building trust between police and local residents whose immigration status may make them wary of reporting crimes.",
      "\"In flagrant disregard of the law, President Trump seeks once again to punish those who disagree with him, coerce local authorities, and commandeer them into carrying out his agenda,\" the cities' lawsuit says.",
      "The Trump administration's moves against sanctuary cities have generated a flurry of lawsuits, including one suit filed earlier this week by 20 states over the Justice Department's decision to tie crime victim grants to immigration enforcement.",
      "The Justice Department has also vowed to sue dozens of alleged sanctuary jurisdictions, including both cities and states. The administration sued New York City and the state of Illinois over their sanctuary policies earlier this year, though the Illinois suit was tossed out by a judge last month.",

      "The Trump administration may try to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda following his release from criminal custody, according to a senior Department of Homeland Security official and a notice sent by government officials obtained by CBS News.",
      "Hours after Abrego Garcia \u2014 who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year \u2014 was released from pre-trial detention in Tennessee on Friday, his attorneys were sent a court-required notice of his potential deportation to Uganda, the official said.",
      "The notice said he may be deported to the East African country \"no earlier than 72 hours from now,\" not including weekends.",
      "Earlier in the week, CBS News was first to report that Uganda had agreed to a U.S. request to accept deportees who are not its citizens, becoming the latest \"third country\" to strike a deportation agreement with the second Trump administration.",
      "A native of El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months, before being returned to the U.S. and jailed while awaiting trial on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.",
      "In a legal filing Saturday, Abrego Garcia's lawyers revealed that the Trump administration had offered their client a \"last-ditch\" plea deal that would see him sent to Costa Rica after the completion of his criminal sentence. They submitted in federal court a letter from a Costa Rican government official that said the Central American country had agreed to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee and provide him legal status there.",
      "But after Abrego Garcia declined that deal and was released from pre-trial detention, his lawyers confirmed they were notified by the Trump administration that he could face deportation to Uganda instead. Abrego Garcia was also directed to show up to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore on Monday morning. His lawyers said he has been told he has until then to accept the Costa Rica deal, or it will no longer be on the table.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said the Uganda deportation threat bolsters their argument that the Trump administration's prosecution of their client is vindictive.",
      "\"There can be only one interpretation of these events: the DOJ, DHS, and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,\" they wrote in the filing Saturday.",

    "published": "Sat, 23 Aug 2025 06:19:49 -0400",
    "summary": "Residential electricity rates are expected to increase by as much as 18% in the next few years, according to the Energy Information Administration.",
    "story": [
      "If you noticed your utility bill has gone up this summer, you're not alone. On average, electricity costs are 5.5% higher today than they were a year ago, according to the latest federal data, and natural gas is up 13.8%.",
      "Nearly 60 utility companies are set to increase electricity rates this year by more than $38 billion, affecting more than 57 million Americans, according to analysis from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.",
      "President Trump recently commented on the rising prices, blaming them on renewable power. He wrote on Truth Social that renewables were \"THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!\" And he vowed he would not approve wind and solar projects.",
      "But higher rates are largely a result of higher demand, and that's being driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence, oil and gas drilling, space heating and electrified forms of transportation \u2014 all technologies that require immense amounts of power, according to Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C. based energy consultancy firm, \"When supply is scarce, then prices go up,\" he said.",
      "Gramlich says that after 25 years of a flat demand for energy and a dip during the pandemic, demand rose once economic activity picked up after the pandemic was over.",
      "Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also played a role in higher costs, disrupting international energy supply chains and causing rates to go up in the U.S. Rapid growth in data centers and newer electrified forms of technology mean the nation will need 15% more capacity \u2014 or 120 gigawatts \u2014 by the end of the decade to keep pace, Gramlich estimated.",
      "The increasing demand is a big reason why the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u00a0expects residential electricity rates to increase steadily by as much as 18% in the next few years, far outstripping the annual inflation rate of about 2.7%.",
      "The fastest way to bring rates down would be to increase supply, but there are challenges.",
      "U.S. falling behind on transmission",
      "Gramlich, in recent testimony before Congress, said there's no shortage of fuel to add to the grid \u2014 it's a shortage of transmission that's the major problem.",
      "At the end of 2023, there were more than 2,600 gigawatts of energy waiting to get connected, representing over twice the current installed capacity of the U.S. power grid, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. And 95% of it was generated by solar, wind, and battery storage.",
      "To meet growing electricity needs, the U.S. needs to expand transmission systems by 60% by 2030, and even that may need to triple by 2050, according to a 2022 report by the Department of Energy.",
      "\"If we can get a lot of transmission built, then I think we can meet the AI-driven data center demands,\" Gramlich said.",
      "AI data centers consume far more power from the grid than regular data centers, says Norman Bashir, a fellow at MIT's Climate and Sustainability Consortium, where researchers are studying the impact of generative AI on the grid.",
      "\"AI data centers are much more power intensive,\" Bashir told CBS News Boston last month. \"So, if you have a normal data center, an AI data center would be up to 10 times more power intensive.\"",
      "Role of tariffs and equipment shortages",
      "Beyond the transmission backlog, Gramlich says tariffs and equipment shortages are making energy projects more expensive. One example \u2014 gas turbines are extremely scarce right now, and that's holding up the expansion of natural gas power plants.",
      "\"The price of an actual turbine has almost tripled,\" Gramlich said. And the wait time for a gas turbine is around three or four years \u2014 even as long as seven, according to a May\u00a0 analysis by S&P Global.",
      "Energy sources",
      "Over the past decade, the nation's energy mix has increasingly grown to favor natural gas and renewables, like wind, solar and hydropower, that have become much cheaper to produce. New nuclear plants won't be on line before 2030, Gramlich said, and coal is becoming less economically viable because of maintenance and update costs required to address pollution concerns.",
      "\"That leaves wind and solar and battery storage that can help in this decade,\" Gramlich told CBS News.",
      "But the Trump administration has enacted policies to curtail new clean energy projects and instead foster greater reliance on fossil fuels. Approving and permitting new clean energy projects has become increasingly difficult, taking away a valuable asset from energy providers at a critical time.",
      "\"If things keep going like this, [utility bills] are gonna be higher next year,\" Gramlich said.",
      "Trump energy policies projected to raise prices",
      "Upon returning to office, Mr. Trump issued a \"National Energy Emergency\" executive order, arguing the country needs \"reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation's manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.\"",
      "Most of the actions tied to that order have gutted renewable energy generation and are bolstering fossil fuel development.",
      "The passage of Trump's signature legislation, One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to make energy more expensive, impact jobs, and make it more difficult to meet rising energy demand, according to analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank.",
      "OBBBA will change the tax code, increasing generation costs, resulting in a drop in power generation capacity of 340 gigawatts by 2035, says Michael O'Boyle, acting policy team director of Energy Innovation in an email to CBS News. To put that in perspective, 1 gigawatt typically powers 750,000 homes, so 340 gigawatts could power about 255 million homes.",
      "O'Boyle estimates wholesale energy prices will increase by 74% by 2035, resulting in a $170 annual increase in the average household energy bill. Some 760,000 jobs could be lost by 2030, and the states that are expected to see the biggest impacts on energy cost increases and job losses from the OBBBA are South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Kentucky and North Carolina.",
      "The Energy Department criticized the analysis and its support of renewables arguing, \"The OBBBA ensures taxpayers will no longer be forced to subsidize intermittent energy sources like wind and solar \u2013 subsidies that have only resulted in more expensive, less reliable energy,\" said Ben Dietderich, the department's press secretary and chief spokesman, in an email to CBS News.",
      "Ending Biden-era clean energy policies",
      "Since he returned to office, Mr. Trump has been dismantling Biden-era clean energy policies, resulting in the termination of more than $22 billion in renewable energy projects,\u00a0according to an analysis by the environmental policy firm E2.",
      "\"Unfortunately, the president and Congress is making it harder for Americans to have access to the cheapest, cleanest, quickest to deploy power there is,\" said Bob Keefe, E2's executive director.",
      "\"By slowing clean energy deployment, the Administration is directly fueling cost increases,\" Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement. Grumet cited EIA data and noted, \"The top four clean energy states are seeing prices decline this year, while the 10 states with the least renewable power all face rising costs.\"",
      "Trump admin. keeping fossil fuel generation alive",
      "To address rising energy demand, the Energy Department has ordered some utility companies to keep coal power plants open beyond their retirement dates, an action that could cost more than $3.1 billion a year by 2028, according to analysis by Gramlich's firm, Grid Strategies.",
      "\"These coal plants are basically uneconomic in the market. Each year, they incur tens of millions of dollars of maintenance just to stay operating,\" said Gramlich.",
      "Those costs to extend the life of coal plants will be borne by ratepayers, according to a ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.",
      "Coal plants are generally planned for retirement when their operating cost exceeds their expected revenue or their value to the electric grid, the EIA\u00a0has pointed out. Coal-fired plants, which produce high levels of CO2 emissions, have been under pressure to be phased out in many states, in particular, those with clean energy goals. According to the EIA, natural gas and clean energy sources are providing a growing share of the nation's electricity, while coal has been waning. By the end of 2023, the maximum potential power plant output for coal was 15.2%, down from 45% in 1990.",
      "If additional fossil fuel-based plants delay retirement dates \u2014 28% were expected to be retired by 2035 \u2014 the bill to ratepayers could grow to more than $6 billion.",
      "Still, Energy Secretary Chris Wright supports the administration's efforts to keep fossil fuel generation online longer.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas,\" he said in a statement, upon releasing a report on the U.S. grid's reliability. \"If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.\"",

      "President Trump said that Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business.",
      "Speaking with reporters on Friday, Mr. Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan \u2014 which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.",
      "\"I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He agreed, and they've agreed to do it.\"",
      "In a social media post Friday afternoon, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the deal had been finalized, but did not elaborate.",
      "\"The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies,\" Lutnick wrote. \"This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America's technological edge.\"",
      "Lutnick also thanked Tan \"for striking a deal that's fair to Intel and fair to the American People.\"",
      "The struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under former President Joe Biden. With a 10% stake, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "Intel confirmed the deal in a news release Friday evening which stated that the U.S. government would \"make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, reflecting the confidence the Administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "Intel said the government's equity stake would be \"funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program.\"",
      "Intel said that under the terms of the deal, the government agreed to purchase 433.3 million primary shares of Intel stock, valued at $20.47 per share, or the equivalent of a 9.9% stake in the company.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post early Friday evening, Mr. Trump wrote that it was his \"Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL.\"",
      "Trump added that the U.S. \"paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars.\"",
      "Why did Trump want this deal?",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "Earlier this month, the president called on Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company had hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist.",
      "But Mr. Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S.\u00a0in a public letter\u00a0to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \"amazing story.\"",
      "After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Has the U.S. government done something like this before?",
      "Although rare, it's not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",
      "But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",
      "What federal grants does Intel receive?",
      "Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration's CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn't been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.",
      "The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program.",

    "summary": "Energy suppliers are having trouble keeping up with the rapid increase in demand, and consumers in some states are seeing higher monthly bills.",
    "story": [
      "A July 11 post in a Hoboken, New Jersey, parenting group on Facebook pointed to a frustrating trend: \"Our utility bill is more than double what it was last month. ... Anything we can do about it?\" The post had several dozen replies and most of the commenters said their home utility bills had also risen dramatically.",
      "On the campaign trail a year ago, President Trump vowed, \"Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months \u2014 at a maximum, 18 months,\" but this year has seen energy prices rising in several states. Residents and governors in five East Coast states are blaming electric supplier, PJM Interconnection. The company is the largest grid operator in the U.S., serving 13 states and 65 million customers.",
      "In New Jersey, energy prices increased on June 1, causing a 17-20% jump in residential customers'utility bills. The utility company PSE&G told its New Jersey customers they should expect to see a higher monthly bill of about $183 for the average customer, an increase of $27.",
      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"We don't have enough newer, more reliable energy sources,\" said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Ambrose says that renewable sources like wind, solar, and battery are the cheapest and fastest forms of energy to bring online and faults PJM for its reluctance to bring clean energy into the grid: \"PJM is also keeping older coal gas plants running, even if they are uneconomical and more expensive.\"",
      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey. PJM also said it has a queue of 63 gigawatts of projects \u2014 enough to power more than 47 million homes \u2014 waiting to be connected by 2026, and an \"overwhelming majority\" of those projects are renewables.",
      "Rising utility bills likely an issue in New Jersey governor's race",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright is starting to worry that high energy prices could hurt Republicans at the ballot box. In a recent interview with Politico, he blamed Democratic policies for \"pushing prices up right now,\" but conceded the political reality that Republicans may suffer in the next elections.",
      "\"Who's going to get blamed for it? We're going to get blamed because we're in office,\" he said.",
      "New Jersey is poised to be among the first to test the issue in the governor's race this November.",
      "\"Affordability is the number one issue in this race, and rising energy prices are also at the top of everyone's mind,\" Ambrose told CBS News.",
      "Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, in July released a statement accusing PJM of \"mismanagement\" of the grid: \"PJM has refused to plug clean, cheap power like solar into the grid, while giving preference to coal and oil.\"",
      "And earlier this month, her opponent, Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, wrote in a post on X about \"Rebecca in Highland Park,\" whose electric bill he said had tripled, \"to more than $1000.\"",
      "\"Why? Because Trenton Democrats, with the approval of my opponent Mikie Sherrill, shut down six electricity generation plants around the state, stopped burning natural gas, and didn't expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey,\" Ciattarelli said.",
      "\"We can look at how folks are going to vote in this upcoming election, as a reflection on how they're feeling about the country at large,\" says Ambrose, \"This affordability problem is not going away.\"",
      "A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll earlier this month found that 26% of voters blame the utility companies for price hikes, 19% blame Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, and 10% say that energy producers are at fault. Murphy is not running for reelection due to term limits.",
      "\"Utility bills directly impact elections,\" says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C.-based energy consultancy firm. Gramlich pointed to the most infamous example of this, the California recall election in 2003, prompted in large part by the state's energy crisis. It cost Democrat Gray Davis the governorship and handed it to Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump promised Monday to work to end mail-in voting and said work is already underway on an executive order to ban it before the 2026 midterm elections, although the Constitution does not give him this power.",
      "\"We, as a Republican Party, are going to do everything possible that we get rid of mail-in ballots,\" he said during an Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \"We're going to start with an executive order that's being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail-in ballots.\"",
      "Why does Trump want to ban mail-in ballots?",
      "\"Mail-in ballots are corrupt,\" the president said. He suggested the method is susceptible to voter fraud, claiming in California, \"it's so corrupt, where some people get five, six, seven ballots delivered to them.\" He has often insisted mail-in ballots can be tampered with or enable people to vote multiple times.",
      "But soon after the 2020 election, Debra Cleaver, founder and CEO of VoteAmerica, a nonpartisan voter information site, dismissed the idea of widespread voter fraud as \"a myth.\"",
      "\"The outgoing ballots have a barcode, and then when you send your ballot in, you put it in a return envelope and that barcode has to match the barcode that was sent out in order for the ballot to be counted,\" she explained to CBS News.",
      "After that election, the director of the nation's cyber security agency, Christopher Krebs, called the 2020 vote \"the most secure in American history.\"",
      "In 2024, when Mr. Trump won the presidential election, the U.S. Census Bureau said nearly a third of ballots nationwide were cast by mail.",
      "The White House told CBS News in a statement that Democrats had \"eroded faith in our elections\" with policies like \"unfettered mail-in voting.\"",
      "\"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said Monday night.",
      "Trump's impending executive order to stop mail voting \u2014 would it be legal?",
      "In a social media post earlier in the day, the president said of the impending order that it would \"help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections.\"",
      "He claimed that the states \"are merely an 'agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,\" and that \"[t]hey must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.\"",
      "But Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution says it's the states that have the authority to regulate elections, not the president, and this may be changed only by Congress.",
      "Trump claims U.S. is the only country that uses mail-in voting. Is that true?",
      "Mr. Trump also claimed, \"We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting\" and argued, \"You will never have an honest election if you have mail-in. And it's time that the Republicans get tough and stop it, because the Democrats want it. It's the only way they can get elected.\"",
      "In fact, more than 30 other countries allow voting by mail for some or all voters, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, an intergovernmental advocacy group based in Sweden. Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany\u00a0and Denmark are among them.",
      "Mail-in voting in the U.S.",
      "In the U.S., mail voting is widespread:\u00a036 states offer some form of no-excuse mail-in voting \u2014 including 8 states that conduct elections entirely by mail \u2014 while the rest require a documented reason such as illness or military service, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The pandemic gave mail voting a huge boost in the 2020 elections. About 43% of voters cast their ballot by mail that year, according to a report by the Election Assistance Commission. In 2024, mail voting dropped off, representing just over 30% of the total votes cast \u2014 about 46.8 million votes. The commission said that last year's numbers still exceeded pre-pandemic levels.",
      "The topic of mail-in voting came up during Mr. Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, too. After the two met Friday, the president told Fox News' Sean Hannity that \"Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said, 'You can't have an honest election, election with mail-in voting.' And he said, 'There's not a country in the world that uses it now.'\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the two talked about the 2020 election and that Putin told him, \"You won that election by so much, and that's (mail voting) how [Biden] got it.\" Audits and investigations, including some conducted by Trump supporters and Republican secretaries of state, showed no evidence that the 2020 election results were inaccurate.",
      "David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, pointed out in a statement to CBS News that mail-in voting has been around since the Civil War and said getting rid of mail voting \"is an incredibly bad idea that would make our elections much less secure and vulnerable to interference.\"",
      "\"Requiring states to eliminate or replace the voting machines that confirmed the election of this president, just 15 months before a midterm election and less than a year before primaries, is not possible and would result in chaos,\" said Becker, who is also a CBS News election law contributor.",

    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, diesel people hate me, gasoline people hate me, ethanol people hate me, nuclear people hate me, coal people hate me. They do, because I'm telling the truth,\" he said. \"We don't need any of these technologies.\"",

    "summary": "Taking no chances, SpaceX called off an attempt to launch its huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket after running into problems with ground equipment.",
    "story": [
      "After three catastrophic in-flight failures in a row, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket for launch Sunday evening from the Texas Gulf Coast to put a variety of upgrades to the test and to deliberately stress the vehicle to learn more about its capabilities.",
      "Test flight No. 10 was expected to get underway at 7:30 p.m. ET from SpaceX's Starbase flight and manufacturing facility and the team was in the process of pumping liquid oxygen and methane fuel into the 40-story-tall rocket when the company announced a scrub.",
      "\"Standing down from today's tenth flight of Starship to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems,\" the company said on X. SpaceX later announced that another hour-long launch window would open at 7:30 p.m. EDT Monday.",
      "The flight plan had called for the 30-foot wide, 230-foot tall Super Heavy booster, generating more than 16 million pounds of thrust, to propel the Starship out of the dense lower atmosphere before it would fall away, flip around and head back toward the coast.",
      "During three of the nine previous test flights, the booster flew itself all the way back to its launch pad where giant mechanical arms on the service gantry plucked the descending rocket out of midair. This time around, because of the planned tests, the Super Heavy was expected to descend to splashdown in the Gulf, but it never took off.",
      "SpaceX previously said the primary objectives for the booster test was focused on its landing burn. One of the three center engines used for the final phase of landing was going to be \"intentionally disabled to gather data on the ability for a backup engine from the middle ring to complete a landing burn,\" the company said on its website.",
      "The booster was then going to use two engines toward the end of the descent and hover briefly before dropping to the Gulf.",
      "The 160-foot-tall Starship, meanwhile, powered by six Raptor engines of its own, would have headed for a suborbital trajectory carrying it halfway around the world before a belly-first reentry, a flip back to vertical and a rocket-powered descent to splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along with deploying eight Starlink simulator satellites, the Starship's flight computer had planned to attempt a variety of other tests, including an in-space engine restart, to verify the performance of numerous upgrades implemented in the wake of the most recent test flight failures.",
      "Working the bugs out of the giant launcher is critical to SpaceX and founder Elon Musk, who designed the ultra-heavy-lift rocket to launch thousands of next-generation Starlinks and other satellites in Earth's orbit and to one day carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The rocket also is critical to NASA, which is paying SpaceX more than $3 billion to develop a modified version of the Starship upper stage to carry Artemis astronauts to the surface of the moon in 2027.",
      "But that flight will require 10 to 20 Super Heavy-Starship flights just to refuel the \"Human Landing System,\" or HLS, lander before it can head to the moon. Transferring thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid nitrogen and oxygen in space has never been attempted.",
      "And it is still not known how SpaceX plans to control propellant temperatures to minimize the amount that will naturally warm up and turn into a gas, which must be vented overboard. SpaceX has provided no details. Musk promised pre-launch update Sunday on the company's plans going forward, but the talk was also canceled with no explanation.",
      "Given the number of flights that must be successfully executed to demonstrate the reliability NASA will expect, the 2027 target date for the Artemis 3 moon landing is considered unrealistic, if not impossible to meet, by many aerospace observers.",
      "China plans to launch its own astronauts on the moon by 2030. It is unclear at this point whether NASA and SpaceX will get back to the moon using the Starship lander before the Chinese plant their own flag on the lunar surface.",
      "Given the sheer size and power of the Super Heavy-Starship \u2014 it has more than twice the thrust of NASA's current Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket \u2014 technical problems during development were not unexpected.",
      "But given the short time between now and NASA's first planned Artemis moon landing, the problems have clearly set the program back and cast doubt on the overall mission architecture, especially the requirement for 10 to 20 problem-free flights in short order just to fuel the lander for its flight to the moon.",
      "The first three test flights of the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage in 2023 and 2024 ended in catastrophic failures with both stages destroyed, either while still attached to each other or after separation.",
      "The fourth flight in June 2024 was generally successful with the Super Heavy flying itself back to a controlled splashdown in the Gulf while the Starship followed the planned sub-orbital trajectory to splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The ship's fins were damaged by reentry heating, but otherwise worked as required.",
      "The fifth flight in October 2024 was highlighted by a successful Super Heavy return to the launch pad gantry where giant mechanical arms snagged the rocket in mid air. The Starship, meanwhile, managed a second controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean although it again suffered fin damage during reentry.",
      "During the sixth integrated flight test in November 2024, the Super Heavy attempted another return to the launch site but it was diverted to a Gulf splashdown because of launch damage to critical sensors in the pad's capture mechanism. The Starship again flew itself to a controlled Indian Ocean splashdown with minimal flap damage.",
      "But the next three flights, in January, March and May of this year, ended with catastrophic failures. Two Super Heavy boosters successfully returned to the launch site, but the most recent broke up over the Gulf while testing a high angle-of-attack entry.",
      "All three Starships were destroyed after catastrophic malfunctions, including two propellant leaks, an on-board fire and multiple engine failures.",
      "In addition to the flight record, another Starship was destroyed on the ground when a high-pressure nitrogen tank exploded during an engine test firing at the Starbase launch site.",

    "story": [
      "SpaceX early Sunday launched its 33rd resupply mission to the International Space Station, sending up a Dragon capsule loaded with 2.5 tons of equipment and supplies along with an add-on thruster kit to help maintain the lab's altitude.",
      "Perched atop a workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, commercial resupply mission 33 got underway with a sky-lighting launch from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 2:45 a.m. ET, climbing away on a northeasterly trajectory lined up with the space station's orbit.",
      "Nine minutes and 45 seconds later, moments after the discarded first-stage booster safely landed on an offshore droneship, the Dragon was released from the rocket's second stage, kicking off a 29-hour rendezvous with the orbiting laboratory complex.",
      "If all goes well, the cargo ship will move in for docking at the station's forward port at 7:30 a.m. Monday. On board: more than 2,400 pounds of crew supplies, nearly 1,000 pounds of science gear, 1,300 pounds of space station hardware, computer equipment and spacewalk gear.",
      "The food includes the usual variety of fresh, asked-for items for the crew, including coffee, tea and more than 1,500 tortillas.",
      "\"We fly tortillas because ... other breads and things like that have too many crumbs and things of that nature (that float away in weightlessness), so you can't actually maintain it in orbit,\" said Bill Spetch, ISS operations and integration manager. \"Tortillas are a great substitute for that.\"",
      "On a more significant note, Heidi Parris, associate program scientist for the space station, noted that NASA will mark 25 years of continuous human presence aboard the lab in November.",
      "During that quarter century, she said, \"we've hosted more than 280 residents, we've enabled more than 4,000 different ... scientific experiments and technology demonstrations (representing) the work of over 5,000 researchers from over 110 countries around the world.\"",
      "The CRS-33 mission will bring 50 research projects to the lab, including a new study of the effects of microgravity on bone loss, a 3D metal printer to assess the capability for manufacturing spare parts and tools on demand in space, and an experiment to study the effectiveness of 3D \"bioprinting.\"",
      "\"This investigation ... is looking to create a 3D-printed implantable medical device that can support nerve regrowth after injury by bridging the gap to reconnect severed nerves while also simultaneously delivering drugs that can support nerve regeneration,\" Parris said.",
      "Of special interest to NASA is the performance of an add-on propulsion system consisting of two SpaceX Draco engines, six propellant tanks and a supply of helium to pressurize the system. The hardware is mounted in the Dragon's open-to-space aft trunk section.",
      "\"The space station's altitude slowly decays over time due to the thin amount of atmosphere still at our altitude,\" Spetch said. \"To counteract that drag, we must occasionally raise the altitude of the ISS.\"",
      "The Russians handle the majority of those re-boost operations, delivering the needed propellants and periodically firing thrusters aboard Progress cargo ships and the station itself.",
      "\"With the addition of the boost trunk on this mission, Dragon will also provide this ability to maintain the station's altitude,\" Spetch said. \"The boost kit will help sustain the orbiting lab's altitude starting in September with a series of burns planned periodically throughout the fall of 2025.\"",
      "The CRS-33 Dragon will remain docked to the station until December. During that time, the boost kit will provide the one and a half Progress missions.",
      "Sarah Walker, director of Dragon mission management at SpaceX, said the boost kit will provide about a quarter of the propulsion needed in one year to maintain the station's 260-mile-high altitude. The first \"burn,\" expected to last about 20 minutes, is planned for Sept. 3.",

    "summary": "During its secretive mission, the X-37B will test new laser communications gear and a \"quantum\" navigation sensor.",
    "story": [
      "A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off late Thursday, propelling a reusable X-37B Space Force rocket plane into space on a classified long-duration mission. It was the eighth such flight since the program's debut in 2010 and the first since a 434-day mission ended last March.",
      "Lighting up the overnight sky for miles around, the Falcon 9 roared away from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 11:50 p.m. EDT, arcing onto a northeasterly trajectory atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust from the booster's nine first-stage engines.",
      "After the spacecraft climbed out of the lower atmosphere, the engines shut down, the first stage fell away, flipped around and re-ignited three engines to reverse course and head back to Florida. Heralded by an attention-getting sonic boom, the booster landed at the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to wrap up its sixth flight.",
      "It was SpaceX's 66th booster landing in Florida and the company's 490th successful recovery overall.",
      "As usual with classified Space Force missions, SpaceX ended its launch commentary with the first stage landing and offered no information about the Falcon 9's second stage climb to orbit, when the Boeing-built X-37B was to be released to fly on its own, or any details about its orbit.",
      "The seven previous X-37B missions -- three by the orbiter launched Thursday and four by a twin sister ship -- all carried out long-duration missions ranging from 224 days to nearly 909 days. It's not known how long the X-37B launched Thursday will remain in orbit.",
      "While the flights are generally classified, Space Force and Boeing officials publicly discussed two of the payloads on board.",
      "One  will test high-speed, tightly-targeted laser communications between the  X-37B and small data relay satellites making up a growing  \"proliferated\" space-based communications system.",
      "The tests \"will mark an important step in the U.S. Space Force's  ability to leverage proliferated space networks as part of a diversified  and redundant space architecture,\" said Gen. Chance Saltzman, director of space operations for the U.S. Space Force.",
      "\"In so doing, it will strengthen the resilience, reliability, adaptability and data transport speeds of our satellite communications architecture.\"",
      "The other publicly disclosed payload is a sophisticated quantum navigation sensor designed to determine a spacecraft's precise position in space by \"detecting rotation and acceleration of atoms without reliance on satellite networks like traditional GPS,\" the Space Force said in an on-line description.",
      "\"Whether navigating beyond Earth-based orbits in cislunar space or operating in GPS-denied environments, quantum inertial sensing allows for robust navigation capabilities when GPS navigation is not possible,\" said Space Delta 9 commander Col. Ramsey Horn.",
      "\"Ultimately, this technology contributes significantly to our thrust within the Fifth Space Operations Squadron and across the Space Force guaranteeing movement and maneuverability even in GPS-denied environments.\"",
      "Clad in black heat shield tiles and white insulation blankets, the unpiloted X-37B resembles a mini space shuttle with stubby delta wings and two tail fins extending from either side of the rear of the fuselage. It can be launched atop SpaceX Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets or United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 and Vulcan boosters.",
      "Two virtually identical X-37B Orbital Test Vehicles, or OTVs, are operated by the Pentagon's Rapid Capabilities Office for the U.S. Space Force. The vehicles are designed to serve as test beds for avionics and advanced sensors, to evaluate reusable spacecraft components and to provide a platform for experiments that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Powered by solar cells and batteries, the orbiters feature a small payload bay similar to a space shuttle's that can accommodate a variety of sensors and experiment packages.",
      "The compact spacecraft are designed to end their missions with runway landings at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California or the Kennedy Space Center in Florida using 3-mile-long runways originally built for the space shuttle.",
      "The most recent flight of an X-37B began with a\u00a0launch atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on Dec. 29, 2023. It ended last March 7, with touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center after 434 days and six hours in space. Going into Thursday's mission, the two X-37Bs had logged a combined 11-and-a-half years in space across seven flights.",

    "summary": "Tommy Fello struggled to regain function after a stroke affected the left side of his body. A new technology is making a difference.",
    "story": [
      "Restaurateur Tommy Fello was driving from his Ohio establishment to his house on Christmas Eve when he started veering off the road. Fello, then 71, had been awake since 4 a.m. local time preparing a holiday buffet for his family. He chalked the disturbance up to a flat tire. Driving slowly and relying on the vehicle's autocorrect feature, he was able to complete his journey home safely.",
      "But when Fello stepped out of the truck, he couldn't get his balance.",
      "\"I finally realized it wasn't the truck that was veering. It was me that was veering,\" Fello said. He went indoors and talked to his wife and daughter, who said he looked unwell. About five minutes later, they called 911. Paramedics took him to an area hospital, where he lost all movement in his left arm and leg.",
      "\"They were literally just like appendages on me. I could not feel them and could not do anything,\" Fello said.",
      "A clot-busting drug reversed the stroke, but the numbness on the left side of his body, including his face, remained. He struggled to swallow, eat or drink. Physical and occupational therapy produced only minor improvements.",
      "Dr. Sharon Covey, Fello's occupational therapist and the founder of the Center for Stroke and Hand Recovery, Inc., told CBS News that his arm was essentially stuck in a bent position with his fingers curled when he met her in January 2024. The position and tension in the limb caused Fello constant pain. Working in his restaurant was out of the question.",
      "\"It was very scary. You take for granted so many of the things you do, and even the common, simplest things become like a chore,\" Fello said. \"We mark all these small victories ... Being able to lift up your arm or pick up a cup is a gigantic accomplishment. Those little accomplishments are gigantic to a stroke victim. They encouraged me to keep going on. But there was always a thought in the back of my mind: 'Is this as good as it's going to get?'\"",
      "A \"first-of-its-kind technology\"",
      "One day, another recovering stroke patient suggested Fello look into an implant called the Vivistim System. The FDA-approved implant, developed by the medical device company MicroTransponder Inc., uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to improve hand and arm function for stroke victims. The vagus nerves are the body's longest cranial nerve, with one on each side of the body, according to the Cleveland Clinic. They regulate the body's involuntary functions.",
      "The Vivistim Therapy system involves a physical or occupational therapist sending wireless signals to the device. That signal delivers a brief, gentle pulse to the vagus nerve while the stroke patient performs rehabilitative tasks. The stroke patient also does at-home exercises.",
      "Dr. Erez Nossek, a neurosurgeon and director of the cranial bypass program at NYU Langone, told CBS News that the vagus nerve stimulation can enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, known as neuroplasticity. That increased neuroplasticity can result in \"greater and faster improvements in motor function for stroke survivors,\" Nossek said in emailed remarks.",
      "\"There is no other FDA-approved technology proven to boost neuroplasticity for stroke survivors, creating new connections in the brain, which is theirs to keep, even after the device is no longer in use,\" Nossek said. \"This is (a) first-of-its-kind technology that is redefining what is possible for this patient population.\"",
      "A 108-person trial\u00a0published in The Lancet in 2021\u00a0found that the device generated two to three times greater improvement in hand and arm function for stroke survivors when compared with just rehab. Stroke patients who have limited hand and arm function six months or more after their stroke and are considered to have \"moderate to severe deficits\" qualify for the device, the company\u00a0said in a fact sheet.",
      "Implant aids in recovery",
      "Fello turned to the Cleveland Clinic, where he met cerebrovascular neurosurgeon Dr. Mark Bain. He studies stroke recovery, especially in the cases of patients like Fello, whose rehab progress has plateaued months after the stroke. Bain determined that Fello was a candidate for the Vivistim System. Fello became the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant on April 29, 2025.",
      "\"It didn't really scare me to try and do it. I was anxious to see how it worked,\" Fello said.",
      "The device was placed during an hour-long procedure. The vagus nerve sits just below the carotid artery, so Bain and his surgical team made a small incision to place the leads of the implant and hid the scar in a fold of Fello's neck. The key-fob sized implant was placed under Fello's clavicle. Bain said the procedure itself is low-risk, with \"less than 1% chance of any complications.\" Two weeks after the surgery, the device was turned on and Fello returned to his rehabilitative work with Covey.",
      "Covey said Fello has made huge progress since the device was implanted four months ago. She said he has no pain or tension in the limb, and is beginning to practice using his left arm to carry items. The task is difficult, she said, but isn't \"something he could have done before.\" Fello, now 72, said he's been thrilled by the progress he's made in a short time.",
      "\"I'm very, very happy to do it, very proud to do it, and I'm glad I did it,\" he said.",
      "\"The sky's the limit\"",
      "About 800,000 people in the United States experience an ischemic stroke each year, Bain said. Vivistim and other new technologies may offer hope to the patients like Fello who struggle to recover with just rehabilitation, Bain said.",
      "\"I think over the next probably five to 10 years, what you're going to see is an explosion of procedures, devices and things in rehab that will help people, once they've had strokes, to get their lives back,\" Bain said. \"In the future, I think the sky's the limit for what we can expect for stroke recovery.\"",
      "At the time of his conversation with CBS News, Bain had given seven other stroke patients a Vivistim implant. Covey said at her practice, there are eight patients with the implant receiving the paired therapy course. MicroTransponder Inc. declined to say how many patients have received the implant, but shared a map that shows dozens of surgeons and rehabilitation therapists that provide the therapy.",
      "\"I think this is the newest, most effective strategy for people getting their affected limbs back,\" Covey said. \"This is the first real technique that has been available, at least in the last 20 years, for stroke rehab. The theories that we use as practitioners to increase somebody's use of their affected arm are 50 to 75 years old. So this is a new technology that's really going to turn the stroke recovery world upside down.\"",

      "The Pixel phones, now on their 10th generation, will have an AI-powered feature called \"Magic Cue\" designed to anticipate a person's information needs. For example, if travelers use the device to call their airline, the phone is able to recognize the number and display their flight information, according to Google.",

      "\"If you keep at it and say, 'no, you're wrong. You're wrong' \u2014 eventually AI will say, 'I'm sorry, I was wrong.' Doing that with your class can show you that AI isn't really as smart as you think it is,\" Ong said.",

      "She thinks teachers would be better served by more support within schools than by an alliance with Silicon Valley.",
      "\"There is so much drudgery in the job, but the answer to that is to improve the conditions of teachers' work,\" said Weiner, adding that AI does not accomplish improving work conditions for teachers.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Kilmar Abrego Garcia is being processed for deportation to Uganda, the Department of Homeland Security said, after he was taken into custody Monday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, days after his release from criminal custody.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, was mistakenly deported to his home country in March and held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months before being returned to the U.S. in June where he was jailed on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.",
      "Abrego Garcia was freed from pretrial detention last Friday. CBS News reported on Saturday that his attorneys were then sent a court-required notice of his potential\u00a0deportation to Uganda. He arrived at the ICE facility on Monday morning to check in, speaking in Spanish to supporters who had gathered in a show of support outside of the facility.",
      "\"There was no need for them to take him into ICE detention. He was already on electronic monitoring from the U.S. Marshals Service and basically on house arrest,\" his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him. To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.\"",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg filed a new lawsuit on Abrego Garcia's behalf on Monday challenging his confinement and deportation to any country \"unless and until he had a fair trial in an immigration court.\"",
      "The U.S. district court in Maryland soon issued an order preventing the government from immediately removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S. or altering his legal status, meaning his deportation is on hold for now. The order will remain in effect until 4 p.m. Wednesday unless Judge Paula Xinis, who is assigned to the case, extends it. The court has issued the standing order in all cases involving migrant detainees challenging the legality of their detentions in recent months, a move the Justice Department is challenging as unlawful.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his family denies.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said\u00a0in a statement that ICE had arrested Abrego Garcia and was \"processing him for deportation.\" DHS said he is \"being processed for removal to Uganda.\" The U.S. reached an agreement with Uganda to accept some deportees last week.",
      "\"President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,\" Noem said.",
      "In a legal filing over the weekend, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he was offered a plea deal that included deportation to Costa Rica. His attorneys said they then received a notice of his possible deportation to Uganda. Sandoval-Moshenberg clarified Monday that Abrego Garcia had stated that he was willing to accept refugee status in Costa Rica.",
      "\"The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a manner that is completely unconstitutional,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Monday.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg said an ICE officer did not answer when asked about the reason for Abrego Garcia's detention and would not say which detention center he would be taken to, or commit to providing paperwork.",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who traveled to El Salvador to advocate for the return of Abrego Garcia earlier this year, met with him Sunday. Van Hollen said in a statement that he was glad to \"welcome him back to Maryland after what has been a long and torturous nightmare.\"",
      "\"The federal courts and public outcry forced the Administration to bring \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to Maryland, but Trump's cronies continue to lie about the facts in his case and they are engaged in a malicious abuse of power as they threaten to deport him to Uganda \u2014 to block his chance to defend himself against the new charges they brought,\" Van Hollen said. \"As I told Kilmar and his wife Jennifer, we will stay in this fight for justice and due process because if his rights are denied, the rights of everyone else are put at risk.\"",
      "An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia may not be deported to El Salvador because he feared persecution by local gangs in the Central American country.",
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore advocated for due process for Abrego Garcia on Sunday, saying on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that \"I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case.\"",

    "story": [
      "Cracker Barrel shed almost $100 million in market value Thursday after its stock plunged following the release of a new logo. The new design eliminates a longstanding drawing of an overall-clad man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a cleaner logo featuring just the chain's name.",
      "Shares of Cracker Barrel fell $4.22, or 7.2%, to $54.80 in Thursday trading, shedding $94 million in market value. The stock had dipped to a low of $50.27 earlier in the day, representing a loss of almost $200 million in its capitalization.",
      "Cracker Barrel shares gained in early trading Friday, but resumed their slide later in the day. The stock closed down 40 cents, or less than 1%, to $54.40.",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the logo redesign comes as Cracker Barrel has been working to refresh its image through new menu items and redecorated stores that eschew the 55-year-old chain's old-timey approach in favor of a more modern look.",
      "According to the company's website, the man and barrel in the old logo represented \"the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories.\"",
      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",
      "\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven't changed,\" the company said.",
      "The new logo, which will appear on menus and marketing materials, \"is now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and wordmark that started it all,\" the company said in an Aug. 18 press release.",
      "Conservative commentators took issue with the rebrand, with right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh calling it \"more generic\" on social media. Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Many of the criticisms took on a political tone, with some social media commenters describing the new design as \"woke.\"",
      "Brand strategist Kelly O'Keefe, a founding partner of consultancy Brand Federation, said the redesign simplifies an \"overly complex logo.\"",
      "\"In a normal marketing environment, this would not even be noticed, but these are not normal times,\" O'Keefe said in an email. \"Politically inert marketing moves are being labeled as political for opportunistic reasons.\"",
      "Another marketing expert pointed out that the redesign risks turning off long-time fans of the chain, with Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, describing Cracker Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",
      "Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and today operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S.",
      "Cracker Barrel's growth, which soared in the 1990s as the chain expanded, has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up 0.8% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down from $99 million in 2023.",
      "For its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $821.1 million, up slightly from $817.1 million, according to a regulatory filing.",

      "The step is an escalation in Mr. Trump's intervention into policing in the nation's capital and comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members are stationed in the city, with the arrival last week of hundreds from several Republican-led states.",
      "Last week, the Pentagon and Army said troops would not carry weapons. The new guidance is that they would carry their service-issued weapons.",
      "National Guard personnel have been deployed in D.C. since\u00a0last week, when Mr. Trump ordered the D.C. Guard to crack down on\u00a0what he has called\u00a0an \"epidemic of crime.\" Federal agents have also patrolled the city, and the president has asserted control over the local Metropolitan Police Department.",
      "It was unclear if the guard's role in the federal intervention could be changing. The troops have not taken part in law enforcement and largely have been protecting landmarks, including the National Mall and Union Station, and helping with crowd control.",
      "Some troops have fed squirrels. One Guard member helped a woman carry her belongings down the stairs in a train station. Others have been seen taking photos with passersby, standing around chatting and drinking coffee. There have been no reports of them facing threats that would require weapons.",
      "On Thursday, Mr. Trump visited a U.S. Park Police facility in southeast D.C., and handed out hamburgers and pizza as he thanked federal law enforcement. A day before, Hegseth, as well as Vice President JD Vance and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, visited National Guard members at Union Station.",
      "Mr. Trump has insisted that people he knows feel safer than before in the city, but local officials say the initiative is unnecessary. After spiking in 2023, violent crime in D.C.\u00a0has been declining\u00a0for the last year and a half, according to local police data. Mr. Trump has claimed that crime is on the upswing.",
      "The city's police department and the offices of Mayor Muriel Bowser and Attorney General Brian Schwalb did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The city had been informed about the intent for the National Guard to be armed, a person familiar with the conversations said earlier this week. The person was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Spokespeople for the District of Columbia National Guard and a military task force overseeing all the guard troops in Washington did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.",

      "The United States military scrambled fighter jets Sunday to intercept a Russian spy plane flying near Alaska, the North American Aerospace Defense Command said. It was the third time in less than a week that U.S. forces deployed planes after a Russian plane was spotted inside the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone, a section of international airspace just outside of U.S. and Canadian sovereign space that both countries monitor closely.",
      "This kind of Russian activity is not considered a threat and happens regularly in the identification zone, which extends outward from U.S. territory off the coast of Alaska, said NORAD.

      "NORAD detected and tracked one IL-20 COOT, a Cold War-era reconnaissance aircraft operated by the Russian military, in the Alaskan identification zone Sunday after surveilling the same type of plane flying over the region Wednesday and Thursday.",
      "In each instance, NORAD responded by scrambling multiple fighter jets to monitor the spy plane, according to the military command. The Russian aircraft never entered U.S. or Canadian sovereign territory, remaining in the international zone off Alaska.",
      "U.S. military officials have detected Russian warplanes inside the Alaskan identification zone on numerous occasions this year, including sightings within the bounds of the international space in April and July.",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cited risks to the labor market in opening the door to cutting interest rates. Here's what job-seekers should know.",
    "story": [
      "When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday opened the door to\u00a0cutting interest rates\u00a0for the first time in nearly a year, he noted the tremors beginning to shake a main pillar of the U.S. economy: the labor market.",
      "Concerns about the pace of job growth were heightened earlier this month after government data showed a sharp slowdown in hiring in July, along with much weaker payroll gains in May and June than previously thought. The disappointing numbers were alarming enough for President Trump to question their accuracy and to fire the head of the agency tasked with compiling the data.",
      "Yet labor experts tell CBS News they weren't surprised by the downturn, and caution that more pain could be in store for job seekers. Data released since the August 1 job numbers shows companies are delaying hiring as they adjust course to account for headwinds including\u00a0fresh U.S. tariffs\u00a0and the advent of artificial intelligence, they say.",
      "\"There's a real cooling in the labor market,\" Andy Challenger, senior vice president of executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We're also having lots of individual conversations with companies that are letting us know to expect future layoffs.\"",
      "He added, \"So for me, there is more reason to be pessimistic about the labor market than optimistic we'll see some major bounce back.\"",
      "Here are three charts that could point to a serious downturn in the U.S. job market.",
      "Fewer workers are getting hired",
      "Overall, U.S. employers in 2025 have added fewer jobs on a monthly basis compared with the pace of gains in recent years, when companies sought to expand as the economy roared back from the pandemic. In 2024, employers hired an average of 168,000 workers each month, but that has slowed to an average of 35,000 over the past three months, Powell said on Friday.",
      "The risk is that the labor market could weaken from here, which could lead to \"sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,\" Powell said.",
      "The slowdown could spur the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate, policymakers' main tool for energizing the economy and job growth, at its meeting next month for the first time since December 2024. Lowering rates could bolster the labor market because it would make it cheaper for consumers to borrow, driving spending, for businesses to invest, including by adding workers.",
      "More long-term job seekers",
      "Another troubling sign is a recent surge in long-term job seekers, or people who have been searching for a job for more than 27 weeks. In July, about 1.8 million Americans had been looking for work for more than 27 weeks, a jump of about 64% from three years earlier and 20% from a year ago.",
      "It may not get easier to find work anytime soon, given signs from employers that they intend to continue to cut jobs, Challenger said.",
      "\"Don't take the summer off\" from looking for new work, he advised job-hunters. \"It's hard to imagine a scenario where the labor market will be better in three to six months.\"",
      "A jump in unemployed young workers",
      "At the same time, young workers are also having more trouble finding their first jobs, which has been blamed on everything from slowing economic activity this year to employers adopting artificial intelligence in place of entry-level workers.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low, at 4.2%. Yet that statistic is backward-looking, reflecting the labor market's strength in previous months \u2014 it says little about economic conditions moving forward.",
      "Meanwhile, for new college graduates the current job market amounts to \"a perfect storm,\" said career coach Tracey Newell.",
      "\"Companies are limiting new entry-level roles, and AI is replacing many traditional 'starter' jobs,\" she added, noting that it isn't unusual for employers these days to receive hundreds of job applications for a single position.",

    "summary": "Trump officials sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists, slowing their response to the measles outbreak in West Texas.",
    "story": [
      "As measles surged in Texas early this year, the Trump administration's actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency's most critical function \u2014 emergency response \u2014 when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows.",
      "The outbreak soon became the worst the United States has endured in over three decades.",
      "In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration interfered with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, stalled the agency's reports, censored its data, and abruptly laid off staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.",
      "\"CDC hasn't reached out to us locally,\" Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. \"My staff feels like we are out here all alone,\" she added.",
      "A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.",
      "\"All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,\" one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. \"All this training and then we weren't allowed to do anything.\"",
      "Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, researchers estimate. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.",
      "The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces as vaccination rates drop, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.",
      "While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fueled doubt in vaccines and exaggerated the ability of vitamins to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The Texas outbreak spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Mexico's Chihuahua state \u2014 at minimum. Together these linked outbreaks have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.",
      "\"This is absolutely outrageous,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \"When you're battling contagious diseases, time is everything.\"",
      "\"The CDC is 'stressed' currently\"",
      "Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in late January had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren't getting tested.",
      "\"I think this may be very large,\" she wrote in a Feb. 3 email to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in another email what she'd learned from conversations with people in the community: \"According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November.\"",
      "In that email and others, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.",
      "One email asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC's recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.",
      "\"Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?\" Wells wrote on Feb. 5.",
      "\"It never hurts to ask the CDC,\" said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.",
      "\"I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified,\" Milton wrote. \"Of course, we know the CDC is 'stressed' currently.\"",
      "Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the Immunization Partnership, a Texas nonprofit.",
      "\"The CDC had gone dark,\" said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. \"We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn't expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit.\"",
      "Technically, the Trump administration's freeze on federal communications had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after.",
      "\"There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,\" one CDC scientist said.",
      "Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. \"Like most public health organizations, we weren't able to get ahold of our program people in February,\" he said. Information trickled out through the CDC's communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. \"The CDC was gagged,\" he said.",
      "Through private conversations, Benjamin said he learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration lay off CDC staffers in droves.",
      "\"It's not that the CDC was delinquent,\" Benjamin said. \"It's that they had their hands tied behind their backs.\"",
      "To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn't need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. \"We would always offer a conversation and ask if there's anything we could do,\" she said.",
      "Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state's correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records \"confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code.\"",
      "Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That's corroborated in emails from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.",
      "\"Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC,\" Zach Holbrooks, the health district's executive director, told KFF Health News.",
      "Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren't already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn't spread measles to others.",
      "Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in close-knit Mennonite communities where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn't want to be tested, didn't want to name their contacts, and didn't want to talk with the health department. \"It doesn't matter what resources I have if people won't avail themselves of it,\" Holbrooks said.",
      "Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against COVID-19 restrictions deepened that mistrust.",
      "Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some live in the U.S. illegally, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. Locals guess the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is far larger than the U.S. Census count.",
      "\"I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don't know how many people are in the community,\" Holbrooks said. \"There's a lot of people in the shadows out here.\"",
      "Public health experts say the situation in Gaines County sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.",
      "About 450 people \u2014 including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers \u2014 helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in Clark County, Washington, in 2018.",
      "Alan Melnick, Clark County's public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. \"We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,\" he said.",
      "Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.",
      "In New York, hundreds of people in the city's health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.",
      "The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City's assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to data from prior outbreaks. Then there's the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and the lasting toll of some measles infections, including deafness or worse.",
      "\"I don't think there's a price tag to put on a child's death that would otherwise be prevented,\" Zucker said.",
      "Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells emailed a colleague: \"I'm so overwhelmed.\"",
      "A death ignites a response",
      "On Feb. 26, Texas announced that a 6-year-old child had died of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a brief notice on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.",
      "In emails, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC's notice might exacerbate a problem: Doctors were treating children with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet reported on a large drugstore where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were \"flying off the shelf.\"",
      "Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and dire abnormalities during fetal development.",
      "Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups \u2014 including one founded by Kennedy \u2014 that diminished the need for vaccination by inaccurately claiming that vitamin A staved off the disease's worst outcomes.",
      "\"How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?\" Milton asked in an email.",
      "Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. \"HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials,\" one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency's notices and alerts. \"If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven't seen those babies born yet.\"",
      "Another CDC official said they've had to \"walk a fine line\" between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS.",
      "While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. \"We're providing vitamin A,\" Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News. \"There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,\" he claimed, \"against serious disease and death.\"",
      "The studies Kennedy referenced were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is seldom useful against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.",
      "Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, saying that any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with numerous inaccurate statements. \"There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year,\" he said. \"It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.\" There is no evidence that measles vaccines \"cause deaths every year.\" Scores of studies show that the vaccine doesn't cause encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.",
      "In another interview, Kennedy said, \"The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.\" The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine does not contain an iota of fetal cells.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.",
      "\"Staff are exhausted\"",
      "Despite national attention after the country's first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.",
      "\"Local hospitals are at capacity,\" wrote Jeffrey Hill, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. \"The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now,\" he added.",
      "\"I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,\" Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in an email, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. \"Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted.\"",
      "The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.",
      "None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It spread to Mexico when an unvaccinated Mennonite child visited relatives in Seminole and returned home with an infection. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen in decades, with at least 3,700 cases and 13 deaths in the state of Chihuahua.",
      "Then another child in West Texas died of measles.",
      "In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine advisory meeting in late April. \"There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,\" Sugarman said. \"We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.\"",
      "Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. \"A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,\" he said, \"and didn't see the need to confirm it.\"",
      "On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas outbreak over, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.",
      "The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.",
      "More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding not to vaccinate their kids, alarmed by unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers lacking expertise in vaccines and infectious disease, including some who have expressed anti-vaccine views. One of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, blamed the deaths of children with measles on \"medical mismanagement,\" without evidence.",
      "At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than $11 billion in public health funds earlier this year.",
      "Amid Lubbock's toughest months, Wells sent an email to the department's exhausted staff. \"The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us,\" she wrote. \"Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience.\"",

      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \"passed peacefully in his sleep,\" Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \"The Sopranos,\" on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \"The Good Wife,\" where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\"I'm a creature of nepotism,\" Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \"I got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\"",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \"My Fair Lady\" and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \"Santa Barbara.\"",
      "\"I was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\" he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \"The Public Eye\" and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \"chills\" when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \"Northern Exposure\" paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \"The Sopranos.\"",
      "\"When David was going to do the pilot for 'The Sopranos' he called and asked me if I would do a cameo of Hesh. It was just supposed to be a one-shot,\" he told Forward in 2015. \"But when they picked up the show they liked the character, and I would come on every fourth week.\"",
      "Films included Woody Allen's \"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\" but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \"Rescue Me,\" \"Mad About You,\" \"Transparent\" and guest spots on shows ranging from \"The West Wing\" to \"Broad City.\"",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \"Taller Than a Dwarf\" in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \"Fish in the Dark.\"",
      "\"I do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\" Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \"I wouldn't know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that's when I'll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\"",
      "Adler published a memoir, \"Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\" last year. \"I'm ready to go at a moment's notice,\" he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \"too goofy-looking\" to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",
      "\"I'm immortal,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip\u00a0\u2014 An Israeli airstrike hit the fourth floor of southern Gaza's main hospital Monday, killing at least eight people including four journalists, health officials said. An official with the civil defense rescue agency in Hamas-run Gaza said later that at least 15 people were killed in the strike in total.",
      "Civil defense spokesman Mahmud Bassal told journalists at the scene that \"the death toll is 15, including four journalists and one civil defense member,\" according to the French news agency AFP.",
      "The victims were killed in a double-tap strike on the hospital, with one missile hitting first, then another moments later as rescue crews arrived, the health ministry said.",
      "Khan Younis' Nasser Hospital, the largest in southern Gaza, has withstood raids and bombardment throughout 22 months of war, with officials citing critical shortages of supplies and staff.",
      "Asked about the strike and journalists being among the victims, the Israel Defense Forces issued a statement saying it had carried out an attack and adding that it would \"conduct an initial inquiry as soon as possible,\" adding that it regretted \"any harm to uninvolved individuals and does not target journalists as such.\"",
      "A hospital official told CBS News that four journalists were killed in the Monday morning double-tap strike at Nasser Hospital. The official identified the four as Hossam al-Masri, who worked for the Reuters news agency, Mohammed Salama, who worked for Al Jazeera, and freelance journalists Maryam Abu Daqqa  and Moaz Abu Taha.",
      "The Associated Press' news director for the Middle East, Jon Gambrell, said in a social media post that Abu Daqqa had \"freelanced for the AP since the Gaza war began.\"",
      "Reuters confirmed that al-Masri had worked for the international news agency. It said photographer Hatem Khaled, who also worked as a contractor for the agency, was wounded.",
      "At least one other journalist was wounded in the strike, a hospital official said, identifying the man as Haithem Omar, who also works for Reuters.",
      "Israel has come under mounting pressure over the number of journalists being killed in its military operations in Gaza \u2014 including in targeted strikes against individuals whom Israeli officials claim were Hamas operatives.",
      "Israeli strikes and raids on hospitals are not uncommon. Multiple hospitals have been struck or raided across the Gaza Strip, with Israel claiming its attacks had targeted militants operating inside the medical facilities, without providing evidence.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, the Foreign Press Association, which represents journalists working in Israel and the Palestinian territories, said it was \"outraged and in shock\" over the latest killings of media workers.",
      "\"This is among the deadliest Israeli attacks on journalists working for international media since the Gaza war began,\" the organization said, confirming the identities of the four people killed. \"These strikes hit the exterior staircase of the hospital where journalists frequently stationed themselves with their cameras. The strikes came with no warning.\"",
      "The organization demanded an immediate explanation from the IDF and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office for the strike, adding: \"This has gone on far too long. Too many journalists in Gaza have been killed by Israel without justification. Israel continues to block international journalists from independent access to Gaza. This must be a watershed moment. We appeal to international leaders: do everything you can to protect our colleagues. We cannot do it ourselves.\"",
      "The international Committee to Protect Journalists also condemned the Israeli strike. In a statement, the group called on the international community \"to hold Israel accountable for its continued unlawful attacks on the press.\"",
      "\"Israel's broadcasted killing of journalists in #Gaza continues while the world watches and fails to act firmly on the most horrific attacks the press has ever faced in recent history,\" CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah said in the group's post. \"These murders must end now. The perpetrators must no longer be allowed to act with impunity.\"",
      "On August 11, Israel's military targeted and killed five Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza, including correspondent Anas al-Sharif. The Israel Defense Forces said it had intelligence and documents from Gaza to prove al-Sharif was the head of a Hamas terrorist cell, and the IDF shared\u00a0undated\u00a0photos\u00a0of Al-Sharif with Yahya Sinwar, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, who was\u00a0killed last October.",
      "CBS News could not verify the authenticity of the photos. Al Jazeera and al-Sharif had\u00a0previously dismissed\u00a0Israel's claims as baseless, The Associated Press reported. Just three weeks ago, al-Sharif had appealed to the Committee to Protect Journalists over fears he might be assassinated.",
      "A June strike on Nasser Hospital killed three people and wounded 10, according to the health ministry. At the time, Israel's military said it had targeted Hamas militants operating from a command and control center inside the hospital.",
      "The Hamas-run health ministry said Sunday that at least 62,686 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its war in Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and saw 251 others taken as hostages.",
      "The ministry does not distinguish in its figures between fighters and civilians, but it says around half of those killed have been women and children. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable information available on war casualties, as such figures are difficult to independently verify as Israel does not permit foreign journalists into Gaza.",
      "Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. Good to have you here, Congressman, there's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland, and that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The President encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now, California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well. Why do you so strongly oppose this?",
      "REP. MIKE LAWLER: I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong, and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less, and mine wasn't even one of them, despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat, I won by six and a half points. So when you look at the map across the country, the fact is roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts. They're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and therefore they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that obviously reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond. But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here. Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year in 2024 at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become Speaker. They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting, despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution. So now New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the house. So this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states trying to get electoral advantage right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the President's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the President of United States doesn't want it done?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Look, obviously, it's going to be a fight, but this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms, because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974 never held a job outside of elected office. It's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform. So I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties, because frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority. Period. On the question, though, that we have been- also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The President of the United States has mentioned New York is another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars, and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Crime has been a major problem in New York for years, and Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Do you want National Guard troops?-- ,",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized- Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard's troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime. When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80% of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution, that 80% of these individuals are released back out onto the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington DC, 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. So when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime?",

      "REP. LAWLER: -- This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- that's a local issue that would need to get changed. But in terms of the question on the troops--",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- No but- it's- no- but Margaret, this why the homicide rate is so high--",

      "REP. LAWLER: No. No, no, don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above, the FBI, the DEA, ATF. I've met with ATF just a few weeks ago in my office on this very issue of really cracking down on gun crimes and prosecuting criminals who use guns in the commission of a crime. I was proud last year to lead the passage of the Undetectable Firearms Act, a common sense, bipartisan piece of gun safety legislation enacted into law in the 1980s. We extended it seven years to make sure that no gun is manufactured or sold with less than 3.7 ounces of metal. I led that effort, and the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime, and yet, as I pointed out, you look at Washington D.C., only 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. This is why you've seen the homicide rate double in less than a decade. It's outrageous, and it's exactly why the President is cracking down on crime in major cities, and as we saw in California, he is legally authorized to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something in New York State that matters. A good amount of money from that CHIPs bill went to New York. On Friday, the White House announced there's going to be a change to how the government deals with that money that's meant to make America independent of Asian computer chip manufacturing and bring it all back on shore, the President wants to buy a 10% stake in Intel. That company says it's going to now basically have US taxpayers as a shareholder, own 10%. As a conservative, do you think that the government should have ownership stakes in private companies?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Generally speaking, no, I think when you look at prior history, when we've had, for instance, the bank bailouts, when we've had the auto bailouts, you know, in the- in the aftermath of the collapse of the market and '08 the American taxpayer really didn't get a return on that. I think what the President is seemingly trying to do is get a return on these tens of billions of dollars that are being invested by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. taxpayers into companies like Intel to manufacture chips. And so rather than just give the money away, get a return on that investment. Obviously, this is a national security issue. We want to be in control of the manufacturing of semiconductors and that's critical for our foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm being told I have to go to a commercial break, so I'm going to leave it there. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen. She joins us from Amman, Jordan. Good morning, Senator. I know we've got a bit of a delay here, so I'll launch right in.",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Good morning, or, afternoon here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, exactly. You do sit on the Armed Services Committee as well. Here in Washington, there was a sudden round of firings we learned of on Friday. There was Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was dismissed, the Pentagon did not explain why. In addition, the Navy Reserve chief, Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, was fired. The Navy SEAL who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Milton Sands, was dismissed. Has Congress been informed as to why these leaders are being fired by Secretary Hegseth?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings, and they come on the heels of firings earlier this year, of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of Naval Operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things, one of the strengths of America's military, are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks, who have the training, the expertise, to be able to do the jobs. And what we don't want is political people in those jobs, who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So it's very troubling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze, and we're going to try to get that back up, if we can. The Senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan. So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: The feed just froze.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan. We- we lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator. Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday, this internationally recognized body, backed by the UN, the IPC. It tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a man-made famine underway in Gaza. This is a very rare designation, only four other times has one been designated. The country you are in, Jordan, called it a \"shameful failure of humanity\" that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think is- it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen. One of the- we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is an- it funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration. They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable. Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he's doing and change his position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli Prime Minister's Office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it, quote, \"a modern blood libel, spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\" That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor, and the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it. But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death, because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that, they're getting ready to do another- or, they've already started, planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people. So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in, to the people who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I- I understand your criticism right now. I want to ask you a little bit though about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former deputy national security adviser for President Biden Joe- Jon Finer, just wrote a piece in the Atlantic, and he said that while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes \"we did far too little, far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\" Do you agree with him, and do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position. With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in. I think it's something that, I hope, that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but do you agree with this self criticism by this key Democrat? Do you think Democrats should have said more sooner--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We should be doing more and we should have done more. Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. I want to also ask you--",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think everybody--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: --should have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense. When it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck, and they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck, when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border. That's- that's not a legitimate effort to get humanitarian aid in to the people of Gaza who are starving. And that can be changed. All it takes is Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, we're going to allow that aid in.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to 'Face The Nation.' It's quiet here in Washington as we come on the air this morning, but the debate is heating up over President Trump's calling up of nearly 2300 National Guardsmen, along with federal agents from ICE, the ATF, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and others, to patrol the streets of the city alongside DC police forces. And we're seeing yet another instance of Trump's expanding of the federal government's reach, this time when it comes to control of police in local communities. Will we see pictures like these in other U.S. cities in the future? Well, one of the places President Trump has mentioned is needing help fighting crime is nearby Baltimore, and joining us right now is Maryland's Democratic Governor Wes Moore. Thank you for being here.",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they're here in DC- there are guardsmen from six different states on the street. The mission is, quote, 'beautification, duty and support.' The defense secretary has author- authorized them to carry M4 and M17 rifles, but to date, we have not been able to locate anyone armed within the National Guard on the streets of DC. Why, though, are you so opposed to this deployment?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Well, there's- there's plenty of reasons. You know one, it is not sustainable. You cannot continue this type of pace of operations, particularly when you're when it's costing over a million dollars a day in order to do this. The second, it's not scalable. You're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city, particularly when many of the cities that have the highest crime rates are the places that have actually deployed their national guards to Washington, DC. So who's going to- who's going to go do the work in their cities? The third, it's unconstitutional. It's a direct violation of the 10th Amendment, and for a party that talks about state rights, it's amazing how they're having such a big government approach in the way they're conducting public safety. The fourth reason is because it's deeply disrespectful to the members of the National Guard. As someone who actually deployed overseas and served my country in combat, to ask these men and women to do a job that they're not trained for is just deeply disrespectful. And so when we're thinking about all of these lasting factors, when we're thinking about the fact that it serves as a distraction from the fact that the President's disastrous economic policies are making everything more expensive for everyday Americans- is making life harder for everyday Americans, there is a multitude of reasons that I am against this, and I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the National Guard does say that these troops will be trained and deputized by Federal Marshals. So this is going to be distinct from the military rules of engagement",
      "GOV. MOORE: But it is counter to every bit of training that we received. When- when I joined the military, we joined with a clear intention to fight and win our nation's wars. The members of our National Guard are trained up to be able to address things like emergency situations, situations where you need- where you need a surge of supports for- for traumas and disasters that are happening within individual jurisdictions. That is not this, and this is a direct deflection that the President is authorizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know the President watches the program, and he likely saw the guest listing because he's tweeting about you- or truthing, I guess. He says the Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked in a 'nasty and provocative tone that I walk the streets of Maryland with him,' and he's talking about 'crime ridden Baltimore.' It's quite lengthy, but he goes after your record on crime. He says it's a 'bad one.' He says, if you need help, he will send in the troops, which is being done in nearby DC. I mean, when we saw a few weeks ago the deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the governor of California tried to go to the courts, and he was unable to stop it. Is the reality here is- you can't stop the president from sending troops to Baltimore if he wants to?",
      "GOV. MOORE: The year before I became the governor, in 2022, Baltimore was averaging almost a homicide a day, and I came in and I said, I refuse to be a governor who just offers thoughts and prayers to this situation. So we said we're actually going to work in partnership with Mayor Scott, work in partnership with local elected officials, work in partnership with local- with local law enforcement. We made the largest investments in local law enforcement in our state's history. Over $50 million going to Baltimore City alone\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That came from federal money.",
      "GOV. MOORE: No that came from both federal and state money, and also Maryland became one of the only states that actually helps to fund the U.S. Attorney out of balance sheet, taking many of those gun crimes and actually turning them into federal charges. And the results have been- have been incredibly encouraging, where Maryland's had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime of anywhere in the United States in the past two and a half years. The homicide rate in Maryland is down over 20% since I have been the governor, and the last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet. And so the reason that I've asked the President to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance. This- these tropes, in these 1980s scare- scare tactics. And you know, just last week I was in Baltimore, and I was with a group called 'We Our Us' who is a violence intervention group. And they say we're all we got, we're all we need. And that's exactly how people in this community feel. Because while the President is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime, but it's falling on deaf ears of the President of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the positive trend line. The President's pointing to the FBI statistics, which shows Baltimore is the fifth most instances of violent crime on a per capita basis. Fourth highest murder rate. To your point, the city of Memphis is also on that list, and the Governor of Tennessee sent those National Guard troops here to this city, not to the streets of Memphis--",
      "GOV. MOORE: \u00a0--And we know we have work to do. We know- if one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work and what tactics is just theatrics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But your- the mayor in Baltimore did just say he wants federal help-- he doesn't want National Guard troops, per se, though, he says he wants agents from FBI, DEA and ATF, do you need more federal help in policing if your mayor thinks you do?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Oh, absolutely. And we need the President to stop cutting funding. Because if you look at the President's budget, it actually cuts funding towards violence intervention groups. It cuts funding towards the bureaus of the FBI and the ATF that are supporting local jurisdictions like Baltimore. That it doesn't do anything about things like ghost guns and these extended Glock clips that allow these Glocks to essentially turn into automatic weapons. Those are actually real, tangible things that the President of the United States could do and where you could put capital to actually make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are a Democrat who is- President Trump says so as well, possibly a presidential candidate. He talked about you the other day.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He spent a lot of time talking about you.",
      "GOV. MOORE: I've been on his mind a lot of times.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're spending time talking about crime. Is this something that, as a Democrat, you think the Democratic Party needs to be more vocal and muscular about when running for office? Because I hear you doing that. It's a very big change from 2020 when the you know idea was defund the police.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Absolutely. And yet the President spending all of his time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. And yes, I believe that we have to be able to address the issue of crime. I came up in, and I have existed in neighborhoods and communities that have been chronically neglected. And I remember one of the first things that happened in our first months in, I had to visit Shock Trauma inside of Baltimore, because Baltimore had one of the largest mass shootings in its history. And I visited a young man, a teenager, who was just finished surgery and had one of his testicles shot off, and was talking about, how was he ever going to become a father? And I said, at that point, I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer. And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the President of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods who believe that progress is possible and who are willing to put in the work and we're just simply asking for Washington to be able to acknowledge it and support it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says you're not 'presidential timber' at all. I imagine you disagree with that assessment?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah, I've been very clear. I'm not running for president--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.",
      "GOV. MOORE: But it's interesting that- but it's interesting the President seems to be more concerned about my future than he is about the future of the American people, and that's why I'm asking him to keep his focus. Focus on the things that actually matter right now, which is the fact that his economic policies are driving up prices on everything from electronics, to the clothes that we wear, to the food that we eat. Talk about the fact that he has immigration policies that are knocking out tens of thousands of jobs in the state of Maryland. Talk about the fact that you are about to kick veterans and seniors off of health care. Don't worry about my future. Worry about theirs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, you brought up immigration one of the residents of your state, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was just released from pretrial detention on Friday. But the Trump administration has instructed him to report to ICE within 72 hours for deportation to Uganda. He's originally from El Salvador. He was mistakenly deported to that prison in El Salvador and then returned to the U.S. This is federal policy. This is not state policy. But I do wonder, is there anything that you are doing to help his family stay united?",
      "GOV. MOORE: And the- what we know is that- you know, and all we're asking for, is that the constitution be followed on this. The constitution is very clear about how we deal with these types of issues, and when we look at what's happened in this situation, it's the President manipulating the fact that we have a very broken immigration system inside this country. But instead of actually doing the work that it requires to fix it, actually working in Congress to come up with a comprehensive immigration bill, the President is using to just- working to exploit the brokenness. And I am very clear that there is no higher priority for me than public safety\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want him to face a day in court, in other words.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Absolutely. I want due process. I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the President of the United States or the Secretary of Homeland Security who is trying to be judge, Juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case. I believe in the Constitution, and I believe that that's what we should follow for this case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something your party is tinkering with here, redistricting or gerrymandering, as some people know it. You've said you don't like talking about it, but all options are on the table when it comes to your state. There's only one- one seat here that is actually Republican, and it's a seat held by Representative Andy Harris. Are you considering trying to redraw lines in Maryland?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah. When I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actively looking at it now?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah because and I think- and I think we have to--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yes, and I think- and I think we have to, because I think what's happened is this is what people hate about politics in the first place, the fact that the President of the United States very similar to what he did in Georgia, where he called up a series of voter registrants and said, I need you to find me more votes. We're watching the same thing now, where he's calling up legislatures around the country and saying, I need you to find me more congressional districts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's doing it. That may be different, but Democrats redistrict you know this, Gavin Newsom is doing it right now. A few years ago in New York, we saw this. This can backfire. Do you really want to go down this road?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don't have situations where- where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials. We need to be able to have fair maps. And we also need to make sure that if the President of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections, because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't think that one district where they represent- they have a Republican representative that they are actively being represented in Maryland?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I think if you look at maps across the country, less than 10% of congressional seats are actually competitive by nature. Less than 10%. And so if you look at the average win margin in our state and so many states, the average win margin is upwards of 20 to 30% so that means we already have so many gerrymandered areas that we have to be able to add a measure of fairness in the way that it's applied. And so yes, all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're looking at it, you said.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yes we are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Thank you so much.",

      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we saw the Federal Reserve chair signal on Friday that the Fed is going to, as expected, begin lowering rates very soon, but he's also cited slowing economic growth and a cooling job market. So why then did the financial markets rally?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Because he finally pivoted to the risk that matters most for the U.S. economy right now. By construct the Fed has to deliver two things, maximum employment and price stability, and the Fed is looking at slightly higher inflation and a weakening labor market. And what Powell finally did, and many of us feel he should have done this earlier, is he said the risk to the employment side is higher than the risk to the inflation side, and therefore an interest rate cut is warranted. As you know, many of us felt he should have cut last month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed chair said significantly higher tariffs are remaking the entire global trade system. Tighter immigration policy has slowed labor growth, and there are big tax and regulation changes you can't quite, you know, quantify at this point, but it's a lot of uncertainty. Since economists have to build off of models and data, how do you predict where we're going if, basically, he's saying throw out your models?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So one of the problems is he hasn't looked forward enough. He's been very data dependent, and therefore he has tended to be late. Look, there is something promising in our future, and that is productivity enhancement that comes from exciting innovation in AI in life sciences and robotics and other areas. We just have to manage a challenging few months in the period ahead. And if that challenge is mishandled, we will not be able to get the opportunities that we have that offset a lot of structural headwinds, and that includes high debt and high deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something we were discussing with Congressman Lawe- Lawler just before you, and that is this unusual decision for the U.S. government to take a stake in chip maker Intel. That company has been struggling of late and its CEO was criticized by the president United States. He was criticized by the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton. President Trump mentioned all of that on Friday, and he said this.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE STARTS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:",
      "He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States. So we picked up $10 billion. And we do a lot of deals like that.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said the CEO wanted to keep his job, so he offered a 10% stake in his company. Is this signaling a new era for U.S. policy? I mean, central planning of the economy?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: I don't think so, Margaret. Look, as the congressman said, it's good to send the message that companies will not get something for nothing, and that is what they've gotten used to since 2008, all the bailouts. And what they are saying now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Which were paid back--",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Which were paid back, but at the time, the government took enormous risk in many, many areas. The most important distinction, if I may, here, is between ownership and control. Yes, the government can own 10% but it must not control how this company manages its affair, because once we go down that road that is a really dangerous road, and that would eat away at what makes America really special, which is a dynamic, entrepreneurial economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I believe the Commerce Secretary said there won't be control, but that is something to watch for. I want to also ask you about political pressure, not just on the Federal Reserve Chair, which you've nodded to, but the President is also now threatening to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. They're accusing her without publicly disclosed evidence of mortgage fraud and urging an investigation. In fact, the Justice Department wrote a letter to Chair Powell, encouraging her to be removed. Are you concerned that this is starting to be a pattern here of political interference with the Federal Reserve?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So these allegations are unproven, and it's important to stress that. Having just said that, this is the fifth time in the last five years that there has been allegations against a Fed official. And already four of them have had to resign. So what I'm concerned about is that there seems to have been a culture that has developed at the Fed that has resulted in these four resignations. But I am very worried about preserving Fed independence. And an independent central bank is critical to the well being of the economy, and there's lots of reasons for that. So you know, one has to disting- distinguish between the two. I can't speak to the unproven allegations, but I do think it's really important to defend the central bank independence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as I understand it, the governor has said she wants to, you know, share information, and is denying wrongdoing here. But just the fact that it is the President directing the attention towards her doesn't this suggest that even if Jerome Powell steps aside as head of the Federal Reserve, that this isn't going to stop this big spotlight on the central bank that is so powerful, and that the fear you have of political interference may not go away?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and I- my fear and my concern is that the longer Chair Powell is in his position, and it runs out in May, the longer he's in his position until then, the more this acts as a magnet for attacking, not only deeper attacks from the president, but much broader from the political system. And that's one thing that quite a few people are worried about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mohamed El-Erian, thank you so much for sharing your insight today. We'll leave it there. We'll be back in a moment."

So he's doing great.\"",
      "When Billy first revealed his NPH diagnosis, the five-time Grammy Award winner said that the condition had been \"exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance.\"",
      "The statement at the time continued, \"Under his doctor\u2019s instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period.

      "Common symptoms of NPH include difficulty walking, urinary incontinence and problems with concentration and memory.",

      "\"I was doing a segment for SiriusXM for his channel, the Billy Joel channel on Sirius a couple of weeks ago,\" she said. \"I do a playlist of his songs. I do analysis on it with the backstories. So I interview him. I go straight to the source, my dad, and I ask him about all the material. And I was asking him, single by single, I said, \u2018Well, which album is this from? What year?\u2019\"",
      "\"He remembers every album, the exact year, the order in which the singles were ordered on the album,\" she added. \"So, as far as I'm concerned, he's sharp as a tack.

      "\"It is personal to me because it was my way of saying to the world and saying, as an artist, I'm not just one person,\" she said. \"I think there is a sort of societal penchant and interest in putting women in a box and pinpointing them as, 'OK, she's that type.'\"",
      "Alexa continued, \"She's good or she is bad or she's sugar or she's spice or she's sweet or she's a bitch. We have this interest in pigeonholing women a lot of times. Or even people do it [and] they don't even realize, right? You just form quick judgments based on a picture or based on an interview clip, now with sound bites on social media. It's so easy to form judgments too quickly, I feel.\"",
      "\"And so \u2018Riverside Way\u2019 is personal for me because it's my way of saying, 'Hey, you know, just like most women and particularly artists, there's not just one side to us,'\" she added. \"There is the side of me that's very much the good daughter and loves to perhaps be a little more demure. But then there's another side that's...a bit wilder and more curious and more interested in exploring things. And I think with \u2018Riverside Way,\u2019 I wanted to show, it's OK to get outside your comfort zone and take risks, both with storytelling, narrative wise and stylistically with this song.\"",
      "\"I wanted this image of a girl that's just having a fantasy with a guy and, you know, speeding down the highway in a truck at 200 miles per hour, and they're not even sure where they're going or where they'll end up because they're so immersed in the moment. And so I wanted that escapism to be very vivid. And I am an escapist at heart. I love painting a very vivid picture in my mind. That I can just sort of climb into and crawl into. I get a real thrill from that as an artist.\"",

      "\"And my dad was more like the Long Island hooligan, as he calls himself, but you know a genius with a chip on his shoulder,\" Alexa said with a laugh. \"So they kind of complimented each other in that way and their differences.

      "While NASA classified the object as a comet, Dr. Avi Loeb pointed out that an image showed an unexpected glow in front of the object rather than trailing behind it, something he called \"quite surprising.\"",

      "Over the past year, more people have reported receiving order shipment emails for purchases they never made. These messages usually come from legitimate retailers, often sportswear brands or electronics stores, and contain real tracking numbers and delivery details. The products are being shipped to different names at different addresses, but for some reason, the buyer's contact email is yours.",
      "It might seem like a harmless clerical error or someone accidentally typing the wrong email address. But when it happens repeatedly, and across multiple unrelated orders, it starts to look less like a coincidence and more like a tactic.",

      "HOW TO DETECT FAKE AMAZON EMAILS AND AVOID IMPERSONATION SCAMS",

      "Some scammers use valid, active email addresses to bypass retailer fraud filters. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's likely happening with those shipment emails in your inbox",
      "It is unlikely that someone is accidentally typing your email address every single time. Rather, scammers are deliberately using valid, active email addresses like yours to bypass retailer fraud filters. Numerous sources confirm that fake order and shipping confirmation emails are a common tactic in fraud operations, with criminals exploiting the trust systems placed in legitimate email addresses.",
      "When a stolen credit card is used, pairing it with a real email that has not triggered spam alerts increases the chance the transaction will go unnoticed by anti-fraud systems. Retailers often check whether an email address is active or bounces. If the system sees a functioning address, it may be less suspicious than an obviously fake one.",
      "Once the order is placed, products are frequently sent to drop addresses or freight-forwarding services, as confirmed by official investigations into brushing scams. These services act as intermediaries, making the scam harder to trace. In that context, your email is simply a means to an end, a validated contact point that helps the operation move forward smoothly.",
      "Scammers can obtain email addresses when reputable companies experience data breaches. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How bad actors are able to get your email",
      "Your email address may have ended up in the hands of scammers through several common methods. The most likely cause is a data breach. Many well-known companies have\u00a0experienced leaks in which customer emails and other information were exposed.",
      "Once your email is part of a leaked database, it often circulates on the dark web or in underground forums, where it is freely traded and reused. Even if you were not part of a breach, scammers often use a technique called credential stuffing. This involves testing stolen login details across different websites to confirm which email addresses are active.",
      "REMOVE YOUR DATA TO PROTECT YOUR RETIREMENT FROM SCAMMERS",
      "The best thing you can do to prevent this from happening is to invest in a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Scan your inbox regularly for order confirmations, shipping notices or account sign-ups you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it directly to the retailer or platform; it could be part of a larger scam using your email address. Never click on suspicious links, even if the message looks legitimate, and protect your devices with strong antivirus software to catch threats before they spread.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Avoid entering your email on shady giveaway sites or sketchy online forms. When in doubt, skip the sign-up or use a throwaway email. The fewer places your email lives, the harder it is for scammers to get hold of it.",
      "Set up a dedicated email for online purchases, newsletters and subscriptions. This helps keep your main inbox clean and makes it easier to spot strange activity. Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0 An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.

      "If this email misuse leads to fraudulent financial activity, users should file a report with the FTC at IdentityTheft.gov or their local authorities.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If you are receiving order confirmations for things you never bought, do not shrug it off. Your email is likely being misused as part of a larger fraud operation, not by accident but intentionally. Scammers are taking advantage of active, trustworthy email addresses to slip past retailer defenses and carry out unauthorized purchases. The repeated use of your email shows that fraud networks are already circulating it, even if your financial information remains untouched.",

      "A new brain implant now lets people control Apple devices, such as iPads, iPhones and the Vision Pro, using only their thoughts. Synchron, an endovascular brain-computer interface (BCI) company based in New York, demonstrated the first wireless BCI that works with Apple's official protocol.",
      "Ten patients have received the implant: six in the U.S. and four in Australia. With this technology, users living with severe paralysis can navigate apps, send messages and operate devices hands-free. This breakthrough greatly expands independence, as it enables patients to manage their environment, stream shows and control smart home devices, all using only their minds.",

      "Synchron is the first company to connect a brain implant directly to Apple devices using Apple's official BCI Human Interface Device (HID) protocol. This means no custom hacks or workarounds. The system simply connects over Bluetooth, just like a keyboard or a mouse, and works with iPhones, iPads, and even the Apple Vision Pro. In a powerful video shared by Synchron, ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates the tech in action. After losing the use of his hands, he's now able to navigate his iPad entirely with thought. That includes opening apps, composing messages, and staying connected with the people he loves-all without moving a muscle.",
      "Behind the scenes, Synchron's system uses artificial intelligence to decode brain signals and turn them into real-time digital commands. Machine learning models interpret motor intent, such as thinking about tapping your finger, and translate that into actions on the iPad. This AI-powered decoding helps the system feel smooth and responsive as users learn to control it with focus alone.",
      "Synchron's brain-computer interface is seen up close. (Synchron)",
      "The game-changing signal strength meter",
      "One surprising new feature is the built-in signal strength meter. This visual cue shows patients how strong their brain signal is in real time. A blue box appears over an icon or app and fills up based on how clearly the system reads the user's intent. It may sound simple, but this is a huge deal. It helps users like Mark fine-tune their mental focus, adjust their posture, and improve their interaction without outside help. It's like seeing your brain in action and learning to drive it better.\u00a0\"When I lost the use of my hands, I thought I had lost my independence,\" Mark says in the video.\u00a0\"Now, with my iPad, I can message my loved ones, read the news, and stay connected with the world, just by thinking.\"",

      "What sets Synchron apart",
      "BCIs like Synchron's Stentrode and Elon Musk's\u00a0Neuralink have connected to devices before, but never like this. Previous setups required custom software or physical adapters. Now, thanks to Apple's new BCI HID protocol, brain-computer interfaces can plug right into the Apple ecosystem like any other accessory. That official integration opens the door to more features, better performance, and fewer setup hurdles. Synchron's COO, Kurt Haggstrom, calls it a\u00a0\"game changer\" for both patients and the entire BCI industry.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This tech isn't just for people with paralysis, at least, not forever. Today, it's a medical tool undergoing trials. Tomorrow, it could become a consumer product you buy at your local Apple Store. With Apple embracing BCI as a legitimate input method, everything from your phone to your smart home could one day be controllable by thought.

      "Falls are the number one cause of injury among adults 65 and older. But the truth is, your risk doesn't suddenly appear the day you turn 65. It increases gradually over time, especially if you're dealing with weak muscles, balance issues, side effects from medication, or even just forgetting a pill. Experts recommend that everyone get screened for fall risk at age 65. But you don't have to wait for a doctor's visit to take action. A new wave of technology is giving older adults the power to track, prevent, and respond to fall risks, all from home. Here are 10 smart tools that can help.",

      "New technology can help track and prevent falls. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "1) Gait sensors track how your balance changes over time",
      "Your walking pattern can reveal subtle issues that increase your risk of falling. If you use an iPhone with iOS 15 or newer, the built-in walking steadiness feature in the Health app can rate your balance as OK, low, or very low over time. Android users can use wearable fitness trackers like\u00a0Fitbit, or Samsung Galaxy Watch to gather similar data. These tools track stride, stability, and pressure patterns that help identify balance changes before you feel unsteady.",
      "FORGET 10,000 STEPS \u2014 RESEARCH REVEALS THE REAL NUMBER YOU NEED FOR BETTER HEALTH",
      "What to check:\u00a0On iPhone, open the Health app and review your walking steadiness trends. Android users can check their wearable app dashboards, like Samsung Health or Fitbit, to view step symmetry, cadence, and gait-related data. Look for any changes over weeks or months and take advantage of in-app exercise suggestions to improve balance and strength.",
      "Apps that track physical activity and walking patterns can help users improve their balance and strength, or even detect a change in gait before it becomes an issue. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "2) Smart pill dispensers prevent risky mistakes",
      "Forgetting to take medication, or taking too much, can cause grogginess or dizziness that increases fall risk. A smart pill dispenser helps make sure you take the right dose at the right time.",
      "What to look for: Look for dispensers with reminders, dose tracking, and alerts for missed meds.",
      "Smart pill dispensers can assist patients in making sure they take the correct dose of the desired medication at the right time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3) Fitness trackers keep you motivated to move",
      "Building strength, especially in your legs and core, is one of the best ways to prevent falls. Whether you use an\u00a0Apple Watch, Fitbit or another device, fitness trackers can nudge you toward daily movement goals.",
      "What to check:\u00a0Track your cardio fitness levels, not just step counts. It's a good indicator of your overall strength and endurance.",
      "Fitness tracking devices can help users build strength and resilience. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Vital-sign monitors help detect lightheaded spells",
      "Dips in blood pressure or oxygen levels can make you feel woozy, which increases your fall risk.\u00a0Smartwatches and fingertip pulse oximeters help you monitor these changes in real time.",
      "What to check:\u00a0If you're not using a wearable, jot down your daily readings with a standard cuff or oximeter to spot any unusual trends.",
      "5) Motion-activated lighting lights the way",
      "Getting up in the middle of the night without enough light is a common recipe for a fall. Motion-activated lights can illuminate your path without you needing to touch a switch.",
      "What to look for: Try plug-in nightlights that turn on when they sense motion, or during a power outage. Some even double as portable flashlights.",

      "What to look for:\u00a0Choose ones that send alerts to your phone. You'll avoid a fall and possibly a pricey repair bill.",
      "7) Doorbell cameras keep you from rushing",
      "One overlooked fall trigger is rushing to answer the door. A\u00a0doorbell camera lets you see who's there and speak to them, so you can take your time or decide not to answer at all.",
      "What to look for: A model with two-way audio gives you the freedom to communicate from wherever you are in your home.",

      "Doorbell cameras enable users to communicate with visitors without rushing to answer the door. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8) Fall-detection devices can call for help",
      "Even the most independent older adults face higher fall risks, and family members who live far away may worry more than they let on. If a fall happens and you're alone, getting help quickly is essential. Wearables like the\u00a0Apple Watch can detect a hard fall and automatically alert emergency services or your emergency contacts.\u00a0Apple Watch SE, Series 4 or later, and Apple Watch Ultra include fall detection. If a hard fall is detected, the watch vibrates, sounds an alarm, and gives the option to call emergency services.",

      "Many smartwatches and medical alert devices can detect when a user falls and offer the option to call for help. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Voice assistants like\u00a0Alexa or\u00a0Google Nest can help you call someone, turn on a light, or get a reminder, without having to move.",
      "What to look for: Set up voice shortcuts and routines for common tasks. If you're unsteady, saying \"Call my daughter\" is a lot safer than walking to your phone.",

      "10) Balance-training apps keep your brain and body in sync",
      "Apps like Nymbl for iPhone or Android, or KOKU for iPhone and Android, offer fun daily balance and cognitive exercises that take just a few minutes. The goal? Keep your body strong and your reflexes sharp.",
      "What to check: Use an app that tracks progress and gives feedback. Some are backed by health researchers or physical therapists.",

      "What this means for you",
      "Falls aren't only about tripping on a rug or losing your footing. They often involve deeper issues like poor sleep, medication interactions, or delayed reflexes. By using smart tech, you can spot early warning signs, make smarter choices, and stay in control of your health, on your own terms.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Getting older doesn't mean giving up your independence. In fact, the right technology can help extend it. Whether it's a\u00a0smartwatch that alerts family during a fall or a simple nightlight that turns on automatically, every tool you use can add peace of mind.

      "Tanicia Miller captured the pill-shaped object, later identified as a rocket launch, on Aug. 12, 2025. (Tanicia Miller/Facebook)",
      "He emphasized the critical nature of data verification when distinguishing between civilian misidentifications and genuinely Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP).",
      "\"The primary protocols are to cross-check the visual sighting with other data: higher-resolution optical or infrared, radar, lidar, listen for a radio or acoustic signature, and if it looks to be under intelligent control, interrogate it via VHF radio. That will allow for a better characterization of the object, e.g. size, speed, altitude, range, material composition, and intentions.\"",

      "\"After that obstacle course was completed, you could see in video all of the individuals, all the pledges were pretty banged up,\" Jim said. \"Then they all went to the basement of this fraternity house and they continued on feeding the pledges drinks. Different fraternity guys would hand them drinks and make them chug it and whatnot.\"",
      "Soon thereafter, Timothy was moved to an upstairs couch where he was left alone. According to Jim, he attempted to open a door and leave the house, but couldn't given his level of intoxication. He then fell down 15 basement stairs, causing a brain bleed and a ruptured spleen. He suffered a lung collapse due to aspiration from his own vomit.",
      "Still, the fraternity members picked him up and returned him to the couch.",
      "\"They threw him back on the couch and throughout the night they were slapping him, throwing alcohol on him, throwing stuff at him. And then finally, at about, you know, 1 o'clock in the morning or so, they all went to bed, and they left him laying there,\" Jim said.",
      "Timothy was found in the basement again the next morning, unconscious and unresponsive. Jim said fraternity members spent 45 minutes deciding what to do before they called 911. A little more than 12 hours later, Timothy died at Hershey Medical Center. He had alcohol poisoning from the incident, and the official cause of death was the brain bleed, known as a subdural hematoma.",

      "\"To learn that we lost him to people that were supposed to become his friends, and they could have saved his life \u2026 you can't even get your head around it,\" he continued. \"Like, how could that be? Whether they're his friends or not, how could individuals not care at all to make sure somebody was OK? It's brutal, and it continues to be brutal.\"",

Well, it does happen, and it happens to good kids from good families, you know, wealthy, not wealthy. It's non-discriminating.\"",

      "\"At the end of the day, the pledges have a little bit of power in that they could just band together and say, we're not doing that, because the fraternity members need them,\" he said.",
      "\"They need the money, right? They need money to move in the house, and they need the money to pay the dues,\" he continued. \"And we know of groups that have said, \u2018no, we are not doing that,' and the fraternity members gave them a hard time at first, and then after a while it was like, \u2018OK, well, we still need the pledge class, so fine.\u2019\"",

      "The scam operates in three phases: a \"tech support impostor,\" \"financial institution impostor\" and a \"US government impostor.\"",
      "In the first phase, a tech support impostor will contact victims through text, phone call or email, then direct them to download a program allowing the scammer remote access to their computer. Then, the scammer asks victims to open their financial accounts to \"determine whether there have been any unauthorized charges,\" which the FBI says \"is most lucrative for targeting.\" Afterwards, the scammer will choose an account to target, then tell the victim they will get a call for further instructions from the \"fraud department\" of the bank hosting their account.",

      "U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee discusses Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to remove Hamas from Gaza on 'Fox & Friends.'",
      "On Saturday, Israeli tanks and troops began maneuvering ever closer to Gaza City\u2019s outskirts in preparation for a\u00a0full-scale offensive. Eyewitness accounts reported intensified shelling as Israel is moving toward what could be the defining battle of its war against Hamas terrorists: the capture of Gaza City.",
      "Israel's security cabinet approved the operation, known as Gideon\u2019s Chariots B, and has deployed up to five IDF divisions toward the city\u2019s outskirts\u2014a highly significant mobilization. Thousands of reservists\u2014some 60,000\u2014have been called up.",
      "John Spencer, chair of urban warfare studies at the Madison Policy Forum and executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute, told Fox News Digital the scale of this operation is unprecedented. \"This will be a bigger challenge than anything\u00a0the IDF has faced, arguably ever. It is the densest location in Gaza, the heart of Hamas\u2019s stronghold. And you don\u2019t really know what the tunnels are until you get into them.\"",

      "Spencer said that \"Hamas built semi-circles of defenses oriented at Israel. But the IDF has shown creativity in maneuvering around obstacles.\" Israel plans to send more combat power into Gaza City than it has deployed across the entire Strip thus far. \"If your goal is to clear Gaza City of Hamas\u2019 military capabilities and search for hostages, you need that scale,\" he said.",
      "Gadi Shamni, former commander of the Gaza Division and ex-head of IDF Central Command, told Fox News Digital, \"It is a crowded city with refugee camps, dense neighborhoods, high-rises and a highly developed underground. People say the IDF controls above and below ground, but in the last campaign we saw that wasn\u2019t always true. Even when you destroy tunnels, Hamas can rebuild them quickly. The longer you stay with more forces, the more opportunities you create for the other side to attack.\"",
      "A former senior Israeli security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Fox News Digital, \"The IDF can militarily conquer Gaza, but the costs will be immense on both sides. The IDF will fight with a method of \u2018destroy everything first\u2019\u2014air force bombs, massive charges, detonating streets from afar, wiping out entire areas and advancing slowly.",

      "Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, the chief of the General Staff, conducts a field tour in the Gaza Strip. (IDF Spokesman's Unit)",
      "\"The IDF has gained enormous experience over the past two years and will use those tactics in this battle.\u2026 You are strong, the enemy is weak, and you have patience. Even the weather is on Israel\u2019s side, with winter not arriving until January.\"",
      "The tunnels remain the most formidable element of Hamas\u2019 defense. Unlike ISIS terrorists in Mosul, Spencer said, Hamas has built an underground tunnel network that allows commanders and fighters to move between positions, avoid strikes and\u00a0conceal hostages. \"The IDF that will go into Gaza City is not the IDF of 2023,\" Spencer said, pointing to rapid adaptations in the use of drones, robots and specialized units for tunnel warfare. \"They\u2019ve learned so much. But this will still be slow, very careful and costly.\"",
      "To illustrate the scale, Spencer pointed to the 2004 battle for Fallujah in Iraq. \"It took the Marine Corps about two weeks to clear Fallujah\u2014every single home, building, shop. About 68,000 structures were cleared, as if somebody physically looked in them,\" he said. \"If all five of these [IDF] divisions were doing that, absolutely, you could get it done in a few months. But the enemy always gets a vote. You can\u2019t rush to failure.\"",
      "The former Israeli senior security official described the operation as \"telescopic\u2014very slow, with pistons working one by one. This pace also gives Hamas the chance at every stage to try to cut a deal.\"",

      "Shamni also warned Hamas may relocate hostages, 50 hostages, of whom 20 are still believed to be alive, into combat zones to deter strikes\u2014a tactic he said the IDF would be reluctant to engage for fear of harming captives, a conflict between military necessity and core values.",
      "Shamni highlighted a particularly fraught dilemma: evacuating civilians. \"You don\u2019t know who will leave, how many will leave, how they\u2019ll react\u2014or whether Hamas will even allow them to leave,\" he said. \"I assume many will not evacuate, and then you face the hard dilemma of fighting in a place full of noncombatants.\"",
      "Spencer added that history shows around 10% of civilians stay behind. \"Even 10% of a million is 100,000 people,\" he said.",
      "A terrorist from Hamas takes part in a military parade. (Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/File Photo/Reuters.)",
      "Shamni forecast a protracted operation: \"It could take months. Two months might seize the surface, but then you still have to clear tunnels. It will cost many lives\u2014including civilians. The worst-case scenario is that no hostages are found alive or dead because of the destruction.\"",
      "Shamni, who also served as Israel\u2019s military attach\u00e9 in Washington, warned that the dual goals of defeating Hamas and returning hostages are contradictory, risking years of drawn-out fighting.",

      "Spencer, however, called the decision to press forward a \"calculated risk,\" explaining that while military action carries dangers, \"you weigh the risk of Hamas killing the hostages against the certainty that they\u2019re being starved and tortured. Military pressure is the last resort. Without conquering Gaza City, Hamas will continue to hold a sanctuary.\"",

      "Voters in Taiwan are headed to the polls Saturday to decide whether Taipei should reignite its nuclear power capabilities as the island faces immense energy vulnerabilities amid growing concern over threats posed by China.",
      "In May, Taiwan shut down the Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant \u2014 its last remaining nuclear plant \u2014 after the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) pledged in 2016 to phase out\u00a0nuclear power\u00a0by 2025 over concerns relating to nuclear fallout following the 2011 Fukushima accident in Japan.",
      "Security experts have since been sounding the alarm that the move further exposes Taiwan\u2019s vulnerabilities to China as the island is highly dependent on energy imports, relying heavily on nations like the U.S., Australia, Saudi Arabia and Qatar for both Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and crude oil imports.",
      "\"Taiwan's energy dependence is an Achilles heel,\" Craig Singleton, China Program senior director and senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), said during a media call following a delegation\u2019s visit to the island earlier this month.",

      "\"Beijing can exploit this issue without firing a single shot,\" he added, noting the ease with which China can cut off trade to the island. \"China can leverage its maritime dominance, its legal warfare and cyber tools to choke supply and test Taiwan's political resilience.\"",
      "Over the last decade, Taiwan has imported up to 97% of its energy needs, largely through fossil fuel options, which make up a little over 90% of its energy usage, while renewables reportedly make up another 7%, according to FDD experts.",
      "Though prior to its decision to cut ties with the alternative energy option, nuclear power was a strong supply source and provided nearly 12% of the island\u2019s needs in 2011.",
      "By 2021, that supply had dropped to roughly 9.5%, and, by the following year, it had dipped to just over 4% before being eliminated this year.",
      "Nuclear power for some nations, especially in Europe, has become a solution as they look to drop dependence on carbon-emitting fuels amid escalating concern over climate change.",

      "But some nations, like Germany, have taken a strong anti-nuclear approach over concerns relating to nuclear fallout as seen after the devastating consequences of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster, which not only affected those in the immediate vicinity of Ukraine, but had resounding effects across Europe.",
      "Berlin in 2023 also phased out nuclear power entirely, but Taiwan is facing some glaring security challenges that Germany is not.",
      "Some opponents of nuclear power have also pointed out that wartime scenarios in recent years have shown the security risks with active nuclear power plants as seen during Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and its fight over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.",
      "But experts also argue that Taiwan would likely use up its stores of oil in a matter of weeks to days if China implemented a blockade, according to a report by DW.",

      "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Donald Trump brokering a deal with Azerbaijan and Armenia on \u2018Special Report.\u2019",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s new deal in the South Caucasus has ended a decades-long conflict and handed Washington a rare strategic foothold on Iran\u2019s northern border, experts say.",
      "The agreement, signed earlier this month between Armenia and Azerbaijan, grants the U.S. a 99-year lease over the Zangezur Corridor - a narrow strip of land that will serve as a critical trade and energy route to Europe, bypassing Tehran entirely. Iranian American journalist and dissident Banafsheh Zand told Fox News Digital the move is \"a wonderful gain for the U.S.\" that also delivers a \"slap in the face\" to the regime in Tehran.",
      "The corridor has long been at the center of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which displaced tens of thousands and fueled three decades of instability. Trump\u2019s intervention brought both sides to the table and created what observers say is a new trade and security lifeline linking the Caspian Basin to Europe, bypassing Iran entirely.",

      "A view from Armenia's southern border reveals the Arax River, with Iran visible across the water. This crossing is a vital lifeline for Armenia, facilitating essential trade and energy flows, especially as tensions rise over the proposed Zangezur Corridor. Iran strongly opposes the corridor, fearing it would sever its direct land access to Armenia and diminish its role as a regional transit hub. The corridor, intended to connect Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, has become a flashpoint in regional geopolitics. (Anthony Pizzoferrato/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Known as the Trump Route for Peace & Prosperity (TRIPP), economically, the agreement secures Washington a direct role in overseeing the flow of Caspian hydrocarbons to Europe. The U.S. will manage rail and road infrastructure, telecom networks and energy pipelines running through the corridor, giving American companies a dominant position in regional transit for oil, gas and goods. By controlling this artery, the U.S. not only generates billions in future trade and investment but also locks Europe into alternative supply routes that reduce reliance on both Russia and Iran.",
      "For allies, the corridor offers cheaper and safer access to Caspian energy. For Tehran, it represents lost revenue, lost leverage, and the end of its ability to act as a mandatory gatekeeper for east-west commerce.",
      "Zand said the deal is not only historic but also a direct win for Washington. \"It\u2019s a wonderful gain for the U.S.,\" she said. \"American contractors will be supervising oil and gas from the Caspian Basin, routed through Zangezur and Turkey to Europe. The profit margins are great, and it all happens under NATO\u2019s blessing.\"",
      "Zand said the potential goes even further. \"Nobody\u2019s talking about it yet, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question to see U.S. bases there,\" she said. \"If that happens, then checkmate the Khamenei regime and Russia.\"",

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "For Iran, the corridor represents what Zand called a nightmare scenario. Tehran has long used its geography to shape energy and trade flows. By inserting the U.S. into the region, the new deal effectively strips Iran of that leverage. Zand put it in stark terms: \"Iran is shaped like a cat, a sitting cat. This corridor literally runs above the cat\u2019s ears. It bypasses Iran, takes money away from the regime, and pushes them out into the cold.\"",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Iran Program, said the corridor exposes how vulnerable Iran has become in the Caucasus. \"Both the defeat of Armenia in the most recent war with Azerbaijan, as well as the political problems between Moscow and Yerevan today, have made it harder for the Islamic Republic to really benefit from its traditional economic and political relationship with Armenia,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"They still do have ties, and the regime is an opportunistic actor as much as it is an ideological one. If there is any way to throw stones at this agreement, or extract concessions on the back end, they will try.\"",
      "At the same time, he said the strategic picture is clear. \"The Islamic Republic is, in essence, carved out of this route,\" he said. \"This is not just a critical corridor that could bring stability to the South Caucasus and economic improvement for all countries involved-it also drives home the point that the regime has been such a poor guardian of Iran\u2019s national interest that the Iranian state has been excluded from a major transit route just above its border.\"",
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei addresses the media during voting for parliamentary elections in Tehran, Iran in May 2024. (Photo by Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "The timing, Zand argued, makes the impact even greater. She pointed to Iran\u2019s weakening position since October 7, 2023, and Israel's recent 12-day war with Tehran. \"The regime was self-isolated when it couldn\u2019t come to Hamas\u2019s or Hezbollah\u2019s rescue. Iraq\u2019s Shiites are saying they don\u2019t want to be controlled, Syria is out, and Hezbollah has been degraded. For those of us who\u2019ve watched the regime for decades, we always knew it was a paper tiger. October 7 and the war exposed it to the world.\"",
      "The killing of senior IRGC commanders and nuclear scientists has deepened the sense of vulnerability inside Tehran. \"They can huff and puff about blowing the house down, but the truth is, there\u2019s a whole lot of fear among the regime\u2019s leaders now,\" Zand said. \"Khamenei has even gone into hiding again.\"",
      "TRUMP BRINGS PEACE TO CAUCASUS: INSIDE THE ARMENIA\u2013AZERBAIJAN DEAL 30 YEARS IN THE MAKING",
      "Ben Taleblu added that Washington is now using these shifts to turn Iran\u2019s weakness into opportunity. \"Wherever the regime is weak, that invites pushback, whether militarily or economically,\" he said. \"The U.S. has followed Israel\u2019s military success against the Islamic Republic with strikes of its own against nuclear facilities, and it is now following Azerbaijan\u2019s battlefield success with a political and economic success of its own. This corridor is another example of America moving in when Tehran is most vulnerable.\"",
      "An aerial view of the construction of roads and railways that will pass through the Zangezur Corridor, which will connect the western provinces with Nakhchivan and will also be one of the routes of the Central Corridor extending from China to Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and Turkey. (Photo by Resul Rehimov/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Zand, whose father was a well-known Iranian journalist and intellectual assassinated by the regime, said she views Trump\u2019s direct involvement as the key to the corridor\u2019s success. \"Because it\u2019s Trump, it makes all the difference,\" she said. \u00a0\"Trump doesn\u2019t care about not hurting people\u2019s feelings.

      "Despite Bowser\u2019s attempt to project normalcy ahead of the first day for public schools Monday, the start of the school year will be anything but business as usual. Federal agents have set up checkpoints at various intersections across the city. They\u2019ve conducted immigration enforcement actions, with food delivery drivers slammed to the ground and arrested by masked agents from the Department of Homeland Security in broad daylight. National Guard soldiers in Army fatigues have taken up posts outside of Nationals games and at metro stops.",
      "The White House says there are more than 2,000 agents, officers and soldiers involved in the operation, and more than 900 arrests have been made.",
      "While the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement told NBC News last week that agents wouldn\u2019t be at D.C. schools on the first day, they might come onto campuses in the future.",
      "As mayor, Bowser is the highest ranking official in D.C. government. But ever since Trump issued an executive order declaring an emergency to restore \u201claw and order\u201d in the nation\u2019s capital, her limited power has become more evident, reflecting the city\u2019s lack of autonomy since it is not a state. She wants the agents from Homeland Security Investigations to stop covering their faces to avoid identification during enforcement operations. She doesn\u2019t think the National Guard presence is necessary, and wants them out. But all she can do is ask.",
      "So she\u2019s focused on the things she can control.",

      "Even with the city on edge, Bowser told the educators to avoid the elephant in the room when the bell rings on Monday.",
      "\u201cI want everyone to know whose job politics is in this room,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cWhose job is it? It\u2019s mine. It\u2019s mine. It\u2019s mine. I\u2019m the only one. It\u2019s not yours. Alright?\u201d",

Now, though, Swenson said she and her husband will to escort their kids to their school in Northwest D.C. because the National Guard is making their younger daughter uncomfortable.",
      "The last time she saw a large law enforcement presence in D.C. was during the 2020 racial justice protests, Swenson said. This time, though, is harder to explain to her children.",
      "\u201cBack then, I think we said, \u2018There\u2019s peaceful protesting, and that is people\u2019s right. It\u2019s a good thing to do to stand up when you see something wrong,\u2019\u201d Swenson said during a Friday interview. \u201cBut this? I have no idea what to say to her. It\u2019s very hard for us to explain what\u2019s going on right now.\u201d",
      "At a back-to-school event in the West End neighborhood on Friday, parent Melissa Neil said that while the National Guard surge can be \u201cunderstandable,\u201d it was also \u201ca little concerning.\u201d Neil is a citizen but immigrated from the Dominican Republic, and she noted that even if someone is a citizen, \u201cyou still look as an immigrant.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou never really know what are the standards,\u201d Neil said. \u201cEven if you have your documentation, they can still identify you as you are not. So it is concerning that you\u2019re with your kids, and they can pull you out.\u201d",
      "Nearly every day, a video goes viral of immigration enforcement actions on the streets of Washington, after the Department of Justice directed Bowser to order the city\u2019s police department to assist in immigration enforcement operations and to comply with database inquiries and requests for information from any federal law enforcement entity.",
      "At the same back-to-school event, Louis Limes said he has \u201cmixed emotions\u201d about sending his daughters back to school amid the surge of National Guard and federal agents.",

      "Itzetht Testa was shopping with her children in Columbia Heights on Thursday, and she said that although she served 25 years in the Air Force, she disagreed with the National Guard in the city\u2019s streets. She voted for Trump but disapproves of his first few months so much that she says she will never vote for a Republican again. Now, she said her seventh grade son felt threatened seeing the National Guard.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019re using it for immigration purpose, I don\u2019t care for that,\u201d she said of the National Guard near schools. \u201cIt should not be used for that.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will always vote independent from now on,\u201d Testa added.",
      "While DC residents have yelled, taunted, and protested against the federal agents and National Guard in their neighborhoods over the past 14 days, when students get to the front doors of their schools on Monday, Bowser said Wednesday at the Phelps pep rally that parents, neighbors, and friends will be there \u201cclapping\u201d them in, to show the city is cheering them on.",

      "The majority of the guard members will carry M17 pistols, their service-issued weapons, a Defense Department official with knowledge of the planning, while a small number of the troops will be armed with their service M4 rifles. The troops are authorized to use their weapons for self-protection and \"as a last resort\" in response to an \"imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm,\" the federal task force said.",
      "A spokesperson for the task force said National Guard members supporting safety and security will be armed, whereas troops who are assigned to \u201cbeautification\u201d tasks across the district, which includes tasks like community restoration, most likely will not be.",
      "Several armed National Guard troops were seen Sunday evening patrolling the Chinatown neighborhood of D.C., wearing patches labeled \"MP\" to signify their role as military police.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday ordered the authorization of roughly 2,000 National Guard troops in D.C. to begin carrying weapons. It marked a shift in the posture of the guard members, who had been unarmed as they worked to support law enforcement by assisting with community safety patrols, traffic control points and crowd flow support.",
      "The federal task force said it is \"currently staffing\" a request by local police for \"increased Guardsmen presence at pre-specified metro locations\" to coincide with the start of school year for many D.C. area schools.",
      "In carrying out Hegseth's directive, the Army said that \"Guard members receive initial, regular, ongoing and refresher training\" and \"complete annual weapons qualifications, prior to carrying weapons.\"",
      "A White House official told NBC News that despite being armed, as of Saturday night, the National Guard troops in D.C. are not making arrests and will continue to focus their work on protecting federal assets and providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers making arrests.",
      "More than 2,200 National Guard soldiers and airmen, a majority from out of state, have been deployed to D.C. to support what Trump has framed as a concerted effort to tackle crime and homelessness in the nation's capital. At the time of the initial troop deployment this month, violent crime had dropped roughly 27% year over year, according to D.C. police data. Currently guard members from D.C., West Virginia, South Carolina, Ohio, Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee are assisting the District and federal government agencies.",
      "Nearly 60% of guard members in D.C. are from out of the district after several Republican state leaders sent hundreds of troops there. West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey deployed more than 400 troops to D.C. \"as a show of commitment\" to Trump's initiative, the most of any state leader.",
      "Democrats have bashed the deployment as partisan in nature, accusing Trump of trying to exert his presidential authority through scare tactics and noting that his primary targets have been cities with Black leadership.",
      "Trump threatened Sunday to send the military into Baltimore after he sparred with Democratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, deriding the city as \"crime-ridden.\"",
      "\u201cBut if Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum did in L.A., I will send in the \u2018troops,\u2019 which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social, using a derogatory nickname to refer to Gavin Newsom, the governor of California.",
      "Deploying the National Guard to cities like D.C. is historically uncommon, as the force is typically used to respond to situations like natural disasters and civil unrest."

      "On Friday, Trump talked about his controversial deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and said Chicago and New York City would be next. He has described the deployment in the nation's capital as a bid to clean up crime, but critics dismiss the move as little more than political overreach.",
      "\u201cThe guard is not needed,\u201d Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson told NBC News. \u201cThis is not the role of our military. The brave men and women who signed up to serve our country did not sign up to occupy American cities.\u201d",
      "Johnson also noted the city's decline in murders, shootings and car thefts. Chicago police crime data from earlier this month show murders are down 31% from the same time last year, shootings have dropped by 36% and vehicle thefts are down 26%.",
      "\u201cThe things that we\u2019re doing in Chicago by investing in people, youth employment, mental health care, services, building more affordable homes, making sure that our detectives bureau has all the resources that it needs ... that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing the results that we are experiencing right now,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cOccupying our cities with the military \u2014 that\u2019s not how we build safe and affordable communities,\u201d he added.",

      "\u201cThe National Guard is not going to put food on people\u2019s table. The National Guard is not going to reduce unemployment,\u201d Johnson said.",

      "\"There\u2019s a higher barrier for the president to send National Guard into Chicago [than into D.C.], because there has to be a reason or he has to have the agreement of the governor of the state of Illinois. And clearly, from what we see, he\u2019s not going to have that. He\u2019s going to have to articulate a reason for doing it. I think that reason will be challenged by the state of Illinois,\" Yohnka said in an interview.",
      "He said the ACLU of Illinois will also be \u201con the lookout\u201d for how troops, if deployed, behave on the streets and challenge any arrests, detention sweeps or use of excessive force.",

      "He claimed, however, that people in the city \"are screaming for us to come.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re ready, and we\u2019ll go in and we\u2019ll straighten out Chicago, just like we did D.C. Chicago is very dangerous,\u201d he said.",
      "On Saturday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker accused Trump on X of \u201cattempting to manufacture a crisis, politicize Americans who serve in uniform, and continue abusing his power to distract from the pain he\u2019s causing families.\u201d",
      "The chair of the Chicago City Council\u2019s Public Safety Committee spoke to NBC Chicago about the need to reduce crime in the city but said Trump's National Guard threats are misguided.",

We have work to do, but we need help that makes sense,\" Alderman Brian Hopkins said. \"The federal National Guard isn\u2019t going to make a difference in carjacking in Chicago. If he really wanted to help, we\u2019re short 2,000 police officers. Unfortunately, that is not what Trump is talking about.\u201d",

      "The check-in with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore was part of the conditions of his release from federal custody on parole on Friday.",
      "While such meetings are usually routine and are meant for case updates, Abrego's attorneys said they expected he would be taken into ICE custody during the check-in after the Trump administration announced over the weekend its intention to deport him to Uganda.",
      "\"There was no need to take him into ICE detention. ... The only reason they took him into detention was to punish him,\" for using his constitutional right to speak up and fight proceedings, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego's attorneys, said Monday morning.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg said on Friday that a notice said the 8 a.m. meeting on Monday would be for an interview.",
      "\"Clearly that was false,\" he added.",
      "He said lawyers asked ICE officers why Abrego was taken into custody, and the officers would not answer. The ICE officers would also not give information as to where Abrego is going, Sandoval-Moshenberg said.",
      "\"The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a matter that is completely unconstitutional, and specifically weaponizing the decision of which country they send him to,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said.",
      "What we know about Abrego Garcia's case",
      "Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March due to what officials described as an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d In April, a judge ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego \u2014 spurring a legal back-and-forth that involved the Supreme Court. Abrego was returned to the U.S. on June 6, following an indictment in a federal court in Nashville. The indictment charged Abrego with transporting within the U.S. people who were not legally in the country.He was released from federal custody on parole on Friday and had a tearful reunion with his family after months apart. Minutes after his release, immigration authorities notified Abrego that they intend to deport him to Uganda. Separately, the Trump administration offered him a plea deal that would ensure his eventual deportation to Costa Rica.",

      "The White House confirmed Monday's arrest and said ICE officials are \"processing him for deportation.\" The White House X account did not offer more details about Abrego's future.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg said Monday that Abgrego has filed a new lawsuit in federal district court for the district of Maryland \"seeking to ensure that he is not removed from the United States pending his immigration proceedings.\"",
      "The lawsuit asks for an order from a Maryland federal judge that Abrego not be allowed to be removed from the United States, unless he is given proper due process to fight his potential deportation.",
      "The suit challenges Abrego's deportation to Uganda or any other country unless and until he's had a fair trial, Sandoval-Moshenberg said. He later argued that deporting his client to any country without any credible assurances that he can stay there would be \"just a very inconvenient layover to El Salvador.\"",
      "Abrego spoke at a news conference before heading into his ICE appointment on Monday morning, surrounded by family, supporters, faith leaders and his legal team, who were all calling for his freedom.",
      "\"My name is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and I want you to remember this, remember that I am free and I was able to be reunited with my family,\" he said in Spanish before a translator repeated in English.",
      "\"This was a miracle. Thank you to God and thank you to the community,\" Abrego added. \"I want to thank each and every one of you who marched, lift your voices, never stop praying and continue to fight in my name.\"",
      "It's the latest move by the government to boot Abrego from the country after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, in violation of a 2019 court order. After much legal resistance, Abrego was returned to the U.S. in June and hit with human smuggling charges out of Tennessee, which he pleaded not guilty to.",
      "The Trump administration has repeatedly accused Abrego of being a gang member part of the notorious MS-13, which his attorneys have denied. Abrego\u2019s lawyers have said he illegally immigrated to the U.S. when he was 16 to join his brother in Maryland to escape gang violence in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration offered Abrego a plea deal last week, his lawyers said in a Saturday court filing that was part of their efforts to get the charges in Tennessee dropped over what they consider to be \"vindictive\" and \"selective\" prosecution.",
      "If he pleads guilty to the federal charges out of Tennessee and serves time, he can be deported to Costa Rica. The Costa Rican government said he'd live as a free man there, according to the filing.",
      "Before Monday morning's appointment, Sandoval-Moshenberg said his client would not be taking the plea deal as Abrego \"will not accept charges of which he's not guilty.\" This means the agreement to be deported to Costa Rica could be off the table.",

They\u2019re trying to use the deportation system, and specifically, they\u2019re trying to use which country they\u2019re planning on deporting him to as a means of punishing him for exercising his constitutional rights,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Saturday outside Abrego's brother's home in Maryland.",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 One of the United States\u2019 strongest allies in Asia, South Korea has had a rough start with President Donald Trump \u2014 struggling in tariff talks as it spent months without a permanent leader.",
      "But its new president, Lee Jae Myung, has arrived for a meeting with Trump on Monday touting a $150 billion offering whose name is sure to appeal to the U.S. leader: \u201cMake America Shipbuilding Great Again.\u201d",
      "The package, which South Korean officials also refer to as MASGA, includes the construction of new U.S. shipyards, the training of shipbuilding personnel and U.S. Navy ship maintenance.",
      "It\u2019s a key part of the last-minute trade deal South Korea struck last month with Trump, who says he wants to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding for both economic and national security reasons. Trade and security will be high on the agenda at his summit with Lee, which comes amid growing tensions with China and North Korea.",
      "A White House official said that Trump \u201clooks forward to hosting\u201d Lee.  \u201cThey will discuss North Korea, defense posture, trade barriers, maritime security, American shipbuilding, energy dominance, and more,\u201d the official said.",
      "Trump himself injected a note of uncertainty into the day's meeting Monday by posting on Truth Social: \"WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA? Seems like a Purge or Revolution. We can\u2019t have that and do business there.\"",
      "It was not clear what Trump was referring to.",
      "After decades of industry decline, the U.S. now accounts for less than 1% of the global shipbuilding sector, according to the Rand national security think tank, compared with 50% for China, 30% for South Korea and 10% for Japan. South Korean equipment, designs and knowledge could help put the U.S. back on the map.",
      "On Tuesday, Lee and possibly Trump will visit a Philadelphia shipyard acquired last year by the South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group.",
      "The shipbuilding initiative is \u201ca strategic and symbolic win\u201d for South Korea as well as the U.S., said Eun A Jo, an assistant professor of government at William & Mary and director of its Asia Policy Lab.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a smart move to try and secure influence in a critical American sector, while at the same time countering Chinese expansion in global maritime infrastructure,\u201d she told NBC News in a phone interview Sunday.",
      "No 'bromance' expected",
      "The White House summit is an important opportunity for Lee to advocate South Korea\u2019s interests with Trump after months of political instability created by former President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s botched declaration of martial law.",
      "Though Lee comes from a liberal party, he and Trump share much in common \u2014 both have been the subjects of assassination attempts, and both are more open to diplomacy with nuclear-armed North Korea than their predecessors.",
      "But they have very different outlooks on political, economic and foreign policy, which could make the summit challenging, said Bae Jong-chan, president of Insight K, a private think tank in Seoul.",
      "\u201cOne will not be able to expect bromance between President Lee and President Trump,\u201d he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The relationship has already been strained by Trump\u2019s tariffs on South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy, which has a large trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Trump said last month that the U.S. tariff on South Korean imports would be 15%, down from the 25% he had threatened earlier. He said South Korea, which does not impose any tariffs on U.S. goods, managed to \u201cbuy down\u201d the U.S. tariff by promising $450 billion in U.S. investment and energy purchases, including the $150 billion shipbuilding fund.",
      "Jo said Lee is seeking to lock in the terms favorable to South Korea in the trade deal, which remains unwritten and largely unclear.",
      "\u201cI think he wants that to be firm and solid, to have at least some sense of predictability and stability in their economic relations,\u201d she said.",
      "More tricky are questions about South Korea\u2019s longstanding security alliance with the U.S. and its position on China.",
      "Trump wants South Korea to take more responsibility for its own defense, freeing up the almost 30,000 U.S. service members stationed there to focus more on containing China, Washington\u2019s biggest strategic rival.",
      "South Korea worries that such a shift could leave it more exposed to threats from North Korea, as well as increase the chances it could be drawn into a potential U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan, the island democracy Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "Though Lee strongly supports the decades-old U.S.-South Korea alliance, he also has to balance relations with China, South Korea\u2019s main trading partner.",
      "On Sunday, a special envoy told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing that South Korea hopes to normalize relations with China after years of tension.",
      "Lee has long been vocal about his reluctance to take sides between the U.S. and China, and his pragmatic approach to South Korea-China relations \u201cis unlikely to sit comfortably with President Trump,\u201d Bae said.",
      "Lee makes U.S. his second stop",
      "Before heading to Washington, Lee stopped in Tokyo for a summit with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in his first foreign visit since being elected president in June.",
      "\u201cThat was a very deliberate and strategic move,\u201d Jo said, as the two U.S. allies seek leverage to protect themselves from Trump\u2019s vicissitudes.",
      "On his flight from Tokyo to Washington on Sunday, Lee told reporters he had asked Ishiba for details on Japan\u2019s negotiations with the U.S., and that Ishiba had given \u201ca lot of very friendly advice.\u201d",
      "Lee and Ishiba, whose countries have historically been at odds, agreed at their summit to improve bilateral ties so they can better coordinate with the U.S. against China and North Korea.",
      "Despite interest from Washington and Seoul, North Korea has dismissed the idea of further denuclearization talks, saying Trump must accept it as a nuclear power. The Trump-Lee summit comes as the U.S. and South Korean militaries are holding annual joint exercises that North Korea condemns as a rehearsal for invasion.",
      "Bae said Lee is \u201clikely to walk away from the summit with detailed homework\u201d on North Korea, tariffs, military cost-sharing and the role of U.S. troops in South Korea, among other issues.",
      "If he \u201cfails to deliver as President Trump sees fit,\u201d Trump may protest by skipping the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting South Korea is hosting this fall.",
      "\u201cMASGA cannot cover everything for President Lee in dealing with President Trump,\u201d Bae said.",
      "Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Stella Kim from Los Angeles."

    "story": [
      "Postal services in Japan and Switzerland are the latest to pause shipments to the United States this week, days before an exemption for certain import taxes is about to expire.",
      "The loophole, known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d has allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the United States duty-free since 2016. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month to abolish the practice. It is set to end Friday.",
      "The change has rocked small businesses and consumers, leaving many concerned about shipping backlogs and higher costs. Some business owners have said on social media they will be forced to close up shop.",
      "\u201cThere is so much uncertainty about how these tariffs are going to be collected,\u201d said Caleb Silver, editor-in-chief of Investopedia. \u201cWho will collect these tariffs? What products, if any, will be exempt from these tariffs? And that just adds more uncertainty into an already very confusing picture around tariffs and how they\u2019re going to impact us here in the United States.\u201d",
      "The change means effective Friday, goods coming into the U.S. from abroad will be slapped with country-specific tariffs. For an $800 item coming in from a country with a tariff rate of 25% or more (like China, Brazil, India, Switzerland or Canada), that could amount to at least $200 in extra costs just to bring the product into the U.S.",
      "Under the new rules, letters and personal gifts worth less than $100 will still be duty-free.",
      "The White House said ending the de minimis exemption would help combat \u201cescalating deceptive shipping practices, illegal material, and duty circumvention,\u201d claiming some shippers had \u201cabused\u201d the exemption to send illicit drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "The de minimis exemption had also been a focal point of the administration\u2019s trade spat with China. Chinese-linked e-commerce companies like Temu and Shein surged in popularity among American consumers by directly shipping cheap clothes and goods under the de minimis threshold. Despite the ongoing conversation between the U.S. and China on a framework trade agreement, the administration ended the de minimis exemption for low-value imports from China and Hong Kong in early May, prompting Temu and Shein to switch to a \u201clocal fulfillment model\u201d to avoid price hikes.",
      "On Monday, Swiss Post and Japan Post announced they would soon suspend shipments bound for the United States. Postal services in Australia, India, New Zealand, the U.K. and other parts of Europe have said they will also stop shipping parcels to the States this week.",
      "DHL, one of the biggest delivery companies in the world, said Friday it will stop accepting parcels destined for the U.S. starting Monday, saying that \u201ckey questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out.\u201d",
      "Many European postal services say they are pausing shipments now because they cannot guarantee the goods will enter the United States before Friday.",
      "Other delivery services said they would try to pick up the slack. \u201cOur priority is supporting our customers and helping them navigate through the changes going into effect for U.S.-bound shipments on Aug. 29,\u201d FedEx said."

      "Kneecap announced the news Monday in a social media post, saying that all 15 of its October shows in the U.S. had to be axed \"as the British government continues it's witch-hunt.\"",
      "\"With every show fully sold out, to tens of thousands of fans, this news is sad to deliver,\" Kneecap wrote. \"But once we win our court case, which we will, we promise to embark on an even bigger tour to all you great heads.\"",
      "Refunds are available to those who had tickets to the shows, the band said.",
      "Kneecap found itself in legal trouble in May, after police in London accused Liam O'Hanna, 27, of violating a part of the U.K.'s terrorism law that bans people from displaying flags \"in such a way or in such circumstances as to arouse reasonable suspicion that he is a supporter\" of groups the country considers terrorists.",
      "The Metropolitan police at the time said it had launched an investigation into O'Hanna \u2014 whose name in Irish is Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh and who performs as Mo Chara in the hip-hop trio \u2014 after it saw a video online of the singer displaying the flag of Hezbollah at a venue north of London on Nov. 21.",

      "Kneecap has characterized criticism of its views on Israel's war in Gaza as a \"coordinated smear campaign\"",
      "\"Those attacking us want to silence criticism of a mass slaughter,\" Kneecap said in a statement in April. \"They weaponize false accusations of antisemitism to distract, confuse, and provide cover for genocide.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government could take equity stakes in more companies going forward, potentially through an American sovereign wealth fund, according to one of President Donald Trump's top economic advisers.",
      "National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett's comments Monday came days after the U.S. took a nearly 10% stake in Intel. The government secured a piece of the semiconductor maker with money intended for grants as part of the CHIPS and Science Act, passed under the Biden administration.",
      "Speaking about the new Intel position, Hassett told CNBC: \u201cIt\u2019s like a down payment on a sovereign wealth fund, which many countries have.\u201d Governments throughout Europe, Asia and the Middle East use such funds to make investments in companies and other financial assets.",
      "The federal government has taken ownership stakes in private companies before, but under extraordinary circumstances, such as during the global financial crisis of 2008.",
      "Hassett said the Intel investment was a \"very, very special circumstance because of the massive amount of CHIPS Act spending that was coming Intel's way.\"",
      "He added: \u201cSo I\u2019m sure that at some point there\u2019ll be more transactions, if not in this industry, in other industries.\"",
      "The CHIPS Act was established as a way for the government to provide financing and capital to foreign & domestic companies that manufactured semiconductors and related products in the United States.",
      "Americans and the American economy received the benefit of more than $200 billion in private capital investments since the act was signed into law, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Many companies also announced plans to create new U.S. manufacturing and construction jobs.",
      "Hassett said previously the money was \"going out and disappearing into the ether.\"",
      "He also said \"we're absolutely not in the business of picking winners and losers.\" However, the U.S. is now Intel's largest single shareholder. The administration has also took a \"golden share\" in U.S. Steel as part of approving its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. Trump also said he negotiated with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to take a 15% cut of the chipmaker's revenue from some chips sold in China. Trump also has a similar deal with rival chipmaker AMD.",
      "After Hassett's interview Trump took to Truth Social to say: \"I PAID ZERO FOR INTEL, IT IS WORTH APPROXIMATELY 11 BILLION DOLLARS. All goes to the USA.\" He also said he would \"help those companies that make such lucrative deals with the United States.\"",
      "It was unclear why the president said the U.S. did not pay anything for the stake. The government purchased 433.3 million Intel shares at $20.47 each, which equates to $8.9 billion.",
      "Trump has also pushed companies to change course on key products, such as when he pre-emptively announced that Coca-Cola would add cane sugar to an American version of its namesake product.",
      "Trump has also threatened firms such as Amazon, Mattel, Hasbro and Walmart with retaliation for hiking prices as a result of his sweeping global tariff regime.",
      "The president's intervention in private industry has sparked widespread criticism, including from Republicans. Trump's former U.N. ambassador, and a former Boeing board member Nikki Haley, said on X: \"Intel will become a test case of what not to do.\"",
      "After the CNBC interview, NBC News asked Hassett about setting up a sovereign wealth fund.",
      "\"As we acquire things like Intel, then there's sort of a question of where it goes and it's held by the U.S. Treasury. And if the U.S. Treasury has more of that stuff, that is starting to look like sovereign wealth fund, whether an official sovereign wealth fund is established is another question,\" Hassett said.",
      "\"But it's not unprecedented for the U.S. to own equity\" in private companies, he added.",
      "The U.S. took equity stakes in private companies during the global financial meltdown of 2008 and 2009.",
      "Then, the U.S. bought troubled assets and took equity stakes in the likes of JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America, AIG, and other systemically important firms in order to stabilize the global financial system.",
      "Trump has expanded his power over the business world, fueled by his view that the U.S. economy is like \"a department store, and we set the price.\"",
      "\"I meet with the companies, and then I set a fair price, what I consider to be a fair price, and they can pay it, or they don't have to pay it,\" Trump said in an April interview."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump signed executive orders Monday aimed at eliminating cashless bail for suspects arrested in Washington, D.C., and in other jurisdictions around the nation with similar policies, according to fact sheets describing the executive orders that the White House provided to NBC News.",
      "The executive order on D.C. directs the administration to take certain actions if the city does not change its cashless bail policy, including \"federal funding decisions, services, or approvals,\" according to the fact sheet. Attorney General Pam Bondi, too, could get involved, though the fact sheet did not detail what actions she might take.",
      "The order on D.C., first reported by Axios, also asks law enforcement officials to work to ensure that people arrested in the city are taken into federal custody \"to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law,\" the fact sheet obtained by NBC News said.",
      "The executive order aimed at other cities across the nation directs the administration to find federal funds that could be \"suspended or terminated\" in jurisdictions that have cashless bail policies, the fact sheet said.",
      "A spokesperson for Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s office declined to comment to NBC News.",
      "Trump signed another executive order on Monday aimed at prosecuting people who \"desecrate\" the American flag, a third fact sheet said. That order, first reported by Fox News, directs Bondi to \"vigorously prosecute those who violate our laws in ways that involve desecrating the flag, and to pursue litigation to clarify the scope of First Amendment in this area.\"",
      "The order also targets noncitizens by asking the administration to \"deny, prohibit, terminate, or revoke visas, residence permits, or naturalization proceedings, and other immigration benefits, or seek removal\" of non-citizens who desecrate the flag. The order could hit a legal obstacle in that the Supreme Court decided in Texas v. Johnson in 1989 that flag burning was protected by the First Amendment.",
      "The D.C. executive order on cashless bail is Trump's latest step to broaden the administration's control over the capital. It comes on the heels of the White House's move to deploy and arm National Guard troops in an effort to fight crime. Critics, though, have slammed the administration's handling as overreach and unnecessary.",
      "They argue that cash bail disproportionately hurts low-income people, who may have more difficulty securing the money to pay bail for release from jail.",
      "Trump, though, has criticized the practice, saying earlier this month that it was a \"disaster\" and caused \"so many problems came that we never had before.\"",
      "\"So they're watching us today, and if they don't learn their lesson, if they haven't studied us properly, because we're going to be very successful,\" Trump said of other cities earlier this month.",
      "The U.S. Attorney for D.C., Jeanine Pirro, claimed on \"Fox & Friends\" on Monday morning that cashless bail \"is when all of the problems started.\" She criticized defendants being released, asserting that \"they are reoffending and they\u2019re reoffending again.\"",
      "D.C. has had a cashless bail system since 1992. The policy means that judges decide whether people charged with crimes pose a risk to others or the community at large or would pose a flight risk if released without money for bail connected with the person\u2019s freedom. If judges make any of those determinations, then they may opt to hold a defendant in a detention facility before trial.",
      "As part of the city government's own safety measures, the D.C. Council extended its pretrial detention policy in July.",
      "Several states have eliminated or nearly eliminated cash bail, including Illinois, New Mexico and New Jersey.",
      "The expected executive order comes as National Guard troops in D.C. began carrying firearms Sunday evening. Also over the weekend, Trump threatened to deploy troops to Baltimore. Just days earlier, he floated sending the National Guard to Chicago and New York.",
      "Trump's focus on how the capital is run is a stark departure from prior administrations. He has enacted sweeping changes by surging National Guard and federal agents into the city, pushing enforcement agencies to clear homeless encampments and restoring a Confederate memorial in Arlington National Cemetery.",
      "Last week, Trump also announced that he ordered attorneys to review Smithsonian museums, arguing that the storied museums were not positive enough about U.S. history, \"where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been.\""

      "\"There was no need to take him into ICE detention. ... The only reason they took him into detention was to punish him,\" for using his constitutional right to speak up and fight proceedings, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego's attorneys, said Monday morning.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg said on Friday that a notice said the 8 a.m. meeting on Monday would be for an interview.",
      "\"Clearly that was false,\" he added.",
      "He said lawyers asked ICE officers why Abrego was taken into custody, and the officers would not answer. The ICE officers would also not give information as to where Abrego is going, Sandoval-Moshenberg said.",
      "\"The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a matter that is completely unconstitutional, and specifically weaponizing the decision of which country they send him to,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said.",
      "What we know about Abrego Garcia's case",
      "Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March due to what officials described as an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d In April, a judge ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego \u2014 spurring a legal back-and-forth that involved the Supreme Court. Abrego was returned to the U.S. on June 6, following an indictment in a federal court in Nashville. The indictment charged Abrego with transporting within the U.S. people who were not legally in the country.He was released from federal custody on parole on Friday and had a tearful reunion with his family after months apart. Minutes after his release, immigration authorities notified Abrego that they intend to deport him to Uganda. Separately, the Trump administration offered him a plea deal that would ensure his eventual deportation to Costa Rica.",

      "Separately, the Trump administration offered him a plea deal that would ensure his eventual deportation to Costa Rica.",
      "The White House confirmed Monday's arrest and said ICE officials are \"processing him for deportation.\" The White House X account did not offer more details about Abrego's future.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg said Monday that Abgrego has filed a new lawsuit in federal district court for the district of Maryland \"seeking to ensure that he is not removed from the United States pending his immigration proceedings.\"",
      "The lawsuit asks for an order from a Maryland federal judge that Abrego not be allowed to be removed from the United States, unless he is given proper due process to fight his potential deportation.",
      "The suit challenges Abrego's deportation to Uganda or any other country unless and until he's had a fair trial, Sandoval-Moshenberg said. He later argued that deporting his client to any country without any credible assurances that he can stay there would be \"just a very inconvenient layover to El Salvador.\"",
      "Abrego spoke at a news conference before heading into his ICE appointment on Monday morning, surrounded by family, supporters, faith leaders and his legal team, who were all calling for his freedom.",
      "\"My name is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and I want you to remember this, remember that I am free and I was able to be reunited with my family,\" he said in Spanish before a translator repeated in English.",
      "\"This was a miracle. Thank you to God and thank you to the community,\" Abrego added. \"I want to thank each and every one of you who marched, lift your voices, never stop praying and continue to fight in my name.\"",
      "It's the latest move by the government to boot Abrego from the country after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, in violation of a 2019 court order. After much legal resistance, Abrego was returned to the U.S. in June and hit with human smuggling charges out of Tennessee, which he pleaded not guilty to.",
      "The Trump administration has repeatedly accused Abrego of being a gang member part of the notorious MS-13, which his attorneys have denied. Abrego\u2019s lawyers have said he illegally immigrated to the U.S. when he was 16 to join his brother in Maryland to escape gang violence in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration offered Abrego a plea deal last week, his lawyers said in a Saturday court filing that was part of their efforts to get the charges in Tennessee dropped over what they consider to be \"vindictive\" and \"selective\" prosecution.",
      "If he pleads guilty to the federal charges out of Tennessee and serves time, he can be deported to Costa Rica. The Costa Rican government said he'd live as a free man there, according to the filing.",
      "Before Monday morning's appointment, Sandoval-Moshenberg said his client would not be taking the plea deal as Abrego \"will not accept charges of which he's not guilty.\" This means the agreement to be deported to Costa Rica could be off the table.",
      "Abrego's attorneys rebuffed the Trump administration's apparent attempt to strong-arm him.",
      "\"What they\u2019re trying to do here is punish him. They\u2019re trying to use the deportation system, and specifically, they\u2019re trying to use which country they\u2019re planning on deporting him to as a means of punishing him for exercising his constitutional rights,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Saturday outside Abrego's brother's home in Maryland.",
      "Gary Grumbach reported from Baltimore, Marlene Lenthang from Los Angeles, and Rebecca Cohen from New York."

      "LONDON \u2014 France has summoned the American ambassador to Paris after he wrote a letter to President Emmanuel Macron alleging that the country had not taken \u201csufficient action\u201d to combat antisemitism.",
      "France\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday that it had summoned Charles Kushner to appear Monday over his criticism, which it said was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "It said that \u201cFrance firmly rejects these allegations\u201d and that French authorities have \u201cfully mobilized\u201d to combat the \"intolerable\" rise in antisemitic acts over the past two years.",
      "The French ministry said that Kushner\u2019s allegations violated international law and the obligation not to interfere with the internal affairs of another country. \u201cThey also fall short of the quality of the transatlantic partnership between France and the United States and of the trust that must prevail between allies,\" it said.",
      "The episode is the latest sign of a growing divide between the United States and its longtime partners in Europe. It comes as Washington's close ally, Israel, increasingly clashes with Western countries amid fallout from its military assault on Gaza.",
      "\u201cAntisemitism has long scarred French life, but it has exploded since Hamas\u2019s barbaric assault on Oct. 7, 2023,\u201d Kushner wrote in an open letter in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.",
      "\u201cPublic statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France,\u201d added Kushner, who is Jewish.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Sunday evening that it stood by Kushner\u2019s comments, according to the Associated Press news agency. \u201cAmbassador Kushner is our U.S. government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role,\u201d he said.",
      "France said last month that it plans to recognize a Palestinian state in September, while other traditional allies of Israel such as Australia and Canada have said they will do the same.",
      "Last week, Macron denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's accusations that this move was fueling antisemitism, calling the suggestion \"abject\" and \"erroneous.\"",
      "France is home to the largest Jewish population in Europe, with an estimated 500,000 Jews, the third-largest Jewish population in the world after Israel and the United States. That\u2019s approximately 1% of the national population.",
      "In his letter, Kushner goes on to say that French Jews are living in fear and that Macron should act decisively in protecting them, adding that he stands ready to work with French leaders across the country to \u201cforge a serious plan that addresses the roots of antisemitism and defeats it.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, many French Jews fear that history will repeat itself in Europe,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cMr. President, I urge you to act decisively: enforce hate-crime laws without exception; ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses, prosecute offenders to the fullest extent; and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.\u201d",
      "Kushner, a real estate developer, is the father of President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. He said during his confirmation hearing in May this year that he was \u201cdedicated to building an even stronger relationship\u201d between the U.S. and France.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term in the Oval Office, he pardoned Kushner, who pleaded guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations."

      "The package, which South Korean officials also refer to as MASGA, includes the construction of new U.S. shipyards, the training of shipbuilding personnel and U.S. Navy ship maintenance.",
      "It\u2019s a key part of the last-minute trade deal South Korea struck last month with Trump, who says he wants to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding for both economic and national security reasons. Trade and security will be high on the agenda at his summit with Lee, which comes amid growing tensions with China and North Korea.",
      "A White House official said that Trump \u201clooks forward to hosting\u201d Lee.  \u201cThey will discuss North Korea, defense posture, trade barriers, maritime security, American shipbuilding, energy dominance, and more,\u201d the official said.",
      "Trump himself injected a note of uncertainty into the day's meeting Monday by posting on Truth Social: \"WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA? Seems like a Purge or Revolution. We can\u2019t have that and do business there.\"",
      "It was not clear what Trump was referring to.",
      "After decades of industry decline, the U.S. now accounts for less than 1% of the global shipbuilding sector, according to the Rand national security think tank, compared with 50% for China, 30% for South Korea and 10% for Japan. South Korean equipment, designs and knowledge could help put the U.S. back on the map.",
      "On Tuesday, Lee and possibly Trump will visit a Philadelphia shipyard acquired last year by the South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group.",
      "The shipbuilding initiative is \u201ca strategic and symbolic win\u201d for South Korea as well as the U.S., said Eun A Jo, an assistant professor of government at William & Mary and director of its Asia Policy Lab.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a smart move to try and secure influence in a critical American sector, while at the same time countering Chinese expansion in global maritime infrastructure,\u201d she told NBC News in a phone interview Sunday.",
      "No 'bromance' expected",
      "The White House summit is an important opportunity for Lee to advocate South Korea\u2019s interests with Trump after months of political instability created by former President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s botched declaration of martial law.",
      "Though Lee comes from a liberal party, he and Trump share much in common \u2014 both have been the subjects of assassination attempts, and both are more open to diplomacy with nuclear-armed North Korea than their predecessors.",
      "But they have very different outlooks on political, economic and foreign policy, which could make the summit challenging, said Bae Jong-chan, president of Insight K, a private think tank in Seoul.",
      "\u201cOne will not be able to expect bromance between President Lee and President Trump,\u201d he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The relationship has already been strained by Trump\u2019s tariffs on South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy, which has a large trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Trump said last month that the U.S. tariff on South Korean imports would be 15%, down from the 25% he had threatened earlier. He said South Korea, which does not impose any tariffs on U.S. goods, managed to \u201cbuy down\u201d the U.S. tariff by promising $450 billion in U.S. investment and energy purchases, including the $150 billion shipbuilding fund.",
      "Jo said Lee is seeking to lock in the terms favorable to South Korea in the trade deal, which remains unwritten and largely unclear.",
      "\u201cI think he wants that to be firm and solid, to have at least some sense of predictability and stability in their economic relations,\u201d she said.",
      "More tricky are questions about South Korea\u2019s longstanding security alliance with the U.S. and its position on China.",
      "Trump wants South Korea to take more responsibility for its own defense, freeing up the almost 30,000 U.S. service members stationed there to focus more on containing China, Washington\u2019s biggest strategic rival.",
      "South Korea worries that such a shift could leave it more exposed to threats from North Korea, as well as increase the chances it could be drawn into a potential U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan, the island democracy Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "Though Lee strongly supports the decades-old U.S.-South Korea alliance, he also has to balance relations with China, South Korea\u2019s main trading partner.",
      "On Sunday, a special envoy told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing that South Korea hopes to normalize relations with China after years of tension.",
      "Lee has long been vocal about his reluctance to take sides between the U.S. and China, and his pragmatic approach to South Korea-China relations \u201cis unlikely to sit comfortably with President Trump,\u201d Bae said.",
      "Lee makes U.S. his second stop",
      "Before heading to Washington, Lee stopped in Tokyo for a summit with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in his first foreign visit since being elected president in June.",
      "\u201cThat was a very deliberate and strategic move,\u201d Jo said, as the two U.S. allies seek leverage to protect themselves from Trump\u2019s vicissitudes.",

      "Lee and Ishiba, whose countries have historically been at odds, agreed at their summit to improve bilateral ties so they can better coordinate with the U.S. against China and North Korea.",
      "Despite interest from Washington and Seoul, North Korea has dismissed the idea of further denuclearization talks, saying Trump must accept it as a nuclear power. The Trump-Lee summit comes as the U.S. and South Korean militaries are holding annual joint exercises that North Korea condemns as a rehearsal for invasion.",
      "Bae said Lee is \u201clikely to walk away from the summit with detailed homework\u201d on North Korea, tariffs, military cost-sharing and the role of U.S. troops in South Korea, among other issues.",

    "story": [
      "The first human case of the flesh-eating parasite new world screwworm has been detected in the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services said early Monday.",
      "The case, related to a person who had recently traveled to El Salvador, was confirmed to be screwworm by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Maryland Department of Health on Aug. 4.",
      "\"This is the first human case of travel-associated New World screwworm myiasis (parasitic infestation of fly larvae) from an outbreak-affected country identified in the United States,\" HHS spokesperson Emily G. Hilliard said in a statement.",
      "\"The risk to public health in the United States from this introduction is very low,\" he said.",
      "The parasite \u2014 the larvae of the new world screwworm fly \u2014 can devastate cattle herds and is rife in parts of Central America and Mexico. It can destroy wildlife and even kill household pets.",
      "There were serious outbreaks in the 1980s and 1990s in Central America and it was eradicated at great expense, only to return in the last two years.",
      "U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins traveled to Texas to announce a five-part plan to combat the screwworm on Aug. 15",
      "This includes plans to breed billions of sterile flies and dump them from the air over southern Texas and Mexico in the hope of stopping the parasite's spread.",
      "The sterilized male flies mate with females, but the eggs don't hatch. Eventually, the population reduces and dies out. This technique worked in the 1960s when the U.S. suffered its last screwworm outbreak.",
      "And the federal government may face calls to accelerate its work on this: When first announced in June, the sterilization plan wasn't due to be operational for \"two to three years.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbot, commenting on the federal government scheme, said the state agriculture industry, with its 2 million jobs, was worth $867 billion. \"All of this is at risk because of the New World screwworm.\"",
      "A report from the USDA last year estimated an outbreak of screwworm could cost Texas at least $1.8 billion due to livestock deaths, labor costs and medication.",
      "The little parasitic flies \u2014 also known as cochliomyia hominivorax \u2014 have an effect that's vast and devastating, but in isolation quite disgusting. The females can lay eggs in any warm-blooded animal, which then hatch unleashing hundreds of screwworm larvae, so-called because of their sharp mouths and their burrowing being compared to the motion of a screw.",
      "Human infections can be fatal but are rare and most cases can be treated.",
      "The USDA has said that screwworms have been making their way north into Mexico from other parts of Central America. The fly is endemic in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and some South South American nations it said.",
      "Mexico reported a case in Ixhuatlan de Madero, Veracruz, in July, 370 miles from the Texas border, prompting DHH to immediately shut down cross-border cattle trade, following similar stops in November and May."

      "Amaya\u2019s journey to find love in Fiji was far from straightforward.",
      "Entering the villa as a bombshell on Episode 4 alongside Hannah Fields, Amaya originally coupled up with Ace Greene.",
      "While there seemed to be a spark between the pair at first, Ace quickly switched up on Amaya, citing her usage of nicknames (particularly \u201cbabe\u201d) and physical touch as too much, too soon.",
      "From there, Amaya found more connections and obstacles. She coupled up with Austin Shepard on Episode 14, but he, like Ace, began to distance himself from Amaya.",
      "The couple split up when Casa Amor happened on Episode 19, leaving them both single and open to exploring new connections.",
      "Bryan came into the show as a bombshell in Casa Amor, the biggest relationship test of every \u201cLove Island\u201d season. This is where either the men or the women from the main villa are secretly whisked away to a second villa nearby, where they get to meet a group of other singles hoping to find love in Fiji.",
      "In Casa Amor, Bryan quickly hit it off with Andreina. Amaya, meanwhile, was striking up a connection with Zak Srakaew, who also came into the show during Casa Amor. They ultimately coupled up and remained a couple as they went back to the main villa.",
      "However, Zak blindsided Amaya during the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge and gang up on her alongside Austin and Ace, which led to Amaya exploring new connections and hitting it off with Bryan.",
      "Wait, what happened during the \u2018Stand on Business\u2019 challenge?",
      "During the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge in Episode 26, Amaya was confronted by all three men she had previously been coupled up with: Ace, Austin and Zak.",
      "As Amaya stood in front of her peers, she read cards that had been written about her \u2014 specifically about her emotions and how she expressed herself in her relationships.",
      "\u201cYou cry more than needed. You try to move to fast for everyone,\u201d Austin wrote on a card that Amaya had to read in front of the entire villa.",
      "\u201cGod forbid I\u2019m a sensitive gangsta,\u201d Amaya replied (a phrase that became one of her signature one-liners).",
      "\u201cI would just have to say that many people could view this as a weakness, but to me personally, after everything I\u2019ve been through in my life, I view it as a strength,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo if you guys view it like that, then guess what. I\u2019m just not your cup of tea to be drinking, so don\u2019t f------ drink it.\u201d",

      "\u201cBut with you, you looked right into the sun, you know?\u201d she continued.",

    "summary": "Expert reveals how Love Island's isolated environment affects contestants' mental health, decision-making, and relationships through psychological manipulation.",
    "story": [
      "Joining \"Love Island\" may seem like the ultimate dream gig \u2014 a trip to Fiji where you bask in the sun all day surrounded by attractive singles, playing what amounts to glorified frat party games with no real-world distractions. Just you, your best bathing suits, and endless tropical sunshine.",
      "But behind this Instagram-perfect facade is a intense psychological experiment.",
      "The hit reality dating show strips participants of modern life's most basic comforts \u2014 no personal phones, no clocks, little privacy \u2014 creating conditions that could fundamentally alter how they think, feel and form relationships.",
      "TODAY.com spoke with Beverley Andre, a licensed psychologist, about how the villa's unique environment could affect contestants' minds and decision-making processes, and why the show has mental health care professionals on set.",
      "Her insights reveal why \"Love Island USA\" relationships can appear and feel so intense in the moment, yet may struggle to survive in the real world.",
      "When Time Stands Still",
      "Perhaps the most disorienting aspect of villa life is the complete absence of time cues. Without clocks or calendars, contestants lose all sense of how long they've actually known each other.",
      "\"When time is distorted, your day can feel like a week,\" Andre says. \"So you're thinking that you have this really deep bond with this person, but it's only been like one day or two days.\"",
      "This temporal confusion accelerates emotional investment in ways that can seem almost comical to viewers. Remember when contestants declare they\u2019re \u201cready to be locked in\u201d after just 48 hours? That\u2019s not just reality TV drama \u2014 it\u2019s psychology in action.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no indication, no cues for you to remember, \u2018You guys just got here. This is brand new,\u2019\u201d Andre says.",
      "The result? Some decisions can be driven more by proximity rather than compatibility.",
      "While \"Love Island's\" relatively tech-free environment might sound like a wellness retreat, it brings both benefits and challenges for contestants.",
      "On the positive side, the absence of digital transactions allows for unprecedented focus.",
      "\"When you aren't surrounded by so much noise, you're able to center in and really focus on your own thoughts,\" Andre says.",
      "Forced introspection can lead to genuine self-discovery and deeper connections.",
      "However, the isolation comes with a major downside: Contestants lose access to established neutral parties. Without the outside perspectives people in the real world often engage with when dating, contestants can become trapped in their own biases and misconceptions.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have neutral sounding boards because technically, the other people there are your competitors,\u201d Andre explains.",
      "When Romance Meets Competition",
      "The villa's unique blend of romantic pursuit and competition creates what Andre calls a \"pressure pot effect.\" Contestants aren't just looking for love, they're fighting for public votes and a cash prize, which fundamentally changes relationship dynamics.",
      "\u201c'How can you gain the fastest connection possible?' becomes the driving question, rather than, 'Is this person right for me?'\u201d Andre says.",
      "The format of the show \u2014\u00a0and the $100,000 cash prize at the end \u2014 can lead people to pursue a relationship for the sake of appearing to be in a strong connection, as opposed to laying the groundwork for a relationship.",
      "(The show aims to \"test\" these motives at the end by forcing one member of the winning couple to decide whether they split the prize money or keep it for themselves, with the goal of proving whether or not they were in the villa for love.)",
      "The constant questioning of motives adds another layer of complexity. As Andre points out, both contestants and viewers, may wonder: \u201cAre you really digging me, or do you just want us to win and look cute?\u201d",
      "Living Under Surveillance",
      "Sharing one bedroom and one bathroom with a house full of strangers, all while being filmed 24/7, would create unprecedented challenges for emotional regulation, Andre says.",
      "\"When you have a hard day at work, sometimes you just need space and time to process without having witnesses,\u201d Andre says. \u201cBut then you can\u2019t, because you have eyes all around you.\u201d",
      "The lack of privacy doesn't just affect comfort. It can actively shape behavior. Contestants must constantly consider how their actions will be perceived by both their fellow Islanders and the viewing public. The result can be emotional shutdown rather than emotional regulation.",
      "For contestants from marginalized groups, this scrutiny carries additional weight. Black women on the show face particular pressure around public perception, which can affect everything from their romantic choices to their physical expressions of affection, Andre says.",
      "\u201cBlack women can\u2019t go on this show and sleep with any of these people or any of these men, because of the public perception around Black women and being overly sexualized,\u201d Andre says.",
      "She cites contestants Olandria Carthen and Chelley Bissainthe, who appeared on Keke Palmer's podcast, \"Baby, This is Keke Palmer,\" on July 22 and spoke to this perception.",
      "During the episode, Palmer asked the former Islanders how often they feel they had to \"tone down\" their emotions and reactions to events in the villa as Black women.",
      "\"It's taken out of context, and I'm a bad guy and I'm a mean girl,\" Olandria responded. \"It\u2019s very exhausting to say the least. I truly feel like initially I had to tone down a lot to not cross over that boundary because a person that looks the opposite of us, as soon as they get emotional it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to cater to this person.\u2019 It\u2019s like bro, what about us? I don\u2019t understand.\"",
      "The 'Challenges'",
      "While \"Love Island\" occasionally includes what Andre calls \"wholesome activities\" that can mirror real relationship milestones, such as family day, some viewers are here for prime reality TV drama. Enter: the challenges.",
      "While many feature elaborate props, costumes and kissing, some can expose interpersonal rifts. For example, the \"Stand on Business\" challenge encouraged contestants to anonymously call out other Islanders, while \u201cHate to Burst Your Bubble\" involved Islanders sorting each other in categories like \"most genuine,\" before revealing how viewers at home ranked them.",
      "Andre says while these challenges are entertaining for the viewer, they can cause emotional harm to the islanders participating in them. She uses Season 7's infamous Heart Rate challenge, which involves Islanders dressing in costume and acting out to try and raise their fellow contestants' heart rates the most, as an example.",
      "\"These situations \u2014 do they really have the time to process?\" Andre says. \"Granted, they\u2019re with each other 24 hours a day, but do they have the capacity and the space to process?\"",
      "The Heart Rate challenge led to a feud between Huda Mustafa and Chelley, after several people in the villa thought Huda went too far while dancing with Ace, the other half of Chelley's couple.",
      "\"'Wow, we just had this experience, and I\u2019m in this relationship, but there are some things that happened in that challenge that made me feel, you know, really jealous, or I felt very humiliated,'\" Andre explains of how Islanders may process these situations. \"'You\u2019re saying that you\u2019re really feeling me, or you love me, but then someone else was kissing up on you, and I don\u2019t know how to react to that, right?'\"",
      "Reality Check: Transitioning Back to the Real World",
      "Perhaps the most significant psychological challenge may come after the cameras stop rolling, when contestants must process an intense, highly controlled experience while navigating new relationships under public scrutiny.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re still processing the whole experience,\u201d Andre says.",
      "The villa\u2019s emotional intensity, combined with challenges that may have triggered feelings of jealousy or humiliation, would require serious psychological work to unpack.",
      "Add in the pressures of newfound fame, social media attention and public investment in their relationships, and it\u2019s no wonder \"Love Island\" couples can struggle post-villa.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019re really down for the cause and down for the relationship, I would imagine they\u2019re in therapy,\u201d Andre says."

    "story": [
      "\"The Hunting Wives\" is now a Netflix phenomenon, a star-studded series about southern housewives behaving badly \u2014\u00a0and they're packing more than booze and gossip.",
      "But it all began with a story author May Cobb's mother told her once, while they were driving down the blacktop roads of Longview, her Texas hometown. Cobb's eventual 2021 novel, \"The Hunting Wives,\" went on to inspire the series, first produced for Starz.",
      "\"My mom is such a good storyteller. She started telling me how in high school some of the rich boys would invite her to something called 'the hunting party,'\" Cobb says, speaking to TODAY.com. \"Basically, they would go out to the roofs of their giant cars and try to shoot small game.\"",
      "Cobb, hearing the story, immediately thought of everything that could go wrong with the scenario, and there was a lot. Then it clicked: She wanted to write a novel about it.",
      "\"But I want to swap out the rich boys for women. I want to subvert to 'Texas boys club' and let the women behave badly for a change,\" she remembers thinking.",
      "It's the story of Sophie (Brittany Snow in the series), a Texas transplant who becomes enmeshed in a dynamic friend group in her new town. When a teenage girl winds up dead, they're implicated, although the ending in Cobb's novel is different.",
      "Cobb set the story in a town like the one she grew up in, two hours east of Dallas, in a part of Texas close to the Louisiana border. She describes it as \"eerily beautiful noir,\" a place where Spanish moss hangs from trees and everyone knows everyone's name and history.",
      "She calls the character of Margo, portrayed by Malin \u00c5kerman in the show, a risk-taking and boundary-pushing woman whom Sophie befriends, an \"archetypal east Texas woman\" in the book, but also in the show.",
      "\"It's a party town. The people from my town are high-spirited and fun. I remember one of my editor's notes was, 'Do people drink this much?' And I said, 'I actually toned it down,'\" she says, laughing.",
      "She wanted the book to feel like a \"train wreck\" and a \"downward spiral.\" She was writing when her son was a little kid, and since she was no longer going out for ladies' nights, put the feeling of nights out in the book.",
      "\"I think I went a little too far, but it was so much fun to, like, skew that moral compass and not have to worry about it at all,\" she says.",
      "Cobb stands by her book's morally gray female characters, who party until the late hours and have affairs with high schoolers \u2014 and each other.",
      "\u201cI got a fair amount of backlash when the book came out, and I was honestly shocked. I was like, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s not why I read novels. I read them to escape, to go on an adventure, and I love a good train wreck,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like, \u2018Who am I to judge?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny. Nobody ever got mad at the women being murderers. They were mad about the misbehaving,\u201d she says.",
      "She no longer lives in Longview, Texas, but she knows people in the town are theorizing about how real people might have inspired the book.",
      "\"I've heard there's group chats. And I'm like, 'Guys, I'm a professional author. These characters are fictional.' I'm not foolish enough to write about anyone that's real from there,\" she says, laughing.

      "'Hunting Wives' Author May Cobb Weighs in on Fan Theories \u2014 Including About Sophie and Margo",

      "THEORY: Sophie fired the kill shot at Abby. Then Margo finished the job. \"My knee-jerk reaction would be to say, 'No, it was Margo.' But that's kind of fun.\" THEORY: Jill hit Abby with her car, which is why she was limping. \"Wow. Interesting. Hm. Well, all of this could be such good fodder for Season 2.

Is she being watched? \"I feel like that's just a happy accident with, like, that's her son's book. That's just me, though that's a really clever \u2014 I love all this.\"THEORY: Graham (played by Evan Jonigkeit in the show) did not leave Sophie: He was abducted. \"No, absolutely not.

She wrote it in a four-month \u201cstate of euphoria,\u201d not plotting it out but rather letting the story carry her. Since then, Cobb has published three books.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m a Black artist, I\u2019m apparently a rapper, even though \u2018Hotline Bling\u2019 is not a rap song,\u201d Drake said during in an interview with U.K. DJ Semtex. \u201cThe only category that they can manage to fit me in is in a rap category, maybe because I\u2019ve rapped in the past or because I\u2019m black. I can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d",
      "In 2019, the last time Drake attended the Grammys, he accepted the award for best rap song for \"God's Plan\" and gave a pointed acceptance speech about how he and the other artists there that night \u201cplay in an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport.\u201d",
      "After his album \u201cCertified Lover Boy\u201d was nominated in 2022 for best rap album and his single \u201cWay 2 Sexy\u201d was nominated for best rap performance, Drake asked the Recording Academy to remove his work from the nominations. The Academy honored Drake\u2019s request and rapper didn\u2019t attend the awards show.",
      "In 2023, although Drake refused to submit his 2022 album, \u201cHonestly, Nevermind,\u201d or any of its songs for consideration by the Grammys, he received four nominations. Once again, however, Drake boycotted the awards show.",
      "In 2024, Drake received four Grammy nominations for his joint 2022 album with 21 Savage, \u201cHer Loss.\u201d Per the Grammys, Drake \u201csubmitted material for nomination for the 2024 GRAMMYs,\u201d but the rapper, who did not attend that year, ultimately did not take home an award.",
      "The Weeknd has also had a winding history with the Grammys, receiving 14 nominations and four wins over the years.",
      "After his his \u201cBlinding Lights\u201d and \u201cAfter Hours\u201d were snubbed from nominations at the 2021 ceremony, The Weeknd announced he would not submit his work to Recording Academy.",
      "He told The New York Times at the time that he will \u201cno longer allow my label to submit my music to the Grammys\u201d due to \u201csecret committees\u201d involved in the nomination process.",
      "From 2022 to 2024, the singer boycotted the award show, until an unexpected return this past year, when the Weeknd sang \u201cCry For Me\u201d and \u201cTimeless\u201d with Playboi Carti from his new album, \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Irish singer-songwriter and activist Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor first performed at the Grammys in 1989, just two years before writing an open letter to the Recording Academy, criticizing \u201cfalse and destructive materialistic values.\u201d",
      "Just a year prior to O'Connor's pointed \"SNL\" performance, during which she destroyed a photo of Pope John Paul II on live television, she dropped her planned Grammys performance and published her 1991 letter.",
      "Directing her message to both the Academy and the industry at large, O'Connor wrote, per the Los Angeles Times, \u201cThey acknowledge mostly the commercial side of art. They respect mostly material gain, since that is the main reason for their existence. And they have created a great respect among artists for material gain--by honoring us and exalting us when we achieve it, ignoring for the most part those of us who have not.\u201d",
      "O'Connor won the best alternative music performance Grammy in 1991 for her album, \"I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got,\u201d but refused to accept the award, marking the first time in the award show's history that an artist rejected a win.",
      "O\u2019Connor's letter led to waves of artists refusing to attend the show.",
      "When best rap performance by a duo or group was not televised at the 1991 Grammys \u2014 following the award show's history of not televising wins in the rap category \u2014 nominee Public Enemy decided to boycott the show and released their own statement, via their label head Russell Simmons, that year.",
      "When Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid accepted the 1991 win for Best Hard Rock Performance, he donned a T-shirt displaying a giant photo of O'Connor.",
      "In 2022, Bruno Mars told Rolling Stone that he and Anderson .Paak, who together make up R&B duo Silk Sonic, withdrew their album, \"An Evening with Silk Sonic\" from Grammys consideration.",
      "\u201cWe truly put our all on this record, but Silk Sonic would like to gracefully, humbly and most importantly, sexually, bow out of submitting our album this year,\u201d Mars told the outlet. \u201cWe hope we can celebrate with everyone on a great year of music and partake in the party. Thank you for letting Silk Sonic thrive.\u201d",
      "The two artists did not attend the 2023 ceremony.",
      "Mars has received 33 Grammys nominations and 16 wins. His last win was at this past year's ceremony in best pop duo/group performance for \"Die With a Smile,\" his duet with Lady Gaga.",
      "Why Are Artists Removing Themselves From Grammy Consideration?",
      "While some artist have removed their work from future considerations after past snubs, others have took a stronger stance against the Recording Academy.",
      "While Drake has been vocal about his message that a Grammy win \u201cdoesn\u2019t dictate s---- in our world\u201d as an artist, he has also made reference to his frustration with the Grammys in his music. In his 2023 collaboration with J. Cole, \u201cFirst Person Shooter,\u201d Drake boasts, \u201cI told Jimmy Jam I use a Grammy as a door stop.\u201d",
      "When The Weeknd refused to submit his work for Grammys consideration in 2021, he referred to \u201csecret committees\u201d involved in the nomination process when talking to The New York Times.",
      "In O'Connor's 1991 open letter criticizing the Recording Academy, she wrote that they \u201cacknowledge mostly the commercial side of art.

      "Winona Ryder became one of Hollywood's hottest celebrities in the 1990s thanks in part to her offbeat fashion choices.",
      "By the time Ryder starred alongside Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo and Ethan Hawke in the 1994 cult movie \"Reality Bites,\" her edgy looks \u2014 a vintage thrift store dress with chunky shoes one day, an Armani men's suit the next \u2014\u00a0had turned her into a style icon.",
      "The \"Stranger Things\" star, 53, opened up about her style influences in a video interview with Elle UK. Her love of men's suits, she told the publication, was inspired by the kooky 1976 kids' gangster flick \"Bugsy Malone.\"",
      "\"Even when I didn't have any money and was in school, we would always shop at the Salvation Army, and I was always picking out, like, the boys' three-piece suits because I wanted to be like the kids in 'Bugsy Malone,'\" recalled Ryder.",
      "Many of Ryder's iconic looks were achieved by accident, she said. That choppy layered \u201cReality Bites\u201d haircut that all the Gen X girls flipped for? Turns out, it was a DIY cut Ryder gave herself.",
      "\"All during the \u201890s I cut my own hair,\u201d said Ryder. \"And I remember being incredibly surprised and flattered that my 'Reality Bites' haircut became (popular), or, you know, girls would go to the (hair salon) and bring that picture in, and I thought that was kind of cool.\u201d",
      "Though the haircut was a hit, Ryder is the first to admit she has no clue how to cut hair properly.",
      "\u201cI mean, I literally just put my head upside down and went like that with the scissors. And I did that for any of my short hair,\u201d she explained.",
      "Despite being singled out for her hip style in the '90s, Ryder said her \"relationship to fashion\" during the era was \"probably not what a lot of people think it was.\"",
      "\"If I went to an event, I would wear a designer. Often I wore a lot of vintage,\" she said. \"I was working really quite a lot in the '90s so I was often just on sets and wearing jeans and a T-shirt.\"",
      "Ryder told Elle UK she collects concert T-shirts.",
      "\"I have a T-shirt from every show I've been to, which started very young,\" she shared. \"My dad took me to a lot of the early, like, late '70s, early '80s punk rock (concerts).\"",
      "Ryder said she still has the first concert T-shirt she ever owned, from The Clash's short 1980 tour of the United States. The shirt is so old that it's unwearable, she said, so she keeps it framed.",
      "Looking back, Ryder says her fashion choices in the '90s were all about being true to herself.",
      "\"You know when you're in your 20s, you try to, I don't know, you almost try to do what wasn't trendy. Because a lot of the trends were, I'm sorry, they were awful,\" she said. \"I just wanted to be my own self, and I was also very into recycling and showing people that you can look good and not spend a ton of money.",
      "\"Things are not meant to be worn only once,\" added Ryder. \"That was what always drove me nuts about the events. I remember re-wearing things a lot and apparently that was looked down upon sometimes. I thought it was a great thing.\""

    "published": "Fri, 22 Aug 2025 18:06:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Shawn Hatosy previews Season 2 of \"The Pitt,\" shares why the show is resonating so much and how he's preparing to direct Episode 9.",
    "story": [
      "Shawn Hatosy is getting ready to clock back in for a shift at \"The Pitt.\"",
      "The medical drama, which premiered in January 2025, is on a fast track rarely seen in streaming shows these days. Filming for Season 2 is well underway, and a teaser for the sophomore outing dropped Aug. 21. But eagle-eyed fans may have noticed that Hatosy's character, the internet's favorite night shift attending, Dr. Jack Abbot, wasn't seen in any of the clips.",
      "Shabana Azeez, who stars in the show as medical student Victoria Javadi, joked on her Instagram that Abbot is in a \"retirement home.\" Hatosy has another explanation.",
      "\"I have not shown up yet,\" he tells TODAY.com. \"I'm still about to, so getting prepared for that. I know the cast and crew have been diligently kicking away for a couple months now. So I'm getting ready.\"",
      "The 15-episode procedural \"The Pitt\" has received acclaim for its unconventional format \u2014 each episode reflects one hour of an emergency room shift, with the whole season comprising just one day in the life. Season 1 opens with senior emergency attending Dr. Michael \u201cRobby\u201d Robinavitch, played by Noah Wyle, arriving for his shift, relieving a distraught Abbot. In the first episode, Robinavitch finds Abbot on the roof, who asks why they continue to show up at the grueling job each day.",
      "By the end of the season, Abbot makes a triumphant return to the emergency department in the wake of a mass casualty shooting. He ends the day answering his own question\u00a0\u2014 \"We\u2019re the bees that protect the hive,\" he says \u2014 effectively solidifying his character's arc and making Abbot a \"fully formed character,\" Hatosy says.",
      "\"I feel like I have his backstory down to this point,\" Hatosy says. \"I do believe that they will throw a monkey wrench into that.\"",
      "Below, Hatosy previews what could be in store for Abbot in Season 2, unpacks his character's buzzy chemistry with Dr. Samira Mohan (Supriya Ganesh) and reflects on being nominated for an Emmy Award for best guest actor in a drama series.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "I don't actually know the answer to the first question.",
      "I love the show. I love the character. I think that the night shift has a lot of elements that people respond to. I think it takes a certain type of individual to decide to work nights, and Abbot would be the leader of that because his therapist says he finds comfort in the darkness. I would love to check in once the original \"Pitt\" is up and running, because that's the first priority. But if the writers have the bandwidth for it, I mean, I would love it.",
      "I think No. 1, the medicine. We don't dumb it down in any way. We treat it as it is. So I think the audience, even though they may not understand it \u2014\u00a0I certainly don't understand some of the things that are happening \u2014 there's a trust there. You expect them to follow it, and they do.",
      "I also think the immersive feeling of the narrative being one day, I think it adds to the excitement and the adrenaline. And then the characters are all so well drawn. Each has their own distinct point of view, and people respond to that. I also think that they're all inherently decent people working there, and in a world that's very divided right now, they have pledged to take care of everybody and do their job and save lives.",
      "They do. I'm the target of that sometimes.",
      "Oh yeah, of course. There's always a healthy dose of nerves and fear when you're both directing and acting. The first time you present a character on a TV show, it's terrifying because you're like, \"Whatever I do now I have to commit to for however many years this goes.\" So there's just a lot of anxiety. With directing, you're responsible for so many departments and ideas, and it's definitely scary, but that is what keeps you working so hard. It's a good scary. It's the kind that you need to sort of give you that lift.",
      "But like you said, listen, I'm a performer. So there's a language that actors have with each other. So my first point of attention is always going to be towards the performance, because that's where I come from. So even though they may call me old and a grandpa and chronically online, or whatever they say, I will power through it.",
      "I've said it before, there was a scene early on where he talks about how she's one of the smartest people here. I think that he's not just saying that, I think he believes that. He just respects her. I think he sees her as the future of the ER. There's some light flirting happening, and it's definitely layered into the script. Some writers may say, \"No, we were just putting stuff there.\" But it seems obvious to me. I think that the scene with the pigtail catheter, where he's ... sort of insisting that she do it, even though there's only one case in history of this exact procedure that's ever been done \u2014 it just shows how much he respects her. And sometimes that can turn into something more, you know, when you're working together.",
      "We haven't. I'm actually curious to see how she feels. She might be like, \"Ew, gross,\" and it's possible.",
      "I did read something that Noah said online yesterday in an interview where he was talking about Abbot in Season 2. I don't know much, but I did hear him say that they're going to delve deeper into Abbot's backstory and his relationship with his deceased wife. He still wears his wedding ring. That's one of the pieces of hidden trauma that I knew about, but we haven't gone into yet, but I think we might deal with it this season.",
      "It's still a mystery to me. I've received scripts, though. I'm just about now ready to sit down and plunge in. For directing, I'm going to have to catch up.",
      "They're kind of mirror images of each other, but one is night, one is day. (Laughs). I think the writers did a really nice job of the way that they presented the bookends of the roof scenes. Abbot, seemingly coming off of a horrendous night shift, losing this vet who he spent three hours trying to save, I think that affected him and made him question his purpose. And by the end of the shift, he's up on the roof and the roles are reversed now. Robby has had his worst day, and Abbot is metaphorically talking him off the ledge.",
      "But Abbot's purpose is crystallized in that moment. He figures out that the reason that he keeps coming back is because they're the bees that protect the hive. It's in his DNA \u2014 I think that that line is pure Abbot. It's the spine of how I shape that character.",
      "I think he is in many ways, at least at the end of Season 1, a kind of a fully formed character, whereas Robby has experienced a type of PTSD that will need attention. Abbot has proven and said that he's working on himself, and it'll be nice to find out if Robby will go that path.",
      "I don't know about that. There's so much about just the way he carries himself that's very much me. I was trying to avoid creating something that was transformative. I wanted him to be as close to me as possible. Sometimes that can be challenging, playing somebody that's very close to you, somebody that's like you. So there's that.",
      "I think it's amazing that he's had a rough night, and he's sitting there in his whatever, I don't know, house, van, I don't know, listening to a police scanner, just waiting for an emergency. I think that does say a lot about him. And I do think Season 2 will highlight a little bit more of what he does in his off time, and we will learn maybe why he does stuff like that.",
      "No, I think as actors, we often create these little things to give energy or life to a scene. ... That's kind of the training that you get as an actor. So it's just even the Mohan stuff, whether or not it was explicit, the nuance for me was always this sort of feeling of flutter that he gets with her. Because he does respect her, and she responds.",
      "You're always trying to build a backstory. And what's incredible about episodic television is sometimes even the writers create a backstory, and they tell you that, and then you get to, like, Season 3, and it completely changes, and you just have to accept that. That's how the stuff that I build in there\u00a0\u2014 it's never right, but you just kind of have it in there to bring nuance to the scene.",
      "I feel like I have his backstory down to this point. (Laughs.) I do believe that they will throw a monkey wrench into that. I've worked on John Wells-produced shows, this is my fifth show with him, and every single one of them, I've played pretty complex characters. Like for \"Southland,\" each season, Sammy Bryant would get to a place where I'm like, \"I don't know if he can recover from that.\" And then John will, and his staff of brilliant writers, always come up with a plan that knocks him down another peg. And I'm assuming that Abbot will have a very roller coaster, emotional plight.",
      "I'm feeling great. I'm so ... I'm overwhelmed. It means so much to get the support from the people in the business that do this. But more importantly, I think it's just exciting for the show, being recognized. I'm proud of the show. I think it has something important to say about health care workers, and it is a show that doesn't cost a lot of money compared to other shows, and it's shot in L.A. I think it's great for the business, this show, this model. And I hope that this success, the critical response, leads to more shows like it.",
      "And how I celebrated, (laughs), I was alone in a hotel room in Vancouver, actually. And my wife and I were on the phone, and then I received a lot of phone calls congratulating me. I think I've heard from everybody. And I don't drink anymore, and it's been a while since I've done that, but I actually was like, \"What am I going to do?\" So I went to Queen Elizabeth Park in Vancouver, and I played pickleball with complete strangers. So that's how I celebrated.",
      "No. (Laughs.) The nomination really is the win. It feels great. And it's been a grinding career, just grinding it out. So the nomination is great. Whatever happens from there? Thank you. And if not, OK. It's not going to change anything about how I work, or what this show looks like. We're gonna attack it from the same point of view.",
      "No, just go easy on me out there on the internet. I'm very sensitive."

    "story": [
      "When Angela Bassett started filming Season 8 of \"9-1-1,\" she had no idea of the heartbreak in store for her character.",
      "Bassett plays police Sgt. Athena Grant on the long-running first responder procedural drama. The eighth season, which aired from September 2024 to May 2025, opened with Athena having to land a plane after a swarm of bees caused a midair crash (really). But it ended with the truly unthinkable: the death of fire Capt. Bobby Nash (Peter Krause) \u2014 who has been married to Athena since the show's Season 2 finale \u2014 after he sacrificed his life to save his team during a tragic lab accident.",
      "In an exclusive interview with TODAY.com, Bassett reveals she found out about Bobby's tragic end \"late.\" In fact, she says she first received a \"fake script\" which portrayed the death of a different character, probationary firefighter Ravi (Anirudh Pisharody).",
      "\"We did twice as much work. We filmed (Ravi's) demise, and then the real one,\" Bassett says.",
      "But after she found out it was Bobby who was being killed off, she recalls waiting until she got to set to speak with Krause. Once she arrived, she immediately asked for her co-star, ran upstairs to speak with him and then, \"we just sort of looked at each other,\" she says.",
      "\"I mean we're grown-ups, we know things can go this way sometimes. I remember saying to him, 'Listen, I've died a horrible death a number of times. Even as a queen, they've taken me out,'\" she adds with a laugh, seemingly referring to the death of her character Queen Ramonda in 2022's \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\"",
      "\"'It happens to the best of us,'\" she recalls saying. \"You know, you try to make light, you face the reality of it.\"",
      "She adds that they embraced and felt \"grateful for the time and the love and the camaraderie and the moments that you did have together.\"",
      "\"As he said, I am his longest actor wife,\" she says.",
      "Bobby's death sent shockwaves throughout the \"9-1-1\" fandom as it marked the first major character death in the show's entire run.",
      "During the two-episode event, which aired April 10 and April 17, members of LAFD station 118 were trapped in a research lab and exposed to an aerosolized, mutated version of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. After Chimney (Kenneth Choi) displayed symptoms of the virus, Athena and Buck (Oliver Stark) hunted down the one cure. After it was given to Chimney, Bobby revealed he was also infected, and Athena watched him die in quarantine through a glass wall.",
      "In a statement published by Variety after the episode aired, Krause said he would miss his \"9-1-1 family,\" with a special shoutout to \"my partner, Angela Bassett. Her strength and her sweetness, and us holding hands. We parted ways too soon. Much love.\""

    "story": [
      "While goofing around with TikTok filters, Kate Gosselin gave fans a rare, heartwarming look at her bond with son Aaden.",
      "In the footage, 21-year-old Aaden looks amused as his mom playfully adorns his face with a variety of digital stickers, including a mustache and a cowboy hat. As Gosselin, 50, scrambles to keep up with comments, he happily guides her through it. Their interaction offers a glimpse of a fresh and unseen side of their relationship.",
      "Gosselin shares 8 children with her ex-husband Jon Gosselin: 24-year-old twins Maddie and Cara, and sextuplets Aaden, Alexis, Hannah, Collin, Leah and Joel. The family appeared on TLC\u2019s \u201cJon & Kate Plus 8\u201d for 11 seasons, spanning from 2007 to 2017, but the kids largely disappeared from the public eye afterward.",
      "During her August 21 livestream, Gosselin was asked about the reality series. She said, \u201cI\u2019d love to see my reaction to our show \u2014 I\u2019d probably just cry the whole time.\u201d",
      "Though Aaden mostly observed and let his mother do the talking, she encouraged him to reflect on his favorite memory from when they were filming. After a long pause and some thoughtful chin stroking, Aaden recalled that any time the family traveled to Wyoming was a good memory.",

      "The clips offer a rare glimpse into Gosselin\u2019s life since she moved to North Carolina and became a pediatric home health care nurse. Recently, daughter Alexis made an appearance, popping into the kitchen to give Gosselin a hug before heading out.",
      "Fans seem to be loving this social media version of Gosselin, noting how at peace she appears, with comments overwhelmingly positive. One person remarked, \"Who would\u2019ve thought in 2025 that Kate Gosselin would be my soothing decompress videos to watch!\""

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 One of the United States\u2019 strongest allies in Asia, South Korea has had a rough start with President Donald Trump \u2014 struggling in tariff talks as it spent months without a permanent leader.",
      "But its new president, Lee Jae Myung, has arrived for a meeting with Trump on Monday touting a $150 billion offering whose name is sure to appeal to the U.S. leader: \u201cMake America Shipbuilding Great Again.\u201d",
      "The package, which South Korean officials also refer to as MASGA, includes the construction of new U.S. shipyards, the training of shipbuilding personnel and U.S. Navy ship maintenance.",
      "It\u2019s a key part of the last-minute trade deal South Korea struck last month with Trump, who says he wants to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding for both economic and national security reasons. Trade and security will be high on the agenda at his summit with Lee, which comes amid growing tensions with China and North Korea.",
      "A White House official said that Trump \u201clooks forward to hosting\u201d Lee.  \u201cThey will discuss North Korea, defense posture, trade barriers, maritime security, American shipbuilding, energy dominance, and more,\u201d the official said.",
      "Trump himself injected a note of uncertainty into the day's meeting Monday by posting on Truth Social: \"WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA? Seems like a Purge or Revolution. We can\u2019t have that and do business there.\"",
      "It was not clear what Trump was referring to.",
      "After decades of industry decline, the U.S. now accounts for less than 1% of the global shipbuilding sector, according to the Rand national security think tank, compared with 50% for China, 30% for South Korea and 10% for Japan. South Korean equipment, designs and knowledge could help put the U.S. back on the map.",
      "On Tuesday, Lee and possibly Trump will visit a Philadelphia shipyard acquired last year by the South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group.",
      "The shipbuilding initiative is \u201ca strategic and symbolic win\u201d for South Korea as well as the U.S., said Eun A Jo, an assistant professor of government at William & Mary and director of its Asia Policy Lab.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a smart move to try and secure influence in a critical American sector, while at the same time countering Chinese expansion in global maritime infrastructure,\u201d she told NBC News in a phone interview Sunday.",
      "No 'bromance' expected",
      "The White House summit is an important opportunity for Lee to advocate South Korea\u2019s interests with Trump after months of political instability created by former President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s botched declaration of martial law.",
      "Though Lee comes from a liberal party, he and Trump share much in common \u2014 both have been the subjects of assassination attempts, and both are more open to diplomacy with nuclear-armed North Korea than their predecessors.",
      "But they have very different outlooks on political, economic and foreign policy, which could make the summit challenging, said Bae Jong-chan, president of Insight K, a private think tank in Seoul.",
      "\u201cOne will not be able to expect bromance between President Lee and President Trump,\u201d he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The relationship has already been strained by Trump\u2019s tariffs on South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy, which has a large trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Trump said last month that the U.S. tariff on South Korean imports would be 15%, down from the 25% he had threatened earlier. He said South Korea, which does not impose any tariffs on U.S. goods, managed to \u201cbuy down\u201d the U.S. tariff by promising $450 billion in U.S. investment and energy purchases, including the $150 billion shipbuilding fund.",
      "Jo said Lee is seeking to lock in the terms favorable to South Korea in the trade deal, which remains unwritten and largely unclear.",
      "\u201cI think he wants that to be firm and solid, to have at least some sense of predictability and stability in their economic relations,\u201d she said.",
      "More tricky are questions about South Korea\u2019s longstanding security alliance with the U.S. and its position on China.",
      "Trump wants South Korea to take more responsibility for its own defense, freeing up the almost 30,000 U.S. service members stationed there to focus more on containing China, Washington\u2019s biggest strategic rival.",
      "South Korea worries that such a shift could leave it more exposed to threats from North Korea, as well as increase the chances it could be drawn into a potential U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan, the island democracy Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "Though Lee strongly supports the decades-old U.S.-South Korea alliance, he also has to balance relations with China, South Korea\u2019s main trading partner.",
      "On Sunday, a special envoy told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing that South Korea hopes to normalize relations with China after years of tension.",
      "Lee has long been vocal about his reluctance to take sides between the U.S. and China, and his pragmatic approach to South Korea-China relations \u201cis unlikely to sit comfortably with President Trump,\u201d Bae said.",
      "Lee makes U.S. his second stop",
      "Before heading to Washington, Lee stopped in Tokyo for a summit with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in his first foreign visit since being elected president in June.",
      "\u201cThat was a very deliberate and strategic move,\u201d Jo said, as the two U.S. allies seek leverage to protect themselves from Trump\u2019s vicissitudes.",
      "On his flight from Tokyo to Washington on Sunday, Lee told reporters he had asked Ishiba for details on Japan\u2019s negotiations with the U.S., and that Ishiba had given \u201ca lot of very friendly advice.\u201d",
      "Lee and Ishiba, whose countries have historically been at odds, agreed at their summit to improve bilateral ties so they can better coordinate with the U.S. against China and North Korea.",
      "Despite interest from Washington and Seoul, North Korea has dismissed the idea of further denuclearization talks, saying Trump must accept it as a nuclear power. The Trump-Lee summit comes as the U.S. and South Korean militaries are holding annual joint exercises that North Korea condemns as a rehearsal for invasion.",
      "Bae said Lee is \u201clikely to walk away from the summit with detailed homework\u201d on North Korea, tariffs, military cost-sharing and the role of U.S. troops in South Korea, among other issues.",
      "If he \u201cfails to deliver as President Trump sees fit,\u201d Trump may protest by skipping the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting South Korea is hosting this fall.",
      "\u201cMASGA cannot cover everything for President Lee in dealing with President Trump,\u201d Bae said.",
      "Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Stella Kim from Los Angeles."

      "\"This is the first human case of travel-associated New World screwworm myiasis (parasitic infestation of fly larvae) from an outbreak-affected country identified in the United States,\" HHS spokesperson Emily G. Hilliard said in a statement.",
      "\"The risk to public health in the United States from this introduction is very low,\" he said.",
      "The parasite \u2014 the larvae of the new world screwworm fly \u2014 can devastate cattle herds and is rife in parts of Central America and Mexico. It can destroy wildlife and even kill household pets.",
      "There were serious outbreaks in the 1980s and 1990s in Central America and it was eradicated at great expense, only to return in the last two years.",
      "U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins traveled to Texas to announce a five-part plan to combat the screwworm on Aug. 15",
      "This includes plans to breed billions of sterile flies and dump them from the air over southern Texas and Mexico in the hope of stopping the parasite's spread.",
      "The sterilized male flies mate with females, but the eggs don't hatch. Eventually, the population reduces and dies out. This technique worked in the 1960s when the U.S. suffered its last screwworm outbreak.",
      "And the federal government may face calls to accelerate its work on this: When first announced in June, the sterilization plan wasn't due to be operational for \"two to three years.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbot, commenting on the federal government scheme, said the state agriculture industry, with its 2 million jobs, was worth $867 billion. \"All of this is at risk because of the New World screwworm.\"",
      "A report from the USDA last year estimated an outbreak of screwworm could cost Texas at least $1.8 billion due to livestock deaths, labor costs and medication.",
      "The little parasitic flies \u2014 also known as cochliomyia hominivorax \u2014 have an effect that's vast and devastating, but in isolation quite disgusting. The females can lay eggs in any warm-blooded animal, which then hatch unleashing hundreds of screwworm larvae, so-called because of their sharp mouths and their burrowing being compared to the motion of a screw.",
      "Human infections can be fatal but are rare and most cases can be treated.",
      "The USDA has said that screwworms have been making their way north into Mexico from other parts of Central America. The fly is endemic in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and some South South American nations it said.",
      "Mexico reported a case in Ixhuatlan de Madero, Veracruz, in July, 370 miles from the Texas border, prompting DHH to immediately shut down cross-border cattle trade, following similar stops in November and May."

      "LONDON \u2014 France has summoned the American ambassador to Paris after he wrote a letter to President Emmanuel Macron alleging that the country had not taken \u201csufficient action\u201d to combat antisemitism.",
      "France\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday that it had summoned Charles Kushner to appear Monday over his criticism, which it said was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "It said that \u201cFrance firmly rejects these allegations\u201d and that French authorities have \u201cfully mobilized\u201d to combat the \"intolerable\" rise in antisemitic acts over the past two years.",
      "The French ministry said that Kushner\u2019s allegations violated international law and the obligation not to interfere with the internal affairs of another country. \u201cThey also fall short of the quality of the transatlantic partnership between France and the United States and of the trust that must prevail between allies,\" it said.",
      "The episode is the latest sign of a growing divide between the United States and its longtime partners in Europe. It comes as Washington's close ally, Israel, increasingly clashes with Western countries amid fallout from its military assault on Gaza.",
      "\u201cAntisemitism has long scarred French life, but it has exploded since Hamas\u2019s barbaric assault on Oct. 7, 2023,\u201d Kushner wrote in an open letter in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.",
      "\u201cPublic statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France,\u201d added Kushner, who is Jewish.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Sunday evening that it stood by Kushner\u2019s comments, according to the Associated Press news agency. \u201cAmbassador Kushner is our U.S. government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role,\u201d he said.",
      "France said last month that it plans to recognize a Palestinian state in September, while other traditional allies of Israel such as Australia and Canada have said they will do the same.",
      "Last week, Macron denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's accusations that this move was fueling antisemitism, calling the suggestion \"abject\" and \"erroneous.\"",
      "France is home to the largest Jewish population in Europe, with an estimated 500,000 Jews, the third-largest Jewish population in the world after Israel and the United States. That\u2019s approximately 1% of the national population.",
      "In his letter, Kushner goes on to say that French Jews are living in fear and that Macron should act decisively in protecting them, adding that he stands ready to work with French leaders across the country to \u201cforge a serious plan that addresses the roots of antisemitism and defeats it.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, many French Jews fear that history will repeat itself in Europe,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cMr. President, I urge you to act decisively: enforce hate-crime laws without exception; ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses, prosecute offenders to the fullest extent; and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.\u201d",
      "Kushner, a real estate developer, is the father of President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. He said during his confirmation hearing in May this year that he was \u201cdedicated to building an even stronger relationship\u201d between the U.S. and France.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term in the Oval Office, he pardoned Kushner, who pleaded guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations."

      "Vice President JD Vance remains confident the U.S. can broker an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine despite potential hang-ups that have emerged since President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting this month with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve already seen some significant concessions from both sides, just in the last few weeks,\u201d Vance said in an exclusive interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Vance also weighed in on a Russian missile strike in western Ukraine overnight Thursday that hit an electronics factory owned by a U.S.-based company. Asked by moderator Kristen Welker if he was \u201cenraged\u201d by the strike, which the company said injured  several workers, Vance pivoted to a criticism of former President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Vance said of the assault. \u201cBut this is a war, and this is why we want to stop the killing. The Russians have done a lot of things that we don\u2019t like. A lot of civilians have died. We\u2019ve condemned that stuff from the get-go and, frankly, President Trump has done more to apply pressure and to apply economic leverage to the Russians, certainly, than Joe Biden did for 3 \u00bd years, when he did nothing but talk, did nothing to bring the killing to a stop. So you asked me what I\u2019m enraged by? What I\u2019m enraged by is the continuation of the war.\u201d",
      "Trump told reporters Friday that he was not happy about the strikes on western Ukraine and indicated that any peace deal between the countries could be weeks away.",
      "\u201cI think over the next two weeks, we\u2019re going to find out which way it\u2019s going to go,\u201d Trump said.",
      "During his interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Vance did not characterize the strike, and a number of other issues, as long-term hindrances to peace, saying there was still plenty of room for negotiation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to eventually be successful, or we\u2019ll hit a brick wall. And if we hit a brick wall, then we\u2019re going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage,\u201d Vance added. \u201cThis is the energetic diplomacy that\u2019s going to bring this war to a close.\u201d",
      "Welker then asked Vance what the pressure is on Russia if the U.S. is not \u201cimposing new sanctions.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow do you get them to a place of getting to the table with Zelenskyy and stopping to drop bombs?\u201d she asked.",
      "Vance replied by saying Trump has applied \u201caggressive economic leverage,\u201d such as \u201csecondary tariffs on India, to try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy.\u201d",
      "Asked by Welker if he could guarantee that the U.S. would not send troops to help enforce any peace deal, Vance reaffirmed Trump\u2019s opposition to such a deployment.",
      "\u201cThe president has been very clear,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThere are not going to be boots on the ground in Ukraine. But we are going to continue to play an active role in trying to ensure that the Ukrainians have the security guarantees and the confidence they need to stop the war on their end and the Russians feel like they can bring the war to a conclusion on their end.\u201d",
      "The interview, which aired Sunday, comes amid new, heightened tensions in the effort to end the war.",
      "On Friday, Russia\u2019s top diplomat told NBC News that no meetings between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been scheduled, raising further doubts about Trump\u2019s ability to mediate the conflict.",
      "Meanwhile, details about security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 and Russia\u2019s role in shaping them \u2014 remain unresolved.",
      "In the interview, Vance said he doesn\u2019t believe the Russians are stringing Trump along.",
      "\u201cI think the Russians have made significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in 3 \u00bd years of this conflict,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands. They\u2019ve talked about what would be necessary to end the war.\u201d",
      "Trump, Vance added, stepped up efforts to negotiate a diplomatic solution \u201cbecause this war is not in anyone\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not in Europe or the United States\u2019 interest.\u201d",
      "While acknowledging some of the hurdles that have popped up since Trump\u2019s Aug. 15 meeting with Putin in Alaska, Vance expressed optimism that persistence would deliver results.",
      "\u201cThere are hills and valleys to the negotiations,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe sometimes feel like we\u2019ve made great progress with the Russians, and sometimes, as the president has said, he\u2019s been very frustrated with the Russians. We\u2019re going to keep on doing what we have to do to bring this thing to a close. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen overnight. I think that we\u2019re going to continue to make progress. But, ultimately, whether the killing stops, that determination is going to belong to whether the Russians and Ukrainians can actually find some middle ground here.\u201d",
      "Putin has rejected calls \u2014 including from Trump before their recent meeting \u2014 for a ceasefire.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t say they conceded on everything,\u201d Vance said in the interview, referring to Russia. \u201cBut what they have conceded is the recognition that Ukraine will have territorial integrity after the war. They\u2019ve recognized that they\u2019re not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. \u2026 Have they made every concession? Of course they haven\u2019t. Should they have started the war? Of course they [shouldn\u2019t have], but we\u2019re making progress.\u201d",
      "Asked about disagreements surrounding how involved Russia will be in establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, Vance asserted that \u201cthere\u2019s a little bit of talking past each other here.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re not talking about security guarantees until after the war has come to a close,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd, of course, the Russians are going to be a part of the conversation about bringing that war to a close. So, of course, they\u2019re going to have some stake in this.\u201d",
      "The interview with Vance also touched on several domestic issues, including new congressional maps passed by the Republican-controlled Texas House of Representatives that could pad the GOP\u2019s majority by as many as five seats. The issue has become a political flashpoint, with California Democrats preparing retaliatory moves and other states aiming to redraw maps, too.",
      "\u201cAll we\u2019re doing, frankly, is trying to make the situation a little bit more fair on a national scale,\u201d Vance said of GOP efforts. \u201cThe Democrats have gerrymandered their states really aggressively. We think there are opportunities to push back against that, and that\u2019s really all we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "On the subject of his own political ambitions, Vance again sidestepped questions about whether he sees himself as Trump\u2019s heir apparent in 2028, when the president is term-limited.",
      "\u201cI see myself as a vice president who\u2019s trying to do a good job for the American people ... and if I do a good job, and if the president continues to be successful, as I know that he will be, the politics will take care of itself,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe can cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d",
      "Welker asked if Vance has discussed the possibility with Trump.",
      "\u201cAs you know, the president talks about everything, and if it\u2019s in the news, the president and I have certainly discussed it,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cBut I think the president is just focused on doing a good job for the American people. He wants me to be focused on doing a good job for the American people. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep on doing.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month abolishing the trade loophole known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d which since 2016 had allowed goods worth up to $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.",
      "The end of the exemption is being extended worldwide after the loophole was closed in May for packages from mainland China and Hong Kong.",
      "Under the new rules, personal gifts worth less than $100 will still be duty-free, but all other packages will face the same tariffs as standard imports from their country of origin.",
      "The planned policy shift, which operators say lacks clear procedures, has raised concerns about backlogs as services are put on hold.",
      "Postal providers in Belgium, Denmark and New Zealand are among several operators that have already suspended shipments of packages to the U.S. until they can retool their systems to comply with the new rules. Letters and documents are generally unaffected.",
      "Services in Germany, France, Britain and India have announced they will follow suit in the coming days.",
      "France\u2019s national postal service, La Poste, said in a statement that the U.S. did not provide full details or allow enough time to prepare for new customs procedures. New Zealand\u2019s postal service said parcel deliveries to all U.S. states and territories would be \u201ctemporarily unavailable until further notice\u201d while systems are updated to meet new U.S. customs requirements.",
      "DHL, one of the world\u2019s largest courier companies, said Friday that it will stop accepting parcels containing goods from business customers destined for the U.S. beginning Monday.",
      "The company cited unresolved \u201ckey questions\u201d about the process, including \u201chow and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out.\u201d",
      "DHL will, however, continue to deliver private parcels labeled as gifts valued under $100, in line with White House assurances.",
      "The White House said ending the duty-free exemption would help combat \u201cescalating deceptive shipping practices, illegal material, and duty circumvention,\u201d claiming some shippers had \u201cabused\u201d the exemption to send illicit drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "It said the number of de minimis parcels jumped from 134 million in 2015 to more than 1.36 billion in 2024 as shippers \u201cdeceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties,  inspection, and U.S. law.\u201d",
      "Most of those packages came from mainland China and Hong Kong, which the Trump administration initially targeted as part of efforts to curb American shoppers from ordering low-value goods from China-linked retailers such as Temu and Shein.",
      "The White House briefly closed the loophole for mainland China and Hong Kong in February, but quickly extended the deadline to May 2 amid confusion over how the new duties would be collected."

      "Although the English-dubbed version may do better in the U.S. than the earlier Chinese-only release with English subtitles, which earned about $20 million, Zeng said that if \u201cNe Zha II\u201d succeeds with international viewers it is likely to stem more from its domestic acclaim and novelty than from genuine interest in Chinese mythology.",
      "Zeng said while she expects some reviews in the U.S. will criticize the film as Chinese propaganda, other viewers may just watch it out of curiosity.",
      "Kevin Ma, a veteran observer of the film industry who is based in Hong Kong, said another challenge \u201cNe Zha II\u201d faces in its latest release is the tight theatrical window in today\u2019s streaming-dominated market.",
      "New films may capture public attention for only one or two months before moving to streaming platforms, said Ma, who is also a film festival consultant.",
      "Even though \u201cNe Zha II\u201d came out only at the beginning of this year, it almost seems \u201clike a distant memory now\u201d because of consumers\u2019 \u201cshorter attention span\u201d in the streaming age, he said."

      "Famine was officially declared on Friday in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, by the world's leading authority on hunger as Israel vowed to raze the area if Hamas doesn't agree to its terms.",
      "The declaration of famine by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, comes as deaths from starvation rise across the Palestinian enclave in a spiraling crisis under Israel's military assault and aid restrictions.",
      "Israel's military is preparing to push ahead with a new operation to seize Gaza City that could displace hundreds of thousands of people and worsen the dire situation there. It has launched intense strikes on the city this week after announcing it had begun the first stage of its planned assault.",
      "Famine declared",
      "The IPC, an internationally recognized system for classifying food insecurity and malnutrition, said in its report that famine had been confirmed in the Gaza Governorate \u2014 and that it was projected to expand to the Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates farther south by the end of September if the humanitarian situation does not change.",
      "The number of people now experiencing famine in Gaza was nearly 514,000, the IPC said \u2014 around a quarter of the enclave's population. That was projected to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.",
      "\"Famine is a race against time,\" the IPC said. \"An immediate ceasefire and end to the conflict is critical to enabling an unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response to save lives.\"",
      "The United Nations-backed body had up until now only declared famine on four other occasions since it was first established in 2004, most recently in Sudan last year.",
      "The report's findings were met with little surprise by global health authorities and humanitarian groups.",
      "\u201cFamine warnings have been clear for months,\u201d said Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Program.",
      "\u201cA ceasefire is an absolute and moral imperative now,\u201d said World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cThe world has waited too long, watching tragic and unnecessary deaths mount from this man-made famine.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forcefully rejected the report's findings, calling them a \"lie,\" and repeated that \"Israel does not have a policy of starvation.\"",
      "The IPC's 59-page report does not state that Israel has a policy of starvation in Gaza.",
      "Earlier, Israel's foreign ministry said the IPC had published a \u201cfabricated report to fit Hamas\u2019s fake campaign.\u201d It hit out at the IPC\u2019s methods, accusing it of having \u201ctwisted its own rules and ignored its own criteria.\u201d",
      "The IPC rejected Israel\u2019s accusation.",
      "Mike Huckabee, the United States' ambassador to Israel, attacked the famine declaration before it was officially announced.",
      "\"You know who IS starving? The hostages kidnapped and tortured by uncivilized Hamas savages,\" he said in a post on X early Friday.",
      "Famine, the highest phase of the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale, is classified when an area has at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food; at least 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition and at least two people or four children out of every 10,000 people are dying each day from starvation.",
      "But the bar can also be met if 15% of children are considered to be suffering from acute malnutrition based on mid-upper arm circumference with evidence of rapidly worsening underlying drivers, according to the IPC, which cited the latter practice in its report.",
      "The IPC said that this did not mean it had altered its threshold for famine, saying it used this method in line with established standards where a lack of other data is available, as it had also done in South Sudan.",
      "This \"does not represent a 'lowered threshold' in IPC methodology. Instead, it demonstrates the continued application of established IPC standards,\" it said.",
      "Israel has repeatedly denied reports of growing starvation in Gaza, while seeking to blame any hunger in the enclave on humanitarian groups and Hamas.",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza intensified after Israel launched a blockade on March 2, in the middle of its ceasefire with Hamas, barring the entry of food and other vital supplies for more than two months. It lifted the blockade in May, but only allowed a basic amount of aid in for weeks after that.",
      "Data published by COGAT states that in the weeks since Israel lifted its blockade on May 19 to August 17, when the database was last updated, 9,165 trucks carrying aid entered the enclave, with food making up just over 95% of the supplies.",
      "That boils down to an average of around 100 trucks carrying aid per day during that time period. Prior to Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, around 500 trucks per day were entering the enclave, according to humanitarian groups.",
      "Israel threatens 'gates of hell'",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed Friday to open the \u201cgates of hell\u201d on Gaza City until Hamas agreed to Israel\u2019s conditions for ending the war, including the release of all hostages and the militant group's complete disarmament.",
      "If not, he said, the city would \u201cbecome like Rafah and Beit Hanoun,\u201d areas that have been largely reduced to ruins under Israel\u2019s 22-month offensive.",
      "Netanyahu said a day earlier that he had authorized the operation to take over Gaza City, while also revealing he had instructed \u201cimmediate negotiations\u201d to begin for a deal to end the war in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages who remain held in the enclave.",
      "The video statement followed days of silence after Hamas announced it had accepted a ceasefire proposal put forward by Arab mediators.",
      "The IPC\u2019s declaration comes just over three weeks after it warned that the \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201d was already unfolding in the Palestinian enclave under Israel\u2019s offensive and crippling aid restrictions \u2014 but it had emphasized the alert was not a formal famine classification.",
      "Aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks there is still not enough food entering Gaza to stave off famine.",
      "The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said on Monday it had recorded three new adult deaths \u201cdue to famine and malnutrition\u201d within a 24-hour period, bringing the total death toll from starvation to 266 people, including 112 children.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, marking a major escalation in a decades-long conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the local Palestinian health ministry, with much of the territory destroyed.",
      "Among the dead are hundreds of people who have been killed while trying to seek aid following the introduction of a new distribution system led by Israel and the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation."

      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hailed his country\u2019s fallen soldiers in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine as \u201cheroes\u201d at an emotional award ceremony, state media said Friday, in a rare public admission of the losses Pyongyang has suffered in the conflict.",
      "The North Korean leader \u201cextended deep gratitude and warmest militant respect\u201d to those who had returned home \u201cdespite the hail of bullets and bombs of the life-and-death war in the foreign country,\u201d state news agency KCNA reported.",
      "\u201cThe victory won by the brave soldiers who participated in the war is a great feat that firmly defended the great honor of the KPA,\u201d Kim was quoted as saying, referring to his military, the Korean People\u2019s Army.",
      "Photos released by state media showed Kim pinning commendation badges on soldiers\u2019 uniforms as well as on photo frames of deceased soldiers hung on a wall. They also showed him meeting with and embracing tearful family members of deceased soldiers.",
      "KCNA said Kim laid a flower on a memorial wall and paid a silent tribute at the ceremony, during which the national anthem was also played.",
      "The ceremony on Thursday came a week after Kim received a letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin that also described the North Korean troops as \u201cheroic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe bonds of militant friendship, goodwill and mutual aid which were consolidated in the days of the war long ago remain solid and reliable even today,\u201d Putin said in the letter published by North Korean state media Voice of Korea.",
      "Pyongyang and Moscow have forged increasingly close ties after the Kremlin found itself diplomatically isolated following its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Kim and Putin signed a mutual defense pact last year, and experts say North Korea may have sent Russia troops in exchange for advanced military technology that would aid its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "Neither Russia nor North Korea confirmed the deployments until months after Pyongyang sent its first soldiers last fall. Though the two countries have not revealed the exact number of troops involved, it could be as high as 15,000, according to South Korean, U.S. and Ukrainian officials.",
      "Of those, about 600 are believed to have been killed, South Korea\u2019s spy agency said, and thousands more injured.",
      "Though North Korea has one of the largest militaries in the world, its troops have had little real-world combat experience since the end of the Korean War in 1953. But they are strongly loyal to Kim and are trained to take their own lives rather than surrender, former North Korean soldiers who defected have told NBC News.",
      "According to South Korean intelligence, there was at least one incident in which a North Korean soldier seeking to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces was killed while trying to detonate a grenade and shouting Kim\u2019s name.",
      "It is unclear how many North Korean troops remain on the frontlines. South Korean lawmakers said after an intelligence briefing in June that North Korea could deploy additional troops to Russia in July or August and that it was continuing to supply Moscow with arms."

      "The Sinpung-dong Missile Operating Base is about 17 miles from the border with China in the North Korean province of North Pyongan, researchers from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington, said in a report Wednesday.",
      "The base could contain six to nine of North Korea\u2019s advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles, along with their mobile launchers and thousands of soldiers, the report said. Though the weapons are not likely to be mounted with nuclear warheads, they are capable of carrying them.",
