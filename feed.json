      "The Cannes Film Festival has barred French actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy from attending the premiere of the competition entry \u201cCase 137.\u201d",
      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival barred French actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy from attending the premiere of the competition entry \u201cCase 137,\" in what's believed to be a first for the festival in the #MeToo era.",
      "Festival director Thierry Fremaux confirmed to the French magazine T\u00e9l\u00e9rama that Navarro-Mussy would not be allowed to attend the red carpet premiere of \u201cCase 137\" (\"Dossier 137\" in France) on Thursday night at Cannes. He has a supporting role in the film.",
      "T\u00e9l\u00e9rama reported that Navarro-Mussy was accused of rape by three former partners in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The case was dropped last month due to lack of evidence, but T\u00e9l\u00e9rama reported the three woman plan to appeal.",
      "\u201cIt is because there is an appeal, and therefore the investigation is still active, that the case is not suspended,\" Fremaux told the French magazine. \u201cWhen a legal decision becomes final, the situation changes.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Navarro-Mussy didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for the Cannes Film Festival referred inquires to Fremaux's comments to T\u00e9l\u00e9rama.",
      "Navarro-Mussy's attorney, Marion Pouzet-Gagliardi told T\u00e9l\u00e9rama: \u201cI have received no information indicating that any proceedings are ongoing. This proposed complaint with civil party status has, to my knowledge, not been legally filed.\"",
      "The decision marks a shift for the Cannes Film Festival, which has sometimes been criticized for welcoming men accused of sexual misconduct. But some say now that the festival is evolving as the #MeToo movement has made belated inroads into the French film industry.",
      "This year's Cannes opened hours after French actor Gerard Depardieu was found guilty of sexual harassment and handed a 18-month suspended prison sentence. When asked about the Depardieu verdict, Juliette Binoche, Cannes jury president, said that \u201cthe festival is following this trend in social and political life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe festival is in step with what\u2019s happening today,\u201d Binoche said. \u201c#MeToo took some time to gain strength. We reacted very strongly recently.\"",
      "On Thursday, the French production company of \u201cCase 137,\u201d Haut et Court, said it last week received a warning about the situation.",
      "\u201cEven though the allegations largely predate the production of the film, we agreed with the festival management that the person in question will not accompany the film to Cannes, out of respect for the plaintiffs and their right to be heard, while also respecting the presumption of innocence of the accused,\u201d the company said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "An athlete will aim to be the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard to educate the public on sharks",
      "VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. -- Lewis Pugh has followed an unspoken rule during his career as one of the world\u2019s most daring endurance swimmers: Don\u2019t talk about sharks. But he plans to break that this week on a swim around Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where \u201c Jaws\u201d was filmed 50 years ago.",
      "The British-South African was the first person to complete a long-distance swim in every ocean of the world \u2014 and has taken on extreme conditions everywhere from Mount Everest to the Arctic.",
      "\u201cOn this swim, it\u2019s very different: We\u2019re just talking about sharks all the time,\u201d joked Pugh, who will, as usual, wear no wetsuit.",
      "For his swim around Martha\u2019s Vineyard in 47-degree (8-degree Celsius) water he will wear just trunks, a cap and goggles.",
      "Pugh, 55, is undertaking the challenge because he wants to change public perception around the now at-risk animals \u2014 which he said were maligned by the blockbuster film as \u201cvillains, as cold-blooded killers.\u201d He will urge for more protection for sharks.",
      "On Thursday, beginning at the Edgartown Harbor Lighthouse, he will swim for three or four hours in the brutally cold surf, mark his progress and spend the rest of his waking hours on the Vineyard educating the public about sharks. Then, he'll get in the water and do it again \u2014 and again, for an estimated 12 days, or however long it takes him to complete the 62-mile (100-kilometer) swim.",
      "He begins the journey just after the New England Aquarium confirmed the first white shark sighting of the season, earlier this week off the coast of Nantucket.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to test me not only physically, but also mentally,\u201d he said, while scoping out wind conditions by the starting line. \u201cI mean every single day I\u2019m going to be speaking about sharks, sharks, sharks, sharks. Then, ultimately, I\u2019ve got to get in the water afterwards and do the swim. I suppose you can imagine what I\u2019ll be thinking about.\u201d",
      "Pugh said the swim will be among the most difficult he\u2019s undertaken, which says a lot for someone who has swum near glaciers and volcanoes, and among hippos, crocodiles and polar bears. No one has ever swum around the island of Martha's Vineyard before.",
      "But Pugh, who often swims to raise awareness for environmental causes \u2014 and was this year named the United Nations Patron of the Oceans \u2014 said no swim is without risk and that drastic measures are needed to get his message across: Around 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day \u2014 a rate of 100 million every year, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
      "\u201cIt was a film about sharks attacking humans and for 50 years, we have been attacking sharks,\u201d he said of \u201cJaws.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s completely unsustainable. It\u2019s madness. We need to respect them.\u201d",
      "He emphasizes that the swim is not something nonprofessionals should attempt. He\u2019s accompanied by safety personnel in a boat and kayak and uses a \u201cShark Shield\u201d device that deters sharks using an electric field without harming them.",
      "Pugh remembers feeling fear as a 16-year-old watching \u201cJaws\u201d for the first time. Over decades of study and research, awe and respect have replaced his fear, as he realized the role they play in maintaining Earth\u2019s increasingly fragile ecosystems.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m more terrified of a world without sharks, or without predators,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d is credited for creating Hollywood\u2019s blockbuster culture when it was released in summer 1975, becoming the highest grossing film up until that time and earning three Academy Awards. It would impact how many viewed the ocean for decades to come.",
      "Both director Steven Spielberg and author Peter Benchley have expressed regret over the impact of the film on viewers\u2019 perception of sharks. Both have since contributed to conservation efforts for animals, which have seen populations depleted due to factors like overfishing and climate change.",
      "Discovery Channel and the National Geographic Channel each year release programming about sharks to educate the public about the predator.",
      "Greg Skomal, marine fisheries biologist at Martha\u2019s Vineyard Fisheries within the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, said many people tell him they still won't swim in the ocean because of the sheer terror caused by the film.",
      "\u201cI tend to hear the expression that, \u2018I haven\u2019t gone in the water since \u2018Jaws\u2019 came out,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "But Skomal, who published a book challenging the film's inaccuracies, said \u201cJaws\u201d also inspired many people \u2014 including him \u2014 to study marine biology, leading to increased research, acceptance and respect for the creatures.",
      "If \u201cJaws\u201d were made today, he doesn't think it'd have the same effect. But in the 1970s, \u201cit was just perfect in terms of generating this level of fear to a public that was largely uneducated about sharks, because we were uneducated. Scientists didn\u2019t know a lot about sharks.\u201d",
      "Skomal said the biggest threat contributing to the decline of the shark population now is commercial fishing, which exploded in the late 1970s and is today driven by high demand for fins and meat used in food dishes, as well as the use of skin to make leather and oil and cartilage for cosmetics.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve really moved away from this feeling, or the old adage that, \u2018The only good shark is a dead shark,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely morphing from fear to fascination, or perhaps a combination of both.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- An alligator that appeared in numerous TV shows and films over three decades, most notably the 1996 Adam Sandler comedy \u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d has died at a gator farm in southern Colorado.",
      "Based on his growth rate and tooth loss, Morris the alligator was at least 80 years old when he died, the Colorado Gator Farm said in a Facebook post Sunday. He was nearly 11 feet (3.3 meters) long and weighed 640 pounds (290 kilograms).",
      "\"He started acting strange about a week ago. He wasn\u2019t lunging at us and wasn\u2019t taking food,\u201d Jay Young, the farm\u2019s owner and operator, said in a video as he tearfully stroked Morris' head in an animal enclosure.",
      "\u201cI know it's strange to people that we get so attached to an alligator, to all of our animals. ... He had a happy time here, and he died of old age,\" he said.",
      "Morris, who was found in the backyard of a Los Angeles home as an illegal pet, started his Hollywood career in 1975 and retired in 2006, when he was sent to the Colorado Gator Farm in the tiny town of Mosca. He appeared in several films, including \u201cInterview with the Vampire,\u201d \u201cDr. Dolittle 2\" and \u201cBlues Brothers 2000.\" He also appeared on \u201cCoach,\u201d \u201cNight Court\u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno\u201d featuring the late wildlife expert Steve Irwin.",
      "But his most famous role was in \u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d a film about a failed and ill-tempered hockey player who discovers a talent for golf. The title character played by Sandler confronts Morris after hitting a golf ball that ends up in the gator's mouth.",
      "Sandler posted a tribute to Morris on Instagram on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe are all gonna miss you. You could be hard on directors, make-up artists, costumers \u2014 really anyone with arms or legs \u2014 but I know you did it for the ultimate good of the film,\" Sandler wrote. \"The day you wouldn\u2019t come out of your trailer unless we sent in 40 heads of lettuce taught me a powerful lesson: never compromise your art.\u201d",
      "The Colorado Gator Farm, which opened to the public in 1990, said it plans to preserve Morris' body.",
      "\u201cWe have decided to get Morris taxidermied so that he can continue to scare children for years to come. It\u2019s what he would have wanted,\" the farm posted on Facebook on Monday.",

      "NEW YORK -- A former model reproached one of Harvey Weinstein \u2019s lawyers for suggesting that her sexual abuse allegations against the ex-studio boss are lies.",
      "\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself,\u201d Kaja Sokola retorted. In her fifth and final day of testimony at Weinstein's sex crimes retrial, she maintained that she was telling the truth and that Weinstein's alleged conduct in her teens had changed the course of her life.",
      "\u201cIt changed the course of your life in that you got $3.5 million from false accusations?\u201d defense lawyer Mike Cibella pressed, referring to compensation she was awarded through civil proceedings in recent years.",
      "\u201cNo. That\u2019s very unfair,\" Sokola said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d",
      "During her days on the witness stand, she said Weinstein repeatedly offered to foster her acting ambitions but then made unwanted physical advances, beginning when she was 16 in 2002.",
      "Weinstein, 73, faces a sexual assault charge related solely to her allegation that he forced oral sex on her when she was 19. He also faces charges based on two other women's claims. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges, and his attorneys assert that his accusers had consensual sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer because they wanted movie and TV work.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers grilled Sokola about her requests for career help from him after the alleged assault, her motives for her civil lawsuits and criminal trial testimony, as well as her personal struggles, and even a private journal she kept for an alcohol-abuse program in her native Poland.",
      "After apparently getting the decade-old writings via the witness' sister, the defense was allowed to bring up portions in which Sokola said two other men had sexually assaulted her over the years but didn't say the same about Weinstein. Instead, she wrote that he promised her help but didn't deliver.",
      "Sokola testified Wednesday that she had left out Weinstein's alleged sexual abuse partly because she couldn't come to terms with it at the time. Also, she said, her sponsor was in the film business in Poland and knew who Weinstein was.",
      "Cibella questioned that explanation, noting that the text mentioned only \u201cHarvey W\u201d and nothing about his profession. Sokola said her sponsor nonetheless knew his identity because they talked about it.",
      "Tearing up as she spoke, she said she hadn\u2019t seen the black notebook for 10 years, never gave anyone permission to share it and was stunned and appalled to be confronted with it in court.",
      "\u201cI felt very violated,\u201d said Sokola, now 39 and a psychotherapist.",
      "She was the second of Weinstein's accusers to testify at the retrial, and the only one who wasn't involved in his first trial in 2020. That proceeding led to a landmark #MeToo-era conviction that was subsequently overturned, setting up the retrial. Prosecutors decided to add Sokola's allegations to it.",
      "Another woman, Miriam Haley, already has told jurors at the retrial that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify in the coming days or weeks. She alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission to be identified. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "\u201cYou did not deserve what I did to you, but you inspire me to do better,\u201d Erik Menendez said, addressing his family.",
      "Jesic issued his decision immediately after the brothers spoke, granting them a new sentence of 50 years to life.",
      "The brothers are immediately eligible for parole under California\u2019s youthful offender law because they committed the crime at ages 18 and 21, both under the age of 26.",
      "Parole suitability hearings are conducted by a state board to determine if a person should be released. An inmate will be scheduled for their first hearing no later than six months following their eligibility date, according to board policy.",
      "They already have a hearing before the board scheduled for June 13 in a clemency petition they\u2019ve submitted to Gov. Gavin Newsom. It\u2019s not yet clear if that will serve as their formal parole hearing or if a separate one will be scheduled.",
      "Newsom ordered the state parole board to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for him to determine their danger to the public if released.",
      "Anne Bremner, a trial lawyer in Seattle, said the brothers will have some pressure on them to prepare for the parole board and impress upon them that they should be let out.",
      "\u201cMy guess is the parole board has been watching this and of course they\u2019ve done these risk assessments already,\u201d she said.

      "If they are denied at their first parole hearing, they will continue to receive subsequent hearings until they are granted release.",
      "If parole is granted, Newsom could still move to override the board. If he lets the parole decision stand, the brothers would be released from prison.",
      "In May 2023, the brothers\u2019 attorneys also filed a petition for habeas corpus to the court, asking for a new trial in light of new evidence of their sexual abuse. LA prosecutors have filed a motion opposing that petition, but its status is unclear.",

She said when she called a relative for help, he took her phone and got into his car, slamming the door on her as she was holding the baby. Bailey filed a police report over the incident.",
      "She also asked that Granberry be ordered to stop using his streaming platforms on Twitch and YouTube to turn his followers against her.",
      "\u201cWhenever he wishes to cause upset, he starts bad mouthing me to his several millions of fans,\u201d she said in the documents. \u201cHe claims I am withholding our son and that I am with other men. As a result, I then receive threats and hate on social media.\u201d",
      "Granberry was also ordered not to possess any weapons. The judge can extend the order for up to five years at the June 6 hearing.",
      "DDG, from Pontiac, Michigan, first saw success as a video streamer and then as a hip-hop artist. On May 5, he released his fourth studio album, \u201cBlame the Chat,\u201d on Epic records.",
      "Bailey, from Atlanta, has been nominated for five Grammy Awards as both a solo artist and as part of Chloe x Halle, the duo with her sister that first brought her fame.",
      "She starred in the sitcom \u201cGrown-ish\u201d from 2018 to 2022, and in 2023 played the title character in Disney's live-action remake of \u201cThe Little Mermaid.\u201d",

      "Authorities say a man who attacked rapper Tory Lanez in a California prison is an inmate serving a life sentence for second-degree murder who was previously convicted for an in-prison assault with a deadly weapon",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Authorities said Tuesday that a man who attacked rapper Tory Lanez in a California prison is an inmate serving a life sentence for second-degree murder who was previously convicted for an in-prison assault with a deadly weapon.",
      "Lanez was in fair condition a day after the attack in a housing unit at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi, where he\u2019s serving a 10-year sentence for shooting hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion in the feet, Pedro Calderon Michel, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said in an email.",
      "Authorities did not specify how Lanez was attacked, but a message posted on the rapper\u2019s Instagram account Monday evening said Lanez was stabbed 14 times and both his lungs collapsed.",
      "Prison officials identified the alleged attacker as Santino Casio, 42. He has been put in restricted housing pending an investigation by the prison and the Kern County District Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "Casio has been in the facility since 2004, after he was sentenced to life, with parole possible, for convictions of second-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder. In 2008, he was sentenced to six more years for assault by a prisoner with a deadly weapon, and in 2018 he was sentenced to two more years for possession and manufacture of a deadly weapon by a prisoner.",
      "An email seeking comment sent to an attorney who previously represented Casio was not immediately answered.",
      "The prison is about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Los Angeles in the mountains of the Mojave Desert and houses about 1,700 medium- and maximum-security inmates.",
      "In December 2022, Lanez was convicted of three felonies: assault with a semiautomatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.",
      "Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, testified during the trial that in July 2020, after they left a party at Kylie Jenner\u2019s Hollywood Hills home, Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding.",
      "She had bullet fragments in both feet that had to be surgically removed. It wasn\u2019t until months after the incident that she publicly identified Lanez as the person who had fired the gun.",
      "A judge rejected a motion for a new trial from Lanez\u2019s lawyers, who are appealing his conviction. They had no immediate comment after the attack.",
      "Megan recently alleged that Lanez was harassing her from prison through surrogates, and in January a judge issued a protective order through 2030 ordering him to stop any such harassment or any other contact.",
      "The 32-year-old Canadian Lanez began releasing mixtapes in 2009 and saw a steady rise in popularity, moving on to major label albums, two of which reached the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s charts.",
      "The Monday Instagram post on Lanez\u2019s status said he was \u201ctalking normally, in good spirits, and deeply thankful to God that he is pulling through.\"",

      "One hundred years after Charlie Chaplin made dinner rolls dance and ate his shoe like it was a fine meal, \u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d has been vividly brought back to life in a new restoration that premiered Tuesday at the Cannes Film Festival",
      "CANNES, France -- One hundred years after Charlie Chaplin made dinner rolls dance and ate his shoe like it was a fine meal, \u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d has been vividly brought back to life in a new restoration that premiered Tuesday at the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "On the opening day of its 78th edition, Cannes debuted a 4K restoration of \u201cThe Gold Rush,\u201d one of Chaplin\u2019s most beloved silent masterpieces. The screening, held just before the festival\u2019s official opening ceremony, was part of a new day-one tradition for restored films, festival director Thierry Fremaux said before the screening at Cannes\u2019 Debussy Theatre.",
      "Years in the making, this \u201cGold Rush\u201d pristinely restores Chaplin\u2019s Tramp to all his downtrodden glory. The 1925 Alaskan frontier comedy may be marking its centenary, but it looks bracingly fresh in the restoration carried out by La Cineteca di Bologna.",
      "The restoration was more complicated than most because it included an extensive search for any missing footage. In 1942, Chaplin edited the film and re-released it with sound effects, music and narration. That version landed two Oscar nominations, but the restoration sought to get as close to the 1925 original as possible.",
      "In \u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d Chaplin's lone prospector ambles through the snowy Alaskan wilds in pursuit less of gold than some food and perhaps companionship. His antic, cliff-dangling struggles make up much of the film's deft slapstick, but the Little Tramp's humble, sweet hopes for romance greatly exceed his strike-it-rich ambitions.",
      "The film's premiere drew two grandchildren of Chaplin: Kiera Chaplin and Spencer Chaplin.",
      "\u201cWhat to say about \u2018The Gold Rush?' said Spencer Chaplin. \u201cIt was his biggest production to date. He built the set \u2014 it was almost like a tourist attraction in L.A. at the time. He built the mountains.\u201d",
      "The screening in Cannes drew a packed house in one of Cannes' largest theaters, a crowd that the Chaplin descendants warmly surveyed.",
      "\u201cOur grandfather would be really proud to see this, a hundred years later, to see all you here and interested in seeing the film,\u201d said Kiera Chaplin.",
      "\u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d will roll out in theaters worldwide on June 26 in a release organized by mk2 Films.",

      "A former model testifying in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s retrial on sexual assault charges is being questioned about a private journal she wrote a decade ago",
      "NEW YORK -- A former teen fashion model testifying in Harvey Weinstein \u2019s retrial on sexual assault charges was confronted on the stand Tuesday with a private journal where defense attorneys say she wrote about people who sexually abused her.",
      "As one of Weinstein\u2019s lawyers began to question her about the handwritten journal, Kaja Sokola protested that it shouldn\u2019t be discussed in open court as she\u2019d written it as part of a substance abuse treatment program years ago.",
      "\u201cThis is very inappropriate,\u201d she pleaded as the attorney began to cite portions of the text, which they say was originally written in Polish in 2015. \u201cPlease don\u2019t read that. This is my personal things. I\u2019m not on trial here.\u201d",
      "Judge Curtis Farber dismissed the jury for a lunch break as Sokola began to get emotional.",
      "He assured her later that he would allow the jury to hear limited questioning around the document. The judge also said he had concerns about the journal\u2019s completeness and authenticity, wondering how defense lawyers had obtained what appears to be private medical records.",
      "\u201cThis might backfire tremendously\u201d for the defense, Farber said at one point, as prosecutors also strongly opposed inclusion of the journal as evidence in the trial. \u201cThat\u2019s the risk they\u2019re willing to take.\u201d",
      "Sokola, who is now a 39-year-old psychotherapist, continued to push back. Her testimony was expected to resume Tuesday afternoon after a lunch break.",
      "\u201cThis is unethical,\u201d she insisted to the judge. \u201cI would never do this to my patient, and I would never do this to myself.\u201d",
      "Michael Cibella, one of Weinstein\u2019s lawyers, told Farber that the defense team intends to question Sokola on a part of the journal where she describes at least five sexual assaults she\u2019s suffered over her life.",
      "Weinstein, they say, is not among those she named, though he does appear elsewhere in the journal. They say she references her frustration and disappointment after a \u201cHarvey W\u201d had led her along, \u201cpromising me help\u201d but \u201cnothing came out of it.\u201d",
      "Sokola testified last week that Weinstein exploited her dreams of an acting career to subject her to unwanted sexual advances, starting days after they met in 2002, while she was a 16-year-old on a modeling trip to New York.",
      "Some of those allegations are beyond the legal time limit for criminal charges, but Weinstein faces a criminal sex act charge over Sokola\u2019s claim that he forced oral sex on her in 2006.",
      "Prosecutors added the charge to the landmark #MeToo case last year, after an appeals court overturned Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction. The guilty verdict pertained to allegations from two other women, who also have testified or are expected to testify at the retrial.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies ever sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "His lawyers, in their cross-examination of Sokola that began Friday, have sought to raise doubts about her allegations, portraying her as a wannabe actor who tried to leverage her consensual relations with the former studio boss.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted, but Sokola has given her permission to be identified.",

      "In real life, the Eurovision Song Contest is an annual musical competition and TV event that sees 37 countries compete for a crystal microphone trophy over a four-hour live broadcast. In the interstellar version, aliens from 40 different worlds vie to win, also by singing.",
      "Davies says it took three years to pull it off the doubleheader because they had to work with the BBC to set the schedule and storylines in stone to ensure a perfect alignment.",
      "Britain\u2019s Sam Ryder took a \u201cSpace Man\u201d to Eurovision before, in 2022. Now, Gatwa will read out the U.K.\u2019s jury scores during the song contest's grand final, held this year in Basel, Switzerland.",
      "Talking to The Associated Press, Davies says that both Eurovision and \u201cDoctor Who\u201d share the DNA of old-fashioned Saturday night television, making the combination \u201cirresistible.\u201d",
      "This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "DAVIES: I almost think every episode of \u201cDoctor Who\u201d is a great big celebration, sort of noise and color and spectacle, and that sums up Eurovision as well. In pitching this to Disney+ as well it\u2019s like, \u201cLook we\u2019re going out in 60 of your territories\u201d and Eurovision itself has a viewing figure that some years is bigger than the Super Bowl. There\u2019s not many shows that can say that on planet Earth.",
      "DAVIES: It\u2019s enormous fun. It could be said if you\u2019ve never seen a single Eurovision Song Contest in your life, you can still come along and watch this. It\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019d have made up for a \u201cDoctor Who\u201d story anyway.",
      "One day I\u2019ll do that \u201cABBA Voyage\u201d story where the holograms come to life and start killing people. That\u2019s the best idea ever. We\u2019ve got to do that one then. Can you imagine? That would be just amazing. I think there might be some copyright problems with that but we\u2019d overcome them.",
      "The actual pitch for the story to Juno (Dawson), who wrote it, was Eurovision meets \u201cDie Hard.\u201d So as you will see, the moment it starts, there\u2019s trouble, someone\u2019s out to sabotage it. There are villains behind the scenes trying to disrupt the program. All chaos is let loose and the rest of the episode is spent saving people\u2019s lives after that.",
      "DAVIES: I think there\u2019s four songs in total (by Murray Gold). Obviously we don\u2019t get to all 40 planets with their songs, but it was a very big production. We had to hive this off into its own production unit. There are scenes in the television gallery, where 40 different monitors have output of 40 different screens. And that\u2019s all been fed in live. That\u2019s not done with green screen afterwards, that\u2019s all stuff they\u2019d already shot. Crowds, acts, rehearsals, backstage, presenters, all of that stuff, playing onto that set, so it\u2019s terribly complicated.",
      "DAVIES: Frankly, they\u2019re all expensive. It was a lot, yes. It had to be planned very far in advance, more than any. Once you plan something carefully, then it costs less just because you\u2019re not busking. We allocate each story more or less the same amount of money. So I think it ends up costing as much as the others, but it just looks so good because they had so much time to plan it.",
      "DAVIES: We never say that. I don\u2019t know why, but we just don\u2019t ever do it. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d tell me. I\u2019d faint.",
      "DAVIES: Yes, I will be. This will be a great night. I always sit and watch \u201cDoctor Who\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m old-fashioned \u2014 on its old-fashioned BBC One transmission at 7 o\u2019clock at night.",
      "I know people who have Eurovision parties, which I\u2019ve never gone to actually. Look at my life, it\u2019s devoted to television. I can\u2019t bear other people talking over it. That would just be a nightmare. So I will be sitting in. I\u2019ll get some nice dinner. I\u2019ll be a very happy man.",
      "DAVIES: I would like to go on a date with the man from Cyprus (Theo Evan). He\u2019s beautiful. I do like the U.K. entry this year (\u201cWhat the Hell Just Happened?\u201d by Remember Monday). I have a theory it\u2019s being underestimated in Great Britain. Just because we\u2019re so used to losing. We\u2019ve won five times, everyone. But this country gets a bit cynical about Eurovision sometimes. But I love our song. I think it\u2019s got a very memorable chorus.",

      "CANNES, France -- The 78th Cannes Film Festival got underway Tuesday, kicking off two weeks of French Riviera frenzy. Here are five things to look for at this year\u2019s Cannes:",
      "It might still be springtime, but, make no mistake, multiple Oscar campaigns will be launched in Cannes.",
      "Recent Cannes editions have produced several best-picture winners, including Bong Joon Ho\u2019s \u201cParasite\u201d and this year\u2019s winner, \u201cAnora\u201d by Sean Baker. The sway Cannes has on the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has only grown in recent years as the academy has expanded its overseas membership \u2014 many of them European voters who closely follow the buzz in Cannes.",
      "At the Oscars in March, three Cannes entries \u2014 \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cEmilia Perez\u201d and \u201cThe Substance\u201d \u2014 were among the 10 best-picture nominees. Less heralded movies can also emerge. The Latvian animated charmer \u201cFlow\u201d premiered last year in Cannes before its upset win at the Oscars.",
      "Before we get to the Academy Awards, though, Cannes will hand out its own prize, the Palme d\u2019Or.",
      "Deliberations by the jury (headed this year by Juliette Binoche ) are held entirely in private, so predicting the Palme is no easier than it was guessing the next pope. That doesn\u2019t stop bookies from handicapping the race and plenty of guesswork up and down the Croisette.",
      "This year\u2019s competition lineup features two previous Palme winners in Julia Ducournau (who returns with \u201cAlpha,\u201d her follow-up to \u201cTitane\u201d) and Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (two-time winners, back this year with \u201cThe Young Mother\u2019s Home\u201d).",
      "Some of the movies that could be in the mix include Lynne Ramsay\u2019s \u201cDie, My Love,\u201d Jafar Panahi\u2019s \u201cA Simple Accident\u201d and Mascha Schilinksi\u2019s \u201cSound of Falling.\u201d Or it could be Chie Hayakawa\u2019s \u201cRenoir,\u201d Joachim Trier\u2019s \u201cSentimental Value\u201d or Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cEddington.\u201d Or it could be \u2026 well, you get the idea.",
      "Cannes has a power to burnish even the most established stars, and its red carpet will, for the next 10 days, host a nonstop parade of them. (And they will be clothed, as per Cannes\u2019 latest etiquette protocol.)",
      "Among those on tap are Tom Cruise with \u201cMission Impossible: Final Reckoning\u201d on Wednesday; Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d with Denzel Washington; Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d with a cast featuring Benicio Del Toro and Michael Cera; Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cEddington,\u201d with Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal and Emma Stone; and Oliver Hermanus\u2019 \u201cThe History of Sound,\u201d with Paul Mescal and Josh O\u2019Connor.",
      "O\u2019Connor also stars in Kelly Reichardt\u2019s \u201cThe Mastermind,\u201d scheduled as one of the festival\u2019s last premieres.",
      "Three stars are coming to Cannes with their first features behind the camera: Scarlett Johansson (\u201cEleanor the Great\u201d), Kristen Stewart (\u201cThe Chronology of Water\u201d) and Harris Dickinson (\u201cUrchin\u201d). All are premiering in the Cannes sidebar Un Certain Regard, which means they won\u2019t have quite the pressure of the competition lineup. But there\u2019s no calm or easygoing section of Cannes, and each could emerge from the festival either minted as a filmmaker or humbled by critics.",
      "While Cannes movie screens light up with films, deal making transpires along the Croisette. Cannes draws studios, producers and sales agents all on the hunt for acquisitions. But when U.S. President Donald Trump last week announced that he wants to enact tariffs on films made outside the U.S., it threw a giant wrench in the border-crossing dealmaking that Cannes specializes in. Yet with little detail on any possible tariffs and widespread doubt over its feasibility, the buying and selling of movies might not be slowed.",

      "PARIS -- Kim Kardashian testified Tuesday that she feared she would be raped and killed during a 2016 armed robbery in Paris, describing the ordeal in stark, emotional terms.",
      "\u201cI was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,\u201d Kardashian told a French court, recalling how one robber pulled her toward him while she was wearing only a bathrobe. \u201cI absolutely did think I was going to die,\u201d she added.",
      "It marked the first time Kardashian has confronted the men accused of tying her up at gunpoint in her hotel suite during Fashion Week and stealing more than $6 million in jewelry.",
      "Her appearance is the emotional peak of a trial that has gripped France and reignited global debates over celebrity, privacy, and digital-age exposure.",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "Kim Kardashian has arrived at a Paris courthouse to testify against the men accused of robbing her at gunpoint in 2016, an event that reshaped her life and redefined celebrity security in the age of social media.",
      "This will be the first time she has faced the alleged assailants since that night, when she begged for her life as masked men bound her with zip ties and stole over $6 million in jewelry.",
      "Kardashian\u2019s appearance is expected to be the emotional centerpiece of a trial that has captivated France, where the suspects \u2014 mostly in their 60s and 70s \u2014 are nicknamed \u201cthe grandpa robbers.\u201d",
      "Authorities say the group tracked her via her Instagram posts. Two defendants have admitted being at the scene.",
      "Her lawyers say she is ready to confront those who attacked her, with dignity.",
      "Earlier, Kardashian 's childhood friend and then stylist told the court that she heard the celebrity beg for her life during the robbery that transformed the way the world viewed fame in the digital age.",
      "Simone Harouche, who was sharing their two-floor hotel suite during Fashion Week, said she heard a terrified Kardashian yelling: \u201c\u2018I have babies and I need to live.\u2019 That is what she kept on saying, \u2018Take everything. I need to live.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cI was scared that she was raped or violated. I thought the worst,\u201d Harouche said. Kardashian was \u201cscreaming with terror in her voice.\u201d",
      "One of the most recognizable figures on the planet, Kardashian is set to face 10 men accused of orchestrating the heist \u2014 a crime that shook the fashion world and redefined the risks of being visible, female and famous in the Instagram era.",
      "Harouche told the court the trauma \u201cforever\u201d changed her friend, whom she\u2019s known since age 12, robbing her of a basic human right: freedom.",
      "\u201cShe now has a completely different lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cIn terms of security, she can\u2019t go alone, she doesn\u2019t go alone to places anymore. To lose your sense of freedom ... it\u2019s horrible.\u201d",
      "Kardashian\u2019s testimony is expected to recount how the attackers demanded her ring and left her fearing she would never see her children again.",
      "David De Pas, the lead judge, asked Harouche whether Kardashian had made herself a target by posting images of herself with \u201cjewels of great value.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Harouche replied. \u201cJust because a woman wears jewelry, that doesn\u2019t make her a target. That\u2019s like saying that because a woman wears a short skirt that she deserves to be raped.\u201d",
      "Twelve suspects were originally charged. One has died. Another was excused due to illness. Most are in their 60s and 70s \u2014 nicknamed les papys braqueurs, or \u201cthe grandpa robbers\u201d \u2014 and authorities describe them as a seasoned and coordinated criminal gang.",
      "Two defendants have admitted being at the scene. The others deny involvement, and one claims he didn\u2019t know who Kardashian was. But police say the group tracked her via social media, where she had posted images of her jewelry, her hotel, and her schedule \u2014 exposing her vulnerability.",
      "The heist turned Kardashian into a cautionary tale of hyper-visibility. At the time, she was at the height of her influence \u2014 a style icon, social media pioneer and one of the most photographed women in the world.",
      "Fashion legend Karl Lagerfeld criticized her after the robbery, telling The Associated Press she was \u201ctoo public\u201d with her wealth. Yet, as details emerged in the days after the heist, public sentiment shifted. The image of Kardashian \u2014 alone, bound, and pleading for her life \u2014 reframed her in the public eye.",
      "In the aftermath, Kardashian pulled back from the spotlight. She developed severe anxiety and later described symptoms of agoraphobia.",
      "\u201cI hated to go out,\u201d she said in a 2021 interview. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anybody to know where I was \u2026 I just had such anxiety.\u201d",
      "Later, she acknowledged that constant sharing had made her vulnerable: \u201cPeople were watching,\u201d she said. \u201cThey knew what I had. They knew where I was.\u201d",
      "Harouche, who hid in a downstairs bathroom during the robbery, said she also suffered trauma. She sought counseling for post-traumatic stress and left the celebrity styling world to become an interior designer.",
      "\u201cThat experience was very stressful for me. It made me fearful of being around celebrities,\" she said.",
      "Harouche said she went to bed before the robbery. Kardashian entertained friends upstairs. Screams jolted Harouche from her sleep.",
      "From inside the locked bathroom, she texted Kardashian\u2019s sister Kourtney and Kardashian\u2019s bodyguard that \u201csomething is very wrong,\u201d Harouche testified.",
      "Later, after the robbers had gone, she said she heard Kardashian hopping down the stairs with her ankles still bound to find her.",
      "\u201cShe was beside herself,\u201d Harouche said. \u201cShe just was screaming.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Paris court has found actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021",
      "PARIS -- French movie star G\u00e9rard Depardieu on Tuesday was found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on the set of a movie in which he starred and was given an 18-month suspended prison sentence by a Paris court.",
      "He was also fined a total of 29,040 euros (around $32,350), and the court requested that he be registered in the national sex offender database.",
      "The 76-year-old actor was convicted of having groped a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during the filming of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d) in 2021. The case was widely seen as a key post-#MeToo test of how French society and its film industry address allegations of sexual misconduct involving prominent figures.",
      "Depardieu, who has denied the accusations, didn't attend the hearing in Paris. Depardieu\u2019s lawyer said that his client would appeal the decision.",
      "\u201cIt is the victory of two women, but it is the victory of all the women beyond this trial,\u201d said Carine Durrieu Diebolt, the set dresser's lawyer. \u201cToday we hope to see the end of impunity for an artist in the world of cinema. I think that with this decision we can no longer say that he is not a sexual abuser. And today, as the Cannes Film Festival opens, I\u2019d like the film world to spare a thought for G\u00e9rard Depardieu\u2019s victims.\"",
      "Depardieu\u2019s long and storied career \u2014 he told the court that he\u2019s made more than 250 films \u2014 has turned him into a French movie giant. He was Oscar-nominated in 1991 for his performance as the swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac.",
      "In recent years, the actor has been accused publicly or in formal complaints of misconduct by more than 20 women, but so far only the sexual assault case has proceeded to court. Some other cases were dropped because of a lack of evidence or the statute of limitations.",
      "During the four-day trial in March, Depardieu rejected the accusations, saying he\u2019s \u201cnot like that.\u201d He acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language on the film set and that he grabbed the set dresser's hips during an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual.",
      "The court, composed of a panel of three judges, concluded that Depardieu\u2019s explanations in court were \u201cunpersuasive\u201d and \u201cnot credible\" and stressed both accusers' \u201cconstant, reiterated and substantiated declarations.\u201d",
      "The court also said that both plaintiffs have been faced with an \u201caggressive\u201d defense strategy \u201cbased on comments meant to offend them.\u201d The judges therefore considered that Depardieu\u2019s lawyer comments in court aggravated the harm to the accusers and justified higher fines.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s lawyer, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, regretted that the court \u201cconsidered that questioning the accusations is an additional assault ... which means that now the defense, even in this type of trial, is no longer accepted.\"",
      "The set dresser described the alleged assault, saying the actor pincered her between his legs as she squeezed past him in a narrow corridor.",
      "She said he grabbed her hips then started \u201cpalpating\u201d her behind and \u201cin front, around.\u201d She ran her hands near her buttocks, hips and pubic area to show what she allegedly experienced. She said he then grabbed her chest.",
      "The woman also testified that Depardieu used an obscene expression to ask her to touch his penis and suggested he wanted to rape her. She told the court that the actor\u2019s calm and cooperative attitude during the trial bore no resemblance to his behavior at work.",
      "The other plaintiff, an assistant, said that Depardieu groped her buttocks and her breasts during three separate incidents on the film set.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify by name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to be named. Neither woman has done so in this case, although one has agreed to be pictured.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very moved,\" one of the plaintiffs, the set dresser, told reporters after the verdict. \u201cI\u2019m very, very much satisfied with the decision, that\u2019s a victory for me, really, and a big progress, a step forward. I feel justice was made.\u201d",
      "Some figures in the French cinema world have expressed their support for Depardieu. Actors Vincent Perez and Fanny Ardant were among those who took seats on his side of the courtroom.",
      "French media reported last week that Depardieu was shooting a film directed by Ardant in the Azores archipelago, in Portugal.",
      "The actor may have to face other legal proceedings soon.",
      "In 2018, actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of raping her at his home. That case is still active, and in August 2024 prosecutors requested that it go to trial.",
      "For more than a half-century, Depardieu stood as a towering figure in French cinema, a titan known for his commanding physical presence, instinct, sensibility and remarkable versatility.",
      "A bon vivant who overcame a speech impediment and a turbulent youth, Depardieu rose to prominence in the 1970s and became one of France\u2019s most prolific and acclaimed actors, portraying a vast array of characters, from volatile outsiders to deeply introspective figures.",
      "In recent years, his behavior toward women has come under renewed scrutiny, including after a documentary showed him repeatedly making obscene remarks and gestures during a 2018 trip to North Korea.",

      "Expectations are running high for a potentially banner Cannes. All of the ingredients \u2014 loads of stars, top-tier filmmakers, political intrigue \u2014 seem to be lined up. Over the next 12 days, Cannes will play host to megawatt premieres including those of \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning,\u201d Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d and Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cEddington.\u201d",
      "DiCaprio skirted the red carpet but drew a standing ovation when he presented De Niro with an honorary Palme d'Or. The moment, which brought together two of Martin Scorsese's most regular stars, came 49 years after \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d was crowned with the Palme d'Or.",
      "DiCaprio praised De Niro as \u201cthe archetype\u201d actor, while also praising the 81-year-old performer \u2014 a fierce critic of U.S. President Donald Trump \u2014 for \u201cfighting for our democracy.\u201d When the crowd rose to its feet for a lengthy ovation for De Niro, DiCaprio handed him the Palme. \u201cThanks, kiddo,\u201d said De Niro.",
      "After thanking the festival, De Niro quickly turned to speaking about Trump, who recently said he wants to enact a tariff on films made outside the country.",
      "\u201cArt is the truth. Art embraces diversity. And that's why art is a threat to the autocrats and the fascists of the world,\u201d said De Niro. \u201cAmerica's philistine president has had himself appointed head of one of America's premier cultural institutions. He has cut funding and support to the arts, humanities and education. And now he announced a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States. You can't put a price on connectivity.\u201d",
      "The opening ceremony, which preceded the premiere of Am\u00e9lie Bonnin\u2019s French romance \u201cLeave One Day,\u201d was attended by Tarantino, who emerged to grandly declare the festival open, and then promptly dropped the mic and walked off stage. On Wednesday, Tarantino will pay tribute to Western filmmaker George Sherman. Also in attendance: Sean Baker, the \u201cAnora\u201d director and last year\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or winner.",

      "Along with Binoche, the other eight jurors include Halle Berry and Jeremy Strong, who was unable to attend Cannes last year for the premiere of his Trump film \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d Strong referenced that film, which led to his first Oscar nomination, in his comments on the American president Tuesday.",
      "\u201cTruth is under assault,\u201d said Strong. \u201cSpecifically at this temple of film, the role of film is increasingly critical because it can combat those forces in the entropy of truth, and can communicate truths, individual truths, human truths, societal truths, and affirm and celebrate our shared humanity.\u201d",
      "Berry, responding to Cannes' new protocols on attire for the red carpet, said she had \u201can amazing dress\u201d with a long train for the opening ceremony but wore something else instead. Cannes has outlawed nudity and dresses with long trains for its evening premieres at the Palais.",

The rule requires ticket sellers, hotels, vacation rental platforms and others to disclose processing fees, cleaning fees and other charges up front.",

Thousands of people lost tickets after waiting for hours in an online queue.",

      "Asked for clarity on the policy, Cannes press officers said the festival \u201cmade explicit in its charter certain rules that have long been in effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe aim is not to regulate attire per se, but to prohibit full nudity on the red carpet, in accordance with the institutional framework of the event and French law,\u201d it said.",
      "Cannes also noted that \u201cvoluminous outfits, in particular those with a large train, that hinder the proper flow of traffic of guests and complicate seating in the theater are not permitted.\u201d",
      "Still, skin has often been flashed at the French Riviera festival by celebrities like Bella Hadid, Naomi Campbell and Kendall Jenner, and dress policies have long been flouted by celebrities. For evening premieres at the Palais' Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lumi\u00e8re, black tie and evening wear is required. Though not in recent years, Cannes security officials have sometimes turned away women for not wearing heels.",
      "The festival also banned selfies in 2018 \u2014 Cannes director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux called them \u201cgrotesque\u201d \u2014 but A-listers sometimes snap a quick photo on the Palais steps.",

      "Behind so many award-winning careers, high-profile productions, beloved institutions and in-depth research projects there is often a quieter story of early support from the government",
      "NEW YORK -- Poet Marie Howe, one of this year's winners of the Pulitzer Prize, says being a writer is often less a career than a vocation. You rely on teaching and other outside work and seek support from foundations or from a government agency, like the National Endowment for the Arts.",
      "\u201cEverybody applies for an NEA grant, year after after year, and if you get it, it's like wow \u2014 it's huge,\" says Howe, a Pulitzer winner for \u201cNew and Selected Poems\u201d and a former NEA creative writing fellow. \u201cIt's not just the money. It's also deep encouragement. I just felt so grateful. It made a big, big difference. It gives you courage. It says to you, \u2018Go on, keep doing it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Behind so many award-winning careers, high-profile productions, beloved institutions and in-depth research projects there is often a quieter story of early support from the government \u2014 the grants from the NEA or National Endowment for the Humanities that enable a writer to complete a book, a community theater to stage a play, a scholar to access archival documents or a museum to organize an exhibit.",
      "For decades, there has been a nationwide artistic and cultural infrastructure receiving bipartisan support, including through the first administration of Donald Trump.",
      "Now that is changing \u2014 and drastically.",
      "Since returning to office in January, the president has alleged that federal agencies and institutions such as the NEA, NEH, PBS, the Kennedy Center and the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) were advancing a \u201cwoke agenda\u201d that undermined traditional values.",
      "Trump has ousted leaders, cut or eliminated programs and dramatically shifted priorities: At the same time the NEH and NEA were forcing out staff members and canceling grants, they announced a multimillion-dollar initiative to support statues for Trump's proposed \"National Garden of American Heroes,\u201d from George Washington to Shirley Temple.",
      "\u201cAll future awards will, among other things, be merit-based, awarded to projects that do not promote extreme ideologies based upon race or gender, and that help to instill an understanding of the founding principles and ideals that make America an exceptional country,\" reads a statement on the NEH website.",
      "Individuals and organizations across the country, and across virtually every art form, now find themselves without money they had budgeted for or even spent, anticipating they would be reimbursed.",
      "Electric Literature, McSweeney's and n+1 are among dozens of literary publications that received notices their grants have been rescinded. Philadelphia's Rosenbach Museum & Library had to halt a project to create an online catalog after losing a near-$250,000 grant from the IMLS. The Stuttering Association for the Young, which manages a summer music camp, has a $35,000 gap.",
      "\u201cOur fundraising allows kids to attend our summer camp at a greatly reduced cost so the lost funds make it harder to fulfill that commitment,\" says the association's director, Russell Krumnow, who added that \u201cwe planned our programming and made decisions with those funds in mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cGovernment money ought to be consistent. It ought to be reliable,\u201d says Talia Corren, co-executive director of the New York-based Alliance of Resident Theatres, which assists hundreds of nonprofit theater companies. \u201cYou need to make decisions based on that money.\u201d",
      "The NEA, NEH and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting were among the institutions established 60 years ago, during the height of President Lyndon Johnson's \u201cGreat Society\u201d domestic programs. At various times, they have faced criticism for supporting provocative artists, such as photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in the 1980s. But they have endured, in part, because of their perceived economic benefits, distributed through as many congressional districts as possible.",
      "Arts advocates contend that, like other forms of federal aid, the importance of an NEA or NEH grant isn\u2019t just the initial money, but the \u201cripple\u201d or \u201cmutliplier\u201d effect. Government backing often carries the kind of prestige that makes a given organization more desirable to private donors.",
      "The millions of dollars channeled through state arts and humanities councils in turn support local projects. Funding for a theater production helps generate jobs for the cast and crew, brings in business for neighboring restaurants and bars and parking garages and spending money for the babysitter hired by parents having a night out.",
      "Actor Jane Alexander was just beginning her stage career when the endowment helped fund the 1967 Arena Stage production of Howard Sackler's drama about boxer Jack Johnson, \u201cThe Great White Hope,\" which starred Alexander and James Earl Jones and eventually won the Pulitzer Prize. Alexander, who headed the NEA in the 1990s, remembered how Arena co-founder Zelda Fichandler worried that the endowment might hurt business by supporting other theaters in Washington.",
      "\u201cAnd I remember my late husband (Robert Alexander) who was artistic director of the Living Stage Theatre Company at the time, saying to her, 'No, it doesn\u2019t work that way. A rising tide floats all boats,\" she says.",
      "In the short term, organizations are seeking donations from the general public and philanthropists are attempting to fill in fiscal holes. The Mellon Foundation recently announced an \u201cemergency\u201d $15 million fund for state humanities councils. At the Portland Playhouse in Oregon, artistic director Brian Weaver says that donors stepped in after the theater lost a $25,000 NEA grant just a day before they were to open a production of \u201cJoe Turner's Come and Gone,\u201d",
      "But Weaver and others say private fundraising alone isn't a long-term solution, if only because individuals incur \u201cdonor fatigue\u201d and philanthropists change their minds. Jane Alexander remembers when the Arena theater in Washington founded a repertory company, supported in part by the Rockefeller Foundation.",
      "\u201cIt was like the National Theatre in Britain,\" she says. '\"We felt so proud that we can have a repertory company of 30 players rotating players through the season. It was very, very exciting. And we had, you know, voice lessons, we had fencing lessons. We were going to become the great company. And guess what happened? Rockefeller\u2019s priorities changed.\u201d",

      "\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d made a meal of it. \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d tried to consider the effect on survivors of losing a planet of people. But it hasn't fit in the swashbuckling world of \u201cStar Wars.\u201d How could the mission to destroy the Death Star have quickly concluded if Princess Leia needed to mourn the loss of nearly all her loved ones on Alderaan?",
      "\u201cAndor\u201d changed all that. Coping with inner pain has been a theme throughout its two-season run, which comes to a close Tuesday when Disney+ releases a series-finale trilogy of episodes. It starts with its title character, who is left rootless by the deaths and destruction around him.",
      "\u201cEverything has been taken away from him since day one,\u201d Diego Luna, who plays Cassian Andor, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd he has to understand that home is inside. That he can be home. That home can be there. And therefore there\u2019s a reason to fight.\"",
      "The three final episodes take Andor and the rest of the characters up to the events of \u201cRogue One,\u201d the 2016 film that spawned the streaming prequel series. Tony Gilroy, who wrote \u201cRogue One\u201d and is the show runner for \u201cAndor,\u201d has loved playing in the Star Wars galaxy, but he\u2019s made it clear his real mission is to tell universal stories of the effects of war, revolution and colonization on human (and occasionally non-human) souls.",
      "Nearly every character he\u2019s created is ravaged in one way or another, and even the lighthearted moments of the series are fraught with emotional pain. (Spoilers ahead for episodes 1-9 of Season 2.)",
      "When Andor goes undercover as a moussed-and-mulleted fashion designer named Varian Skye and makes small talk with a hotel staffer, he learns the man's family was killed in a notorious massacre by Grand Moff Tarkin, the imperial leader who would later order the destruction of Leia's world.",
      "And in a widely-memed moment of drunken techno dancing by senator and secret rebel Mon Mothma at her daughter's wedding, she is, as Genevieve O'Reilly who played her said, \"dancing to stop herself from screaming\" after tacitly agreeing to have an old friend murdered for the cause.",
      "No one on \u201cAndor\u201d undergoes more trauma than Bix Caleen, played by Adria Arjona. While still dealing with the fallout of being tortured by an imperial doctor in the first season, she is nearly raped early in the second and has been surrounded by death. Arjona said seeing the script was daunting.",
      "\u201cShe has to go from PTSD to sort of being addicted to droppers, which help her sleep and get over the nightmares, to then her last final decision,\u201d Arjona told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot. And reading it was incredibly scary.\u201d",
      "An utterly new for \u201cStar Wars\u201d set of scenes between Cassian and Bix explore both the explicit and subtle difficulties of intimate relationships amid trauma. Cassian must comfort Bix, but she doesn't want her pain to define her.",
      "The two try to take a trip to the neighborhood bodega, but even that is subsumed by his fear for her.",
      "Cassian and Bix also must deal with the difficulty of the lives they take for the cause.",
      "Han Solo never mourned the stormtroopers he blasted, but the \u201cAndor\u201d duo killed a young imperial soldier during a mission and it haunts the home life they\u2019re trying to build.",

      "What made the robbery extraordinary was not just its high-profile victim but how investigators believe she was targeted. Kardashian had posted real-time updates from her hotel suite. She showed off a 20-carat diamond ring, gifted by her then-husband Kanye West, hours before it was stripped from her hand.",
      "The attackers used no digital trackers or hacking tools. Instead, investigators believe they followed Kardashian\u2019s digital breadcrumbs \u2014 images, timestamps, geotags \u2014 and exploited them with old-school criminal methods.",

Publicists and managers began advising clients to delay posts, remove location tags and think twice before flashing luxury online.",
      "Visibility remained currency, but for some the rules had changed.",
      "Surveillance footage helped French police reconstruct the timeline of the robbery, but the breakthrough came from a trace of DNA left on the plastic ties used to bind Kardashian.",
      "It matched Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, a veteran criminal whose DNA was in the national database. Phone taps and surveillance led police to others, including Yunice Abbas and Didier Dubreucq, known as \u201cYeux bleus.\u201d Most of the accused have long criminal records.",
      "Abbas later claimed he was unaware of Kardashian\u2019s identity during the heist.",
      "But investigators say the men acted with detailed planning and discipline. Prepaid phones were activated the day before the heist and abandoned immediately afterward. But in the end, it wasn\u2019t enough.",
      "Kardashian, once mocked by some of the French press as a reality TV sideshow, is now at the center of a case with deep cultural resonance.",

      "Missouri lawmakers have approved a referendum seeking to repeal an abortion-rights amendment passed by voters six months ago",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Six months after Missouri voters approved an abortion-rights amendment, Republican state lawmakers on Wednesday approved a new referendum that would seek the amendment's repeal and instead ban most abortions with exceptions for rape an incest.",
      "The newly proposed constitutional amendment would go back to voters in November 2026, or sooner, if Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election before then.",
      "Republican senators used a series of rare procedural moves to cut off discussion by opposing Democrats before passing the proposed abortion-rights revision by a 21-11 vote. The measure passed the Republican-led House last month.",
      "Immediately after the vote, protestors erupted with chants of \u201cStop the ban!\u201d and were ushered out of the Senate chamber.",
      "The Senate then blocked further Democratic debate and gave final approval to a separate measure repealing provisions of a voter-approved law guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers and cost-of-living increases to the minimum wage. That measure does not go back to the ballot. It will instead become law when signed by Kehoe, who has expressed his support for it.",
      "After taking the sweeping votes, the Senate effectively ended its annual legislative session \u2014 two days ahead of a constitutional deadline to wrap up work.",
      "Democrats were outraged by the legislative actions and vowed to retaliate by slowing down any Senate work next year.",
      "\u201cOur rights are under attack,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Brian Williams said during debate. He accused Republicans of \u201ctrying to overturn the will of the voters.\u201d",
      "Republicans contend they are simply giving voters a second chance on abortion \u2014 and are confident they will change their minds because of the new rape and incest exceptions.",
      "\u201cAbortion is the greatest tragedy in the world right now,\u201d Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman said while explaining her efforts to repeal the abortion-rights amendment. If someone's fine with \u201ctaking the life of an innocent, then probably you can justify whatever you want.\u201d",
      "Some GOP lawmakers said they needed to repeal the paid sick leave requirement, which kicked in May 1, because it's adding costs that threaten the financial viability of small businesses. Republicans had been negotiating with Democrats over an alternative to exempt only the smallest businesses before scrapping that and opting for the full repeal.",
      "Missouri lawmakers have a history of altering voter-approved policies. They previously tried to block funding for a voter-approved Medicaid expansion and authored changes to voter-approved measures regulating dog breeders and legislative redistricting.",
      "Missouri's abortion policies have swung dramatically in recent years.",
      "When the U.S. Supreme Court ended a nationwide right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, it triggered a Missouri law to take effect banning most abortions. But abortion-rights activists gathered initiative petition signatures to reverse that.",
      "Last November, Missouri voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy. The amendment also allows later abortions to protect the life or health of pregnant women and creates a \u201cfundamental right to reproductive freedom\u201d that includes birth control, prenatal and postpartum care and \u201crespectful birthing conditions.\u201d",
      "A limited number of surgical abortions have since occurred in Missouri, but medication abortions remain on hold while Planned Parenthood wrangles with the state over abortion regulations.",
      "The new measure seeks to repeal the abortion-rights amendment and instead allow abortions only for a medical emergency or fetal anomaly, or in cases of rape or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. It also would prohibit gender transition surgeries, hormone treatments and puberty blockers for minors, which already are barred under state law.",
      "Polling indicates \u201cthat most voters are opposed to most abortions in Missouri but do want to allow for abortions with limited exceptions,\u201d said Sam Lee, director of Campaign Life Missouri.",
      "The ballot title that voters will see doesn't explicitly mention repealing Amendment 3. Instead, it says the new measure would \u201censure women's safety during abortions, ensure parental consent for minors\" and \u201callow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest.\u201d It also states that it will \u201cprotect children from gender transition,\u201d among other provisions.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Tracy McCreery called the measure \u201can attempt to mislead and lie to the voters,\u201d echoing similar accusations that Republicans had made against the original Amendment 3.",
      "An abortion-rights coalition that includes Planned Parenthood affiliates, the American Civil Liberties Union and others planned a rally Thursday at the Missouri Capitol and vowed a vigorous campaign against the measure.",
      "\u201cAbortion rights won in this state six months ago, and mark my words: Missourians will protect reproductive freedom again,\u201d said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes.",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of what are known as forever chemicals in drinking water",
      "On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.",
      "The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.",
      "President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.",
      "Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:",
      "PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation\u2019s air, water and soil.",
      "They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.",
      "The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.",
      "Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable \u2013 resistance to breakdown \u2013 make them hazardous to people.",
      "PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.",
      "There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.",
      "The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.",
      "The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.",
      "It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration\u2019s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.",
      "For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to meet them.",
      "Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can't legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.",
      "\u201cThe law is very clear that the EPA can\u2019t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,\u201d said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.",
      "Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration's underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.",
      "\u201cHowever, EPA\u2019s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,\u201d the industry group said.",
      "Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA's decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.",
      "Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "They did, however, get an extension.",
      "\u201cThis gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,\u201d said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy wanted an assurance from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. before he would vote to put him in charge of the nation's $1.7 trillion health department.",
      "Kennedy's history of promoting conspiracy theories or misspeaking about vaccines alarmed Cassidy, he said during a confirmation hearing earlier this year.",
      "So, the Louisiana senator asked: \"Can I trust that that is now in the past?\"",
      "Kennedy didn't give a direct answer that day. Now three months into the job, however, Kennedy's habit of casting doubts on vaccines has returned in interviews on television shows, public speeches and social media posts.",
      "Kennedy will make his first appearance as health secretary before Cassidy\u2019s powerful Senate health committee on Wednesday, when he's expected to face intense scrutiny about the thousands of job he's eliminated at the Department of Health and Human Services, the steep cuts he's made to vaccination campaigns and his response to a measles outbreak that\u2019s sickened 1,000 people.",
      "He will speak about the agency\u2019s budget request for the year, which includes a $500 million boost for his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative to promote nutrition and healthier lifestyles. The proposed budget also makes deep cuts, including to infectious disease prevention, maternal health and preschool programs.",
      "The secretary plans to \"share his vision on how HHS\u2019 transformation will improve health outcomes, eliminate redundancies to save the American taxpayer, and streamline operations to improve efficiency and service,\u201d HHS said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s supporters, meanwhile, have viewed his first three months in the job as a successful delivery of \u201cMAHA\u201d agenda items: He's pressured food companies to ditch artificial dyes, promised to study the cause of autism, vowed to reverse fluoride recommendations and earned buy-in from several Republican governors to ban soda from the food stamp program, for example.",
      "But many eyes and ears will be on Kennedy's dialogue with Cassidy, who extracted a number of guarantees from Kennedy about his approach to vaccines. Those included promises to keep the current childhood vaccination schedule, use the current vaccine monitoring system and not remove statements that say vaccines do not cause autism on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.",
      "\u201cI will watch carefully for any effort to wrongfully sow public fear about vaccines between confusing references of coincidences and anecdote,\u201d Cassidy said earlier this year, after voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination.",
      "Kennedy has since delivered a mixed message on vaccines that public health experts have said are hampering efforts to contain the measles outbreak. He's offered endorsements of vaccinations but continued to raise questions about their efficacy or safety. He's said the childhood vaccine schedule will be examined in a study of autism's causes. He\u2019s called the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine \u2014 a shot given to children to provide immunity from all three diseases \u2014 \u201cleaky,\u201d although it offers lifetime protection from the measles for most people. He's also said they cause deaths, although none has been documented among healthy people.",
      "At the agency, too, he's made moves that support the anti-vaccine movement. He hired a man who has published research that suggests vaccines cause developmental delays to oversee a study on autism. And he's terminated some research and public health funds dedicated to vaccines.",
      "Kennedy, who has rejected the anti-vaccine label, has regularly said that he is \u201cpro-safety\" and wants more research on vaccines, although decades of real-world use and research have concluded they safely prevent deadly diseases in children.",
      "\u201cHis longstanding advocacy has always focused on ensuring that vaccines, and other medical interventions, meet the highest standards of safety and are supported by gold-standard science,\u201d HHS said in a statement. \u201cAs he did during confirmation, Secretary Kennedy is prepared to address questions surrounding this topic.\u201d",

      "A judge has ordered the restoration of a health monitoring program for coal miners in West Virginia and rescinded layoffs in a unit of a small U.S. health agency",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A judge on Tuesday ordered the restoration of a health monitoring program for coal miners in West Virginia and rescinded layoffs the federal government implemented in a unit of a small U.S. health agency.",
      "U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed against Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services by a coal miner who was diagnosed with a respiratory ailment commonly known as black lung disease.",
      "Nearly 200 workers at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health facility in Morgantown were told last month that their jobs were being terminated as part of restructuring within Health and Human Services. Berger ordered that jobs be restored within NIOSH's respiratory health division in Morgantown, although her ruling didn't specify a number. The division is responsible for screening and reviewing medical exams to determine whether there is evidence that miners have developed black lung.",
      "Federal law mandates that regular health screenings be made available to coal miners. Those diagnosed with black lung also are given the option to transfer to other positions in a mine to protect them from continued dust exposure without a pay reduction.",
      "Berger said the defendants \u201clack the authority to unilaterally cancel\u201d the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program within NIOSH. She ordered both the surveillance and job transfer programs to be restored, saying that \u201cthere be no pause, stoppage or gap in the protections and services\" mandated by the federal Mine Safety and Health Act.",
      "Poisonous silica dust has contributed to the premature deaths of thousands of mine workers from black lung disease. Plaintiff Harry Wiley, a West Virginia mine electrician who has worked in coal mines for 38 years, was diagnosed with early-stage black lung last November.",
      "Canceling the health surveillance program would \"cost lives,\u201d Berger wrote. \u201cRemaining in a dusty job may reduce the years in which Mr. Wiley can walk and breathe unassisted, in addition to hastening his death. It is difficult to imagine a clearer case of irreparable harm.\u201d",
      "The judge gave Kennedy 20 days to show the federal government is complying with her order.",
      "An email seeking comment from Health and Human Services wasn't immediately returned Tuesday night.",
      "Wiley's attorney, Sam Brown Petsonk, said the preliminary injunction \u201chad to happen, and the public, I think, understands the absolute necessity of this program. It cannot be hindered. It cannot be whittled away. It\u2019s essential because it saves the lives of some of he hardest-working people in this entire world.\u201d",
      "NIOSH was created under a 1970 law signed by President Richard Nixon. It started operations the following year and grew to have offices and labs in eight cities, including Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Morgantown, and Spokane, Washington.",

      "DETROIT -- A judge on Tuesday struck down Michigan's 24-hour waiting period before an abortion, saying it conflicts with a voter-approved amendment that locked abortion rights in the state constitution in 2022.",
      "\u201cMichiganders have the fundamental right to reproductive freedom, including the right to abortion care, and the state cannot deny, burden or infringe upon this freedom barring a compelling state interest to protect the health of the individual seeking care,\u201d Judge Sima Patel said.",

      "The judge said a mandatory 24-hour delay \u201cexacerbates the burdens that patients experience seeking abortion care.\"",
      "Patel also overturned a regulation that required abortion providers to provide a fetal development chart and information about alternatives, declaring them \u201ccoercive and stigmatizing.\u201d The judge stopped a requirement that only a physician, not other health professionals, can perform an abortion.",
      "The lawsuit was filed by Northland Family Planning Centers and a group called Medical Students for Choice.",
      "Michigan's attorney general and health director agreed that the challenged regulations were unconstitutional, though state attorneys were assigned to defend them in court.",

      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has signed a bill into law to make Maryland the first state to use money collected from a surcharge on insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act to pay for an abortion grant program",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland will become the first state to use money collected from a surcharge on insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act to fund a program to pay for abortions, regardless of a patient's insurance coverage, under a measure signed into law Tuesday by Democratic Gov. Wes Moore.",
      "The law will make about $25 million available when it takes effect July 1, because a $1 surcharge has been unused and growing over the last 15 years since the ACA took effect in 2010. It's estimated to make about $3 million available annually in future years.",
      "\u201cThe lieutenant governor and I were very clear from Day 1 \u2014 that Maryland will always be a safe haven for abortion access,\u201d Moore said, highlighting the measure among SOME 170 bills signed at a ceremony.",
      "The program will be paid for through the transfer of certain insurance premium funds collected by carriers that can only be used for abortion coverage in accordance with the ACA. Supporters say other states have access to a similar surplus of funds through their state exchange insurance systems.",
      "\u201cIf programs like ours are duplicated across the country, we could help millions of Americans access essential abortion care \u2014 without relying on taxpayer dollars,\u201d said Del. Lesley Lopez, a Democrat from Maryland's Montgomery County, in the suburbs of the nation's capital.",
      "Officials in New York and Illinois already have reached out to Maryland officials to learn more about the program, said Lopez, who sponsored the bill.",
      "A dozen states require abortion coverage in ACA marketplace plans, according to KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. They are California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.",
      "\u201cThis money exists in every state that has abortion as a required type of care under their state\u2019s benefit exchanges,\" Lopez said. \"It\u2019s basically all the blue states that mandated abortion be covered when the Affordable Care Act was starting to be implemented.\u201d",
      "The law creates a grant program fund in the state's health department to improve access to abortion clinical services. It requires the department to award grants to nonprofit organizations to support equitable access.",
      "Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund, which helps pay costs associated with abortion for people who live in Maryland or who travel there, said it\u2019s hard to keep up with an annual budget of about $2 million.",
      "\u201cWe would need many, many more times over that to fully be able to meet the full logistic and medical support for each caller,\u201d she said.",
      "She said the $3 million that would be made available annually under the new law could make a major difference. The fund could apply to administer a share of that money.",
      "\u201cThe $3 million is a great start, but it will take more than that and it will take sustained funding,\u201d she said.",
      "Maryland's legislature is controlled by Democrats, who hold a 2-1 advantage over Republicans in voter registration statewide. Last year, Maryland voters approved a constitutional amendment with 76% support to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution, in response to the 2022 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. The court's decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization gave control over abortion to the states.",
      "\u201cI think before the Dobbs decision, there just wasn\u2019t quite the same type of urgency as there is now,\" Lopez said. \"We\u2019ve seen abortion bans in some form or another in double digits in states across the country, so we\u2019ve got to make sure that we shore up all the support we can in a state like Maryland that has it as a constitutionally protected right.\u201d",
      "Twelve states currently enforce abortion bans with limited exceptions at all stages of pregnancy. Four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The Dobb decision and an influx of people from other states seeking abortions in Maryland has made the financial need more urgent, supporters of the law say.",
      "Maryland has been seeing an increase in patients from other states where abortion has been banned. Last year, 15% of abortions in Maryland were obtained by patients from other states, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. That's a decrease from 20% in 2023.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. health officials say they plan to phase out fluoride-containing supplements used to strengthen children\u2019s teeth, citing possible health risks",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health regulators announced plans Tuesday to phase out fluoride-containing supplements sometimes used to strengthen children\u2019s teeth, opening a new front in Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s effort against a mainstay of dental care.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said it will conduct a scientific review of the products by late October with the aim of removing them from the market. It was not immediately clear whether the agency planned to formally ban the supplements or simply request that companies withdraw them.",
      "The products targeted by the FDA are sometimes recommended for children and teens who are at increased risk of tooth decay or cavities because of low fluoride in their local drinking water. They usually require a prescription from a pediatrician or dentist. Fluoride-based tablets and lozenges are designed to be chewed or swallowed. Companies also sell drops for babies and infants.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the products pose a risk when swallowed by children because they may interfere with healthy gut bacteria that are critical to digestion, immunity and other key bodily functions. He also referenced studies showing possible associations between excess fluoride intake and other problems, including decreased IQ.",
      "Previous reviews by public health experts and dental professionals have not shown any serious health risks with the products.",
      "As state and local governments begin removing fluoride from their water, the need for supplemental fluoride is expected to grow.",
      "Officials in Utah \u2014 the first U.S. state to ban fluoride from drinking water \u2014 recently made fluoride supplements available without a prescription.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1962, the agency set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d tied to a range of health dangers. Last month, he announced a task force to scrutinize fluoride's use, while at the same time saying he would order the CDC to stop recommending it.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program concluded that drinking water with more than twice the CDC\u2019s recommended level was associated with lower IQs in kids. The study was based on research conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico.",
      "\u201cEnding the use of ingestible fluoride is long overdue,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Tuesday. \"This decision brings us one step closer to delivering on President Trump\u2019s promise to Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "An influential government health panel recommends fluoride supplements for children between the ages of six months and 5 years if they live in areas with low fluoridation levels. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Forces judged the recommendation to have \u201chigh certainty\u201d of benefit, based on the available evidence.",
      "A 2010 paper from the American Dental Association recommended supplemental fluoride for children up to 16 years old who are at high risk of cavities. The recommendation was based on a review of studies across different age groups. The most common side effect associated with the products is spotting or discoloration of the teeth, caused by extra fluoride.",
      "The FDA regulates most dental products, including fluoride-containing toothpastes, supplements, mouthwashes and rinses.",
      "In recent weeks those products have increasingly been targeted with lawsuits and legal actions.",
      "Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced an investigation into the marketing of fluoride toothpastes by Colgate-Palmolive and Proctor and Gamble. A press release from his office described the companies' promotions as \u201cmisleading, deceptive and dangerous.\u201d",

It had previously been an issue primarily for mayors and other local officials, but Newsom pumped money into converting old motels into housing and launched other initiatives to tackle the issue.",

      "Newsom\u2019s model ordinance includes prohibitions on \u201cpersistent camping\u201d in one location and encampments blocking sidewalks and other public spaces. It asks cities and counties to provide notice and make every reasonable effort to identify and offer shelter before clearing an encampment.",
      "Organizations representing California's cities and counties balked at the suggestion that they are to blame for street conditions. They say they need dedicated, sustained funding over multiple years for permanent projects instead of sporadic, one-time funding.",
      "Carolyn Coleman, executive director and CEO of the League of California Cities, said that eight in 10 cities have policies to address encampments but they need money to address the root causes of homelessness, such as more housing.",
      "The California State Association of Counties said the state has not provided as much money to address homelessness as it says it has and that half of the money has gone to housing developers.",
      "Studies have shown that encampment bans and other punitive measures make it even harder for people to find stable housing and work, said Alex Visotzky with the National Alliance to End Homelessness.",
      "People may lose critical documents or lose contact with a trusted case manager, forcing them to start all over again.",
      "In Los Angeles, Jay Joshua watches over a small encampment in which he also lives. He says encampments can be a safe space for those living there.",
      "Major cities with Democratic mayors have already started cracking down on encampments, saying they present a public health and safety hazard.",
      "In San Francisco, new mayor Daniel Lurie vowed to clean up city sidewalks. In San Jose, Mayor Matt Mahan has proposed arrests if a person refuses shelter three times.",
      "Newsom can't make cities and counties adopt an encampment ban.",
      "But the proposed encampment legislation was paired with an announcement of $3.3 billion in grant money for facilities to treat mental health and substance abuse disorders, suggesting that he could condition state funding on compliance.",
      "In 2022, he paused $1 billion in state money for local government, saying that their plans to reduce homelessness fell short of the acceptable.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's plan to change the pricing model for some medications is already facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he's even signed the executive order set for Monday that, if implemented, could lower the cost of some drugs.",
      "Trump has promised that his plan \u2014 which is likely to tie the price of medications covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor\u2019s office to the lowest price paid by other countries \u2014 will significantly lower drug costs.",
      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the Republican president posted on social media on Sunday, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "But the nation's leading pharmaceutical lobby on Sunday pushed back, calling it a \u201cbad deal\u201d for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs.",
      "\u201cImporting foreign prices will cut billions of dollars from Medicare with no guarantee that it helps patients or improves their access to medicines,\u201d Stephen J.

      "Trump's so-called \u201cmost favored nation\u201d approach to Medicare drug pricing has been controversial since he first tried to implement it during his first term. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry has argued that Trump\u2019s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \u201cupper hand\u201d in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.",
      "It's likely that Trump's executive order Monday will only impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, the insurance for doctor\u2019s office visits. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor\u2019s visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.",
      "A report by the first Trump administration found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",

      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "But many Americans won't see the savings.",
      "Trump's proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office \u2014 think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring billions of dollars in savings to the government \u2014 not necessarily the \u201cTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u201d Trump boasted about in his post.",

Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both major political parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.",
      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump\u2019s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn\u2019t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced for much of the world.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very big announcement to make \u2014 like as big as it gets,\u201d Trump said last week.",

    "story": [
      "Vaccination teams are part of an effort by health authorities across Mexico to contain the country\u2019s biggest measles outbreak in decades",
      "CUAUHTEMOC, Mexico -- In a rickety white Nissan, nurse Sandra Aguirre and her vaccination team drive past apple orchards and cornfields stretching to the desert horizon. Aguirre goes door to door with a cooler of measles vaccines. In one of Latin America's biggest Mennonite communities, she knows many will decline to be vaccinated or even open their doors. But some will ask questions, and a handful might even agree to get shots on the spot.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out here every single day,\u201d said Aguirre, pausing to call out to an empty farm, checking for residents. \u201cTo gain trust of the Mennonites \u2013 because they\u2019re reserved and closed-off people \u2013 you have to meet them where they\u2019re at, show a friendly face.\u201d",
      "Aguirre's work is part of an effort by health authorities across the country to contain Mexico's biggest measles outbreak in decades, as cases climb not only here but in the U.S. and Canada. In Mexico, cases have been concentrated in the Mennonite community \u2014 long skeptical of vaccines and distrustful of authorities \u2014 in the northern border state of Chihuahua.",
      "Officials say results of their campaign alongside Mennonite leaders have been mixed \u2014 they cite tens of thousands of new vaccinations in Chihuahua, but infections have ballooned and spread past the community to Indigenous and other populations.",
      "Federal officials have documented 922 cases and one death in Chihuahua. Officials, health workers and local leaders say the numbers are likely underestimated, and misinformation about vaccines and endemic distrust of authorities are their biggest obstacles.",
      "Pressed against the fringes of the small northern city of Cuauhtemoc, the Mennonite settlement here spans about 40 kilometers (25 miles). With 23,000 residents, it's one of Cuauhtemoc's primary economic engines, but it's an isolated place where families keep to themselves. Some have turned to social media and anti-vaccine websites for research. Others use little technology but visit family in the United States, where they also hear misinformation \u2014 which then spreads through word of mouth.",
      "Chihuahua is a particularly worrisome place, officials say \u2014 as a border state, the risk that the preventable disease will continue spreading internationally and affect the most vulnerable is high.",
      "\u201cWe have a massive flow of people,\u201d said Alexis Hern\u00e1ndez, a Cuauhtemoc health official. \u201cThat makes things a lot more complicated.\u201d",
      "Mexico considered measles eliminated in 1998. But its vaccination rate against the virus was around 76% as of 2023, according to the World Health Organization \u2014 a dip from previous years and well below the 95% rate experts say is needed to prevent outbreaks.",
      "Mexico\u2019s current outbreak began in March. Officials traced it to an 8-year-old unvaccinated Mennonite boy who visited relatives in Seminole, Texas \u2014 at the center of the U.S. outbreak.",
      "Cases rapidly spread through Chihuahua's 46,000-strong Mennonite community via schools and churches, according to religious and health leaders. From there, they said, it spread to workers in orchards and cheese plants.",
      "Gloria Elizabeth Vega, an Indigenous Raramuri woman and single mother, fell sick in March. Because she's vaccinated, measles didn't occur to her until she broke out in hives. Her supervisor at the cheese factory \u2014 who also caught measles \u2014 told her she had to take 10 days of leave and docked her pay 40% for the week, Vega said.",
      "It's rare for vaccinated people to get measles, but officials say that may account for up to 10% of cases here, though they're milder.",
      "Vega tucked herself away in the back of her two-room home, hoping her daughter and mother \u2014 also vaccinated \u2014 wouldn\u2019t get sick. She wishes people would think of others when considering vaccination.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018Well, I have enough to be fine,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t think about that other person next to them, or wonder if that person has enough to live off of.\u201d",
      "Vaccination isn't required in Mexico. Schools can request vaccination records, federal health department spokesman Carlos Mateos said, but they cannot deny anyone access to education.",
      "In Chihuahua, some schools started reaching out to parents for copies of vaccination cards and encouraging shots, said Rodolfo Cort\u00e9s, state health ministry spokesman.",
      "It's unknown how many in the Mennonite community have gotten the vaccine \u2014 which is safe, with risks lower than those of measles complications.",
      "Gabriella Villegas, head of vaccination at a clinic treating Mennonites with measles, estimated 70% of community members are not vaccinated. Other health authorities estimated the vaccination rate around 50%.",
      "Mennonites who spoke to The Associated Press \u2014 most on condition of anonymity, fearing backlash \u2014 repeatedly cited vaccine misinformation. One man said U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long record of promoting anti-vaccine views and has called vaccination a personal choice, is a hero.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t accept vaccines; it\u2019s that easy. Because that\u2019s where freedom of expression comes in,\u201d said the man, Jacob Goertzen. \"If we can\u2019t make out own decisions, we don\u2019t live in a democracy.\u201d",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, Cuauhtemoc\u2019s health director, said outside influences affect community vaccine views.",
      "\u201cThe Mennonite population has a lot of access to social media and family members in the U.S. and Canada, where there are a lot of myths that have taken hold and many more \u2018anti-vaccine\u2019 groups than we have in Mexico,\u201d he said.",
      "During nurse Aguirre's vaccination drive, one man simply said people here \u201cprefer to cure themselves in their own way.\" A mother described getting sick with measles as a \"privilege\" and spoke of putting her unvaccinated 5- and 7-year-olds in a party so everyone could get sick and recover \u2014 a risky tactic doctors have long denounced.",
      "Mexico's lone death from measles was a 31-year-old Mennonite man in the settlement who had diabetes and high blood pressure, underlying conditions that often complicate sicknesses.",
      "Most people in Indigenous and other communities quickly agreed to vaccinate, officials told AP, but in Mennonite areas crews have to do more vigorous outreach \u2014 the door-to-door visits, follow-up calls and conversations, and involvement of local leaders.",
      "In Cuauhtemoc's settlement, that's leaders like Jacob Dyck Penner. As colony president, he and other leaders closed school for two weeks to slow infections, have made a push to show residents they\u2019re working with health authorities, and are encouraging vaccination.",
      "Leaders translate health information into Low German, the native language of most of the community. Penner and others are assisting vaccination teams, making sure families know how to access health services.",
      "\u201cWe had to find this way, together with doctors, to not pressure people or inspire distrust, so they can take their time and make their own decision to accept (being vaccinated),\u201d Penner said.",
      "Medics report more people visiting clinics, seeking vaccines for measles and other diseases. Still, Penner said, there a swath of people will always reject vaccinations.",
      "Health officials like Hern\u00e1ndez say they're concerned in particular for vulnerable populations including Indigenous groups, many of whom have fewer resources to cope.",
      "Vega, the single mother who got measles, said her job at the cheese factory was once a blessing, providing health insurance and steady pay.",
      "But the forced leave and docked pay left her reeling. She said she's living paycheck to paycheck and wonders how she'll pay the bills \u2014 her daughter's school supplies, lunches, tennis shoes.",
      "\u201cI have a daughter to keep afloat,\" she said. \"It\u2019s not like I have the option to wait and pay for things, for food.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- The superyacht of British tech magnate Mike Lynch, which capsized last August off the coast of Sicily at the cost of seven lives, was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and could not recover, British investigators said Thursday.",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the 56-meter (184 feet) Bayesian sank Aug. 19 last year. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch's acquittal in a fraud case in the U.S. in June.",
      "In an interim report on the disaster, Britain's Marine Accident Investigation Branch said the boat was \u201cvulnerable\u201d to winds that were even lighter than the ones that tipped it over. The report was based on \u201ca limited amount of verified evidence\u201d as a criminal investigation by Italian authorities has restricted its access to the wreck and other pieces of evidence, it said.",
      "The agency, which is investigating the disaster because the Bayesian was registered in the U.K, said the \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d were \u201cunknown to either the owner or the crew,\u201d as they were not included in the stability information book carried on board.",
      "The report stated that the Bayesian was sailed to the site where it sank the day before in order to \u201cshelter\u201d from forecast thunderstorms. It said the disaster occurred at 4:06 a.m. local time, when wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.), \u201cviolently\u201d knocking the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds,",
      "It said that at the time of the incident, the vessel was in a \u201cmotoring condition\u201d with its sails lowered, while the centerboard, which is used to help stabilize it, was in a \u201craised\u201d position.",
      "\u201cYou have the wind pushing the vessel over and then you have the stability of the vessel trying to push the vessel back up right again,\" said Simon Graves, an MAIB investigator. \u201cAnd what our studies found was that they show that the Bayesian may have been vulnerable to high winds and that these winds were likely to have been evident at the time of the accident.\u201d",
      "Inquest proceedings in the U.K. are looking at the deaths of Lynch and his daughter, as well as Morgan Stanley International bank chairman Jonathan Bloomer, 70, and his wife, Judy Bloomer, 71, who were all British nationals.",
      "The others who died in the sinking were U.S. lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife Neda Morvillo, and Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, who was working as a chef on the vessel.",
      "Fifteen people, including Lynch\u2019s wife, Angela Bacares, were rescued.",
      "A project to move the Bayesian into an upright position and lift it to the surface has been paused since May 9 when a diver died during underwater work. Recovery work is set to resume from Thursday.",
      "Further details such as \u201cescape routes\u201d will be included in the final report, according to Graves.",

      "Officials say Japan\u2019s air force has begun emergency safety inspections on all of its nearly 200 military training aircraft after one of them crashed minutes after takeoff",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's air force has begun emergency safety inspections on all of its nearly 200 military training aircraft after one of the planes crashed minutes after takeoff, officials said Thursday.",
      "The T-4 training aircraft, operated by the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, or JASDF, and carrying two service members, crashed into a reservoir Wednesday, minutes after taking off from Komaki Air Base in the central Japanese prefecture of Aichi.",
      "While the search operation for the missing aircraft and the two crew members continued Thursday, the military announced that it had started emergency inspections on all remaining 196 of the training planes deployed at JASDF bases across the country.",
      "Their operation has been suspended since the crash and they will remain grounded until the cause is identified and safety checks are completed, Hiroaki Uchikura, the air force chief of staff, told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "The crash is the latest in a series of defense aircraft accidents in recent years and comes at a time when Japan is accelerating a military buildup to deter China's influence in the region and double its defense spending, raising concern that funding for weapons may be prioritized over safety measures.",
      "The crashed plane was a 36-year-old T-4 operated out of Nyutabaru Air Base, in the southern prefecture of Miyazaki. It wasn't fitted with a voice recorder or a flight data recorder, a setback for the investigation.",
      "Defense Minister Gen Nakatani on Thursday announced plans to promptly fit the training aircraft with voice and flight data recording equipment.",
      "The JASDF said Thursday the plane experienced trouble when it reached an altitude of 4,000 feet (1,200 meters) about one minute after takeoff. Kyodo News agency said that air traffic control didn't receive any contact from the T-4 aircraft about an emergency.",
      "The force said the plane was lost from radar two minutes after departure and crashed into a reservoir called the Iruka pond, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) northeast of the air base.",
      "Witnesses told the NHK national broadcaster that they heard a loud noise like thunder at the time of the crash.",
      "Debris believed to be of the aircraft, as well as lifesaving equipment and helmets of the crew were found near the reservoir.",

      "LONDON -- The British economy grew at its fastest rate in a year during the first quarter of 2025, official figures showed Thursday, in a welcome boost to the Labour government, which has made lifting the country's growth its top priority.",
      "The Office for National Statistics said growth, as measured by gross domestic product, increased by 0.7% in the first quarter of the year from the final three months of 2024, with the country's dominant services sector doing particularly well.",
      "The first quarter increase makes the British economy the fastest-growing among the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.",
      "Growth was modestly ahead of market expectations for a 0.6% increase. It was also the biggest increase since the first quarter of 2024, when the economy expanded by 0.9%.",
      "Treasury chief Rachel Reeves welcomed the growth leap, and said the figures showed the choices made by Labour since it was elected last July were beginning to pay off.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re set to be the fastest growing economy in the G-7 in the first three months of this year and that\u2019s incredibly welcome, but I know that there is more to do,\" she said while on a visit to a Rolls-Royce factory in Derby, northern England.",
      "Most economists think is likely to slow down in the second quarter of the year, partly because of the global uncertainty generated by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies.",
      "Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10% baseline tariff applied to U.K. goods entering the U.S., the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain, particularly if the U.S.-China trade war persists.",
      "Some of that uncertainty, with regard to the British economy, lifted Thursday when both Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer separately outlined details of a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. Though Trump kept the 10% baseline tariffs on U.K., he agreed to reduce the levies on British autos, steel and aluminum.",
      "Sanjay Raja, chief U.K. economist at Deutsche Bank, said the growth uptick will likely be short-lived, especially during the second quarter when trade uncertainty will be at its peak.",
      "\u201cExporters will likely see reduced demand as well from higher U.S. tariffs and weaker global demand,\u201d he said.",
      "Economists said growth will likely falter in the second quarter as new taxes on business were imposed in April. Also a raft of price rises during the month, including domestic energy and water bills, are expected to keep a lid on consumer demand.",

      "The twisting path, intended to represent migrants' unexpected journeys, stands on the Fenix museum, the newest attraction on Rotterdam's waterfront.",

      "As the museum's construction continued last year, the hard-right Dutch government announced unprecedented measures aimed at reining in migration, including a reintroduction of border checks. It shattered a long-held image of the Netherlands as a nation that welcomed new arrivals.",
      "The museum's viewing platform looks out across Rotterdam, whose 650,000 inhabitants represent over 170 nationalities. The city is the largest port in Europe.",
      "Many of those departing Rotterdam in the early part of the 20th century made the trans-Atlantic journey on the Holland America Line, a shipping company founded by the Van der Vorm family in 1873. The family has been the primary financial backer for the Fenix project, via Dutch art foundation Droom en Daad (Dream and Action).",
      "Art can sometimes provide a better basis for discussion of politically loaded topics like migration, said Cathrine Bublatzky, an anthropologist who studies the intersection of art and migration.",

      "When Law and Justice held power, it repeatedly clashed with EU institutions over judicial independence, media freedom and migration.",
      "While Poland is a parliamentary democracy, the presidency wields significant influence. The president serves as commander-in-chief, holds veto power, shapes foreign policy and plays a symbolic role in national discourse.",
      "Under Duda, the office largely advanced the conservative agenda of Law and Justice. Since Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s centrist coalition came to power in late 2023, Duda has blocked key reforms aimed at restoring judicial independence and repairing relations with the EU.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are enormous for the ruling coalition and for those concerned with the future of Polish democracy,\u201d said Jacek Kucharczyk, president of the Institute of Public Affairs, a Warsaw think tank. \u201cThis is about democratic reform and restoring the rule of law \u2014 and that can only happen with cooperation from the next president.\u201d",
      "The election is also pivotal for Law and Justice, Kucharczyk noted: \u201cIts future as a dominant political force may hinge on the outcome.\u201d",
      "Both Trzaskowski and Nawrocki have pledged to support Ukraine and maintain strong defense ties, but their visions for Poland diverge sharply on the role of the EU and domestic social policy.",
      "Trzaskowski, 52, is a former presidential contender and a senior figure in Civic Platform, the centrist party led by Tusk. He is running on a pro-European platform and has pledged to defend judicial independence and rebuild democratic institutions.",
      "Supporters describe him as a modernizer who represents a cosmopolitan, outward-facing Poland. He speaks foreign languages, has marched in LGBTQ+ parades and appeals to younger, urban voters. Trzaskowski's progressive views highlight an evolution of the once more conservative Civic Platform.",
      "Nawrocki, 42, represents how the party backing him, Law and Justice, is turning further to the right as support for the hard right surges.",
      "Nawrocki, who is not a Law and Justice party member, heads the state-backed Institute of National Remembrance, which investigates Nazi and communist-era crimes. He has drawn praise from conservatives for dismantling Soviet monuments and promoting patriotic education, but he faces criticism for inexperience and playing on anti-German and other resentments. He has also been embroiled in some scandals.",
      "Earlier this month, Nawrocki met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House \u2014 a symbolic moment welcomed by Law and Justice-friendly media as proof that he would be the best man for keeping the relationship with the United States strong. Critics viewed it as interference by Trump's administration.",
      "This week Nawrocki was joined on the campaign trail by Romanian nationalist George Simion, who faces a runoff vote for the presidency on Sunday. Simion is viewed by critics as pro-Russian, leading Tusk to tweet: \"Russia is pleased. Nawrocki and his pro-Russian Romanian counterpart George Simion on the same stage five days before the presidential elections in Poland and Romania. Everything is clear.\u201c",

      "Before becoming Pope Leo XIV, Cardinal Robert Prevost presided over one of the most revolutionary reforms of Pope Francis\u2019 pontificate by having women serve on the Vatican board that vets nominations for bishops",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Before becoming Pope Leo XIV, Cardinal Robert Prevost presided over one of the most revolutionary reforms of Pope Francis' pontificate by having women serve on the Vatican board that vets nominations for bishops.",
      "But he also has said decisively that women cannot be ordained as priests, and despite having worked for years in Peru where women often lead church communities, seems noncommittal on whether women could ever serve in any ministerial capacity.",
      "Nevertheless, the women who have worked closely with Prevost in recent years have praised his leadership style, ability to listen and respect for their opinions. In interviews with The Associated Press, they say they expect that as pope, Leo will continue to promote women in church governance positions, albeit with limits.",
      "Maria Lia Zervino was among the three women Francis appointe d to the Dicastery for Bishops in 2022 to review possible appointments. It was a job previously held by cardinals and bishops, an old boy\u2019s club that has jealously guarded the secret process behind the appointment of bishops.",
      "Zervino rejoiced when Prevost was elected pope, saying the respect he showed for her and other women on the board and their opinions gave them faith in him as a leader.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m convinced that he doesn\u2019t need to learn how to work (with women), how to let them speak, to listen to them, to have them participate in decisions, because that\u2019s what he does anyway,\u201d said Zervino, the Argentine former head of the World Union of Catholic Women\u2019s Organizations.",
      "Zervino said she expected Leo would continue Francis' reform processes, albeit in his own style.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a simple man, serene, always with that smile that we saw that seems to come from an interior peace,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cSo when you see someone who is balanced, peaceful and respectful and who welcomes what you say and is always ready to hear the other, you have faith in him.\u201d",
      "At a 2023 gathering of bishops on the future of the Catholic Church, Prevost was asked at a news conference about women in church leadership positions. He said it was \u201ca work in progress\u201d and that there would be a \u201ccontinuing recognition of the fact that women can add a great deal to the life of the church on many different levels.\u201d",
      "But he drew some very clear lines.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re all familiar with the very significant and long tradition of the church, and that the apostolic tradition is something that has been spelled out very clearly, especially if you want to talk about the question of women\u2019s ordination to the priesthood,\u201d he said in the Oct. 25, 2023, briefing.",
      "Catholic women do much of the church\u2019s work in schools and hospitals and are usually responsible for passing the faith to the next generation. But they have long complained of second-class status in an institution that reserves the priesthood for men.",
      "Prevost acknowledged Francis had created two commissions to study whether women could be made deacons, who perform many of the same functions as priests. While he said the issue was still open, he warned that turning women into clerics \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily solve a problem, it might make a new problem.\u201d",
      "Just because a woman in society can be president doesn't mean there's an \u201cimmediate parallel\u201d in the church, he argued.",
      "\u201cIt isn\u2019t as simple as saying that at this stage we\u2019re going to change, if you will, the tradition of the church after 2,000 years on any one of those points,\u201d he said.",
      "Deacons are ordained ministers who preside at weddings, baptisms and funerals. They can preach but cannot celebrate Mass. Married men can be ordained as deacons while women cannot, although historians say women served as deacons in the early Christian church.",
      "Karlijn Demasure, emeritus professor of practical theology at St. Paul University in Ottawa, served on a Vatican commission with Prevost proposing reforms to the authority of bishops and how they are selected. She said Prevost was absolutely convinced of the need to involve lay people and nuns in the selection of bishops, at least at an initial level.",
      "\u201cHe listens well,\u201d Demasure said. \u201cHe hears what has been said, and if he doesn\u2019t agree, he says it but in a nice way: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t say it like this, or I wouldn\u2019t do it like that.\u2019\u201d",
      "She said Prevost was quiet, \u201cprudent and private.\u201d She wonders, though, what will happen with the work of the commission, one of 10 groups that are studying particularly thorny questions, such as the role of women, and were due to report back to the pope by July.",
      "Sister Nathalie Becquart, one of the highest-ranking women at the Vatican, worked with Prevost during Francis\u2019 meeting, known as a synod, on the future of the church. She also happens to be his neighbor, living in the same Palazzo Sant\u2019Uffizio inside the Vatican gates, and was among the well-wishers who greeted Leo when he came home the night of his May 8 election.",
      "Becquart posted a joyous selfie with the pope in the courtyard in one of the first private moments after his election. \u201cI had time to greet him, not just as a neighbor,\" she said.",
      "Becquart recalled that she had been at a conference of the 900 nuns who run the world's female religious orders when the white smoke came out of the Sistine Chapel chimney. It didn't bother her that the nuns had no vote in the conclave, since the cardinals \u201ccould see that the church is the people of God.\u201d",
      "\"Synodality is about feeling we are from the same body, we are interdependent, we have a deep inner connection, and for me that was a deep spiritual experience I could never imagine before,\u201d she said.",
      "Also during the conclave, advocates for women\u2019s ordination set off pink smoke flares over the Vatican to protest their exclusion from the priesthood and the election process.",
      "\u201cThe discrimination and exclusion of women is a sin, and we\u2019re here to say the next pope will inherit this question and needs to work quickly to correct it,\u201d said Kate McElwee, executive director of the Women\u2019s Ordination Conference.",
      "Hofstra University researcher Phyllis Zagano, who was on Francis\u2019 first Vatican commission on women deacons, remains optimistic. She pointed to Prevost\u2019s acknowledgement that the deacon issue was still open and that he ministered in Peru, a region that has pushed for years for the church to recognize women as ministerial deacons to help offset the priest shortage.",
      "In a column for Religion News Service, Zagano noted that a recent proposal for a new Amazonian liturgical rite, published last month by the Amazonian bishops conference, contained explicit recommendations for women to be ordained as deacons. When Francis in 2020 considered official requests from Amazonian bishops for female deacons, he dodged the issue.",
      "\u201cWomen deserve the ordained diaconal ministry of women,\u201d she said in an interview.",

      "\u201cWe continue to advocate for Dr. Yang\u2019s interests and wellbeing at every opportunity and I have certainly asked our ambassador to convey that very directly to Dr. Yang,\u201d Albanese added.",

      "\u201cI feel all of your support beside me as I stagger through the hardest and darkest chapter of my life, allowing me to immerse in the warmth of humanity,\u201d Yang wrote.",

      "Yang expected he would one day sit side by side with his readers \u201csharing laughter, tears and dreams.\u201d",
      "\u201cDear Prime Minister Albanese, words are now failing me. Tears blur my vision. I can only use a silent voice to thank you and all the people who care for and love me,\u201d Yang wrote.",

      "Some non-governmental organizations have stopped working with the ICC and the leaders of one won\u2019t even reply to emails from court officials.",
      "Those are just some of the hurdles facing court staff since U.S. President Donald Trump in February slapped sanctions on its chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, according to interviews with current and former ICC officials, international lawyers and human rights advocates.",
      "The sanctions will \"prevent victims from getting access to justice,\u201d said Liz Evenson, international justice director at Human Rights Watch.",
      "Trump sanctioned the court after a panel of ICC judges in November issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant.",

      "Staffers and allies of the ICC said the sanctions have made it increasingly difficult for the tribunal to conduct basic tasks, let alone seek justice for victims of war crimes or genocide.",
      "A spokesperson for the ICC and for Khan declined to comment. In February, ICC President Judge Tomoko Akane said that the sanctions \u201cconstitute serious attacks against the Court\u2019s States Parties, the rule of law based international order and millions of victims.\u201d",
      "The February order bans Khan and other non-Americans among the ICC\u2019s 900 staff members from entering the United States. It also threatens any person, institution or company with fines and prison time if they provide Khan with \u201cfinancial, material, or technological support.\u201d",
      "The sanctions are hampering work on a broad array of investigations, not just the one into Israel's leaders.",
      "The ICC, for example, had been investigating atrocities in Sudan and had issued arrest warrants for former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir on charges that include genocide. That probe has ground to a halt even as reports mount of new atrocities in Sudan, according to an attorney representing an ICC prosecutor who is fighting the sanctions in U.S. courts. The prosecutor, Eric Iverson, filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking protection from the sanctions.",

      "American staffers at the organization, like Iverson, have been warned by its attorneys that they risk arrest if they return home to visit family, according to ICC officials. Six senior officials have left the court over concerns about sanctions",
      "One reason the the court has been hamstrung is that it relies heavily on contractors and non-governmental organizations. Those businesses and groups have curtailed work on behalf of the court because they were concerned about being targeted by U.S. authorities, according to current and former ICC staffers.",
      "Microsoft, for example, cancelled the Khan\u2019s email address, forcing the prosecutor to move to Proton Mail, a Swiss email provider, ICC staffers said. His bank accounts in his home country\u202fof the United Kingdom have been blocked.",

      "Staffers at a non-governmental organization that plays an integral role in the court\u2019s efforts to gather evidence and find witnesses said the group has transferred money out of U.S. bank accounts because they fear it might be seized by the Trump administration.",

      "Said one such official: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how the court makes it through the next four years.\"",

      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Netanyahu has dismissed the ICC's allegations as \u201cabsurd,\u201d and Israel\u2019s Knesset is considering legislation that would make providing evidence to the court a crime.",

      "Inside the court, staffers have been coping with dark humor, joking about how they cannot even loan Khan a pen or risk appearing on the U.S. radar.",
      "This is not the first time the ICC has drawn Trump\u2019s ire. In 2020, the former Trump administration sanctioned Khan\u2019s predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, and one of her deputies over the court\u2019s investigation into alleged crimes committed in Afghanistan while the United States military was operating in the country.",
      "President Joe Biden rescinded the sanctions when he took office several months later.",

Earlier this week Iverson, the lawyer investigating genocide in Sudan, won temporary protection from prosecution but if other U.S. citizens at the court want a similar assurance, they would have to bring their own complaint.",
      "Meanwhile, the court is facing an increasing lack of cooperation from countries normally considered to be its staunchest supporters.",
      "The ICC has no enforcement apparatus of its own and relies on member states. In the last year, three countries \u2013 including two in the European Union \u2013 have refused to execute warrants issued by the court.",

Last year, just weeks before Khan announced he was requesting arrest warrants for the Israeli officials, two court staff reported the British barrister had harassed a female aide, according to reporting by the Associated Press.",
      "Khan has categorically denied the accusations that he groped and tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship. A United Nations investigation is underway, and Khan has since been accused of retaliating against staff who supported the woman, including demoting several people he felt were critical of him.",

      "Trump plans to address troops at Qatar\u2019s al-Udeid Air Base, which was a major staging ground during the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and supported the recent U.S. air campaign against Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthis. The president has held up Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia and Qatar as models for economic development in a region plagued by conflict as he works to entice Iran to come to terms with his administration on a deal to curb its nuclear program.",
      "Before addressing the troops, Trump will take part in a roundtable with business leaders. The group includes top executives from Boeing, GE Aerospace and Al Rabban Capital.",
      "Later Thursday, he will travel to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates for the final leg of his Mideast tour. He will visit the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque and be honored with a state visit with UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at the Qasr Al Watan palace.",
      "Trump has also used his trip to announce plans to recognize the government of Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa and to ease sanctions on the war-torn country. The U.S. has deployed more than 1,000 troops in Syria for years to suppress a return of the Islamic State group.",
      "Trump heaped praise on al-Sharaa \u2014 who was tied to al-Qaida and joined insurgents battling U.S. forces in Iraq before entering the Syrian civil war \u2014 after the two met in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. The president called al-Sharaa a \u201cyoung, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter.\u201d",
      "It was a stark contrast from earlier years, when Al-Sharaa was imprisoned by U.S. troops in Iraq. Until December, there was a $10 million U.S. bounty for his arrest.",
      "Trump, speaking in Saudi Arabia on his first day in the region, told Gulf leaders, \u201cIt\u2019s really incredible what you\u2019ve done. In the end, the so-called nation builders wrecked far more nations than they built, and the \u2018interventionalists\u2019 were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves.\u201d",

      "The gas-rich Gulf country has spent some $8 billion over two decades in developing the base, built on a flat stretch of desert about 20 miles (30 kilometers) southwest of Qatar\u2019s capital, Doha. The base was once considered so sensitive that American military officers would say only that it was somewhere \u201cin southwest Asia.\u201d",
      "Trump said he and the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, would also see a demonstration of American air capability, as the U.S. leader looks to boost defense exports to the region.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re buying a lot of that equipment actually,\u201d Trump said Wednesday when he and Sheikh Tamim signed a series of bilateral and business agreements between the two countries. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019re going to see some of it in action tomorrow at the \u2014 we won\u2019t call it an air fair, but its going to be sort of an air fair.

      "Among the agreements the two leaders signed on Wednesday was a document clearing the way for Qatar to purchase American-made MQ-9B drones \u2014 the export version of the Reaper.",
      "Trump told al-Sharaa that he wanted the new government to take control of prisons in Syria holding Islamic State fighters and their family members, who are currently guarded by U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters.

      "Albanese arrived in the capital, Jakarta, on Wednesday evening, a day after his new government was sworn in, to promote the importance of building stronger ties with Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy.",
      "\u201cThat is \u2026 a signal to our region of the importance that we place on this region. We will be in the fastest growing region of the world in human history,\u201d Albanese said in an interview last week with the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "He described Subianto as a \u201cgood friend of mine\" and hailed the two countries' close relations.",
      "Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor Party won a second three-year term in an emphatic election victory May 3.",
      "He was welcomed by Subianto in a ceremony at Merdeka Palace in Jakarta where he was escorted by dozens of motorized troops and cavalry while about 3,200 schoolchildren waved the flags of both countries along the streets, according to Indonesia's presidential office.",
      "The two leaders' talks are expected to \u201cproduce several concrete agreements that could bring direct benefits to the people of both countries,\" the office said.",
      "Albanese\u2019s two-day visit is an indication of the countries' strategic closeness. Their discussions will also include food security, energy, trade and other bilateral priorities, Indonesia's Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement.",
      "Newly elected Australian prime ministers typically make their first bilateral visit to Asia, usually Indonesia.",
      "In his first visit to Indonesia after his inauguration in 2022, Albanese also visited Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi province with close ties to Indigenous Australians.",
      "Albanese\u2019s second visit to Jakarta comes amid global economic upheaval sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's \u201creciprocal tariff\u201d trade policy.",
      "Australia was hit during its election campaign with a global-minimum 10% tariff on exports to the U.S. despite trading with its bilateral free trade partner at a deficit for decades, while Indonesia is subject to 32%. The two countries have for the past month negotiated with Washington for a better trade deal.",
      "Media reports said last month that Russia told Jakarta it wants to base long-range warplanes in Papua, the most eastern Indonesian province, a plan that was raised as a security issue during the Australian election campaign. Indonesia has told Australia that no such Russian base would be allowed.",
      "Given their geographical proximity, Indonesia and Australia have traditionally maintained close ties with each other, including in matters of security and defense, despite the fact that each country has chosen to respond differently to the rivalry between the U.S. and China in the region.",
      "The two neighbors last year signed a historic Defense Cooperation Agreement that will allow more complex joint activities and exercises. Canberra hailed the agreement as the \u201cdeepest and most significant\u201d defense deal in the two countries\u2019 bilateral ties.",
      "Albanese will head on to Rome on Friday morning to attend the inauguration of Pope Leo XIV on Sunday.",

      "Argentina\u2019s right-wing President Javier Milei has issued a decree curbing immigration to the South American nation, a move coinciding with the immigration restrictions put in place by the Trump administration",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentina's right-wing President Javier Milei issued a decree on Wednesday curbing immigration to the South American nation, a move coinciding with the immigration restrictions put in place by the Trump administration.",
      "Milei's abrupt measures and declaration that newcomers were bringing \u201cchaos and abuse\u201d to Argentina \u2014 a country built by millions of immigrants that has long prided itself on its openness \u2014 drew criticism from his political opponents and prompted comparisons to U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Milei's government welcomed those comparisons to its close American ally, with presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni saying it was \u201ctime to honor our history and make Argentina great again.\"",
      "Wednesday's executive order tightens restrictions on citizenship, requiring immigrants to spend two uninterrupted years in Argentina or make a significant financial investment in the country to secure an Argentine passport.",
      "Immigrants seeking permanent residency must show proof of income or \u201csufficient means\u201d and have clean criminal records in their home countries.",
      "The decree makes it much easier for the government to deport migrants who enter the country illegally, falsify their immigration documents or commit minor crimes in Argentina. Previously, authorities could only expel or deny entry to a foreigner with a conviction of more than three years.",
      "It also asks the judiciary to fast-track otherwise lengthy immigration court proceedings.",
      "\u201cFor some time now, we\u2019ve had regulations that invite chaos and abuse by many opportunists who are far from coming to this country in an honest way,\u201d Adorni told reporters.",
      "The presidential spokesperson is also the top candidate for Milei\u2019s La Libertad Avanza party in the key Buenos Aires legislative elections on Sunday. Their hard-right bloc is trying to win over conservative voters from Argentina's center-right in the high-stakes midterm-election year.",
      "That timing fueled criticism, especially as the country has seen no recent surge of migration.",
      "Argentina's most recent national census, from 2022, showed that the nation of 46 million had just 1.93 million foreign residents \u2014 the lowest share of immigrants since record-keeping began in 1869.",
      "\u201cOnce again, politicizing migration for electoral purposes and distorting reality,\u201d Pablo Ceriani Cernadas, vice president of a U.N. committee that protects the rights of migrants, wrote on social media.",
      "In a big shift, the new decree also charges foreigners to access Argentina's public health care and education while mandating that all travelers to the country hold health insurance. Adorni claimed that public hospitals had spent some $100 million on treating foreigners last year, without offering evidence.",
      "\u201cThis measure aims to guarantee the sustainability of the public health system, so that it ceases to be a profit center financed by our citizens,\u201d he said.",
      "Despite bouts of xenophobia in moments of political turmoil, immigration is rarely a matter of debate in Argentina, a nation largely developed by waves of European immigrants in the 19th century. In more recent years the country has welcomed foreigners across the region, the Arab world, Asia and, lately, Russia, offering newcomers a path to citizenship and ensuring their free access the nation's extensive and decent public education and health systems.",
      "Public universities and hospitals are now buckling under Milei's sharp spending cuts as he seeks to reverse years of massive budget deficits. Adorni said the decree allows universities to introduce fees for foreign students.",
      "Right-wing politicians long have railed against what Adorni described Wednesday as \u201chealth tours,\u201d in which patients hop over the border and get treatment before returning home.",
      "Already, several northern provinces and the city of Buenos Aires have started charging non-resident foreigners to access health care.",

      "But the fish and other resources have been dwindling.",
      "\u201cNowadays, the rains come late, affecting our farming, leading to a decrease in production,\u201d said Sunita Muduli, a Paraja tribeswoman from Putpondi village. She stood on freshly tilled fields that would be sown again with millet before the increasingly unpredictable monsoon rains.",
      "The Indigenous Adivasis have lived in these villages for millennia. They continue traditional practices of farming millet and rice and foraging leaves and fruit from the forest to make plates, the local brew and more.",
      "With those practices under pressure from a changing climate, they are making their most significant effort yet to speak up for their community's needs, advocating for Indian authorities to protect and restore their lands as the nation of more than 1.4 billion people tries to adapt to a warming world.",
      "Women are leading the way. Muduli and others from 10 villages, with help from a local nongovernmental organization, have surveyed and mapped out resources that are dwindling and what needs restoring.",
      "Comparing state government data from the 1960s with their results, they found that common areas in many of their villages had shrunk by up to 25%.",
      "The women have created what are known as dream maps, showing their villages in their ideal states. The most prominent of their bright colors is green.",
      "Muduli and others plan to submit their maps and surveys to local government officials, the first step in requesting village development funds to preserve or restore their common areas. The women estimate that $2 million might be needed \u2014 an ambitious ask when India's poorer regions often struggle to secure and implement government projects.",
      "Still, the women believe they have a 50-50 chance of success.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure these resources are available for our children,\u201d Muduli said.",
      "This is the first time that many of the women are formally leading an outward-facing community effort. They say it's giving them more confidence in speaking up about community needs.",
      "\u201cOur forest contains an abundance of diverse resources. Unfortunately, rainfall has reduced, temperatures have risen and our forest cover has dwindled. However, once we acquire the rights we deserve, our priority will be to revitalize and flourish our forest,\" said Saita Dhangada Majhi of Pangan Pani village.",
      "They seek rights over their common lands that will require outsiders, including authorities, to seek villagers' permission to make any changes to them.",
      "India is among the world's most vulnerable countries to climate impacts. According to the 2025 Climate Risk Index, the country between 1993 and 2022 was subject to 400 extreme events \u2014 including floods, heat waves and cyclones \u2014 causing 80,000 deaths and economic losses nearing $180 billion.",
      "Odisha is one of India's poorest states and among the most vulnerable to climate impacts. A study by researchers from Odisha's Fakir Mohan University published in 2023 found that food production there had decreased by 40% in the last 50 years due to climate change.",
      "Most Indian farmers rely on rain-fed agriculture, with about half of all farmed land dependent on downpours. As the monsoons become more unpredictable, livelihoods are affected.",
      "India's Indigenous people feel those impacts the most as their traditions depend greatly on forests and natural produce, said Bidyut Bidyut Mohanty of the Odisha-based nonprofit Society for Promotion of Rural Education and Development. The organization helped the Odisha villages with the dream mapping process.",
      "Climate change is affecting \u201ctheir very existence,\u201d Mohanty said, asserting that they have not contributed to the problem but are paying the price.",
      "The forest commons are \u201cnot only considered the lungs but are also a hidden kitchen for Indigenous communities,\u201d he said.",
      "The women's survey found that resources available a decade earlier had either dwindled or disappeared. In Muduli's village, the number of fruits such as mango, guava, java plum and Indian gooseberry had dropped drastically. Resources used to make traditional instruments and other items had become more rare.",
      "Climate experts said the Odisha project can be a model to be replicated across India and other nations. United Nations reports have said 80% of the world's biodiversity lies in regions controlled by Indigenous peoples.",
      "Women from marginalized and vulnerable communities are affected the most by climate change, and the Indigenous women of Odisha are an inspiration, said Neha Saigal, a gender and climate expert at Bengaluru-based Asar Social Impact Advisors who is familiar with the mapping project.",
      "\u201cThey are actually leading from the front,\u201d she said.",

      "ANTALYA, Turkey -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his NATO counterparts meet in Turkey on Thursday to prepare a pivotal summit of alliance leaders next month that will set the course for future European security as America focuses on challenges elsewhere.",
      "The meeting in the Mediterranean coastal city of Antalya comes amid a flurry of negotiations aimed at producing a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine, including talks in Istanbul that Rubio and President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff plan to attend Friday. Rubio and Witkoff are coming to Turkey after accompanying Trump on portions of his trip to Gulf Arab countries.",
      "On the sidelines of the NATO meeting, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met Wednesday with Rubio, who also is having separate talks with new German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan of Turkey, whose country is trying to help broker a deal that might end the more than three-year-old war.",
      "Sybiha and Fidan on Wednesday discussed efforts to establish a ceasefire and steps toward securing a lasting peace with Russia, according to the Turkish foreign ministry.",
      "The same day that NATO foreign ministers gather, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara. It's an open question whether Trump or Russian President Vladimir Putin will participate Thursday.",

      "\u201cHe\u2019d like me to be there, and that\u2019s a possibility,\u201d Trump said, referring to Putin. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he would be there if I\u2019m not there. We\u2019re going to find out.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy has been pushing for direct talks with Russia but only if Putin attends. Putin, who has rebuffed previous such calls, has been coy and has not committed to a meeting.",
      "The Kremlin on Wednesday said Putin\u2019s aide, Vladimir Medinsky, will head the Russian delegation, which also will include Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin, Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin and Igor Kostyukov, chief of the General Staff\u2019s main directorate. The list did not include Putin himself.",
      "Zelenskyy also remains keen on Ukraine joining NATO, which Russia has adamantly rejected and Trump appears to have agreed with. So even with a Ukrainian presence in Antalya, it appeared unlikely there would be any decisions made about Ukraine's future, or lack thereof, in the military alliance.",
      "Of greater concern to the U.S. is money, with the Trump administration saying it wants to hear how European members of NATO and Canada plan to boost their national defense investments to 5% of gross domestic product.",
      "In 2023, as Russia\u2019s full-scale war on Ukraine entered its second year, NATO leaders agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP on national defense budgets. So far, 22 of the 32 member countries have done so.",
      "The leaders will set a new goal at a summit in The Hague on June 25. Trump insists that U.S. allies should commit to spending at least 5% to be ready to defend themselves, but that would require investment at an unprecedented scale.",
      "Trump has cast doubt over whether the U.S. would defend allies that spend too little. The U.S. was projected to have spent 3.38% last year, NATO figures show, the only ally whose spending has dropped over the last decade. Asked last month whether the U.S. would match the 5% target, Rubio said, \u201cSure. We\u2019re heading there now.\u201d",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, this ministerial is going to be different,\u201d U.S. envoy to NATO Matthew Whitaker said this week, adding that \u201c5% is not just a number, it is a necessity for our security. The alliance is facing significant threats.\u201d",
      "He did not outline those threats. NATO leaders insisted at their summit last year that \u201cRussia remains the most significant and direct threat to Allies\u2019 security,\u201d but some countries are uneasy about Trump reengaging with Putin.",
      "Fidan, the Turkish foreign minister who is hosting the meeting, is expected to express Turkey\u2019s commitment to strengthening NATO and call for the inclusion of NATO allies that aren\u2019t European Union members \u2014 such as Turkey \u2014 into European security and defense initiatives, according to Turkish officials.",
      "Fidan also would advocate a comprehensive, \u201c360-degree security\u201d approach focusing not only on ending the Russia-Ukraine war but also on stability in the Middle East and regions adjacent to NATO members, the officials said.",
      "Meanwhile, the defense spending plan under consideration appears to be for all allies to aim for 3.5% of GDP on \u201chard military spending by 2032,\u201d and an extra \u201c1.5% related spending (on) infrastructure, cybersecurity and things like that. Also achievable by 2032,\u201d according to the Dutch government.",
      "While the two figures add up to 5%, factoring in infrastructure and cybersecurity would change the basis on which NATO traditionally calculates defense spending. The seven-year time frame is also short by the alliance\u2019s usual standards.",
      "Whitaker, the U.S. NATO ambassador, appeared this week to confirm the plan, saying it \u201calso includes things like mobility, necessary infrastructure, cybersecurity. It is definitely more than just missiles, tanks and howitzers.\u201d",
      "It's difficult to see how many allies might reach even 3.5% of GDP. The meeting in Turkey may provide more clarity.",

      "A report of Brazil\u2019s Amazon beef industry published reveals that slaughterhouses complying with a settlement agreement are far more likely to follow laws prohibiting the purchase of cattle from illegally deforested land",
      "BRASILIA, Brazil -- Slaughterhouses that agreed to a settlement with Brazilian prosecutors were far more likely to obey environmental laws banning the purchase of cattle from illegally deforested land, according to an audit published Wednesday, but gaps in oversight mean much of the Amazon\u2019s beef supply chain remains linked to forest destruction.",
      "Companies that hired independent auditors as part of the agreement with the Federal Prosecution Service acquired 4% of their cattle from areas with illegal clearing. In contrast, companies that did not hire auditors recorded a 52% non-compliance rate, 13 times higher.",
      "\u201cIt sends a clear message to the market and consumers about which companies are truly investing in responsible and transparent production,\" prosecutor Ricardo Negrini said in a statement.",
      "Most cleared land in the Amazon is converted into pasture. Para, whose capital, Belem, will host this year\u2019s U.N. climate talks, is home to 25 million head of cattle. It is also the Brazilian state with the largest amount of carbon emissions, as deforestation accounts for roughly half of the country\u2019s total output.",
      "The Amazon rainforest is an important regulator of climate, as trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that heats the planet. Clearing forest for cattle creates a two-fold problem for emissions: trees are lost and cattle, particularly cows, also contribute to global warming because they release methane, another greenhouse gas.",
      "Brazil consumes most of its beef production, but exports are growing. China is by far the largest buyer, followed by the U.S.",
      "The audit was part of a settlement agreement reached in 2009. Formally known as Legal Beef Conduct Adjustment Agreement, it aims to stop companies from purchasing cattle raised in illegally deforested areas of the Amazon. It has technical support from civil organizations, such as Imaflora and the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.",
      "The agreement was first implemented in the state of Para and now includes five other Amazonian states. Audits of cattle purchases made in 2022 were done at 89 slaughterhouse units, including major companies such as JBS, Minerva and Marfrig.",
      "These audits, however, only examine direct purchases, leaving out widespread cattle laundering in the Amazon. The most common way is transferring cows from an illegal area to a legal farm before selling to slaughterhouses, deliberately muddying traceability.",
      "Negrini said the problem has worsened as cattle ranchers find ways around tighter monitoring of direct cattle purchases since the settlement.",
      "Preliminary data in the report show that only 38% of slaughterhouses\u2019 indirect suppliers were verifiably compliant. To reach this number, prosecutors examined transfer documents issued by state animal health agencies.",
      "\u201cSome slaughterhouses have as many as six indirect suppliers behind each direct one. It\u2019s a significant part of the supply chain that still lacks proper monitoring,\u201d said Camila Trigueiro, a researcher at the Belem-based nonprofit Imazon. \u201cThe Federal Prosecution Service must move urgently to address these producers.\u201d",

      "The Endangered Wildlife Trust said Wednesday that two of their researchers had found specimens of the Blyde Rondavel flat gecko, which was first identified in the same canyon in Mpumalanga Province in northeastern South Africa in 1991 only to not be seen again.",

      "\u201cHaving a species that is data deficient annoys me,\" said Pietersen. \"I\u2019ve always loved the species that others wouldn\u2019t study because they\u2019re harder to find or obscure.\u201d",
      "The research trip was two years in the making after they registered at least six applications for permits to go, Pietersen said.",
      "They were dropped off on the top of one of the canyon's landmark circular rocky outcrops, which have sheer cliffs more than 100 meters high that can't easily be climbed and where the geckos were thought most likely to be. It was the exact same outcrop where the geckos were found in 1991.",
      "Pietersen and Davies only had three days camping on the outcrop to find the geckos, which are around 8-9 centimeters long when fully grown.",
      "\u201cAnd when we did, we were elated to say the least,\u201d said Pietersen. He said they saw 20-30 specimens and captured and photographed seven, giving the world a glimpse of a lost gecko three decades in the making.",
      "The Endangered Wildlife Trust said the data they collected, including tissue samples, should allow them to confirm it is a distinct species.",
      "The trust said the gecko was the fifth animal they had rediscovered in recent years. A mole that lives in sand dunes was found in 2021 after having not been seen for more than 80 years, and a butterfly, a lizard and a frog species have also been found again in the last four years after being lost to conservationists for decades.",
      "They all show how much there is still to learn about the world's biodiversity, the Endangered Wildlife Trust said.",

      "El Salvador President Nayib Bukele says that he\u2019s pushing forward a \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill that critics say would deal another blow to civil society and independent journalistic organizations as the popular president tightens his control three years int...",
      "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said he's pushing forward a \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill that critics say would deal another blow to civil society and independent journalistic organizations as the popular president tightens his control three years into a crackdown against gangs.",
      "While Bukele announced few details of the proposal Tuesday night, the president wrote on X that the bill would include a 30% tax on donations to non-governmental organizations, some of which have long criticized his government for moves they assert are undemocratic. Because Bukele\u2019s party has a firm grip on control of the country\u2019s congress, he will likely face few hurdles in jamming the legislation through.",
      "It resembles a similar proposal championed by Bukele in 2021, which collapsed under the weight of international criticism. But critics say the Salvadoran leader \u2013 adored by American right-wing figures \u2013 has become emboldened by his recent political alliance with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Juan Pappier, Americas director for Human Rights Watch, warned that it falls in line with measures passed by autocratic governments to crack down on dissent, citing laws in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Russia, Belarus and China.",
      "\u201cPassing foreign actors legislation is a classic move in the autocrats\u2019 playbook. There\u2019s nothing creative or innovative about this,\u201d Pappier said. \u201cThis is a way of stigmatizing organizations that receive foreign funding and of limiting their work.\u201d",
      "In nearby Nicaragua, the government in an all-out crackdown on dissent has used such laws to shut down or outlaw at least 3,500 NGOs since mass social protests erupted in 2018. Among them were a scouting association and a rotary club.",
      "Bukele\u2019s proposal comes after hundreds of people peacefully protesting an eviction order in front of Bukele\u2019s house were met with a violent response by police, which detained at least two people. The leader quickly cast blame on civil society groups and announced the measure on his social media.",
      "\u201cYesterday we witnessed how humble people were manipulated by self-proclaimed leftist groups and globalist NGOs, whose only real goal is to attack the government,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Bukele has cited such funds as evidence of the groups' corruption and bias against him, but it is fairly common in poorer countries in Latin America to depend on international aid dollars, as it's often difficult to raise money in their own countries.",
      "Bukele's 2021 proposal would have required groups that receive monetary support from abroad to register as \u201cforeign agents,\u201d something that would severely limit their activities. The measure failed in Congress that year after the Biden administration and the European Union raised concerns, and the German embassy threatened to withdraw funding for humanitarian programs in the country.",
      "Since, Bukele has further consolidated power in all branches of government, and simultaneously feels \u201cemboldened\u201d by his alliance with Trump to stamp out dissent, said Pappier.",
      "Bukele has long been at odds with human rights groups as they have criticized his harsh crackdown on the country\u2019s gangs, in which he has suspended key constitutional rights and arrested more than 85,000 for alleged gang ties. He has repeatedly accused human rights organizations of defending gangsters.",
      "Security has improved dramatically, and Bukele easily won reelection last year despite a constitutional prohibition on serving consecutive terms.",
      "Human rights groups are again criticizing Bukele's administration after the Trump administration sent more than 200 Venezuelans to a maximum security prison in El Salvador, despite little to no evidence that they belonged to a gang as the Trump administration alleged.",
      "The measure builds off a number of moves by the government in recent weeks that have raised alarm by watchdog groups.",
      "\u201cEl Salvador is entering that group of countries that repress civil society in order to stay in power and that there is no criticism, no questioning, no social scrutiny of the exercise of power,\u201d said Ingrid Escobar, lawyer and head of the rights group Socorro Juridico.",
      "Earlier in the month, Bukele ordered the arrest of five heads of bus companies after they defied his order to offer free transport for a week following a major highway closure.",
      "That same week, the investigative news organization El Faro said it received word that the government was preparing arrest warrants for reporters after the organization published a series of stories about Bukele\u2019s alleged ties to gangs. No arrests have been made.",

      "Edi Rama, leader of the left-wing Socialist Party, held a celebratory rally in Tirana\u2019s main Skanderbeg Square. The event, attended by thousands of supporters waving Albanian and EU flags, took place in front of a big poster prepared for Friday's European Political Community summit, or EPC, a forum that gathers European leaders with the aim of boosting security and prosperity across the continent.",
      "With only diaspora ballots remaining to be fully counted, the ruling Socialists achieved a landslide victory, winning 83 seats in the 140-seat Parliament in the May 11 polls, according to the Central Election Commission. With those numbers, the Socialists are likely to govern alone.",
      "Rama\u2019s Socialist Party says it can deliver EU membership in five years, with negotiations concluding by 2027 and becoming a member in 2030. That is a pledge met with skepticism by the Democrats, who contend Albania is far from prepared.",
      "\u201cMost Albanians, within and outside Albania, think Albania is on the right path,\" Rama said at Wednesday's rally. \u201cAlbania can only achieve EU membership by 2030 through our collective effort, led by me and the Socialist Party.\u201d",
      "The conservative Democratic Party-led coalition of Sali Berisha, former prime minister and president, won only 50 seats. The remaining seats went to four smaller political parties.",
      "Preliminary turnout Sunday was almost 42.16%, or 4% lower than four years ago. For the first time, those in the diaspora could vote and cast their ballots by mail. About 195,000 mailed their votes.",
      "Eligible voters in Albania and abroad voted to elect 140 lawmakers for a four-year term. Because of mass emigration, the Balkan country of 2.4 million people has a total of nearly 3.7 million eligible voters.",
      "Berisha\u2019s Democrats alleged irregularities, including issues with the diaspora ballots, and have accused the Socialists, without providing evidence, of purchasing votes and employing other illicit tactics. They have said they would not recognize the results.",
      "On Friday, to coincide with the EPC summit, the Democrats will hold a protest against the alleged manipulation of the May election.",
      "The European Union hailed Albania\u2019s election as \u201ccalm and well organized, despite some shortcomings,\u201d and urged all political forces \"to ensure the continued functioning of the country\u2019s institutions.\u201d",
      "A joint international observation mission, including the European Parliament, noted that despite being competitive and professionally managed, the election was marked by the ruling party\u2019s misuse of public resources, a confrontational and polarizing tone, divisive language from both main parties and unbalanced media coverage of smaller parties.",

      "MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay -- Crowds poured into the streets of Uruguay's capital on Wednesday to bid a poignant farewell to former President Jos\u00e9 Mujica, a former guerrilla who became a pioneering leader and icon of the Latin American left, remembered most for his humility, simple lifestyle and ideological earnestness.",
      "Thousands of people mourning the death of their former leader, affectionately known as \u201cPepe,\u201d joined the procession as Mujica's flag-furled coffin, borne on a gun carriage, made its way through downtown Montevideo.",
      "The cortege culminated nearly four hours later at the country's parliament, where banners, wreaths, handwritten notes and portraits littered the lawn and emotions ran high. \u201cFarewell, Pepe\u201d was painted across the walls of the historic Legislative Palace.",
      "Mujica died Tuesday at the age of 89, just days before his 90th birthday, in his home on the outskirts of Montevideo \u2014 a three-room farmhouse where he lived throughout his life and during his presidency (2010-2015), in rejection of Uruguay\u2019s opulent presidential mansion. Mujica was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in April 2024.",
      "His coffin will lie in state before the funeral on Thursday, which is expected to draw an array of sympathetic left-wing leaders, from Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva to Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Uruguay's presidency said.",
      "Chants of \u201cPepe, dear, the people are with you!\u201d rose as the horse-drawn hearse passed through the streets on Wednesday. Uruguayans applauded from balconies, packed the sidewalks along the route and formed snaking lines outside the parliamentary seat of Uruguay, waiting to pay their respects to Mujica's closed casket. Some were wiping tears and others somberly bowing their heads.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like losing a family member,\u201d said Estela Piriz, a 69-year-old nurse among those gathered for the wake. \u201cI have come to say my final goodbye.\u201d",
      "That slow and steady stream of regular people \u2014 as well as lawmakers, ministers and former officials \u2014 seemed a fitting tableau for the lying-in-state of the humble chrysanthemum farmer whose folksy maxims on excessive consumerism and bold progressive policies earned him admiration at home and cult status abroad.",
      "Among those paying tribute to the late leader in the echoey, stained glass hall were Mujica\u2019s rivals and critics in a sign that the leftist leader\u2019s legacy transcended his politics.",
      "During his tenure, as Mujica legalized marijuana and same-sex marriage, enacted the region\u2019s first sweeping abortion rights law and established Uruguay as a leader in alternative energy, he also won respect for meeting with his political foes despite polarization across the continent.",
      "\u201cWe had many disagreements, but in life it\u2019s always better to focus on the good things,\u201d former conservative President Luis Alberto Lacalle de Herrera, who governed from 1990-1995, told reporters as well-wishers slowly processed around the coffin.",
      "Another former right-wing president, Julio Mar\u00eda Sanguinetti, now 89, acknowledged that he and Mujica were often \u201con opposite sides\u201d of issues. But he said their bond went beyond partisan loyalties.",
      "\u201cWe are the same generation that lived through all the ups and downs of the country in the last 70 years,\u201d he said. \u201cPeace is made with your adversaries.\u201d",
      "Uruguay\u2019s president, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, Mujica\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 from his left-wing Broad Front party, declared Wednesday-to-Friday national days of mourning in a presidential decree that praised Mujica\u2019s \u201chumanist philosophy,\u201d closing the government to all but necessary operations while flags dropped to half-staff.",
      "Orsi and Luc\u00eda Topolansky, Mujica\u2019s life partner and fellow guerilla-turned-politician, launched the funeral procession together from the government headquarters. After privately saying farewell to Mujica's casket, Topolansky emerged from the Legislative Palace with a stunned expression, leaving quickly before speaking to reporters.",
      "A former mayor and history teacher, Orsi has, like his mentor, shunned the pomp and circumstance of the presidential palace in favor of commuting from his family home. Mujica made some of his last public appearances campaigning and casting his ballot for Orsi last fall.",
      "Before overseeing the transformation of his small South American nation into one of the world\u2019s most socially liberal democracies as president, Mujica robbed banks, planted bombs and abducted businessmen as the leader of a violent leftist guerrilla group in the 1960s known as the Tupamaros.",

      "Some of that uncertainty, with regard to the British economy, lifted Thursday when both Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer separately outlined details of a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. Though Trump kept the 10% baseline tariffs on U.K., he agreed to reduce the levies on British autos, steel and aluminum.",

    "story": [
      "As the Trump administration resumes collections on defaulted student loans, hundreds of thousands of older Americans with decades-old debts are now at risk of having their Social Security checks garnished",
      "NEW YORK -- Christine Farro has cut back on the presents she sends her grandchildren on their birthdays, and she\u2019s put off taking two cats and a dog for their shots. All her clothes come from thrift stores and most of her vegetables come from her garden. At 73, she has cut her costs as much as she can to live on a tight budget.",
      "But it\u2019s about to get far tighter.",
      "As the Trump administration resumes collections on defaulted student loans, a surprising population has been caught in the crosshairs: Hundreds of thousands of older Americans whose decades-old debts now put them at risk of having their Social Security checks garnished.",
      "\u201cI worked ridiculous hours. I worked weekends and nights. But I could never pay it off,\u201d says Farro, a retired child welfare worker in Santa Ynez, California.",
      "Like millions of debtors with federal student loans, Farro had her payments and interest paused by the government five years ago when the pandemic thrust many into financial hardship. That grace period ended in 2023 and, earlier this month, the Department of Education said it would restart \u201cinvoluntary collections\u201d by garnishing paychecks, tax refunds and Social Security retirement and disability benefits. Farro previously had her Social Security garnished and expects it to restart.",
      "Farro\u2019s loans date back 40 years. She was a single mother when she got a bachelor\u2019s degree in developmental psychology and when she discovered she couldn\u2019t earn enough to pay off her loans, she went back to school and got a master\u2019s degree. Her salary never caught up. Things only got worse.",
      "Around 2008, when she consolidated her loans, she was paying $1,000 a month, but years of missed payments and piled-on interest meant she was barely putting a dent in a bill that had ballooned to $250,000. When she sought help to resolve her debt, she says the loan company had just one suggestion.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018Move to a cheaper state,\u2019\u201d says Farro, who rents a 400-square-foot casita from a friend. \u201cI realized I was living in a different reality than they were.\u201d",
      "Student loan debt among older people has grown at a staggering rate, in part due to rising tuitions that have forced more people to borrow greater sums. People 60 and older hold an estimated $125 billion in student loans, according to the National Consumer Law Center, a six-fold increase from 20 years ago. That has led Social Security beneficiaries who have had their payments garnished to balloon by 3,000% over the same period, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "An estimated 452,000 people aged 62 and older had student loans in default, according to a January report from CFPB.",
      "Debbie McIntyre, a 62-year-old adult education teacher in Georgetown, Kentucky, is among them. She dreams of retiring and writing more historical fiction, and of boarding a plane for the first time since high school. But her husband has been out of work on disability for two decades and they\u2019ve used credit cards to get by on his meager benefits and her paycheck. Their rent will be hiked $300 when their lease renews. McIntyre doesn\u2019t know what to do if her paycheck is garnished.",
      "She floats the idea of bankruptcy, but that won\u2019t automatically clear her loans, which are held to a different standard than other debt. She figures if she picks up extra jobs babysitting or tutoring, she could put $50 toward her loans here and there. But she sees no real solution.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what more I can do,\u201d says McIntyre, who is too afraid to check what her loan balance is. \u201cI\u2019ll never get out of this hole.\u201d",
      "Braxton Brewington of the Debt Collective debtors union says it\u2019s striking how many older people dial into the organization\u2019s calls and attend its protests. Many of them, he says, should have had their debts cancelled but fell victim to a system \u201criddled with flaws and illegalities and flukes.\u201d Many whose educations have left them in late-life debt have, in fact, paid back the principal on their loans, sometimes several times over, but still owe more due to interest and fees.",
      "For those who are subject to garnishment, Brewington says, the results can be devastating.",
      "\u201cWe hear from people who skip meals. We know people who dilute their medication or cut their pills in half. People take drastic measures like pulling all their savings out or dissolving their 401ks,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know folks that have been driven into homelessness.\u201d",
      "Collections on defaulted loans may have restarted no matter who was president, though the Biden administration had sought to limit the amount of income that could be garnished. Federal law protects just $750 of Social Security benefits from garnishment, an amount that would put a debtor far below the poverty line.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re basically providing people with federal benefits with one hand and taking them away with another,\u201d says Sarah Sattelmeyer of the New America think tank.",
      "Linda Hilton, a 76-year-old retired office worker from Apache Junction, Arizona, went through garnishment before COVID and says she will survive it again. But flights to see her children, occasional meals at a restaurant and other pleasures of retired life may disappear.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to mean restrictions,\u201d says Hilton. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any travel. There won\u2019t be any frills.\u201d",
      "Some debtors have already received notice about collections. Many more are living in fear. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order calling for the Department of Education\u2019s dismantling and, for those seeking answers about their loans, mass layoffs have complicated getting calls answered.",
      "While Education Secretary Linda McMahon says restarting collections is a necessary step for debtors \u201cboth for the sake of their own financial health and our nation\u2019s economic outlook,\u201d even some of Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters are questioning a move that will make their lives harder.",
      "Randall Countryman, 55, of Bonita, California, says a Biden administration proposal to forgive some student debt didn\u2019t strike him as fair, but he\u2019s not sure Trump\u2019s approach is either. He supported Trump but wishes the government made case-by-case decisions on debtors. Countryman thinks Americans don\u2019t realize how many older people are affected by policies on student loans, often thought to be the turf of the young, and how difficult it can be for them to repay.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s a young person\u2019s problem today,\u201d he says, \u201cis an old person\u2019s problem tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Countryman started working on a degree while in prison, then continued it at the University of Phoenix when he was released. He started growing nervous as he racked up loan debt and never finished his degree. He\u2019s worked a host of different jobs, but finding work has often been complicated by his criminal record.",
      "He lives off his wife\u2019s Social Security check and the kindness of his mother-in-law. He doesn\u2019t know how they\u2019d get by if the government demands repayment.",
      "\u201cI kind of wish I never went to school in the first place,\u201d he says.",

      "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- Elmo, Abby Cadabby and the rest of the \u201cSesame Street\u201d gang will get some high-profile help as they travel down a new road.",
      "The Sesame Workshop \u2013 founded in 1969 and currently working on its 56th season, but its first that will not be distributed by PBS or HBO \u2013 received the Elevate Prize Catalyst Award Wednesday, which will provide the nonprofit a $250,000 grant as well as support in promoting its work from the Elevate Prize Foundation. Previous winners of the award include Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, actor Michael J. Fox, and NBA great Dwyane Wade.",
      "\u201cThey haven\u2019t just entertained generations \u2013 they\u2019ve educated, advocated and inspired real change,\u201d Elevate Prize Foundation CEO Carolina Garcia Jayaram, said as she presented the award to The Sesame Workshop at the foundation\u2019s Make Good Famous Summit in Miami Beach, Florida. \u201cAnd their work hasn\u2019t just been confined to the screen. Through their nonprofit, they\u2019ve expanded their mission globally. They\u2019ve created real world programs that bring education, health and hope to millions of children in over 150 countries.\u201d",
      "Sal Perez, the show\u2019s executive producer and a Sesame Workshop vice president, said the organization planned to use the award to let more people know that its nonprofit work extends beyond the TV show.",
      "\u201cWe do a lot of work around the world with direct services, trying to provide content for families that talks about some of those harder to talk about subjects, whether it\u2019s trauma, whether it\u2019s homelessness and things of that nature. So this is an opportunity to highlight that kind of work.\u201d",
      "Perez told The Associated Press in an interview before the ceremony that there would be news about Sesame Workshop\u2019s future released \u201cin the coming days.\u201d Last year, Warner Bros. Discovery decided not to renew its deal for new episodes that air on HBO and Max, though episodes will remain on the streaming service until 2027.",
      "\u201c\u2019Sesame Street\u2019 is not going to go away,\u201d Perez said. \u201cIt will never go away. It\u2019s obviously been a beloved show for so long.\u201d",
      "However, there are changes coming to the new season, which currently has no distribution deal. Perez said the segments on the new season will be longer and \u201creally focused on character,\u201d while also focusing on its audience's emotional well-being and development.",
      "\u201cThe more kids want to hang out with our characters on \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 the more they\u2019re going to take in those lessons,\u201d said Perez, adding that there would also be updates to the show's look and feel. The new season will also feature more exploration of the \u201cSesame Street\u201d neighborhood and a look inside the legendary two-story brownstone at 123 Sesame Street.",
      "Though Sesame Workshop does not currently receive any government funding, Perez urged viewers to support public media, especially following President Donald Trump's recent executive order to cut funding to PBS and NPR.",
      "\u201cWe believe in the power that public funding has for children\u2019s media,\" he said. \"I think people should support their local PBS affiliates and support children\u2019s media because it is an entry point for children to really start to see the world outside of their homes.\u201d",
      "Jayaram said she felt the time was right to for the Elevate Prize Foundation to stand with The Sesame Workshop and its work.",
      "\u201cThis is a foundation that\u2019s about social impact,\" she said. \"So the symbolism of us joining forces with a children\u2019s program is to say that even though our leaders are grown adults, it\u2019s the child in all of us that we need to revive and remember our essential values as humans.\u201d",
      "Famed roommates Bert and Ernie were on hand to receive the award alongside Perez with their trademark banter. \u201cWe are so proud to make the Catalyst,\u201d joked Ernie. \u201cOne day we'd also like to make the Dog-alist.\u201d",
      "In a video acceptance, Abby and Elmo took their own swing at explaining the award.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a spark that makes good change happen \u2013 kinda like magic,\u201d explained Abby.",

      "Colombian lawmakers have once again blocked President Gustavo Petro\u2019s efforts to overhaul labor laws",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Lawmakers in Colombia on Wednesday once again blocked President Gustavo Petro's efforts to overhaul the country\u2019s labor laws, this time by rejecting a referendum that would have asked voters whether workdays should be limited to eight hours and whether workers should receive double pay if they work during holidays.",
      "Petro asked Congress earlier this month to approve the 12-question referendum to give voters a chance to decide on the changes that lawmakers themselves had already rejected twice. He had warned lawmakers against blocking the referendum, saying before thousands of people gathered for a Labor Day demonstration on May 1 that if they did not approve it, Colombians would punish them at the polls during the 2026 legislative elections.",
      "After an intense debate Wednesday, 49 senators voted against the measure and 47 in favor.",
      "Petro, Colombia's first leftist president, characterized the vote as fraudulent. He has repeatedly accused lawmakers of blocking his social initiatives and ignoring the demands of Colombians.",
      "Had lawmakers approved the referendum, voters would have answered questions such as whether daytime workdays should end at 6 p.m. and whether open-ended contracts should be offered to workers to prioritize job stability.",
      "In a rarely used maneuver, a group of congressmen on Wednesday successfully appealed the March dismissal of Petro's proposed labor reform. The move allows lawmakers to again debate his proposals and potentially approve them. Lawmakers face a June 20 deadline to do so.",

      "NEW YORK -- The chair of Tesla sold more than $230 million of company stock since Elon Musk's endorsement of Donald Trump triggered boycotts and protests against his cars, sending its profits and stock price plunging.",
      "More than half of Robyn Denholm's cash haul came from sales in the first four months this year as Tesla stock fell by one-third, according to filings reviewed by The Associated Press. In total, she unloaded hundreds of thousands of shares \u2014 more than half her holdings as dictated by a pre-arranged selling plan filed with regulators as Musk began embracing right-wing politics.",
      "Denholm filed that plan on July 25, the day Musk endorsed Trump for president.",
      "Denholm's profits were likely outsized, too. That is because many of the shares she sold had been acquired through so-called options granted to her by Tesla years earlier that, given recent stock prices, allowed her to buy at a deep discount, according to data from research provider FactSet. Nearly a million shares acquired through options were bought for $25, less than a tenth of the market price for much of the last nine months.",
      "The AP reached out to both Tesla and Denholm but did not receive an immediate reply.",
      "A Denholm statement to The New York Times, which earlier reported on the insider sales, said that the share value of holdings by Tesla directors has jumped because the stock itself has soared, creating \u201coutsized returns\u201d for all shareholders.",
      "It's not clear why Denholm decided to cash out so much of her stake.",
      "Pre-determined selling schedules are used by executives and directors as a way of telling investors that their selling isn't based on insider information, which is illegal, or necessarily a sign that they have turned pessimistic about a company.",
      "Denholm isn't the only Tesla insider who has been selling. The chief financial officer and other directors have unloaded $189 million in stock in the same nine-month period, according to FactSet data.",
      "Tesla stock soared after Trump was elected in November on hopes that the president-elect's close relations with Musk would translate to less regulatory scrutiny and bigger profits.",
      "But Musk's role as the government cost-cutting chief for Trump and his comments supporting extreme right-wing politicians in Europe have triggered a backlash among car buyers, and sales have sunk along with its stock.",
      "Tesla reported last month that profits in the first three months of the year plunged 71%.",
      "The stock soared again after Musk, the company's chief executive and biggest shareholder, said he would be stepping back from his Washington work to spend more time at the electric automaker.",
      "Tesla closed at $347 a share Wednesday, up 4% for the day and more than 50% since its April low.",

      "There were cheers when Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee signed off on the GOP tax breaks bill after a round-the-clock session that pushed President Donald Trump\u2019s package past overwhelming Democratic opposition",
      "WASHINGTON -- Cheers broke out early Wednesday as Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee signed off on the GOP tax breaks bill after a grueling round-the-clock session that pushed President Donald Trump's package past overwhelming Democratic opposition.",
      "But there's still more work to do.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also worked past midnight trying to resolve issues with Trump's plan. Opposition is mounting from various corners of the GOP majority as he tries to muscle the party's signature package to passage without any votes from Democrats.",
      "On the one hand, the conservative leader of the Freedom Caucus derides the new Medicaid work requirements as a \u201cjoke\u201d that do not go far enough at cost-cutting. Meanwhile, a handful of GOP lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states are refusing to support the measure unless changes are made to give deeper state and local tax deductions, called SALT, for their constituents back home.",
      "\"To say we have a gulf is an understatement,\" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a leader of the conservative wing.",
      "Roy said there is \u201ca significant number of us who could not bless this product\u201d in its current form.",
      "Nevertheless, momentum is building toward an end-of-the-week inflection point to stitch together the sprawling package Friday at the Budget Committee. That means combining hundreds of pages of bill text covering $5 trillion in tax breaks and at least $1.5 trillion in spending reductions on Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs to deliver Trump's second-term legislative priority.",
      "Democrats decry the package as a give-away to the wealthy at the expense of safety net programs that millions of Americans rely on. But Johnson insists the Republican majority is on track to pass the package by Memorial Day, May 26, sending it to the Senate where Republicans are crafting their own version. With his slim majority, he can only afford a few defections from his ranks.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still on target,\u201d Johnson said at the Capitol. \u201cThe American people are counting on us.\u201d",
      "Democrats also stayed up all night forcing marathon public hearings. One at the House Energy and Commerce Committee was still going more than 26 hours later before finishing Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Later Wednesday evening, the House Agriculture Committee handling the food aid cuts wrapped up its work too, but only after the Republican chairman abruptly shut down debate on dozens of remaining amendments from Democrats.",
      "All told, Democrats proposed hundreds of amendments trying to change the package, with dozens of votes that largely failed.",
      "\u201cIt is a cruel, mean, rotten bill,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., as the Agriculture panel debated changes to the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program, known as SNAP.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said at least 7.6 million fewer people would have health insurance with reductions to Medicaid, and likely more with additional changes to the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The CBO also gave lawmakers a preliminary analysis showing that 3 million fewer people each month would participate in the SNAP food program under the changes proposed.",
      "More than 70 million Americans rely on Medicaid for health care, and about 40 million use SNAP.",
      "The Republicans are targeting Medicaid and SNAP for a combined $1 trillion in cuts as a way to offset the costs of the tax package, but also to achieve GOP goals of reining in the social safety net programs.",
      "Most of the cost-savings would come from imposing stiffer work requirements for those receiving the health care and food assistance, meaning fewer people would qualify for the aid. The legislation would raise from 54 to 64 the age of able-bodied adults without dependents who would have to work to qualify for SNAP. It also would also require some parents to work to qualify for the benefits once their children are older than 7, instead of 18. Under current law, those recipients must work or participate in a work program for 80 hours a month.",
      "The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., insists the changes would \u201cstrengthen and sustain\u201d Medicaid for the future, and are the kind of \u201ccommon sense\u201d policies Trump promised voters.",
      "But Democrats told repeated stories of their constituents struggling to access health care. Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., revealed his own diagnosis with Type 2 diabetes at the House Ways and Means Committee hearing and the sticker shock of health costs.",
      "One of the most difficult issues for Johnson has been the more localized debate over state and local taxes as he works to come up with a compromise for New York, California and New Jersey lawmakers. They have rejected an offer to triple the deduction cap, now at $10,000, to $30,000 for married couples.",
      "The speaker met with lawmakers Tuesday and talks continued into Wednesday.",
      "Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., said it was cordial, but there was no deal. \u201cMore sizzle than steak in that meeting,\u201d he said late Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe reality is you need 218 votes to pass a bill and the way this bill is currently constructed, it will not have that because it does not adequately the issue of SALT,\u201d said Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y.",
      "The lawmakers believe they have leverage in the talks because without a deal, the $10,000 limit established under the 2017 tax bill expires at the end of the year and reverts to no cap at all.",
      "But as Johnson and the lawmakers edge closer to a SALT deal, the conservatives are balking that their priorities must also be met.",
      "Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., said he\u2019s a no for now, but would be working to improve the bill so that he could support it.",
      "The conservatives argue that the tax breaks without deeper spending cuts will pile onto the deficit, and they worry that the Medicaid reductions do not go far enough in rolling back federal funds to expand the Affordable Care Act. They also want the work requirements, which don't take effect until Jan. 1, 2029, after Trump has left office, to start sooner.",
      "\"Basically Republicans are enforcing Obamacare, which is a surreal situation to me,\u201d Burlison said.",
      "Republicans are racing to extend Trump's tax breaks, which are set to expire later this year, while adding the new ones he campaigned on in 2024, including no taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and others.",
      "A new analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation shows that most tax filers would see a lower tax rates under the proposal, except those at the lowest rates, who earn less than $15,000 a year. Their average tax rate would go up.",

      "Starbucks put new limits starting Monday on what its baristas can wear under their green aprons. The dress code requires employees at company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada to wear a solid black shirt and khaki, black or blue denim bottoms.",
      "Under the previous dress code, baristas could wear a broader range of dark colors and patterned shirts. Starbucks said the new rules would make its green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers as it tries to establish a warmer, more welcoming feeling in its stores.",
      "But Starbucks Workers United, the union that represents workers at 570 of Starbucks\u2019 10,000 company-owned U.S. stores, said the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining.",
      "\u201cStarbucks has lost its way. Instead of listening to baristas who make the Starbucks experience what it is, they are focused on all the wrong things, like implementing a restrictive new dress code,\u201d said Paige Summers, a Starbucks shift supervisor from Hanover, Maryland. \u201cCustomers don\u2019t care what color our clothes are when they\u2019re waiting 30 minutes for a latte.\u201d",
      "Summers and others also criticized the company for selling styles of Starbucks-branded clothing that employees no longer are allowed to wear to work on an internal website. Starbucks said it would give two free black T-shirts to each employee when it announced the new dress code.",
      "Starbucks said Wednesday that the strike was having a limited impact on its 10,000 company-operated U.S. stores.",
      "\u201cThousands of Starbucks partners came to work this week ready to serve their customers and communities,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIt would be more productive if the union would put the same effort into coming back to the table to finalize a reasonable contract.\u201d",
      "Starbucks Workers United has been unionizing U.S. stores since 2021. Starbucks and the union have yet to reach a contract agreement, despite agreeing to return to the bargaining table in February 2024.",

      "Moody\u2019s downgraded the state\u2019s credit rating to Aa1. Maryland had received a triple-A bond rating from Moody\u2019s since 1973. The state has benefitted from the higher rating by paying the lowest rates when it sells bonds to pay for infrastructure, likes roads and schools.",
      "\u201cThe downgrade was driven by economic and financial underperformance compared to Aaa-rated states, which is expected to continue given the state\u2019s heightened vulnerability to shifting federal policies and employment, and its elevated fixed costs,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.",
      "Gov. Wes Moore and other leading Maryland Democrats blamed President Donald Trump's mass layoffs of federal workers, which is having a big impact on the region. The District of Columbia also recently received a credit-rating downgrade.",
      "\u201cTo put it bluntly, this is a Trump downgrade,\" Moore said in statement made jointly by the presiding officers of the state's legislature, Comptroller Brooke Lierman and Treasurer Dereck Davis, who are all Democrats. \u201cOver the last one hundred days, the federal administration\u2019s decisions have wreaked havoc on the entire region, including Maryland.\u201d",

      "Sen. Ted Cruz asked whether a hotline between military and civilian air traffic controllers in Washington, D",
      "A hotline between military and civilian air traffic controllers in Washington, D.C., that hasn't worked for more than three years may have contributed to another near miss shortly after the U.S. Army resumed flying helicopters in the area for the first time since January's deadly midair collision between a passenger jet and a Black Hawk helicopter, Sen. Ted Cruz said at a hearing Wednesday.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration official in charge of air traffic controllers, Frank McIntosh, confirmed the agency didn't even know the hotline hadn't been working since March 2022 until after the latest near miss. He said civilian controllers still have other means of communicating with their military counterparts through landlines. Still, the FAA insists the hotline be fixed before helicopter flights resume around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.",
      "The Army said in a statement Wednesday that is it \u201cworking with the FAA to resolve the direct communications line between the Pentagon pad tower and the DCA tower and determine what repairs are required to restore services.\u201d DCA is the code for Reagan airport.",
      "It said the Army \u201ccontinues to restrict flights to the Pentagon pad to only mission essential operations until the line is repaired or improved communication procedures are implemented and accepted by the FAA.\u201d",
      "The FAA said in a statement that the dedicated direct access line between air traffic controllers at Reagan and the Pentagon's Army heliport hasn't worked since 2022 because of the construction of a new tower at the Pentagon. But the FAA said \u201cthe two facilities continue to communicate via telephone for coordination.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe developments at DCA in its airspace are extremely concerning,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThis committee remains laser-focused on monitoring a safe return to operations at DCA and making sure all users in the airspace are operating responsibly.\u201d",
      "The Army suspended all helicopter flights around Reagan airport after the latest near miss, but McIntosh said the FAA was close to ordering the Army to stop flying because of the safety concerns before it did so voluntarily.",
      "\u201cWe did have discussions if that was an option that we wanted to pursue,\u201d McIntosh told the Senate Commerce Committee at the hearing.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and FAA accident investigator, said \u201cthe fact that they were unaware that this connection was not working for three years is troublesome.\u201d But he is not entirely clear on the purpose of the hotline when controllers had other ways to communicate.",
      "But Guzzetti thinks the Army needs to be more forthcoming about what it is doing to ensure the airspace around Washington remains safe. Since the crash, the Army has at times refused to provide information that Congress has asked for, and officials didn't answer all the questions at a previous hearing.",
      "\u201cThe DCA airspace is under the white hot spotlight. So the Army\u2019s going to have to be more transparent and more assertive in their dealings with this problem,\u201d Guzzetti said.",
      "According to a U.S. official, one course of action under consideration now is to have the Army give 24 hours notice of any flights around National Airport. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because no decisions have been made and discussions are ongoing.",
      "January's crash between an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter killed 67 people \u2014 making it the deadliest plane crash on U.S. soil since 2001. The National Transportation Safety Board has said there were an alarming 85 near misses around Reagan in the three years before the crash that should have prompted action.",
      "Since the crash, the FAA has tried to ensure that military helicopters never share the same airspace as planes, but controllers had to order two planes to abort their landings on May 1 because of an Army helicopter circling near the Pentagon.",
      "\u201cAfter the deadly crash near Reagan National Airport, FAA closed the helicopter route involved, but a lack of coordination between FAA and the Department of Defense has continued to put the flying public at risk,\u201d Sen. Tammy Duckworth said.",
      "McIntosh said the helicopter should never have entered the airspace around Reagan airport without permission from an air traffic controller.",
      "\u201cThat did not occur,\u201d he said. \u201cMy question \u2014 and I think the larger question is \u2014 is why did that not occur? Without compliance to our procedures and our policies, this is where safety drift starts to happen.\u201d",
      "The NTSB is investigating what happened.",
      "In addition to that incident, a commercial flight taking off from Reagan airport had to take evasive action after coming within a few hundred feet of four military jets heading to a flyover at Arlington National Cemetery. McIntosh blamed that incident on a miscommunication between FAA air traffic controllers at a regional facility and the tower at Reagan, which he said had been addressed.",

      "Impacted drivers may experience an increase in pedal travel, NHSTA documents warn, meaning the pedal would need to be pressed harder to apply the brakes. And if there's a leaking brake line, the fluid level will decrease over time \u2014 potentially causing the red brake warning indicator to light up.",

      "French uranium mining company Orano says it has sued the government of Niger after the disappearance of its director and the raiding of its local offices",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- French uranium mining company Orano has sued the government of Niger after the disappearance of its director and the raiding of its local offices, as military authorities in the west African country tighten their grip on foreign companies and civil society.",
      "\u201cOrano deplores this intervention, for which no legal basis nor reason has been offered,\" Orano said in a statement late Tuesday, accusing authorities of arbitrary arrest, illegal detention and \u201cunjust confiscation of the property of Nigerien companies, subsidiaries of Orano and the State of Niger itself.\u201d",
      "The company's director was reportedly detained earlier this month. The company says the raids in Niamey, the capital, seized staff's electronic devices and cellphones.",
      "Niger's military authorities did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Orano has been operating in Niger, the world\u2019s seventh biggest supplier of uranium, for over 50 years, and holds majority shares in three main uranium mines in Niger. Only one of the mines, near the town of Arlit, is currently operational.",
      "Last year military authorities withdrew the company\u2019s operating permit for the Imouraren uranium mine, with reserves estimated at 200,000 tons. The authorities also took operational control of Orano\u2019s subsidiary, Soma\u00efr, which operates the only active mine.",
      "The military authorities seized power in 2023 with a pledge to cut ties with the West and review mining concessions. Before that, Niger was the West\u2019s major economic and security partner in the Sahel, the vast region south of the Sahara Desert that has been a hot spot for violent extremism.",
      "Also Wednesday, the founder and director of the private Sahara FM radio station, Ibrahim Manzo, said that authorities had arrested three of its staff members in the central city of Agadez and accused them of spreading fake news.",
      "Although Niger\u2019s transitional authorities recently released political prisoners in an attempt to calm the political climate, such arrests continue.",

      "Some 350,000 commuters who work in New Jersey and New York City could soon be scrambling for other ways to reach their destinations if New Jersey Transit engineers walk off the job early Friday",
      "Some 350,000 commuters who work in New Jersey and New York City could soon be scrambling for other ways to reach their destinations if New Jersey Transit engineers walk off the job early Friday.",
      "NJ Transit \u2014 the nation\u2019s third largest transit system \u2014 operates buses and rail in the state, providing nearly 1 million weekday trips, including into New York City. A walkout would halt all NJ Transit commuter trains, which provide heavily used public transit routes between New York City\u2019s Penn Station on one side of the Hudson River and communities in northern New Jersey on the other as well as the Newark airport, which has grappled with unrelated delays of its own recently.",
      "Wages and working conditions have been the main sticking points of the negotiations between the agency and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. The union claims its members earn an average salary of $113,000 a year and says an agreement could be reached if agency CEO Kris Kolluri agrees to an average yearly salary of $170,000.",
      "NJ Transit leadership, though, disputes the union's data, saying the engineers have average total earnings of $135,000 annually, with the highest earners exceeding $200,000.",
      "\u201cI cannot keep giving money left and right to solve a problem,\" Kolluri recently said. \u201cIt all comes down to, who is going to pay for this? Money does not grow on trees.\u201d",
      "Tom Haas, the union's general chairman, has said NJ Transit has adopted a \u201ctake it or leave it\" approach to salaries during the negotiations.",
      "\u201cWe have sought nothing more than equal pay for equal work, only to be continuously rebuffed by New Jersey Transit,\u201d Haas said during a news conference Friday. \u201dNew Jersey Transit engineers want to keep the trains moving, but the simple fact is that trains do not run without engineers.\u201d",
      "If the walkout does happen, it would be the state\u2019s first transit strike in more than 40 years.",
      "If the engineers do walk off the job, the agency plans to increase bus service, saying it would add \u201cvery limited\u201d capacity to existing New York commuter bus routes in close proximity to rail stations and will contract with private carriers to operate bus service from key regional park-and-ride locations during weekday peak periods.",
      "However, the agency notes that the buses would not be able to handle close to the same number of passengers \u2014 only about 20% of current rail customers \u2014 so it is has urged people who can work from home to do so if there is a strike.",
      "The potential strike is already causing some disruptions. On Monday, NJ Transit said it will not operate train or bus service to MetLife Stadium for Shakira concerts scheduled for Thursday and Friday, and said it\u2019s not clear yet if it will be providing service for Beyonce fans planning to attend her shows scheduled at MetLife from May 22 to 29.",
      "If a walkout does occur, NJ Transit has said the chartered buses will run from four satellite lots across the state to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan or to PATH train stations in north Jersey, starting Monday. The PATH system is operated by a subsidiary of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and its services would not be affected by the potential strike.",
      "As many as 1,000 passengers are on a full train each day, and roughly 70,000 commuters take the trains each day. NJ Transit says each chartered bus could carry only about 100 passengers, and no buses would run on the first day of a potential strike.",
      "Officials expect some train customers will switch to existing NJ Transit bus routes or use the chartered carriers. Others may choose to drive into New York City, where they would have to pay congestion pricing fees.",
      "The potential walkout comes a month after union members overwhelmingly rejected a labor agreement with management. Both sides had earlier said the tentative agreement included a \u201creasonable wage increase\u201d for union members as well as the resolution of a long-standing grievance.",
      "Kolluri has said the offer would have raised the average annual pay of full-time engineers to $172,000 from $135,000, but union leaders say those figures were inflated.",
      "Since that proposal was rejected, the two sides have traded jabs over the labor dispute, which goes back to 2019, when the engineers\u2019 contract expired. Union leaders say train engineers have gone without a raise over the past five years and are just seeking pay parity with engineers who work for other rail agencies.",
      "The parties met Monday with a federal mediation board in Washington to discuss the dispute, but both sides and the board have declined to comment on whether any progress was made or if more talks have been scheduled.",
      "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, says all options are on the table if a strike occurs, including declaring a state of emergency. The governor, though, remains optimistic an agreement can be reached.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of so-called forever chemicals in drinking water",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it plans to weaken limits on some so-called forever chemicals in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones.",
      "The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits were expected to reduce PFAS levels in drinking water for millions of people.",
      "PFAS are man-made chemicals that don\u2019t easily break down in nature. They\u2019re found in a wide range of products, including cookware, firefighting foam and stain-resistant clothing.",
      "Under the new rollback, limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards in place, but give utilities two extra years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to comply and treat for the chemicals.",
      "\"We are on a path to uphold the agency\u2019s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,\u201d said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.",
      "The development was first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "Environmental groups slammed the move.",
      "\u201cWith a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration\u2019s promise to deliver clean water for Americans,\u201d said Erik Olson, a senior strategic director of health at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.",

    "story": [
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom says the state is staring down an $12 billion budget deficit",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California is facing a $12 billion deficit that Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to help close by freezing enrollment in a state-funded health care program for immigrants living in California without legal status.",
      "Newsom announced the deficit and his plans to cover it Wednesday as he outlined his nearly $322 billion state spending plan for the upcoming fiscal year.",
      "Beyond higher-than-expected Medicaid spending, Newsom said the deficit is due to broad economic uncertainty, including ever-changing federal tariff policies and a volatile stock market. California relies heavily on revenue from a tax on capital gains.",
      "Newsom, a Democrat, kicked off his budget presentation by highlighting California's contributions to the U.S. and world economy and blaming President Donald Trump's economic policies, which he said could reduce state revenues by $16 billion in the coming years.",
      "\u201cCalifornia is under assault,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a president that's been reckless in terms of assaulting those growth engines.\u201d",
      "He now opens budget negotiations with lawmakers and it\u2019s unclear how Democrats who control the Legislature will react to his plan to freeze new Medi-Cal enrollment for some immigrants. A final budget proposal must be signed by June. California\u2019s budget is by far the largest among states.",
      "His decision highlights Newsom's struggle to protect his liberal policy priorities against budget challenges in his final years on the job and as he weighs his next political move, which could include a presidential run.",
      "Immigration has become a politically potent issue nationally. Nearly half of Americans approve of President Donald Trump\u2019s tougher immigration approach, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in April. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have threatened to reduce Medicaid money for states that enroll immigrants living in the country illegally.",
      "The freeze does not mean California is backing away from its support for immigrants, Newsom said.",
      "\u201cNo state has done more than the state of California, no state will continue to do more than the state of California by a long shot. And that\u2019s a point of pride,\u201d he said.",
      "California was among one of the first states to extend free health care benefits to all poor adults regardless of their immigration status last year, an ambitious plan touted by Newsom to help the nation\u2019s most populous state inch closer to a goal of universal health care. But the cost ran $2.7 billion more than the administration had anticipated.",
      "Newsom in March suggested he was not considering rolling back health benefits for immigrants as the state was grappling with a $6.2 billion Medicaid shortfall. He also repeatedly defended the expansion, saying it saves the state money in the long run. The program is state-funded and does not use federal dollars.",
      "Under Newsom's plan, low-income adults without legal status will no longer be eligible to apply for Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, starting in 2026. Those who are already enrolled won't be kicked off their plans, and the changes won't impact children. Newsom didn't say how long the freeze would last.",
      "Starting in 2027, adults with \u201cunsatisfactory immigration status\u201d on Medi-Cal will also have to pay a $100 monthly premium. The governor's office said that is in line with the average cost paid by those who are on subsidized heath plans through California's own marketplace. There's no premium for most people currently on Medi-Cal.",
      "\u201cWe believe that people should have some skin in the game as it relates to contributions,\" Newsom said.",
      "Newsom's office estimated the changes will save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.",
      "The Medi-Cal expansion, combined with other factors such as rising pharmacy costs and larger enrollment by older people, has forced California to borrow and authorize new funding to plug the multibillion hole earlier this year. California provides free health care to more than a third of its 39 million people.",
      "Newsom's proposals go against the commitment the state has made to the immigrant community, said Masih Fouladi, executive director of the California Immigrant Policy Center.",
      "\u201cQuestions about the practicality of the program aren't even something that we want to entertain with,\u201d he said. \u201cThe proposal just doesn't match with our values as a state.\u201d",
      "Newsom also proposed eliminating state health care coverage for certain weight loss drugs beginning in January 2026, which would save an estimated $85 million for the upcoming fiscal year and $680 million by fiscal year 2028-29.",
      "Newsom wants to reauthorize the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045. The program aims to reduce emissions from industrial sources over time through market-based mechanisms, and its set to expire in 2030.",
      "Money generated through auctions of credits needed to pollute goes into a fund that lawmakers tap for climate-related spending and the state's high-speed rail project.",
      "Newsom proposed tapping $1.5 billion from that fund for the state fire department. He said the shift would help ensure carbon emitters help fund the state\u2019s response to fires intensified by climate change.",
      "His proposal would also ensure $1 billion annually for the state\u2019s long-delayed high-speed rail project. The project now receives 25% of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund money, which ends up being a little more or a little less than a billion annually depending on the year.",

      "The waste, which came in 10 large containers, was declared as mixed metal scrap but turned out to be circuit boards mixed in a huge pile of metal scrap, said Theeraj Athanavanich, director-general of the Customs Department.",
      "The waste was found on Tuesday after the containers became the subject of a routine random inspection, officials said.",
      "A U.N. report last year said electronic waste is piling up worldwide. Some 62 million tons of electronic waste was generated in 2022 and that figure is on track to reach 82 million tons by 2030, the report said. It said only 22% of the waste was properly collected and recycled in 2022 and that quantity is expected to fall to 20% by the end of the decade due to higher consumption, limited repair options, shorter product life cycles, and inadequate management infrastructure.",
      "Theeraj said Thai authorities are looking to press charges including falsely declaring imported goods, illegally importing electronic waste and planning to re-export the waste back to its country of origin.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important that we take action on this kind of goods,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are environmental impacts that are dangerous to the people, especially communities around factories that might import these things for processing, then recycling.\u201d",
      "Electronic waste creates huge health hazards. Many components are laden with lead and mercury, cadmium and other toxins. Recyclers are after gold, silver, palladium and copper, mainly from printed circuit boards, but lax controls mean that facilities often burn plastics to release encased copper and use unsafe methods to extract precious metals.",
      "Thailand passed a ban on the import of a range of electronic waste products in 2020. The Cabinet in February approved an expanded list of the banned waste.",
      "Sunthron Kewsawang, deputy director-general of the Department of Industrial Works, said officials suspected at least two factories in Samut Sakhon province, which borders Bangkok, are involved in importing the waste.",
      "In January, the Customs Department said it seized 256 tons of illegally imported electronic waste from Japan and Hong Kong at a port in eastern Thailand.",

    "story": [
      "The Tesla Model Y and Hyundai Ioniq 5 are two of the hottest-selling small electric SUVs",
      "The Tesla Model Y and the Hyundai Ioniq 5 are two of the hottest electric SUVs on the market. Adding to their appeal, both SUVs were recently updated. The 2026 Model Y has new styling, higher-quality interior materials and a smoother ride quality. Changes to the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 aren\u2019t as dramatic, but you do get more range, easier-to-use controls and new ways to charge. Which recently updated electric SUV is the better buy? Edmunds\u2019 experts compare them to find out.",
      "The 2026 Model Y is currently only available in the Long Range All-Wheel Drive version. It delivers an EPA-estimated 327 miles of range, which is impressive for a dual-motor electric SUV. Edmunds tested this version on its independent, standardized EV range test and found the Tesla matched its EPA estimate in real-world driving.",
      "The 2025 Ioniq 5\u2019s estimated range spans from 245 miles in the base model to 318 miles in most single-motor models, which are rear-wheel-drive. Edmunds tested an Ioniq 5 Limited with dual electric motors and all-wheel drive. It beat its EPA estimate of 269 miles by going 282 miles in Edmunds\u2019 testing.",
      "The Ioniq 5\u2019s new Tesla-style charging port allows it to charge at most Tesla Supercharger fast-charging stations. The Model Y has access to any type of Tesla charging station. Both can charge at non-Tesla stations as well. When using a high-powered fast-charging station, the Model Y can add up to 169 miles in 15 minutes. The Ioniq 5 charges a little quicker, regaining 178 miles in 15 minutes.",
      "The Tesla offers a bit more maximum range but charges a little slower, making it a tie here.",
      "Winner: tie",
      "Tesla stuffs a lot of standard tech in the Model Y, including a large 15.4-inch center touchscreen, a 16-speaker audio system, dual wireless phone chargers and several advanced driver aids. You can also stream movies and play arcade games when you\u2019re parked. Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system is an expensive option, but it can drive and navigate the Model Y traffic on city streets and highways as long as the driver is paying attention and is prepared to take control if needed.",
      "The Ioniq 5\u2019s base trim comes standard with a 12.3-inch center touchscreen and a pleasing number of advanced driver aids. Wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration is also standard; neither system is available on the Model Y. However, you need to upgrade to a higher trim for the eight-speaker Bose audio system and upgraded highway driving assist system.",
      "Both SUVs seat five and are spacious and comfortable. They also ride smoothly over bumps and are composed when cornering. But Edmunds has found it\u2019s the little things that help the Ioniq 5 get an edge here. Its available 360-degree camera system is more helpful than the Tesla\u2019s when parking, for example, and its controls and features are easier to use and learn. The Model Y\u2019s touchscreen, which controls almost everything, can be distracting to use while driving.",
      "Winner: Ioniq 5",
      "The Model Y provides loads of cargo space: 29 cubic feet behind the rear seats and a whopping 71.4 cubic feet with the rear seat folded down. The front trunk adds another 4.1 cubes. The Ioniq 5 has less space, but it\u2019s enough for most folks: 26.3 cubic feet behind the rear seats and 58.5 cubic feet with the rear seats folded down. However, its front trunk is only large enough for a charging cord.",
      "As for small-item storage, both SUVs provide plenty of compartments and sizable door pockets. The Ioniq 5 has a movable center console that\u2019s handy at times.",
      "Winner: Model Y",
      "The Model Y Long Range All-Wheel Drive currently starts at $50,630, and other models should be offered later. Although not cheap, it\u2019s an excellent value because of its extensive list of standard tech features, several standard comfort features like heated and ventilated front seats, and lengthy range.",
      "The Ioniq 5\u2019s base Standard Range model starts at $44,075 but provides only 245 miles of range. The SE model, which offers 318 miles, is about $4,000 more. Neither one has as many standard features as the Tesla, but the lower price makes the Hyundai attainable for shoppers with smaller budgets. Both the Model Y and the Ioniq 5 currently qualify for federal tax credits.",
      "Winner: tie",
      "This comparison is a draw; both electric SUVs are excellent choices, so it comes down to personal preference. If you want a more traditional vehicle that\u2019s easier to use, go for the Ioniq 5. But if you prefer the Model Y\u2019s minimalist design approach and distinctive tech features, then it\u2019s the EV for you.",

      "While U.S. President Donald Trump has talked of victory after reaching a weekend deal with China to reduce the sky-high tariffs levied on each others\u2019 goods, businesses in China are reacting to the temporary deal with a cautious wait and see approach",
      "BANGKOK -- While U.S. President Donald Trump has talked of victory after reaching a weekend deal with China to reduce the sky-high tariffs levied on each others' goods, businesses in China are reacting to the temporary deal with caution.",
      "The U.S. and China have cut the tariffs levied on each other in April, with the U.S. cutting the 145% tax Trump imposed last month to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%. The lower tariff rates came into effect on Wednesday.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, announcing the reduction in tariff rates this weekend in Geneva, had said, \u201cWe do want trade.\" While the markets have responded to the agreement with gusto, rebounding to the levels before Trump\u2019s tariffs, business owners remain wary.",
      "Businesses like one kitchen utensil factory in southern Guangdong province were eager to get back to work. The business said they put at least four orders from their American clients back into production on Tuesday after the tariff pause was announced.",
      "\u201cWe thought the negotiation would bring the tariffs down a bit, but didn\u2019t expect it would be so much,\u201d said Margaret Zhuang, a salesperson for the utensil factory in Guangdong province, one of China's manufacturing hubs.",
      "The two countries are now planning to start negotiations for a longer-term deal.",
      "Kahlee Yu, sales manager of Yangjiang Hongnan Industry and Trade Company, which also manufactures kitchen utensils, said he was reaching out to American customers again. \u201cWe\u2019re a little bit optimistic about the trade deal between the two sides. But it is still possible the tariff policies will change again, resulting in no orders from our American clients,\" he said.",
      "However happy they were in the moment, the damage from tariffs announced in April has already been done, Zhuang added, as they are seeing fewer orders. Currently, she has orders for products up until June. Earlier this year, before Trump\u2019s trade war began, they had orders for production extending to August.",
      "The uncertainty also means companies are less willing to make new investments. Kelvin Liao, sales director at Action Composites, a manufacturer of carbon fiber auto parts in Dongguan, a major city in Guangdong, said he was originally planning to buy a piece of land to build a new factory, but opted instead to rent because of the tariff situation.",
      "\u201cIt is good to reach a trade deal between the two countries. But people have already lost confidence in Trump, and we will take a wait-and-see attitude,\" he said. \u201cWe believe the signing a trade deal is just a pause and the ultimate goal of the US is to curb China\u2019s development.\u201d",
      "Tariffs also remain in place for some industries, which are not part of the general deal. Hong Kong businessman Danny Lau, who owns an aluminum-coating factory, said his company still faces about a 75% tariff from tariffs levied at different points since 2018 by the U.S. Still he welcomed the news from the weekend, saying he would reach out to existing American customers to gauge their views.",
      "\u201cAlthough the policy change doesn\u2019t cover our industry, we hope talks will continue and there will be better news during the 90-day pause,\u201d he said.",
      "In April, some Chinese businesses said they would focus their attention on exporting to other markets, given how high the American tariffs were. Analysts said previously that the tariffs could cause Chinese businesses to diversify their supply chains and move part of their manufacturing capacity abroad, including to the U.S.",
      "Liao, the auto parts manufacturer, said his company already has a factory in Vietnam, and the products there were exported to the U.S.",
      "\"We don\u2019t believe that the US has the ability to produce the products like ours with lower costs. We will not give up on the US market.\u201d",
      "\u2014-",

      "Two rights organizations have accused Saudi Arabia of turning a blind eye to labor abuses of migrant workers and preventable deaths",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Scores of laborers from countries including India, Bangladesh and Nepal have faced preventable deaths from electrocution, road accidents, falling from heights, and more while working in Saudi Arabia, according to a report Wednesday by the advocacy group Human Rights Watch.",
      "Human Rights Watch and another rights group, FairSquare, released separate investigations Wednesday detailing preventable deaths of migrant workers from job-site accidents and work-related illnesses.",
      "The reports accuse Saudi authorities of often misreporting such deaths and failing to investigate, preventing families from receiving compensation from the kingdom that they are entitled to and knowing how their loved ones died.",
      "As Saudi Arabia pushes ahead with hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure and development initiatives \u2014 including the 2034 men\u2019s soccer World Cup and the futuristic city Neom \u2014 rights groups warn of thousands more avoidable deaths in the coming years.",
      "In one case, Human Rights Watch said a Bangladeshi worker was electrocuted on the job. But his employer allegedly withheld the body, telling the family they would be compensated only if they agreed to a local burial.",
      "Another family reported waiting nearly 15 years before they were compensated by the Saudi government.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very urgent that the Saudi authorities and FIFA put in place basic labor rights protections,\u201d Minky Worden, Human Rights Watch\u2019s director of global initiatives, told The Associated Press, referring to soccer's world governing body.",
      "Authorities in Saudi Arabia did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "FairSquare, which looked into the deaths of 17 Nepali contractors in Saudi Arabia over the last 18 months, warned in its report that without accountability, \u201cthousands of unexplained deaths\u201d of low-paid foreign workers are likely to follow.",
      "\u201cIn some cases, you have families being pursued by money lenders for the loans that their (dead) husband or father took out in order to migrate to the Gulf,\u201d said James Lynch, who co-directs FairSquare.",
      "Saudi Arabia has long faced allegations of labor abuses and wage theft tied to its Vision 2030 project, a big-money effort to diversify its economy beyond dependence on oil.",
      "FIFA shared with the AP a letter it sent Human Rights Watch last month defending the selection of Saudi Arabia as host of the 2034 World Cup.",
      "The letter cited the Saudis' commitments to establishing \u201ca workers\u2019 welfare system\u201d and enhancing \u201ccountry-wide labor protections including through a strengthened collaboration\u201d with the United Nations\u2019 International Labor Organization.",
      "The kingdom is not the only Gulf Arab state to be accused of abusing migrant laborers in the run-up to a World Cup. Rights groups also criticized Qatar, which hosted the competition in 2022, saying they tallied thousands of unexplained worker deaths.",
      "But this time has the potential to be even worse for foreign workers, Worden said, noting that the 2034 World Cup has plans to require more stadiums and infrastructure with more teams competing.",
      "Qatar established an oversight board called the Supreme Committee, which monitored FIFA construction sites and took reports of unsafe work conditions.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such committee like that in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Worden said, adding, \u201cIn the end, Qatar did have concrete policies like life insurance and heat protection. Those aren\u2019t in place now\u201d in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The details of the investigations from Human Rights Watch and FairSquare come a day after FIFA President Gianni Infantino joined U.S. President Donald Trump on his official visit to Saudi Arabia, where Trump met with Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",

      "Kasperi Kapanen scored on a scramble in front of the net at 7:14 of overtime, and the Oilers beat Vegas 1-0 in Game 5 on Wednesday night to advance out of the second round.",
      "\u201cObviously, we win games with Leon and Connor leading the way,\u201d Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch said. \u201cThat\u2019s an absolute given. We won some games where our goalie outperformed their goalie. Then there\u2019s games where our depth guys came through and scored big goals.

Skinner, who was benched two games into the playoffs, also blanked the Golden Knights in Game 4. This was his third start in a row in replacing the injured Calvin Pickard.",
      "And Kapanen was a spectator the first nine games of the playoffs before finally getting his chance in Game 4. Given the other players on the roster, Kapanen said he understood why he was initially left out.",

They set franchise postseason records for assists (36) and field goal percentage (62.8%).",

      "Colorado has struggled out of the gate in many games. It has been outscored 44-15 in first innings. In their last two losses at Texas, Rockies pitching allowed three runs to the first three hitters Tuesday, and four through the first four Wednesday.",

      "The Los Angeles Dodgers have called up top prospect Dalton Rushing and let veteran catcher Austin Barnes go",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Dalton Rushing's phone rang at 1 a.m. Wednesday, startling the Los Angeles Dodgers' top prospect and worrying him that it wasn't anything good.",
      "\u201cI was almost asleep,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a call in the middle of the night, you freak out at first. It ended up being some of the best news I\u2019ve ever heard.\"",
      "It was his Triple-A manager telling the 24-year-old catcher to pack his bags. He was being called up to the big leagues.",
      "\u201cI called every family member,\u201d Rushing said in the dugout at Dodger Stadium. \u201cMy mother just so happened to be the one that didn\u2019t answer after 55 calls. She's a deep sleeper.\u201d",
      "The Dodgers haven\u2019t been sleeping on Rushing\u2019s talent. He was hitting .308 with five home runs and 17 RBI at Oklahoma City. He caught Clayton Kershaw during the three-time Cy Young Award winner\u2019s recent rehab assignment.",
      "\u201cObviously he\u2019s seen 17 more years of Major League Baseball than I have, so I got to learn plenty from those four or five innings,\u201d Rushing said.",
      "At the same time as Rushing's new beginning, the end came for Austin Barnes. The longest-tenured position player on the team was designated for assignment after 11 seasons and two World Series championships. Barnes, the backup catcher to Will Smith, was hitting .214 with three doubles and two RBI.",
      "\u201cAustin\u2019s been a mainstay for our club, so it\u2019s certainly not easy,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said, \u201cbut I think that the performance from Dalton kind of really sped this up.\u201d",
      "Rushing will start Thursday against the Athletics in what is expected to be a bullpen game for the Dodgers.",
      "Roberts plans to have Rushing catch twice a week and pinch-hit while catching bullpen sessions.",
      "Rushing said not playing every day will be different, but he accepts his new role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the young guy and essentially if I show up here every day and I play three days a week, if I can help the team win those other three or four days, it\u2019s pretty special and you\u2019re pretty valuable,\u201d he said.",
      "Rushing has been in the Dodgers' organization for four years and was their minor league player of the year in 2024, when he hit 26 home runs and drove in 85 runs between stints in Double-A and Triple-A. Like starting catcher Will Smith, he attended the University of Louisville.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my job to show up here and one, help the team win, but two, just make his job as easy as possible,\u201d Rushing said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make my job easy, but also there\u2019s a helping hand that I can give to make his job easy as well.\u201d",
      "Barnes was with the Dodgers for 11 seasons, with 35 homers and 162 RBI in 612 games. Roberts said he took the news \u201clike a pro.\u201d",
      "\u201cI expect him to hook up with somebody else and impact another ballclub,\u201d the manager said. \u201cThere\u2019s still more baseball in there from him.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- European Union regulators accused TikTok on Thursday of breaching digital safety rules because of shortcomings in the video sharing app's online ad database.",
      "TikTok's ad repository isn't up to the standards required by the bloc's Digital Services Act, known as the DSA, the 27-nation EU\u2019s executive Commission said in preliminary findings from its investigation.",
      "The Commission said ad databases are vital for researchers to detect scam ads as well as so-called hybrid threat campaigns, coordinated information operations and fake ads, \"including in the context of elections.\"",
      "The DSA is a wide-ranging rulebook that aims to clean up social media platforms and protect users from risks including election-related disinformation. Platforms have to be transparent about digital ads, including informing users why they\u2019re being shown a specific advertisement and who paid for it.",
      "The Commission said TikTok doesn\u2019t provide necessary information about the content of ads, the users targeted, and who pays for them. The database doesn\u2019t allow for a comprehensive search for ads based on this information, \u201cthereby limiting the usefulness of the tool,\u201d it said.",
      "TikTok said it's reviewing the Commission\u2019s findings and remains committed to meeting its DSA obligations.",
      "\u201cWhile we support the goals of the regulation and continue to improve our ad transparency tools, we disagree with some of the Commission\u2019s interpretations and note that guidance is being delivered via preliminary findings rather than clear, public guidelines,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The ad database's shortcomings prevent a \u201cfull inspection\u201d of the risks posed by its ad targeting systems, said Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy.",
      "\u201cTransparency in online advertising \u2014 who pays and how audiences are targeted \u2014 is essential to safeguarding the public interest,\" Virkkunen said. \u201cWhether we are defending the integrity of our democratic elections, protecting public health, or protecting consumers from scam ads, citizens have a right to know who is behind the messages they see.\u201d",
      "TikTok now has a chance to reply before the Commission issues its final decision, which could result in a fine of up to 6% of the company\u2019s annual global revenue.",
      "TikTok is being scrutinized in a separate EU investigation into whether it failed to deal with risks to Romania\u2019s presidential election, which was thrown into turmoil last year over allegations of electoral violations and Russian meddling.",

      "A Brazilian scientist whose work shows farmers how to shift crop production toward more biologically based solutions instead of chemical fertilizers is being honored with this year\u2019s World Food Prize",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- A Brazilian scientist who pushed back against chemical fertilizers and researched biologically based approaches to more robust food production has been honored with this year\u2019s World Food Prize, the organization announced Tuesday.",
      "Microbiologist Mariangela Hungria's research helped her country become an agricultural powerhouse, an accomplishment that has now won her $500,000 from the Iowa-based World Food Prize Foundation. Hungria has been researching biological seed and soil treatments for 40 years, and has worked with Brazilian farmers to implement her findings.",
      "\u201cI still cannot believe it. Everybody said, my whole life, it's improbable, you are going the wrong way, just go to things like chemicals and so on. And then, I received the most important prize in the world of agriculture,\" Hungria said in an interview. \"Sometimes I still think I'll wake up and see that it's not true.\u201d",
      "Norman Borlaug, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his work to dramatically increase crop yields and reduce the threat of starvation in many countries, founded the World Food Prize. Since the first prize was handed out in 1987, 55 people have been honored.",
      "Hungria said she grew up wanting to alleviate hunger. Early in her career, she decided to focus on a process called biological nitrogen fixation, in which soil bacteria could be used to promote plant growth. At that time, farmers in Brazil and around the world were reluctant to reduce their use of nitrogen fertilizers, which dramatically increase crop production but lead to greenhouse gas emissions and pollutes waterways.",
      "Hungria studied how bacteria can interact with plant roots to naturally produce nitrogen. She then demonstrated her work on test plots and began working directly with farmers to convince them that they wouldn't have to sacrifice high crop yields if they switched to a biological process.",
      "The work is credited for increasing yields of several crops, including wheat, corn and beans, but it has been especially affective on soybeans. Brazil has since become the world's largest soybean producer, surpassing the United States and Argentina.",
      "Although Hungria's research could be applied on farms in other countries, soybean production in the U.S. is different than it is in Brazil; American farmers typically rotate crops on their land between growing corn and soybeans. Enough nitrate fertilizer applied to corn still remains in the soil when soybeans are planted that little or no fertilizer needs to be applied, Hungria said.",
      "Brazilian agricultural companies have faced fierce criticism for clearing forested land to create farmland, largely to grow soybeans.",
      "Much of that criticism is justified, Hungria said, but she added that her biological approach builds up the soil and makes further encroachment into forested areas less necessary.",
      "\u201cIf you manage the crop well, the crop will enrich the soil with nitrogen. Soil health improves if you do the right things,\u201d she said.",
      "Hungria will be awarded her prize at an annual October gathering in Des Moines, Iowa, of agricultural researchers and officials from around the world.",
      "Gebisa Ejeta, chair of the World Food Prize Laureate Selection Committee, credited Hungria for her \u201cextraordinary scientific achievements\u201d that have transformed agriculture in South America.",
      "\"Her brilliant scientific work and her committed vision for advancing sustainable crop production to feed humanity with judicious use of chemical fertilizer inputs and biological amendments has gained her global recognition both at home and abroad,\u201d Ejeta said in a statement.",

      "Major social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and X have failed to protect LGBTQ+ users from hate and harassment, in part, because they intentionally rolled back previous safety practices, the advocacy group GLAAD said Tuesday in its annual So...",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Major social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and X have failed to protect LGBTQ+ users from hate and harassment, in part, because they intentionally rolled back previous safety practices, the advocacy group GLAAD said Tuesday in its annual Social Media Safety Index.",
      "The report said that recent \u201cunprecedented hate speech policy rollbacks\u201d from Instagram and Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google's YouTube are \u201cactively undermining the safety of LGBTQ people\u201d both online and offline. Meta\u2019s rollback now allows users to call LGBTQ people \u201cmentally ill,\u201d among other policy changes.",
      "The scorecard assigns numeric ratings to each platform with regard to LGBTQ safety, privacy, and expression. Elon Musk's X received the lowest score at 30 out of 100, while TikTok came in highest at 56. Meta's Facebook, Instagram, Threads and Google's YouTube were in the 40s. The group's methodology has changed since last year, so the scores are not directly comparable to previous reports.",
      "\u201cAt a time when real-world violence and harassment against LGBTQ people is on the rise, social media companies are profiting from the flames of anti-LGBTQ hate instead of ensuring the basic safety of LGBTQ users,\" said Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD's president and CEO.",
      "While X has received the lowest scores since Musk's takeover of the platform in 2022 \u2014 when it was called Twitter \u2014 Meta's backslide can largely be attributed to its recent policy shift. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that Meta is removing restrictions on topics like immigration and gender \u201cthat are out of touch with mainstream discourse,\u201d citing \u201crecent elections\u201d as a catalyst. GLAAD calls the rollback \u201dparticularly extreme.\"",
      "Representatives for Meta, TikTok and X did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Monday afternoon.",
      "GLAAD said Google recently removed \u201cgender identity and expression\u201d from YouTube's list of protected characteristic groups, which suggests that the platform is \"no longer protecting transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming people from hate and discrimination.\"",
      "Google says this is not the case.",
      "\u201cWe confirmed earlier this year our hate speech policy hasn\u2019t changed. We have strict policies against content that promotes hatred or violence against members of the LGBTQ+ community and we continue to be vigilant in our efforts to quickly detect and remove this content,\u201d Google said in a statement.",
      "Although GLAAD acknowledges Google's statement, the organization stresses that gender identity has not been restored as a protected characteristic on YouTube's hate speech policy page.",
      "\u201cYouTube should reverse this dangerous policy change and update its \u2018Hate Speech\u2019 policy to expressly include gender identity and expression as a protected characteristic,\u201d the report says.",
      "GLAAD's report makes policy recommendations for protecting LGBTQ users, though it's unclear if the platforms will take these up, given that many have rolled back such protections. For instance, GLAAD says platforms should protect LGBTQ people from hate, harassment and violence, prohibit targeted misgendering and \u201cdeadnaming\u201d of transgender users and explain steps it takes to stop wrongfully removing or demonetizing legitimate accounts and content related to LGBTQ topics.",

      "Players swiping their way through more than 18,700 levels of Candy Crush Saga might be surprised to learn they\u2019re solving puzzles enhanced by unsuspected ally: artificial intelligence",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Players swiping their way through more than 18,700 levels of Candy Crush Saga might be surprised to learn they\u2019re solving puzzles designed with an assist from artificial intelligence.",
      "The app that helped make gamers out of anyone with a smartphone uses AI to help developers create levels to serve a captive audience constantly looking for more sweets to squash. King, the Swedish video game developer behind Candy Crush, also uses AI to update older levels to help ensure players don't feel bored, stuck or frustrated as they spend time with the game.",
      "Todd Green, general manager of the Candy Crush franchise, said using AI in that way helps free up developers' time to create new puzzle boards. It would be \"extremely difficult,\" he said, for designers to update and reconfigure more than 18,000 levels without AI taking a first pass.",
      "Within the video game industry, discussions around the use of AI in game development run the gamut. Some game makers see AI as a tool that can assist with menial tasks, allowing designers and artists to focus on bigger projects. AI, they say, can help build richer worlds by creating more interactive non-player characters, for example. But there are also those who strongly oppose the use of AI, or who see the tech as a threat to their livelihoods \u2014 be it as video game actors and performers, or as workers who help make games. Concerns over AI led game performers with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists to go on strike in late July.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not putting chatbots into the game. We\u2019re not putting AI-powered design experiences into the game for players directly to play with,\u201d Green said, adding that the tech is not being used to replace game workers. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re trying to deploy AI on existing problems that we have in order to make the work of the teams faster or more accurate, and more accurate more quickly.\u201d",
      "In the United States, consumer spending on video game content increased to $51.3 billion in 2024, up from $49.8 billion in 2023, with mobile games accounting for about half of all video game content spending, according to data from the Entertainment Software Association trade group. Mobile is now the leading game platform among players aged 8 and older, the ESA says.",
      "Candy Crush \u2014 first launched on Facebook in 2012 \u2014 is constantly updating. King recently released its 300th client version of the game. Gaming giant Activision Blizzard acquired King in 2016 for $5.9 billion.",
      "The free-to-play game is in a unique position, said Joost Van Dreunen, author of \u201cOne Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.\u201d Candy Crush is more than a decade old, boasts millions of users and caters to a \u201cravenous set of players,\" he said. Demand is so high for new content that it makes sense to use AI to offset the work it takes to create so many levels, Van Dreunen added.",
      "\u201cTo supply that at scale, you absolutely can rely on a sort of artificial intelligence or generative AI to create the next set of forms,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing about Candy Crush is that every level is technically a single board that you have to solve or clear before you can advance. With AI and the existing library of human-made boards, it makes total sense to then accelerate and expand the efforts to just create more inventory. People play more levels.\u201d",
      "King uses AI to target two separate areas: developing new levels and going back to older levels, in some cases, puzzles that are several years old, and reworking them to ensure they're still worth playing. On new levels designed for people who have played the game for a long time, the company wants to ensure the puzzles are fun \u201con first contact.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s hard for us to do, because we don\u2019t get the benefit of having many players test or play through the levels and give us feedback. We have to sort of try and pitch it right at first,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a really important group for us in between people who maybe played before and perhaps took a break for a while, and then coming back because they saw or heard of or were curious about what might be new.\u201d",
      "Green said King uses AI as a behind-the-scenes assistant in the design \u201cloop\u201d of the game, rather than as a tool that immediately puts something new in front of players.",
      "\u201cDoing that for 1,000 levels all at once is very difficult by hand,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the most important thing to understand here is that we are using AI as like a custom design.\u201d",
      "For most players, Green said, the fun in solving the puzzles lies in the \u201cup and down.\u201d Levels aren't designed in order of difficulty. An easy level can follow a few difficult levels \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 to give the game a sense of variety. Leveraging AI means that instead of the team working on several hundred levels each week, they could potentially improve thousands of levels per week because they're able to automate the drafting of the improved levels, he added.",
      "\u201cWe talk to players all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also get the quantitative feedback. We can see how players respond to the levels... How easy are the levels? Do they get sort of stuck, or are they progressing in the way that we hope?\u201d",
      "To determine whether gamers and playing through the way the designers intended, King looks at several factors, including pass rate \u2014 how many times a player passes a level out of every 100 attempts \u2014 and how often a board is \u201creshuffled,\u201d or refreshed with all candies rearranged. Some metrics are also intangible, like whether a level is simply fun.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also, to some extent, obviously subjective,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s different for different people.\u201d",

      "Many autism experts say the Trump administration's plan to find autism's causes is unrealistic",
      "WASHINGTON -- For many experts, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2019s promise for \u201cpulling back the curtain\u201d to find autism's causes in a few months is jarring \u2014 and unrealistic.",
      "That\u2019s because it appears to ignore decades of science linking about 200 genes that play a role \u2014 and the quest to understand differences inside the brain that can be present at birth.",
      "\u201cVirtually all the evidence in the field suggests whatever the causes of autism \u2014 and there\u2019s going to be multiple causes, it\u2019s not going to be a single cause \u2014 they all affect how the fetal brain develops,\u201d said longtime autism researcher David Amaral of the UC Davis MIND Institute.",
      "\u201cEven though we may not see the behaviors associated with autism until a child is 2 or 3 years old, the biological changes have already taken place,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy on Wednesday announced the National Institutes of Health would create a new database \u201cto uncover the root causes of autism and other chronic diseases\u201d by merging Medicaid and Medicare insurance claims with electronic medical records and other data. He has cited rising autism rates as evidence of an epidemic of a \u201cpreventable disease\u201d caused by some sort of environmental exposure and has promised \u201csome of the answers by September.\u201d",
      "Autism isn\u2019t considered a disease. It's a complex brain disorder better known as autism spectrum disorder, to reflect that it affects different people in different ways.",
      "Symptoms vary widely. For some people, profound autism means being nonverbal and having significant intellectual disabilities. Others have far milder effects, such as difficulty with social and emotional skills.",
      "Autism rates are rising \u2014 not among profound cases but milder ones, said autism expert Helen Tager-Flusberg of Boston University.",
      "That's because doctors gradually learned that milder symptoms were part of autism\u2019s spectrum, leading to changes in the late 1990s and early 2000s in diagnosis guidelines and qualifications for educational services, she said.",
      "The link between genes and autism dates back to studies of twins decades ago. Some are rare genetic variants passed from parent to child, even if the parent shows no signs of autism.",
      "But that's not the only kind. As the brain develops, rapidly dividing cells make mistakes that can lead to mutations in only one type of cell or one part of the brain, Amaral explained.",
      "Noninvasive testing can spot differences in brain activity patterns in babies who won't be diagnosed with autism until far later, when symptoms become apparent, he said.",
      "Those kinds of changes stem from alterations in brain structure or its neural circuitry \u2014 and understanding them requires studying brain tissue that\u2019s available only after death, said Amaral, who\u2019s the scientific director of a brain banking collaborative called Autism BrainNet. The bank, funded by the nonprofit Simons Foundation, has collected more than 400 donated brains, about half from people with autism and the rest for comparison.",
      "Researchers have identified other factors that can interact with genetic vulnerability to increase the risk of autism. They include the age of a child\u2019s father, whether the mother had certain health problems during pregnancy including diabetes, use of certain medications during pregnancy, and preterm birth.",
      "Any concern that measles vaccinations could be linked to autism has been long debunked, stressed Tager-Flusberg, who leads a new Coalition of Autism Scientists pushing back on administration misstatements about the condition.",
      "The U.S., with its fragmented health care system, will never have the kind of detailed medical tracking available in countries like Denmark and Norway \u2014 places with national health systems where research shows similar rises in autism diagnoses and no environmental smoking gun.",
      "Experts say Kennedy's planned database isn't appropriate to uncover autism's causes in part because there's no information about genetics.",
      "But researchers have long used insurance claims and similar data to study other important questions, such as access to autism services. And the NIH described the upcoming database as useful for studies focusing on access to care, treatment effectiveness and other trends.",

      "Courts across the country have been grappling with how to deal with the increasing presence of artificial intelligence in the courtroom",
      "Stacey Wales gripped the lectern, choking back tears as she asked the judge to give the man who shot and killed her brother the maximum possible sentence for manslaughter.",
      "What appeared next stunned those in the Phoenix courtroom last week: An AI-generated video with a likeness of her brother, Christopher Pelkey, told the shooter he was forgiven.",
      "The judge said he loved and appreciated the video, then sentenced the shooter to 10.5 years in prison \u2014 the maximum sentence and more than what prosecutors sought. Within hours of the hearing on May 1, the defendant's lawyer filed a notice of appeal.",
      "Defense attorney Jason Lamm won't be handling the appeal, but said a higher court will likely be asked to weigh in on whether the judge improperly relied on the AI-generated video when sentencing his client.",
      "Courts across the country have been grappling with how to best handle the increasing presence of artificial intelligence in the courtroom. Even before Pelkey\u2019s family used AI to give him a voice for the victim impact portion \u2014 believed to be a first in U.S. courts \u2014 the Arizona Supreme Court created a committee that researches best AI practices.",
      "In Florida, a judge recently donned a virtual reality headset meant to show the point of view of a defendant who said he was acting in self-defense when he waved a loaded gun at wedding guests. The judge rejected his claim.",
      "And in New York, a man without a lawyer used an AI-generated avatar to argue his case in a lawsuit via video. It took only seconds for the judges to realize that the man addressing them from the video screen wasn't real.",
      "Experts say using AI in courtrooms raises legal and ethical concerns, especially if it's used effectively to sway a judge or jury. And they argue it could have a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities facing prosecution.",
      "\u201cI imagine that will be a contested form of evidence, in part because it could be something that advantages parties that have more resources over parties that don\u2019t,\" said David Evan Harris, an expert on AI deep fakes at UC Berkeley\u2019s business school.",
      "AI can be very persuasive, Harris said, and scholars are studying the intersection of the technology and manipulation tactics.",
      "Cynthia Godsoe, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School and a former public defender, said as this technology continues to push the boundaries of traditional legal practices, courts will have to confront questions they have never before had to weigh: Does this AI photograph really match the witness's testimony? Does this video exaggerate the suspect's height, weight, or skin color?",
      "\u201cIt's definitely a disturbing trend,\" she said, \u201cbecause it could veer even more into fake evidence that maybe people don't figure out is false.\u201d",
      "In the Arizona case, the victim's sister told The Associated Press that she did consider the \u201cethics and morals\u201d of writing a script and using her brother's likeness to give him a voice during the sentencing hearing.",
      "\u201cIt was important to us to approach this with ethics and morals and to not use it to say things that Chris wouldn\u2019t say or believe,\" Stacey Wales said.",
      "Victims can give their impact statements in any digital format in Arizona, said victims\u2019 rights attorney Jessica Gattuso, who represented the family.",
      "When the video played in the courtroom, Wales said only she and her husband knew about it.",
      "\u201cThe goal was to humanize Chris and to reach the judge,\u201d Wales said.",
      "After viewing it, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Todd Lang said he \u201cloved the beauty in what Christopher\u201d said in the AI video.",
      "\u201cIt also says something about the family,\" he said. \u201cBecause you told me how angry you were, and you demanded the maximum sentence, and even though that's what you wanted, you allowed Chris to speak from his heart as you saw it.\u201d",
      "On appeal, the defendant's lawyer said, the judge's comments could be a factor for the sentence to be overturned.",

      "Chimpanzees and humans last shared a common ancestor around 6 million years ago. Scientists suspect this ancient ancestor must have been a drummer \u2014 using beats to communicate.",
      "\u201cOur ability to produce rhythm \u2014 and to use it in our social worlds \u2014 that seems to be something that predates humans being human,\u201d said study co-author Cat Hobaiter, a University of St Andrews primatologist.",
      "Previous research has shown that chimps have their own signature drumming style. A new analysis of 371 bouts of chimpanzee drumming demonstrates that the chimps \u201cclearly play their instruments -- the tree trunks -- with regular rhythms,\u201d said University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher Henkjan Honing, who was not involved in the study.",
      "When bounding through the jungle, chimps will often grab hold of the tall buttress roots of rainforest trees. Sometimes they pound them several times to create low-frequency sounds that can be heard for a kilometer or more through the forest.",
      "Scientists believe that the drumming is a form of long-distance communication, perhaps to alert other chimps where one chimp is waiting or the direction it is traveling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a way of socially checking in,\u201d said Hobaiter, adding that each chimp has its own \u201cindividual signature \u2014 a pattern of beats that allows you to recognize who\u2019s producing that drumming.\u201d",
      "The new work showed that chimps from different regions of Africa drum with distinctly different rhythms, with western chimps preferring a more even beat while eastern chimps used varied short and long intervals between beats. The research was published Friday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "It's well-known that chimps use tools such as rocks to crack open nuts and sticks to \u201cfish\u201d termites from their mounds. Tree roots can also be tools, the researchers say.",
      "Chimps are selective about which roots they pound, said co-author Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France. Certain shapes and wood varieties create sounds that travel well through dense jungle.",
      "The drummings are likely \"a very important way to make contact,\" she said.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A half-ton Soviet spacecraft that never made it to Venus 53 years ago is expected to fall back to Earth this weekend.",
      "Built to land on the solar system's hottest planet, the titanium-covered spacecraft may survive its fiery, uncontrolled plunge through Earth's atmosphere, predicted to occur on Saturday. But experts said it likely would come down over water, covering most of the world, or a desolate region.",
      "The odds of it slamming into a populated area are \u201cinfinitesimally small,\u201d said University of Colorado Boulder scientist Marcin Pilinski.",
      "\u201cWhile we can anticipate that most of this object will not burn up in the atmosphere during reentry, it may be severely damaged on impact,\" Pilinski said in an email.",
      "By Friday, all indications pointed to a reentry early Saturday morning, U.S. Eastern Time, give or take several hours. While space debris trackers around the world converged in their forecasts, it was still too soon to know exactly when and where the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 would come down. That uncertainty was due to potential solar activity and the spacecraft\u2019s old condition. Its parachutes were expected to be useless by now and its batteries long dead.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek estimated the impact speed at 150 mph (242 kph) if the spacecraft remains intact.",
      "The Soviets launched Kosmos 482 in 1972, intending to send it to Venus to join other spacecraft in their Venera program. But a rocket malfunction left this one stuck in orbit around Earth. Gravity kept tugging on it and was expected to finally cause its doom.",
      "Spherical in shape, the spacecraft \u2014 3-foot (1-meter) across and packing more than 1,000 pounds (495 kilograms) \u2014 will be the last piece of Kosmos 482 to fall from the sky. All the other parts plummeted within a decade.",

      "The job cuts, amounting to about 4% of its 230,000 workers, will include early retirement offers in Japan and closures and consolidation of various operations, according to the Osaka-based maker of home appliances, such as washing machines and refrigerators.",

    "story": [
      "It will be the first direct meeting between the combatants since 2022.",
      "LONDON -- Ukrainian and Russian representatives will meet in Istanbul, Turkey, on Thursday, for their first meeting since the opening weeks of Moscow's 3-year-old invasion of its neighbor.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin will not attend Thursday's talks, despite an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed to journalists on Thursday that the Russian leader would not be taking part.",
      "The return to Istanbul is symbolic, the historic Turkish city having played host to arguably the most successful bursts of diplomacy in three years of devastating warfare.",
      "It was there in March 2022 that Ukrainian and Russian negotiators produced the Istanbul Communiqu\u00e9 -- the framework of a possible peace agreement to end Russia's nascent full-scale invasion.",
      "Its tradeoff was essentially one of Ukraine accepting permanent neutrality -- meaning forever abandoning any hope of becoming a member of NATO -- in exchange for ironclad security guarantees.",
      "The subsequent intensification of the war and emerging evidence of alleged Russian war crimes -- as well as suspicions of sabotage operations against peace talks participants -- fatally undermined those early peace efforts.",
      "Later, Istanbul was also the hub of the Black Sea Grain Initiative that ran from 2022 to 2023, which with the support of Turkey and the United Nations temporarily allowed for the safe export of grain and other agricultural goods from Ukrainian and Russian ports through the Black Sea -- which had by then become a key theater of the fighting -- to the rest of the world.",
      "Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky -- who led talks in 2022 -- will lead the Russian delegation.",
      "Medinsky will be joined by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin and Igor Kostyukov, the head of Russia's military intelligence agency.",
      "Zelenskyy and Putin last met in person in France in 2019 for a session of the Normandy Format, a peace forum convened with France and Germany in a bid to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine.",
      "The fighting there was touched off by Russia's annexation of Crimea and subsequent fomentation of a separatist revolt against Kyiv in the Donbas region. Moscow's 2022 full-scale invasion was a continuation of that initial cross-border aggression, with Russian columns surging out of occupied Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk to seize more territory.",
      "Zelenskyy said at a news conference this week he would not meet any other Russian representative, because \"everything in Russia depends\" on its president.",
      "Zelenskyy arrived in the Turkish capital Ankara on Thursday to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Once there, he posted to social media confirming Ukraine's \"top-level delegation,\" adding its representatives were \"ready to make any decisions that could lead to a long-awaited just peace.\"",
      "\"I have not yet received official confirmation regarding the Russian level of representation,\" he added. \"But from what we can observe, it appears theatrical. We will decide on our next steps after the conversation with President Erdogan.\"",
      "\"We will have several hours for an important discussion and very important decisions,\" Zelenskyy wrote. \"It is essential to understand the level of the Russian delegation, what mandate they hold, and whether they are authorized to make any decisions at all -- because we all know who actually makes decisions in Russia.\"",
      "President Donald Trump -- who since returning to office has been seeking a ceasefire and eventual peace deal -- suggested this week that he hoped for progress at Thursday's talks.",
      "\"I think we're having some pretty good news coming out of there today and maybe tomorrow and maybe Friday,\" Trump said upon arrival in Qatar on Wednesday.",
      "The president even hinted he might even travel to Istanbul, though did not say whether he expected Putin to do the same.",
      "\"Well I don't know if he's showing up,\" Trump said of his Russian counterpart. \"He would like me to be there, and that's a possibility. If we could end the war, I'd be thinking about that,\" Trump added.",
      "At a Thursday roundtable in Qatar during the second leg of his ongoing Middle East visit, Trump again floated the idea of traveling to Istanbul.",
      "\"If something happened, I'd go on Friday if it was appropriate,\" the president said. \"But we have people right now negotiating, and I think that I just hope that Russia and Ukraine are able to do something, because it has to stop, not only the money.\"",
      "Trump said he did not expect Putin to attend. \"I actually said, why would he go if I'm not going? Because I wasn't going to go. I wasn't planning to. I would go, but I wasn't planning to go. And I said, I don't think he's going to go if I don't go. And that turned out to be right.\"",
      "The U.S. delegation to Turkey includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio and senior envoys Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg. Speaking at a gathering of NATO foreign ministers in Ankara on Thursday, Rubio said of his hopes for the upcoming Ukraine-Russia talks, \"We'll see what happens over the next couple of days.\"",
      "\"I will say this, and I'll repeat it, that there is no military solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Rubio continued. \"This war is going to end not through a military solution, but through a diplomatic one, and the sooner an agreement can be reached on ending this war, the less people, less people will die and the less destruction there will be.\"",
      "Trump, Rubio said, \"is interested in building things, not destroying. He wants economies and countries focused on building things, making things, providing opportunity and prosperity for its people, and he's against all the things that keep that from happening, like wars, like terrorism and all the instability that comes with that.\"",
      "Putin proposed the talks last weekend, in response to Ukraine's demand -- backed by the leaders of France, Germany, the U.K. and Poland during a joint visit to Kyiv -- for a full 30-day ceasefire during which time peace talks could proceed. Trump agreed to the plan by phone, the European leaders said.",
      "But Trump then also backed Putin's offer to restart the talks that collapsed in 2022. Trump even publicly pressed Zelenskyy to \"immediately\" agree to the meeting.",
      "Despite the significance of renewed direct Ukraine-Russia talks, Oleg Ignatov -- the International Crisis Group's senior Russia analyst -- told ABC News he had low expectations of an immediate breakthrough.",
      "\"The Russians clearly say that they're interested in keeping military and diplomatic pressure on Ukraine,\" he said. \"They clearly say that there will be long negotiations and Ukraine should be prepared for this.\"",
      "While Trump agitates for a deal he can sell as a political win, Kyiv and Moscow are maneuvering to avoid blame for the failure of peace talks -- and dodge Trump's subsequent wrath.",
      "Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met with Rubio on Wednesday in Istanbul. \"I reaffirmed Ukraine's strong and consistent commitment to President Trump's peace efforts and thanked the United States for its involvement,\" the former wrote om X.",
      "\"We are ready to advance our cooperation in a constructive and mutually beneficial manner,\" he added. \"It is critical that Russia reciprocate Ukraine's constructive steps. So far, it has not. Moscow must understand that rejecting peace comes at a cost.\"",
      "Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, meanwhile, said during a Thursday morning press briefing that Moscow \"is ready for serious negotiations.\"",

      "Even egg prices -- a symbol of rising costs -- fell about 10% in April compared to the previous month.",
      "Still, prices for some products continued to soar, including everyday items such as coffee and beef.",
      "It's normal for some prices to rise at a much faster pace than overall inflation, said Omar Sharif, founder and president of research firm Inflation Insights. The impact, he added, depends on the role such items play in a given person's finances.",
      "\"At the end of the day, what's important is the weight of the price change in your budget,\" Sharif said, noting stubborn price hikes for some goods may be offset by price drops for others.",
      "Here's what to know about which prices are still climbing and what's behind the trend:",
      "Coffee prices soared 9.6% in April compared to a year ago, marking inflation four times higher than the overall rate. Instant coffee prices climbed even faster, jumping 13.5% over the past year.",
      "The spike in coffee prices comes down to a dearth of supply alongside robust demand, meaning too many dollars are chasing after too few coffee beans, David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University, told ABC News.",
      "Recent droughts in Vietnam and Brazil -- two of the world's largest coffee producers -- have restricted global output, Ortega said.",
      "\"These price increases are primarily driven by weather shocks,\" Ortega added.",
      "Meanwhile, coffee drinkers avail themselves of few alternatives, resulting in consistent demand for the product.",
      "A spike in beef prices also stems from a supply shortage that traces back to drought conditions, Ortega said.",
      "Ground beef prices soared 10% in April compared to a year ago, while the costs of beef steaks increased 7% over that period, government data showed.",
      "In 2022, a major drought in the beef-producing regions of the U.S. forced cattle herders to sell off more animals than usual, since the drought raised costs for cattle feed, which in turn made it more expensive for ranchers to maintain their herds, Ortega said.",
      "Many of those ranchers, he added, sold off cattle necessary to produce future beef supply.",
      "\"The national beef herd is at its lowest level in decades \u2013 and demand is strong,\" Ortega said. \"When those two things meet each other, you get this big rise in prices.\"",
      "Car repair prices soared 7.6% in April compared to a year earlier, amounting to inflation three times higher than the overall rate.",
      "The trend owes in large part to the rise of high-tech cars, equipped with features like rearview cameras and traffic sensors, which have added cost to even some routine repairs, Brian Moody, executive editor at Autotrader, told ABC News.",
      "A shortage of workers has exacerbated the cost woes for repair companies as they bolster compensation to attract and retain employees, sending prices higher, Moody added.",
      "\"More people want technology in their cars,\" Moody said. \"That technology requires greater skill to manage and fix, but at the same time, there's a shortage of technicians and workers.\"",
      "Overall apparel prices dropped slightly over the year ending in April, but some items may still deliver sticker shock for spring shoppers.",
      "Prices for men's outerwear, including suits and sports coats, climbed 5.3% over the year ending in April, which amounts to inflation more than double the overall rate.",
      "Women's outerwear costs -- which include jackets, coats and vests -- surged even faster, climbing 6.2%.",
      "Sharif, of Inflation Insights, said the reason for these price increases is murky since they have coincided with a much slower rise in costs for producers of men's outerwear and an outright drop in production costs for women's outerwear.",
      "The ample supply of such products means the price hikes likely result from quirks in consumer taste, potentially resulting from the prices commanded by specialty brands, Sharif added.",
      "\"Shifting trends in demand may be pushing prices higher,\" Sharif said.",

      "Walmart\u2019s first quarter profit slipped and it said it must raise prices due to higher costs from tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump",
      "NEW YORK -- Walmart\u2019s first quarter profit slipped and it said it must raise prices due to higher costs from tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump.",
      "The nation\u2019s largest retailers posted strong quarterly sales Thursday and said it expects sales growth of 3.5% to 4.5% in the second quarter.",
      "Like many other U.S. companies, however, it did not issue a profit outlook for the quarter because of the chaotic environment, with stated U.S. tariff policies changing constantly. The company maintained its full year guidance issued in February.",
      "Walmart earned $4.45 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the quarter ended April 30, down from $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the same period last year.",
      "Adjusted earnings per share were 61 cents, exceeding the 58 cent projections from industry analysts, according to FactSet.",
      "Revenue rose 2.5% to $165.61 billion, just short of analyst estimates.",
      "Walmart\u2019s U.S. comparable sales \u2014 those from established physical stores and online channels \u2014 rose 4.5% in the second quarter, though that\u2019s slowed from a 4.6% bump in the previous quarter, and a 5.3% increase in the third quarter of 2024.",
      "Shares rose almost 3% before the opening bell Thursday.",
      "Business was fueled by health and wellness items as well as groceries. Sales were weaker in home and sporting good, which was offset by robust sales of toys, automotive goods and kid\u2019s clothing, the company said.",
      "Global e-commerce sales rose 22%, up from 16% in the previous quarter.",
      "Future sales have become a concern for all retailers for a number of reasons.",
      "Many Americans have been pulling back on spending as they grow uneasy about the economy, and inflation remains elevated. Trump\u2019s tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is at the core of Walmart\u2019s success.",
      "Trump\u2019s threatened 145% import taxes on Chinese goods were reduced to 30% in a deal announced Monday, with some of the higher tariffs on pause for 90 days.",
      "Retailers and importers had largely stopped shipping shoes, clothes, toys, and other items with the duties so high, but many will now resume importing from China in the narrow window, hoping to avoid sparse shelves this fall. Yet many retailers say they must raise prices to tariff costs. And they are also bracing for higher shipping costs fueled by a surge of companies scrambling to get their goods on ships to the U.S.",
      "Walmart has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Two-thirds of Walmart\u2019s merchandise is sourced in the U.S., with groceries driving much of that. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of Walmart\u2019s U.S. business.",
      "Still, Walmart isn\u2019t immune and said it will have to raise prices even as it works to absorb the costs of the tariffs.",
      "\u201cWe will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible but given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren\u2019t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,\u201d said CEO Doug McMillon in a statement.",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report financial results and the numbers can provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper and how the tariffs are impacting its business.",
      "Earlier this month, Amazon announced higher first-quarter profit and sales that beat analysts\u2019 projections, underscoring the online behemoth\u2019s hold on shoppers looking for low prices and a wide selection in an uncertain economy.",
      "Amazon brought in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect. And Amazon\u2019s president and CEO Andy Jassy told analysts during its earnings call that many of its third party sellers did the same. And because of that move, a fair amount of third-party sellers haven\u2019t changed their pricing yet, he said.",

      "Noem was testifying about the Department of Homeland Security budget.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem came under fire from House Democrats while testifying before the House Homeland Security Committee on her department's 2026 budget on Wednesday.",
      "The hearing quickly turned to immigration and featured back-and-forths with Democrats on the committee, with ranking member Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., telling Noem that under her leadership, it is a \"sad day for DHS.\"",
      "\"Frankly, I've never seen anything like this that served as a lead Democrat on this committee. Even when, madam secretary, my Republican colleagues and I had strong disagreements, we still have productive conversations and did our duty keep America safe. But that's not the case any longer,\" Thompson told Noem, adding that he is glad that Noem \"found time among your many photo ops and costume changes to testify.\"",
      "\"On your watch, the department is breaking the law, it's hurting people, and it's making America less safe,\" he added. \"The Trump administration is outright lying to the courts and the American people.\"",
      "Noem was asked about what occurred last week in New Jersey as three members of Congress attempted to gain access to Delany Hall, a private detention center that is holding ICE detainees, and testified that it was \"lawless.\" The incident outside the detention center resulted in a melee and ended with the Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat who is also running for New Jersey governor, getting arrested.",
      "\"We have footage of those members of Congress slamming their bodies into our law enforcement officers, shoving them screaming profanities in their faces, striking them with their fists and otherwise assaulting law enforcement,\" Noem testified. \"The behavior was lawlessness, and it was beneath this body. Members of Congress should not break into detention centers or federal facilities. Had these members requested a tour, we certainly would have facilitated a tour.\"",
      "Delany Hall falls under the purview of the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the members of Congress argued they had a right to conduct lawful \"oversight\" on the facility through their congressional responsibilities.",
      "\"They were cooperating with criminals to create criminal acts. This wasn't oversight. This was committing felonies,\" Noem said earlier this week on Fox News. \"This was going out and attacking people who stand up for the rule of law, and it was absolutely horrible.\"",
      "Later in the hearing, Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., slammed Noem for what he said was a lack of access to legal counsel.",
      "\"You are deporting children with cancer, children who are U.S. citizens, a gay makeup artist who committed no crime and didn't even enter the country illegally,\" Magaziner told Noem. \"Instead of focusing on real criminals, you have allowed innocent children to be deported while you fly around the country playing dress-up for the cameras.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Noem and House Republicans highlighted what she called \"total operational control\" of the southern border. Noem said she doesn't know how many immigrants lacking legal status to be in the U.S. were released into the country during the Biden administration and touted that the Trump administration has focused on fixing the border crisis.",
      "\"We truly don't have any idea how many dangerous individuals are still in the United States of America. Since President Trump has been in office, just in these few short months, we have deported over 250 known terrorists out of the country,\" she said.",
      "Noem was also pressed on whether everyone ICE has arrested has received due process -- and she answered yes, through the tools that Congress has given it, arguing that expedited removal is a tool that Congress has allowed.",
      "Later in the hearing, the DHS chief was asked about suspending habeas corpus, which ensures people are not unjustly detained or imprisoned, and whether it falls under the constitutional guidelines that a president can suspend it.",
      "\"I'm not a constitutional lawyer, but I believe it does,\" Noem said, adding that it isn't her authority to do so. \"Well, this is something that's not in my purview to weigh in on. This is the president's prerogative, and he has not indicated that they will or will not be taking action.\"",
      "Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff, has floated this idea.",
      "Sparking a contentious back-and-forth, Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., showed Noem a picture of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's hand that appeared to have the letters MS-13 on his hands to represent what the tattoos mean.",
      "Noem would not answer the question as to whether the photo was edited or manipulated to put the letters on his knuckles, and she appeared to avoid analyzing the photo.",
      "\"You won't look at the photo, and we will not be bringing was it doctored or not in staying here, and you look to your right, the photo in front of madam secretary,\" Swalwell said. \"Can you look to the right at the photo in front of you?\"",
      "\"And the letters MS and the numbers 13 -- are those doctored or not?\" he asked.",
      "\"I don't have any knowledge as to this photo,\" she said, adding it is \"unbelievable\" that Swalwell wanted to focus on Abrego Garcia.",

    "story": [
      "lt comes as Musk announced Saudi Arabia has approved a Starlink agreement.",
      "As President Donald Trump continues his first foreign trip through the Middle East, a group of Senate Democrats are calling for an investigation into whether the Trump administration is clearing hurdles for Starlink, a company led by White House senior adviser Elon Musk, to strike foreign deals.",
      "In a letter sent Wednesday to Attorney General Pam Bondi, acting Director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics Jamieson Greer, acting Inspector General of the State Department Arne Baker and White House ethics official Scott Gast, the senators called for an investigation into whether the administration is \"intervening\" to benefit Starlink as it \"negotiates tariff agreements and other matters with foreign governments.\"",
      "Senate Banking Committee ranking member Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., and Foreign Relations Committee ranking member Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., are leading the effort, raising concerns about recent reporting from the Washington Post that suggests the State Department might be pushing other countries to clear barriers for Musk's satellite company.",
      "\"These reports indicate that Mr. Musk may be using his official role and his proximity to the President as leverage for his own personal financial benefit --- even if it comes at the expense of American consumers and the nation's foreign policy interests,\" the senators wrote. \"These actions raise questions about whether Mr. Musk or other administration officials may be violating ethics or other laws.\"",
      "The group of Senate Democrats, which includes a number of additional Democratic co-signers, said the Department of Justice and the White House designated agency ethics official should investigate \"whether Musk or other administration officials may have violated federal ethics law by abusing their official roles for the benefit of Starlink.\"",
      "The letter comes as Musk appeared alongside Trump during his first foreign trip of his second term. Musk was seated prominently as the president delivered remarks at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday.",
      "During separate remarks at the same forum, Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for aviation and maritime use in the region, raising concern from the senators.",
      "\"Musk announced that Saudi Arabia approved Starlink, just as the White House and U.S. tech companies announced defense and trade agreements with Saudi Arabia and a Saudi company,\" they wrote. \"Starlink stands to earn billions of dollars from unlocking access to these new markets.\"",
      "But the contract with Saudi Arabia is not the only example the senators cite. Starlink, the senators alleged, has seen a \"rush of new countries permitting the company to enter their markets\" since Trump took office. This, they said, comes after the company previously struggled to gain permits to operate in certain foreign markets.",
      "The letter cited Starlink's recent expansion into Bangladesh, which approved Starlink's access to its market shortly after a Bangladeshi government official met with Musk at the White House. The lawmakers argued there should be an inquiry into whether Musk's meeting with Bangladeshi officials violated ethics laws due to Musk's status as a special government employee.",
      "They also noted reports that India seems to have \"sped through\" approvals of Starlink while engaging in negotiations with the White House over tariffs.",
      "\"Suggesting that a foreign government adopt Starlink in exchange for relief on tariffs appears to be a textbook case of corruption,\" they wrote in the letter. \"The DOJ's Public Integrity Section is responsible for investigating potentially criminal conflicts of interest like this. The White House's Designated Agency Ethics Official can similarly investigate potential ethics violations by White House officials. We ask that the DOJ and the White House investigate whether any officials have pursued a quid-pro-quo exchange of Starlink access for tariff favors in violation of federal ethics law.\"",
      "\"It is completely false to claim that Elon Musk had or has anything to do with deals involving Starlink. This is just more fake news from media outlets determined to invent conflicts of interest that don't exist. For the umpteenth time, President Trump will not tolerate any conflicts of interest, and every administration official is following ethical guidelines set by their respective agencies,\" White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields told ABC News.",
      "Trump earlier said he would make sure there was no conflict of interest involving Musk.",
      "\"If there's a conflict then we won't let him get near it. He would know not to do it, so we haven't had that yet. But if there was a conflict, we wouldn't let him work in that area,\" he said in February.",
      "ABC News has also reached out to Starlink for comment.",
      "Senate Democrats have been focused on Musk's role as a special government employee for some time, raising repeated concerns about conflicts of interest between the wealthiest man in the world's businesses and his governmental advisory role.",
      "This is the latest in a series of letters geared toward Musk in recent weeks, including a separate legislative push from Warren that would bar special government employees like Musk from communicating with government agencies that interface with their companies and would require these federal employees to meet new ethics requirements.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump is back in the White House, the GOP controls Congress, and Republicans have dusted off their 2017 plans to reshape Medicaid.",
    "story": [
      "Republicans again have their eyes on Medicaid, the government health program.",
      "This is a KFF Health News story.",
      "It has been nearly eight years since Sen. John McCain's middle-of-the-night thumbs-down vote torpedoed Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and make drastic cuts to Medicaid.",
      "With Donald Trump back in the White House and the GOP back in control of Congress, Republicans again have their eyes on Medicaid, the government health program for those with low incomes or disabilities. A GOP proposal unveiled this week would require many enrollees to prove they are working, volunteering or studying, and to shoulder more of the costs of their care. It would also curtail taxes levied on providers that help states draw down billions in additional federal money.",
      "Changes are needed, conservative lawmakers say, because the program is broken and costs too much. Medicaid's annual price tag has soared from about $590 billion in 2017 to nearly $900 billion today.",
      "If this script sounds familiar, it's because Republicans made the same proposals and arguments in 2017, when they last had narrow control of Congress and Trump in the White House.",
      "But while the 2025 Medicaid debate on Capitol Hill feels like a 2017 replay, the GOP's latest effort toward a massive transformation could be more of a long shot, several health policy experts say. In the past eight years, Medicaid enrollment has surged to a record high, with the COVID-19 pandemic driving numbers up and nine more states expanding the program to cover more low-income Americans, including six controlled by Republicans.",
      "More enrollees, particularly in red states, means more constituents who rely on Medicaid to cover their health costs -- making it harder for lawmakers to approve cuts.",
      "\"More red states have more skin in the game,\" said Christine Eibner, a senior economist at Rand Corp., a nonprofit research organization.",
      "More than three-quarters of the public opposes major cuts to Medicaid, including 55% of Republicans, according to a recent poll from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "With the expansion of coverage to more Americans, Medicaid has grown more popular and important, said Krista Drobac, a health policy consultant who formerly worked for the National Governors Association. \"Cutting it is not as politically palatable, even though Congress has moved further to the right.\"",
      "After months of saying little beyond citing a need to cut \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee released legislation May 11 outlining their plans.",
      "The bill does not include some of the most controversial proposals the GOP considered, such as eliminating the extra federal funding that allowed states to dramatically expand the program. Nonetheless, the changes it does propose amount to hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid spending cuts and could cause at least 8.6 million Americans to lose their health coverage, according to a preliminary estimate by the Congressional Budget Office released by the committee's Democrats.",
      "Some of the proposals are more targeted, such as a new financial penalty on states such as California that use their own money to cover people living in the country without legal permission.",
      "Others would have widespread implications. In addition to requiring low-income people to prove their eligibility every six months, the GOP proposal would mandate that nondisabled enrollees younger than 65, with some exceptions, show that they work, volunteer, or attend school at least 80 hours per month.",
      "A work requirement is an easier sell politically because it is not seen as cutting benefits, Billy Wynne, a Colorado-based health consultant, said in an interview before the legislation was unveiled.",
      "But unlike in 2017, when the GOP also proposed implementing work requirements, such a policy is no longer just a theory: Arkansas' program, which was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year, left 18,000 people without coverage -- with no indication the policy led to more people working. And Georgia's program has been plagued by administrative burdens and cost overruns.",
      "In fact, most Medicaid enrollees are already employed -- just 8% of those who would be required to work are not already doing so, according to KFF.",
      "Awareness about Medicaid and its beneficiaries has improved since 2017, Wynne said. \"These are working families, and they vote.\"",
      "During a marathon House committee debate on the legislation that started Tuesday afternoon and continued through Wednesday morning, Rep. Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts, a Democrat, voiced concern that burdensome new paperwork requirements would lead to many low-income people dropping or losing their coverage.",
      "\"These aren't work requirements,\" he said. \"They're paperwork requirements.\"",
      "Another complication for the GOP's current effort is that the focus is not fixing the health system, as it was with the past push to repeal Obamacare. This time, Republicans' main goal is offsetting the cost of extending $4 trillion in tax cuts passed under Trump in 2017 -- separately from the repeal effort -- that will otherwise expire at the end of this year.",
      "Enrollment in Medicaid and its related Children's Health Insurance Program swelled to over 93 million during the pandemic, a record high. Enrollment had fallen below 79 million as of December, but that was still about 5 million more people than were covered during the repeal debate in the summer of 2017.",
      "Medicaid and CHIP cover more than one in five Americans, as well as 40% of children, 41% of births, and long-term care for 62% of nursing home residents.",
      "Congressional Republicans for decades have sought to rein in Medicaid costs by capping federal spending but have faced resistance from Democrats, states, and the health industry.",
      "The 2010 Affordable Care Act provided billions in federal Medicaid funding that enabled 40 states and the District of Columbia to expand the program to over 21 million nondisabled adults. But the law passed with no Republican votes, leaving Medicaid expansion open to partisan squabbling.",
      "The new GOP proposal would require Medicaid enrollees making poverty-level wages or higher to pay copayments of as much as $35 per health care service.",
      "Medicaid usually doesn't require copays, and advocates for low-income people say any out-of-pocket charge at the doctor's office could discourage them from seeking care.",
      "Republican members of Congress face more pressure to avoid coverage cuts for their constituents, with many now representing expansion states, including key Senate leaders from South Dakota (Majority Leader John Thune) and Idaho (Finance Committee Chairman Michael Crapo).",
      "There's also pressure coming from an unusual source: Trump voters.",
      "Last fall, Trump attracted more low-income voters than usual for a GOP presidential candidate.",
      "Those voters are more likely to depend on Medicaid for health coverage. Matt Salo, a Washington, D.C.-based health consultant who was formerly executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said Trump voters have been telling Republicans at town hall meetings that they did not vote for benefit cuts.",
      "\"MAGA voters and people on Medicaid and their family members overlap in ways that have never been true before,\" Salo said, referring to Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement.",
      "Republicans also face unfavorable odds of curtailing a long-standing practice by nearly every state -- known as provider taxes -- through which states pay some of their share of Medicaid costs by taxing hospitals, nursing homes and other providers. Those funds then help states collect more matching dollars from the federal government.",
      "For decades, Republicans have sought to limit Medicaid provider taxes, and their latest proposal would effectively freeze the taxes at current rates, squeezing state programs as costs continue to rise. Since 2017, such taxes have become more commonplace, and some states now rely on the funding for nearly a third of their Medicaid budgets.",
      "Conservative groups and some GOP lawmakers have begun referring to these taxes as \"money-laundering\" schemes, even though they are legal and the taxes are approved by the federal government before states implement them.",
      "One thing that hasn't changed since 2017 is the strong defense of Medicaid from Democrats, hospital executives, and consumer groups, who argue the GOP's plan will leave more people uninsured or unable to pay their bills, and force hospitals to close, worsening access to care.",
      "Yet the Trump White House is better staffed to work with Congress than it was in 2017, and more members of the party, whether out of fear or loyalty, are likely to side with the president. So far this year, the Republican caucus has had just enough votes to confirm Trump's Cabinet and pass a budget framework to tee up legislation to extend his tax cuts.",
      "While the House GOP's plan would amount to major changes for Medicaid, its legislation left out some of the more ground-shifting ideas like capping federal funding per enrollee or nixing extra expansion funding altogether -- and it still needs to earn the approval of Senate Republicans.",
      "Medicaid's chief backers could end up breathing a sigh of relief, just as they did in summer 2017.",

Kennedy Jr., one of the nation's most publicly recognized vaccine skeptics, took a softened approach on vaccines when he answered questions before a House committee Wednesday morning, saying, \"I don't think people should be taking medical advice from me.\"",
      "Kennedy, who also testified before a Senate committee the same day, defended the massive cuts to the department's workforce and laid out his priorities for the Trump administration's proposed budget.",
      "Kennedy's congressional committee appearances marked the first time he testified before Congress since his confirmation hearings in late January, and forced Kennedy to confront statements he made that critics said were evidence of promises broken.",
      "Kennedy says his 'opinions about vaccines are irrelevant'",
      "During the House hearing, Kennedy avoided sharing his own thoughts about vaccines -- which have previously invited skepticism -- instead deferring to the doctors running the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Asked by Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan if he would today vaccinate his own children for measles and chickenpox, Kennedy said \"probably\" for measles, but that \"what I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant.\"",
      "\"I don't want to seem like I'm being evasive, but I don't think people should be taking advice, medical advice from me,\" Kennedy said.",
      "He said he has directed NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya to try to \"lay out the pros and cons, the risks and benefits, accurately as we understand them, with replicable studies,\" for people to \"make that decision.\"",
      "His comments mark a departure from his strong opinions about vaccines before taking office as HHS secretary.",
      "During his confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy said that he supports vaccines, although he refused to unequivocally say that vaccines don't cause autism, despite numerous existing studies already showing there is no link. However, in March, the HHS confirmed that the CDC will study whether vaccines cause autism.",
      "Shortly after Kennedy said people should not take his medical advice, some public health experts criticized the comments -- with one saying that giving people guidance \"is [Kennedy's] job.\"",
      "\"The problem is that is his job -- the top line of his job description -- is the nation's chief health strategist. That is the top line of every health official, federal, state, local leader. That is his job, is to give people the best advice that he can. I believe that he's giving up on, in my view, his chief responsibility,\" Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told reporters on a call in which he and other health leaders responded to Kennedy's testimony in front of the House Appropriations Committee.",
      "Benjamin pointed out that Kennedy has, in fact, seemed to advise people on how to treat measles, leading them toward unproven remedies.",
      "Democrats push Kennedy on cuts: 'You can't fire 90% of the people and assume the work gets done'",
      "Democrats on both the House and Senate committees questioned Kennedy about cuts to HHS -- with several testy exchanges.",
      "In April, HHS began laying off about 10,000 workers and consolidating 28 institutes and centers into 15 new divisions.",
      "Including the roughly 10,000 people who have left over the last few months through early retirement or deferred resignation programs, the overall staff at HHS is expected to fall from 82,000 to around 62,000 -- or about a quarter of its workforce.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, quoting ABC News' reporting last week, asked Kennedy about cuts to the CDC's lead poisoning prevention program.",
      "Though the program has been completely gutted and the expert staff has been laid off, Kennedy said he believes lead poisoning to be an \"extremely significant concern\" and said he does not intend to eliminate the program.",
      "Kennedy suggested that HHS would still spend the money appropriated to the program -- but didn't offer any details on how the work would continue without any expert staff.",
      "In another heated exchange, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray asked Kennedy about cuts to National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, including the reinstatements that are mostly in Ohio and West Virginia. She said no one has been reinstated in the Western states, including at the Spokane, Washington, office that does research into miner safety.",
      "\"The work in NIOSH will not be interrupted,\" Kennedy said. \"We understand it's critically important function, and I did not want to see it end.\"",
      "Murray quipped back, \"I would just say you can't fire 90% of the people and assume the work gets done.\"",
      "During the earlier House hearing, Kennedy continued to maintain that widespread cuts at HHS have not impacted key health programs, saying he has not withheld any funding for lifesaving research at NIH and continues to prioritize pillars such as Head Start, Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "But in a tense back-and-forth with Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro, ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, she demanded Kennedy's assurance that he would not cut programs that have been approved and funded by Congress, which has \"the power of the purse\" ascribed to it in the Constitution.",
      "Kennedy said he would spend appropriated money -- which drew repeated exasperation from DeLauro, who pointed to $20 billion in cuts to NIH.",
      "Kennedy asserted that his goal at HHS is to focus on the chronic disease epidemic and deliver effective services for those who rely on Medicare, Medicaid and other services by cutting costs to taxpayers.",
      "\"We intend to do more, a lot more with less. The budget I'm presenting today supports these goals and reflects two enduring American values, compassion and responsibility,\" Kennedy said.",
      "DeLauro slammed Kennedy and the Trump's administration for the cuts to HHS, including the elimination of entire divisions.",
      "\"Mr. Secretary, you are gutting the life-saving work of the Department of Health and Human Services and its key agencies while the Republicans in this Congress say and do nothing,\" DeLauro said. \"Because of these cuts, people will die.\"",
      "DeLauro also finished the hearing with an impassioned plea for Kennedy to stop cutting programs, telling him he does not have the authority to go against what Congress allocated in the budget.",
      "\"You do not have the authority to do what you are doing,\" she said.",
      "Kennedy defends measles outbreak response, measles vaccine stance",
      "Kennedy rebuked criticism of his agency's response to the measles outbreak, which has surpassed 1,000 cases for the first time in five years, according to the CDC.",
      "A total of 92 patients have been hospitalized over the course of the outbreak and two school-aged children died in Texas. Both were unvaccinated and had no known underlying conditions, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.",
      "\"We are doing a better job at CDC today than any nation in the world controlling this measles outbreak,\" Kennedy said.",
      "DeLauro hit back, saying that Kennedy's comparison of the U.S. response to measles to the response of other countries was unfair.",
      "\"Mr. Secretary, you keep comparing the U.S. to other countries, compare us to Europe, but the Europe you are referring to is the WHO European region, [which] has 53 countries in Europe and in Asia, including those with low ... vaccination rates like Romania and that has never eliminated measles,\" she said. \"If you compare us to western Europe countries that we often compare ourselves to, like Great Britain, they have seen no measles death.\"",
      "Kennedy argued that the U.S. is doing better than other countries in the Americas with smaller populations, including Canada and Mexico.",
      "DeLauro scolded Kennedy for promoting vaccine skepticism in the wake of a measles outbreak spreading across the U.S.",
      "Kennedy has shared contradicting views about vaccines. In a post on X on April 6, Kennedy said that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles\" is to receive the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. However, in a post later that evening, he said more than 300 children have been treated with an antibiotic and a steroid, neither of which are recognized treatments or cures for measles.",
      "A particularly heated moment occurred when Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy told Kennedy that the secretary has equivocated when discussing the measles vaccine. Murphy noted instances in which Kennedy has touted the effectiveness of the vaccine before listing its potential harms.",
      "Kennedy, angry at the line of questioning, interrupted Murphy, claiming his prior comments were true.",
      "When Murphy pressed for Kennedy to say directly whether he recommended the measles vaccine for people, Kennedy, who told CBS News in an April interview that he did recommend the shot, said, \"I am not going to just tell people everything is safe and effective if I know that there's issues. I need to respect people's intelligence.\"",
      "Vaccine specialists say the measles vaccine is durable and two doses in your youth is sufficient for lifelong protection without the need for a booster. The CDC notes on its website that the agency \"considers people who received two doses of measles vaccine as children according to the U.S. vaccination schedule protected for life, and they do not ever need a booster dose.\"",
      "Numerous studies over decades across multiple countries have confirmed the safety and efficacy of the MMR vaccine, the American Academy of Pediatrics notes. Additionally, monitoring for the safety of a vaccine does not end after the shot has been licensed for use. There are federal health databases in which anyone can report side effects or reactions following a vaccine -- officials are then able to review these reports and identify any potential safety issues.",

    "summary": "Smartmatic, in its defamation lawsuit against Fox News, accuses Fox executives of deleting text messages, while a new ruling for Fox could help its defense.",
    "story": [
      "The company claims Fox News \"orchestrated the destruction of text messages.\"",
      "The multibillion dollar defamation lawsuit brought by voting machine company Smartmatic against Fox News lurched forward this week with new allegations filed by Smartmatic that Fox executives destroyed text messages -- and a new ruling Fox News won that will allow them access to new documents that could help their defense.",
      "Smartmatic, in a court filing Wednesday, alleged that Fox News and Fox Corp \"orchestrated the destruction of text messages across all levels of their corporate hierarchy\" -- a filing that comes as Fox continues to fight the defamation lawsuit brought by the voting machine company over the network's 2020 election claims.",
      "Smartmatic claims those who \"deleted their texts\" include founder Rupert Mudoch and chairman Lachlan Murdoch.",
      "\"The destruction was not isolated or accidental,\" the filing, which was largely redacted, claims. \"It was extensive and willful.\"",
      "The claims were revealed in an introduction to the motion that was publicly filed with the court, though the rest of the motion remained redacted due to a 2022 \"confidentially stipulation\" between the parties.",
      "Smartmatic sued Fox and other defendants in 2021, claiming they \"knowingly and intentionally\" lied about Smartmatic in the wake of the 2020 election regarding claims of voting machine fraud, causing Smartmatic to lose business.",
      "Fox has said they were covering newsworthy allegations made by President Donald Trump and others, and has accused Smartmatic of looking to profit off a lawsuit.",
      "In its filing, Smartmatic alleges that \"Fox custodians\" deleted their text messages from November and December 2020, creating \"an evidentiary void.\"",
      "\"Fox has eliminated contemporaneous texts that would have revealed further evidence of what Fox executives knew about the falsity of their broadcasts and why Fox continued airing them anyway,\" the filing states. \"While it championed election fraud on air, behind the scenes Fox ensured that many of its executives' incriminating communications would never see daylight.\"",
      "As such, Smartmatic is asking that the jury in the case \"be charged with an adverse inference instruction\" -- a legal instruction given by a judge to a jury allowing them to assume that the unavailable evidence was unfavorable to the party that was unable to produce it.",
      "The filing from Smartmatic comes one day after a New York appeals judge ruled that Fox News can gain access to documents related to an ongoing Department of Justice investigation into three Smartmatic executives.",
      "In a statement, Fox said Wednesday's motion by Smartmatic was \"a desperate attempt to distract\" from the winning ruling Fox News secured Tuesday in the case.",
      "\"Smartmatic weakly attempts to resurrect stale, baseless discovery issues that actually were disclosed by FOX and resolved two years ago,\" the statement said. \"These issues have no bearing on the merits of Smartmatic's case, which has fallen apart at every turn.\"",
      "The statement went on to say that Fox would be filing its own motion shortly \"that outlines Smartmatic's actual massive failure to preserve evidence, including direct written instructions by Smartmatic's CEO to delete relevant text messages on the eve of filing this lawsuit.\"",
      "Three current and former executives of Smartmatic were charged in a criminal indictment last year accusing them of a \"bribery and money laundering scheme\" in order to obtain contracts in the Philippines, according to an indictment, which does not name Smartmatic by name.",
      "A judge ruled that the documents were \"plainly relevant\" to Smartmatic's profits, which Smartmatic has alleged plunged due to the election-related statements made by Fox. But Fox News has argued there were other factors for Smartmatic's alleged lost profits, such as the criminal indictment.",
      "In a statement responding to the ruling, Smartmatic attorneys claimed they had \"already agreed\" to the discovery.",
      "\"Fox trying to blame anyone other than itself for Smartmatic's injuries is just more lies from Fox,\" said Smartmatic's legal counsel Erik Connolly. \"The writing is on the wall. Lies have consequences.\"",
      "Fox representatives praised the ruling, saying in a statement they were \"pleased\" with the ruling and that the \"factual evidence shows that Smartmatic's business and reputation were badly suffering long before any claims by President Trump's lawyers on FOX News and that Smartmatic grossly inflated its damage claims to generate headlines and chill free speech.\"",
      "Materials that Smartmatic must disclose include \"all internal documents concerning discussions or analysis of the impact of the indictment on the company\" as well as \"all communications received from any actual or potential customer about the indictment.\"",
      "In a statement at the time, Smartmatic said, \"No voter fraud has been alleged and Smartmatic is not indicted. Voters worldwide must be assured that the elections they participate in are conducted with the utmost integrity and transparency. These are the values that Smartmatic lives by.\"",

    "story": [
      "Democratic leaders called Rep. Shri Thanedar's effort \"a distraction.\"",
      "Minutes before the House was scheduled for floor votes, Democratic Rep. Shri Thanedar announced he would not force a vote to impeach President Donald Trump as he had planned.",
      "Thanedar's effort had angered not only Republicans, but also Democratic leaders, who said they would work with Republicans to kill his bill.",
      "Thanedar said he was holding off on his bill, claiming he wanted to add to his impeachment articles to include Trump's plans to accept a Boeing 747 from Qatar as a gift.",
      "\"In the fifteen days since I filed seven articles of impeachment against President Trump, he has committed more impeachable offenses...After talking with many colleagues, I have decided not to force a vote on impeachment today,\" Rep. Thanedar wrote on X. \"Instead, I will add to my articles of impeachment and continue to rally the support of both Democrats and Republicans to defend the Constitution with me.\"",
      "House GOP leaders planned to introduce a motion to table the legislation and kill it before Thanedar's announcement, and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said leaders from his party would join them.",
      "\"Our focus is on health care being stripped away from the American people. That is the most urgent and dire thing that we could be talking about this week. Everything else is a distraction,\" Aguilar said at his weekly news conference.",
      "Taking a jab at Thanedar, Aguilar added that while his conference has its differences, \"this is one that is a pretty easy call.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson called the effort \"another embarrassing political stunt.\"",
      "\"While Democrats are throwing fits, impeding law enforcement, playing political games, and demonstrating how far out of touch they are -- Republicans are working to deliver lower taxes for families, restore American energy dominance, strengthen border security, restore peace through strength, and make government work more efficiently and effectively. The contrast has never been more clear,\" Johnson said in a statement.",
      "At a rally last month celebrating his first 100 days, Trump, who was impeached twice during his first term, said, \"Here we go again.\" He said the fact that Democrats have \"no control\" over \"a dumb guy like this\" shows \"they have no confidence anymore as a party.\"",
      "Thanedar introduced seven articles of impeachment against Trump last month, arguing the president is abusing the power of his office for his own self-interest and repeatedly defied the Constitution, among other broad charges.",
      "Without the backing of the top Democrats in the House nor a majority of his caucus, Thanedar's effort went nowhere until earlier this week when he introduced his impeachment resolution as \"privileged,\" forcing the chamber to consider the legislation within two legislative days.",
      "Thanedar promised to fight on.",
      "\"Will I succeed this week? Maybe not, but we'll continue to do this until we have a victory,\" he said at his news conference. \"We'll continue to fight until we have a victory, until we remove this president from office for his unconstitutional, illegal, impeachable misconduct. We are going to continue.\"",
      "\"[House Democratic leaders] want to focus on other issues, which is fine. I just tell them that, hey, we can do that, and we can do this as well.\"",
      "However, his move would force Democrats to go on the record on this issue. Thanedar dismissed concerns that his efforts could hurt vulnerable Democratic colleagues, arguing that Republicans would have to vote on it as well.",
      "\"We take hard votes every day, every day there is a hard vote to take. That's my job ... They just need to look into not what plays well in politically, not what the polls are saying. We got to do the right thing,\" Thanedar argued.",
      "Thanedar, who was elected to the then-open seat in 2022, faces a tough reelection battle. His fellow Michigan Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a prominent progressive, endorsed Thanedar's primary challenger, state Rep. Donavan McKinney, earlier this week.",
      "\"I'm done with absent members who don't call their residents back,\" Tlaib said in a post on X, referring to Thanedar.",

    "story": [
      "The ruling stands in contrast to the rulings of two other judges.",
      "A federal judge in Pennsylvania ruled Tuesday that President Donald Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged migrant gang members is lawful, but determined that the administration has provided insufficient notice before deporting migrants under the proclamation.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Stephanie Haines' ruling stands in contrast to two other federal judges who have ruled that Trump's use of the AEA for deportations is unlawful.",
      "The Trump administration has invoked the Alien Enemies Act -- an 18th century wartime authority used to remove noncitizens with little-to-no due process -- to carry out deportations by proclaiming that migrant gang members constitute a \"hybrid criminal state\" that is invading the United States.",
      "Haines, a Trump appointee, said she found that the proclamation \"complies with AEA,\" but said that the Trump administration \"must provide greater notice to those subject to removal under the AEA than they are currently providing.\"",
      "In her ruling, Judge Haines said that the declarations submitted by the Trump administration to the court \"indicate that there is factual basis for President Trump's conclusions in the Proclamation\" and pointed to the designation made by Secretary of State Marco Rubio of the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "As a result, Judge Haines said she found that the proclamation meets the definition of a \"predatory incursion\" under the AEA.",
      "Haines also said she will afford \"substantial deference to the conclusion\" by Trump that TdA is \"acting at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.\"",
      "\"It would be intolerable that courts, without the relevant information, should review and perhaps nullify actions of the Executive taken on information properly held in secret,\" Judge Haines said.",
      "However, the judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot remove the petitioner, a Venezuelan man in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody identified as A.S.R., unless he is given 21 days notice and \"an opportunity to be heard.\" Haines added the notice to A.S.R. needs to be in English and Spanish and must clearly \"articulate the fact that he is subject to removal\" under the AEA.",
      "A.S.R., according to the government, was moved to a detention center in Texas last month.",
      "Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement to ABC News that the ACLU disagrees with the judge's ruling on the use of the AEA.",
      "\"The court properly rejected the government's argument that they can remove people with only 12 hours' notice,\" said Gelernt. \"But we disagree with the court's ruling that the Alien Enemies Act can be used during peacetime.\"",
      "In her ruling, Judge Haines said the case \"implicates significant issues.\"",
      "\"In resolving those issues, this Court's unflagging obligation is to apply the law as written,\" Haines wrote in her conclusion. \"The court now leaves it to the Political Branches of the government, and ultimately to the people who elect those individuals to decide whether the laws and those executive them continue to reflect their will.\"",
      "Earlier this month, a Trump-appointed federal judge blocked the Trump administration from deporting migrants under the AEA in Southern District of Texas, ruling that its invocation of the AEA \"exceeds the scope\" of the law.",

      "The plan would temporarily increase the child tax credit, create a MAGA savings account for children and temporarily increase the standard tax deduction. It also calls for a $4 trillion increase to the debt ceiling, which Congress must address by mid-July to avoid default.",
      "Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., laid out the stakes of inaction at the beginning of the hearing.",
      "\"If the Trump tax cuts expire, every single American will face an average tax increase of 22 percent,\u201d Smith said. \u201cDemocrats who vote against this tax relief will be voting for the largest tax hike in American history.\u201d",
      "But Democrats contend that the legislation could suck the U.S. economy into a recession.",
      "\u201cThis legislation pours gasoline on a fire that\u2019s already burning,\u201d Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the committee, said -- laying out the basis for his party\u2019s opposition. \u201cAmericans are buckling under chaos Republicans helped create. And this bill would make it worse.\u201d",
      "Some moderate Republicans have been adamant about not cutting into Medicaid, a benefit many of their constituents rely on.",
      "The legislation also includes one of the most controversial components -- a tax proposal that would hike the cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT) from $10,000 to $30,000 for those earning less than $400,000, which some moderate Republicans from states with higher taxes say is not enough.",
      "New York Rep. Nick LaLota said he is \u201cstill a hell no\u201d in a post on X.",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler of New York told Bloomberg TV the proposal was \u201cwoefully inadequate,\u201d adding that he will vote against the bill if it comes to the floor.",
      "\u201cWe will continue to work in good faith with leadership, with the administration to get this done, but we need to have an honest and serious discussion about the issue,\u201d he added.",
      "Here's what's in the bill:",
      "Medicaid cuts",
      "Medicaid work requirements: The bill would impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients -- at least 80 hours per month -- or require enrolling in an educational program for at least 80 hours or some combination per month.",
      "More frequent eligibility checks: The legislation would require states to conduct more frequent eligibility determinations -- from every 12 months to every six months.",
      "Prohibits Medicaid funds for gender transition for minors: The measure would ban federal Medicaid funds from going to gender-affirming care for transgender minors.",
      "Blocks Medicaid funding for non-citizens: Federal funding would be blocked from going to states that provide health care coverage under Medicare for migrants in the country without authorization.",
      "Targets Medicaid funding for organizations that provide abortions: The measure includes language that would essentially prohibit health care providers who offer abortion services from receiving Medicaid funds.",
      "Drug pricing: The bill makes a change to the Inflation Reduction Act and allows drugs to be exempt from Medicare\u2019s drug price negotiation if they are approved to treat multiple diseases.",
      "Cuts energy programs in Inflation Reduction Act: The proposal would cut Inflation Reduction Act programs like spending on electric vehicles, claw back climate-related federal funding and phase out clean energy credits.",
      "Tax provisions",
      "No tax on tips: A huge tax break for the service industry and a provision that was also trumpeted by Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for president, though she tied the tax break to an increase for the federal minimum wage. This is temporary and would expire at the end of 2028.",
      "No tax on overtime: Would relieve millions of Americans who work overtime. This is temporary and would also expire at the end of 2028.",
      "Extension of 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act: Makes tax from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent; does not include a tax increase on the wealthiest earners. Trump posted last week that the proposal shouldn\u2019t raise taxes on high-earners, \u201cbut I'm OK if they do!!!\"",
      "Creation of MAGA savings account for children: The contribution limit for any taxable year is $5,000. It includes a pilot program to start the accounts with $1,000.",
      "SALT: Lifts state and local tax deduction cap to $30,000 with an income phase-down above $400,000. Married couples filing taxes separately are subject to a $15,000 cap and phase-down above $200,000 income.",
      "Debt limit increase: The measure calls for increasing the debt limit by $4 trillion. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week lawmakers must address the debt limit by mid-July to avoid a default.",
      "Enhanced tax deduction for seniors: Seniors would get a $4,000 higher standard tax deduction subject to income limits. This is temporary and would also expire at the end of 2028.",
      "Hikes excise tax on colleges: Those with endowments over $2 million per student would increase from 1.4% to 21%, targeting Ivy League schools. Religious schools would be exempt.",
      "Child tax credit: A temporary increase from $1,000 to $2,500 through 2028 and to $2,000 after that. Recipients will be required to have a Social Security number.",
      "Deduction for qualified business: The bill would increase the deduction for qualified business income from 20% to 22%.",
      "Extends increased estate and gift tax exemption: Would increase the estate and gift tax exemption to $15 million.",
      "Elevates standard tax deduction: The measure includes some new tax cuts like temporarily elevating the standard deduction by $2,000 to $32,000 for 2025 for joint filers and by $1,000 to $16,000 through 2028.",

      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama lawmakers on Wednesday approved enhanced legal protections for police officers, changes that Republicans said show support for law enforcement but Democrats called \u201ca green light to kill Black folks.\u201d",
      "The Alabama Legislature gave final approval to the legislation that sets legal standards for the use of force and provides for an immunity hearing. The bill states that an officer \u201cshall be justified\u201d in the use of physical force as long as it is not constitutionally excessive force or \u201crecklessly\u201d outside of the officer\u2019s discretionary authority.",
      "Republicans, who called the legislation the \u201cBack The Blue\u201d bill said it is needed to provide a clear legal framework and show support for law enforcement officers faced with making split-second decisions.",
      "\u201cWe ask them to take care of us, keep us safe in our homes as we sleep at night. This bill will give them the assurances that we back them and back the blue,\u201d Sen. Lance Bell, a former deputy sheriff, said. Bell said officers who act improperly can still be prosecuted.",
      "The approval came after an emotional debate in which Black lawmakers read the names of Black people who have been killed by police and described their own encounters with law enforcement.",
      "\u201cHB 202 is a license to kill Black people. That\u2019s what it is,\u201d Sen. Rodger Smitherman, a Black Democrat from Birmingham, said.",
      "Smitherman said departments have very good officers, but they also have officers who are \u201cracist against Black people\u201d or will make impulsive decisions because they are scared.",
      "Sen. Merika Coleman, a Black Democrat from Pleasant Grove, said she fears the bill will protect \u201cbad apples\u201d in police departments. She described her worries that someone might see her honors student son as a threat someday because of his tall frame and twisted locs.",
      "\u201cIf this bill passes and there are young Black males, females, brown and other folks killed, you will have blood on your hands because of this piece of legislation,\u201d Coleman said.",
      "Bell urged opponents to \u201cwalk a mile in a law enforcement officer\u2019s shoes and find out what they have to deal with.\u201d Smitherman responded, \u201cWalk a mile in the person\u2019s shoes when the person is dead.\u201d",
      "The Alabama Senate approved the bill on a 25-6 late-night vote in the final hour of the legislative session. The House of Representatives accepted Senate changes. The bill now goes to Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey who said she will sign it into law.",
      "\u201cThere is NO question Alabama backs the blue!\u201d Ivey stated on social media after the bill\u2019s passage.",
      "Under existing state law, police and civilians alike are currently entitled to a \u201cstand your ground\u201d hearing in criminal cases where a judge can determine whether the defendant acted in self defense. The legislation will allow an immunity hearing where a judge will decide if a case can proceed based on whether the officer acted recklessly outside the scope of law enforcement duties. It would add similar protections in state civil lawsuits. It would also require law enforcement departments to collect data that tracks use of force complaints.",
      "The executive director of the Alabama Sheriff\u2019s Association, Hoss Mack, testified in favor of the bill in April.",
      "\u201cThis is of equal benefit to law enforcement and the public. Let me reiterate what this bill does not do. It does not give blanket immunity to law enforcement,\u201d said Mack, who added that he had personally arrested officers that worked for him for misconduct throughout his 39-year career in law enforcement.",
      "Leroy Maxwell, a civil rights attorney based in Birmingham, said he is afraid the bill would embolden misconduct.",
      "\u201cLegislation like this paves the way toward a police state, where law enforcement operates above the law and without fear of consequence,\u201d Maxwell said.",
      "Civil rights attorney Harry Daniels opposed the law but doubted the overall impact on civil rights cases which could still be filed in federal court and will not be affected by the legislation.",
      "\u201cIt is a lion with no teeth. It appears to be big and bad but it has no teeth and no claws,\u201d Daniels said.",

    "story": [
      "A suspected serial killer once scrutinized for a possible link to the O.J. Simpson case that riveted the nation in the 1990s is facing execution for a murder",
      "STARKE, Fla. -- A suspected serial killer once scrutinized for a possible link to the O.J. Simpson case that riveted the nation in the mid-1990s is scheduled to be executed Thursday in Florida for the murder of a woman in a Tampa motel room.",
      "Glen Rogers, 62, is set to receive a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke, barring a last-day reprieve. He was convicted in Florida of the 1995 murder of Tina Marie Cribbs, a 34-year-old mother of two he had met at a bar.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court denied Rogers' final appeals on Wednesday without comment.",
      "Rogers would be the fifth inmate put to death in Florida this year. As of May 1, 15 people have been executed this year in the U.S. in eight states, according to the Death Penalty Information Center\u2019s website. That compares with 25 people in all of 2024, the center reported.",
      "He also drew a separate death sentence in California for the 1995 strangulation killing of Sandra Gallagher, a mother of three whom he had met at a bar in Van Nuys in that state. That killing came weeks before the Cribbs murder. Rogers was stopped after a highway chase in Kentucky while driving Cribbs\u2019 car soon after her death.",
      "Rogers was named as a suspect but never convicted in several other slayings around the country, once telling police he had killed about 70 people. He later recanted that statement, but had been the subject of documentaries including one from 2012 called \u201cMy Brother the Serial Killer\u201d that featured his brother Clay and a criminal profiler who had corresponded extensively with Rogers.",
      "The documentary raised questions about whether Rogers could have been responsible for the 1994 stabbing deaths of Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.",
      "During a 1995 murder trial that drew intense media attention, the former football star and celebrity Simpson was acquitted of all charges. Los Angeles police and prosecutors subsequently said after the documentary's release that they didn't think Rogers had any involvement in the Simpson and Goldman killings.",
      "\u201cWe know who killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. We have no reason to believe that Mr. Rogers was involved,\" the Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement at the time.",
      "Simpson had always professed innocence but was later found liable for the deaths in a separate civil case, and then served nine years in prison on unrelated charges. The 76-year-old Simpson died in April 2024 after battling cancer.",
      "Rogers, originally from Hamilton, Ohio, has also been labeled the \u201cCasanova Killer\u201d or \u201cCross Country Killer\" in various media reports. Some of his alleged and proven female victims had similar characteristics: ages in their 30s, a petite frame and red hair.",
      "Rogers' lawyers have filed several appeals with state and federal courts, none successful. One argument was that newly enacted state legislation authorizing the death penalty for trafficking in young children makes clear the abuse he suffered as a child is now taken seriously and should result in a life prison sentence for Rogers. That argument was rejected.",
      "Florida uses a three-drug cocktail for its lethal injection: a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the Corrections Department.",
      "Anthony Wainwright is the next Florida inmate scheduled for execution \u2014 on June 10 \u2014 under a death warrant signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. Wainwright, 54, was convicted of kidnapping a woman from a supermarket parking lot in Lake City in 1994 and raping and killing her.",

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in its first case stemming from the flurry of actions marking the start of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court is hearing arguments Thursday in its first case stemming from the blitz of actions that have marked the start of President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "Before the court are the Trump administration's emergency appeals of lower court orders putting nationwide holds on the Republican president's push to deny citizenship to children born to people who are in the United States illegally.",
      "Birthright citizenship is among several issues, many related to immigration, that the administration has asked the court to address on an emergency basis, after lower courts acted to slow the president's agenda.",
      "The justices are also considering the administration's pleas to end humanitarian parole for more than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and to strip other temporary legal protections from another 350,000 Venezuelans. The administration remains locked in legal battles over its efforts to swiftly deport people accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador under an 18th century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "In Thursday's arguments, the justices will be weighing whether judges have the authority to issue what are called nationwide, or universal, injunctions. The Trump administration, like the Biden administration before it, has complained that judges are overreaching by issuing orders that apply to everyone instead of just the parties before the court.",
      "Yet in discussing the limits of a judge's power, the court almost certainly will have to take up the change to citizenship that Trump wants to make, which would upset the settled understanding of birthright citizenship that has existed for more than 125 years.",
      "The first sentence of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution reads: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d",
      "The Citizenship Clause, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War, was included to ensure that formerly enslaved people would be citizens. It effectively overturned the notorious Dred Scott decision, in which the Supreme Court held that Black people, no matter their status, were not citizens.",
      "Since at least 1898 and the Supreme Court case of Wong Kim Ark, the provision has been widely interpreted to make citizens of everyone born on U.S. soil except for the children of diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in the U.S. during hostile occupation; and, until a federal law changed things in 1924, sovereign Native American tribes.",
      "Trump's executive order would deny citizenship to children if neither parent is a citizen or lawful permanent resident. Those categories include people who are in the country illegally or temporarily because, the administration contends, they are not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States.",
      "Almost immediately, states, immigrants and rights groups sued to block the executive order, accusing the Republican administration of trying to unsettle the understanding of birthright citizenship. Every court to consider the issue has sided with the challengers.",
      "The administration is asking for the court orders to be reined in, not overturned entirely, and spends little time defending the executive order. The Justice Department argues that there has been an \u201cexplosion\u201d in the number of nationwide injunctions issued since Trump retook the White House. The far-reaching court orders violate the law as well as long-standing views on a judge's authority, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote on behalf of the administration.",
      "Courts typically deal only with the parties before them. Even class actions reach only the people who are part of a class certified by a judge, though those can affect millions of people, Sauer wrote.",
      "Nationwide injunctions, by contrast, have no limits and can even include parties who oppose what the court orders are designed to protect, he wrote. As an example, Sauer pointed to Republican-led states that favor the administration's position but are subject to the nationwide injunctions.",
      "But the justices may well ask about Trump's executive order and perhaps even tip their hand.",
      "Lawyers for the states and immigrants argue that this is an odd issue for the court to use to limit judges' authority because courts have uniformly found that Trump's order likely violates the Constitution. Limiting the number of people who are protected by the rulings would create a confusing patchwork of rules in which new restrictions on citizenship could temporarily take effect in 27 states. That means a child born in a state that is challenging Trump's order would be a citizen, but a child born at the same time elsewhere would not, the lawyers said.",
      "The Supreme Court almost always takes up the underlying substance of a dispute, not an emergency appeal of court orders issued early in a legal case.",
      "The main argument against the court deciding too much on the emergency, or shadow, docket is that the justices are intervening too early in the process, sometimes before lower courts have had much to say or the legal arguments are fully developed.",
      "Last year, the justices heard arguments in emergency appeals, then blocked the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s air pollution-fighting \u201cgood neighbor\u201d plan, which aimed to restrict smokestack emissions from power plants and other industrial sources that burden downwind areas with smog-causing pollution.",
      "Two years earlier, the court delivered a split decision that allowed rules requiring COVID-19 vaccines for health care workers but not for employees of large companies.",

      "Benjamin Ritchie is scheduled to be executed Tuesday in the fatal shooting of Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney in September 2000. According to court records, Ritchie jumped out of a stolen van after a police pursuit. Toney was chasing him when Ritchie turned and shot him four times.",
      "A jury convicted Ritchie of murder and other offenses in 2002. Ritchie has unsuccessfully challenged the convictions at the state and federal level.

      "An independent review later found that none of the drugs prepared for the seven inmates executed in Tennessee since 2018 had been fully tested.",
      "The Tennessee Department of Correction issued a new execution protocol in late December that will utilize the single drug pentobarbital.",

      "Alabama last year became the first state to carry out an execution with nitrogen gas. Nitrogen has now been used in five executions \u2014 four in Alabama and one in Louisiana.

      "The Alabama Legislature gave final approval to the legislation that sets legal standards for the use of force and provides for an immunity hearing. The bill states that an officer \u201cshall be justified\u201d in the use of physical force as long as it is not constitutionally excessive force or \u201crecklessly\u201d outside of the officer\u2019s discretionary authority.",
      "Republicans, who called the legislation the \u201cBack The Blue\u201d bill said it is needed to provide a clear legal framework and show support for law enforcement officers faced with making split-second decisions.",
      "\u201cWe ask them to take care of us, keep us safe in our homes as we sleep at night. This bill will give them the assurances that we back them and back the blue,\u201d Sen. Lance Bell, a former deputy sheriff, said. Bell said officers who act improperly can still be prosecuted.",
      "The approval came after an emotional debate in which Black lawmakers read the names of Black people who have been killed by police and described their own encounters with law enforcement.",
      "\u201cHB 202 is a license to kill Black people. That\u2019s what it is,\u201d Sen. Rodger Smitherman, a Black Democrat from Birmingham, said.",
      "Smitherman said departments have very good officers, but they also have officers who are \u201cracist against Black people\u201d or will make impulsive decisions because they are scared.",
      "Sen. Merika Coleman, a Black Democrat from Pleasant Grove, said she fears the bill will protect \u201cbad apples\u201d in police departments. She described her worries that someone might see her honors student son as a threat someday because of his tall frame and twisted locs.",
      "\u201cIf this bill passes and there are young Black males, females, brown and other folks killed, you will have blood on your hands because of this piece of legislation,\u201d Coleman said.",
      "Bell urged opponents to \u201cwalk a mile in a law enforcement officer\u2019s shoes and find out what they have to deal with.\u201d Smitherman responded, \u201cWalk a mile in the person\u2019s shoes when the person is dead.\u201d",
      "The Alabama Senate approved the bill on a 25-6 late-night vote in the final hour of the legislative session. The House of Representatives accepted Senate changes. The bill now goes to Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey who said she will sign it into law.",
      "\u201cThere is NO question Alabama backs the blue!\u201d Ivey stated on social media after the bill\u2019s passage.",
      "Under existing state law, police and civilians alike are currently entitled to a \u201cstand your ground\u201d hearing in criminal cases where a judge can determine whether the defendant acted in self defense. The legislation will allow an immunity hearing where a judge will decide if a case can proceed based on whether the officer acted recklessly outside the scope of law enforcement duties. It would add similar protections in state civil lawsuits. It would also require law enforcement departments to collect data that tracks use of force complaints.",
      "The executive director of the Alabama Sheriff\u2019s Association, Hoss Mack, testified in favor of the bill in April.",
      "\u201cThis is of equal benefit to law enforcement and the public. Let me reiterate what this bill does not do. It does not give blanket immunity to law enforcement,\u201d said Mack, who added that he had personally arrested officers that worked for him for misconduct throughout his 39-year career in law enforcement.",
      "Leroy Maxwell, a civil rights attorney based in Birmingham, said he is afraid the bill would embolden misconduct.",
      "\u201cLegislation like this paves the way toward a police state, where law enforcement operates above the law and without fear of consequence,\u201d Maxwell said.",
      "Civil rights attorney Harry Daniels opposed the law but doubted the overall impact on civil rights cases which could still be filed in federal court and will not be affected by the legislation.",
      "\u201cIt is a lion with no teeth. It appears to be big and bad but it has no teeth and no claws,\u201d Daniels said.",

      "Harvard University for decades assumed it had a cheap copy of the Magna Carta in its collection, a stained and faded document it had purchased for less than $30",
      "BOSTON -- Harvard University for decades assumed it had a cheap copy of the Magna Carta in its collection, a stained and faded document it had purchased for less than $30.",
      "But two researchers have concluded it has something much more valuable \u2014 a rare version from 1300 issued by Britain's King Edward I.",
      "The original Magna Carta established in 1215 the principle that the king is subject to law, and it has formed the basis of constitutions globally. There are four copies of the original and, until now, there were believed to be only six copies of the 1300 version.",
      "\u201cMy reaction was one of amazement and, in a way, awe that I should have managed to find a previously unknown Magna Carta,\u201d said David Carpenter, a professor of medieval history at King\u2019s College London. He was searching the Harvard Law School Library website in December 2023 when he found the digitized document.",
      "\u201cFirst, I\u2019d found one of the most rare documents and most significant documents in world constitutional history,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cBut secondly, of course, it was astonishment that Harvard had been sitting on it for all these years without realizing what it was.\u201d",
      "Carpenter teamed up with Nicholas Vincent, a professor of medieval history at Britain's University of East Anglia, to confirm the authenticity of Harvard's document.",
      "Comparing it to the other six copies from 1300, Carpenter found the dimensions matched up. He and Vincent then turned to images Harvard librarians created using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging. The technology helps scholars see details on faded documents that are not visible to the human eye.",
      "That allowed them to compare the texts word-for-word, as well as the handwriting, which include a large capital \u2018E\u2019 at the start in \u2018Edwardus\u2019 and elongated letters in the first line.",
      "After the 1215 original printed by King John, five other editions were written in the following decades \u2014 until 1300, the last time the full document was set out and authorized by the king\u2019s seal.",
      "The 1300 version of Magna Carta is \"different from the previous versions in a whole series of small ways and the changes are found in every single one,\u201d Carpenter said.",
      "Harvard had to meet a high bar to prove authenticity, Carpenter said, and it did so \u201cwith flying colors.\u201d",
      "Its tattered and faded copy of the Magna Carta is worth millions of dollars, Carpenter estimated \u2014 though Harvard has no plans to sell it. A 1297 version of the Magna Carta sold at auction in 2007 for $21.3 million.",
      "The other mystery behind the document was the journey it took to Harvard.",
      "That task was left to Vincent, who was able to trace it all the way back to the former parliamentary borough of Appleby in Westmorland, England.",
      "The Harvard Law School library purchased its copy in 1946 from a London book dealer for $27.50. At the time, it was wrongly dated as being made in 1327.",
      "Vincent determined the document was sent to a British auction house in 1945 by a World War I flying ace who also played a role defending Malta in World War II. The war hero, Forster Maynard, inherited the archives from Thomas and John Clarkson, who were leading campaigners against the slave trade. One of them, Thomas Clarkson, became friends with William Lowther, hereditary lord of the manor of Appleby, and he possibly gave it to Clarkson.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a chain of connection there, as it were, a smoking gun, but there isn\u2019t any clear proof as yet that this is the Appleby Magna Carta. But it seems to me very likely that it is,\u201d Vincent said. He said he would like to find a letter or other documentation showing the Magna Carta was given to Thomas Clarkson.",
      "Vincent and Carpenter plan to visit Harvard in June to see its Magna Carta firsthand \u2014 and they say the document is as relevant as ever at a time when Harvard is clashing with the Trump administration over how much authority the federal government should have over its leadership, admissions and activism on campus.",
      "\u201cIt turns up at Harvard at precisely the moment where Harvard is under attack as a private institution by a state authority that seems to want to tell Harvard what to do,\u201d Vincent said.",
      "It also is a chance for a new generation to learn about the Magna Carta, which played a part in the founding of the United States \u2014 from the Declaration of Independence to the adoption of the Bill of Rights. Seventeen states have incorporated aspects of it into their laws.",
      "\u201cWe think of law libraries as places where people can come and understand the underpinnings of democracy,\u201d said Amanda Watson, the assistant dean for library and information services at Harvard Law School. \u201cTo think that Magna Carta could inspire new generations of people to think about individual liberty and what that means and what self-governance means is very exciting.\u201d",

      "Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is set to appear in federal court Thursday for a status conference on the Trump administration's charge he trespassed at an immigration detention center in the city last week.",
      "Baraka, a Democrat running for governor in the June 10 primary, will be at the procedural hearing, his office said. U.S. Magistrate Judge Andr\u00e9 Espinosa set the conference after he agreed to a motion from interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, who requested to cancel a preliminary hearing in light of court rules that don't require such hearings for \u201cpetty offenses.\u201d",
      "The trespassing charge against Baraka has a statutory maximum sentence of 30 days in prison. The mayor has denied the charge.",
      "Witnesses said the arrest last week came after Baraka attempted to join three members of New Jersey\u2019s congressional delegation, Reps. Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver, and Bonnie Watson Coleman, in attempting to enter the facility.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday decried the \u201cspectacle\u201d at the detention facility, calling it a \u201cnew low for congressional Democrats.\u201d He said Republicans are having conversations about possible disciplinary action, including censuring the three Democrats or removing them from House committees.",
      "Messages seeking comment Wednesday were left with the members of Congress who were there.",
      "Baraka, an outspoken opponent of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown and a vocal opponent of the facility\u2019s opening, returned to the center Tuesday, but left without incident.",
      "It was not immediately clear how Baraka\u2019s appearance at the gates Tuesday differed from Friday when he was arrested.",
      "He has denied being on the detention facility\u2019s property, which is run by private prison operator Geo Group.",
      "In video of the Friday altercation shared with The Associated Press, a federal official in a jacket with the Homeland Security Investigations logo can be heard telling Baraka he could not enter the facility because \u201cyou are not a Congress member.\u201d",
      "Baraka then left the secure area, rejoining protesters on the public side of the gate. Video showed him speaking through the gate to a man in a suit, who said: \u201cThey\u2019re talking about coming back to arrest you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on their property. They can\u2019t come out on the street and arrest me,\u201d Baraka replied.",
      "Minutes later, several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, some wearing face coverings, surrounded him and others on the public side. Baraka was dragged back through the gate in handcuffs.",
      "Delaney Hall is a two-story building next to a county prison and formerly operated as a halfway house. In February, ICE awarded a 15-year contract to The Geo Group Inc. to run the detention center. Geo valued the contract at $1 billion in an unusually long and large agreement for ICE.",

      "A Wisconsin judge accused of helping a man evade U.S. immigration authorities is set to enter a plea in federal court",
      "MILWAUKEE -- A Wisconsin judge accused of helping a man evade U.S. immigration authorities was set to appear in federal court Thursday and enter a preliminary plea.",
      "Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan is charged with concealing an individual to prevent arrest and obstruction. Prosecutors say she escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back jury door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in the courthouse seeking his arrest for being in the country illegally. She could face up to six years in prison if convicted on both counts",
      "Dugan was scheduled to appear in federal court Thursday morning for an arraignment, an early step in the criminal justice process. Defendants routinely plead not guilty at this point to give their attorneys time to investigate and to preserve their right to a trial.",
      "The FBI arrested Dugan on April 25 at the courthouse where she works and she was later released from custody. Her arrest escalated a clash between the Trump administration and Democrats over President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Her case is similar to one brought during the Trump's first term against a Massachusetts judge, who was accused of helping a man sneak out a courthouse back door to evade a waiting immigration enforcement agent.",
      "Dugan\u2019s attorneys filed a motion Wednesday to dismiss the case, saying she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and therefore is immune to prosecution. They also maintain the federal government violated Wisconsin\u2019s state sovereignty by disrupting a state courtroom and prosecuting a state judge.",
      "According to court documents, Flores-Ruiz illegally reentered the U.S. after being deported in 2013. Online state court records show he was charged with three counts of misdemeanor domestic abuse in Milwaukee County in March. He was in Dugan's courtroom on April 18 for a hearing.",
      "Court documents say Dugan was alerted to the agents' presence by her clerk, who was informed by an attorney that the agents appeared to be in the hallway. An affidavit says Dugan was visibly angry and called the situation \u201cabsurd\u201d before leaving the bench and retreating to her chambers. She and another judge later approached members of the arrest team in the courthouse with what witnesses described as a \u201cconfrontational, angry demeanor.\u201d",
      "After a back-and-forth with the agents over the warrant for Flores-Ruiz, Dugan demanded they speak with the chief judge and led them from the courtroom, according to the affidavit.",
      "After she returned to the courtroom, witnesses heard her say something to the effect of \u201cwait, come with me\u201d before ushering Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out through a door typically used only by deputies, jurors, court staff and in-custody defendants, according to the affidavit. Flores-Ruiz was free on a signature bond in the abuse case, according to online state court records. Federal agents ultimately captured him outside the courthouse after a foot chase.",
      "The state Supreme Court suspended Dugan last week, saying the move was necessary to preserve public confidence in the judiciary.",
      "A former federal prosecutor in Wisconsin, John Vaudreuil, said the Trump administration wants to make an example out of Dugan. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi or Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche are likely making the decisions on how to proceed rather than the local U.S. attorney in Milwaukee, making it less likely prosecutors will reduce the charges against Dugan in a deal, he said.",
      "Her attorneys will likely try to push the case to a jury trial, Vaudreuil said, because they know that \u201cpeople feel very strongly about the way the president and administration is conducting immigration policy.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- The head of the Environmental Protection Agency came under bipartisan criticism Wednesday over his agency's actions to cancel billions of dollars in congressionally approved spending to address chronic pollution in minority communities and jump-start clean energy programs across the country.",
      "Nearly 800 grants were awarded by former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration under the 2022 climate law, which directed the EPA to spend $3 billion on grants to help low-income and minority communities improve their air and water and protect against climate change. The law allocated another $20 billion under a so-called green bank program to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects nationwide.",
      "Funding for both programs was abruptly terminated by the Trump administration in actions that Democrats have denounced as illegal and unconstitutional.",
      "Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat, said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has illegally withheld, or impounded, climate-law funding despite a decades-old law that explicitly prohibits such actions by the executive branch. Repeated court rulings, including by the Supreme Court, support the power of Congress to set federal spending levels.",
      "Zeldin's budget maneuvers \u201cendanger communities by making it harder to address pollution and climate chaos,\u201d Merkley said at a hearing Wednesday.",
      "Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, chair of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the environment, also criticized Zeldin, saying funding freezes approved by his agency \u2014 including to grants intended for rural communities in Alaska \u2014 were \u201csomewhat indiscriminate.\u2033",
      "Murkowski questioned whether severe budget cuts proposed by President Donald Trump were \u201cserious.\u201d Many of the proposals, such as an 88% cut to a state revolving fund for clean water, are likely to be reversed by Congress, she said.",
      "The EPA's approach under Zeldin is \u201cproblematic,\u201d Murkowski added. \u201cEPA has not adhered to our guidelines and has been largely unresponsive to questions,\" she said.",
      "Zeldin told Murkowski she has a special phone number for his office and can call him any time.",
      "His exchanges with Democrats were less friendly.",
      "\u201cSo you understand that when you impound funds, you\u2019re violating the law?\" Merkley asked Zeldin, a former New York congressman who took over at EPA in January.",
      "\u201cNo, Senator, we are going to follow all statutory obligations,'' Zeldin replied. \u201cWe absolutely disagree with you very strongly.''",
      "Asked under what authority the money was being withheld, Zeldin cited \u201cpolicy priorities\u201d under Trump that differ from Biden-era views.",
      "\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t the Biden administration that passed this law. It was Congress,'' Merkley shot back. \u201dAnd so, this is in the law as written, and it\u2019s signed by the president, and yet you\u2019re defying it.''",
      "Zeldin said he rejected Merkley's premise, adding, \"We couldn\u2019t possibly disagree more strongly with what you\u2019re saying.''",
      "If he can't follow his oath of office, Zeldin should resign, Merkley said, a suggestion Zeldin immediately rejected.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state said Zeldin and Trump shared an approach when it comes to EPA: \"Burn it down.''",
      "Money being withheld by EPA would pay for things like heat pumps to reduce energy costs and pollution, wildfire preparedness and infrastructure upgrades to protect drinking water from floods and earthquakes, Murray said. \"Blocking this funding is hurting communities everywhere,'' she said.",
      "Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff asked Zeldin why he had canceled a $19.8 million grant to Thomasville, Georgia, to replace a wastewater collection system and build a community health clinic.",
      "\u201cIs a new health clinic for Thomasville woke?\u201d Ossoff asked, noting that the grant was approved under an environmental justice program the EPA has terminated.",

      "Zeldin declined to provide specific goals for EPA staffing under his tenure, but appeared to acknowledge claims by Merkley and Murray that staff totals could return to a level last seen under former President Ronald Reagan. The EPA had fewer than 11,000 employees in 1983, compared to more than 15,100 in 2024.",
      "The agency has laid off hundreds of employees and offered voluntary retirement or deferred resignations to thousands more as part of a broader effort by Trump and adviser Elon Musk to downsize the federal workforce.",

      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order this week setting a 30-day deadline for drugmakers to electively lower prices in the U.S. or face new limits on what the government will pay",
      "President Donald Trump incorrectly placed the blame for high prescription drug prices in the U.S. on foreign nations, making the comments Monday when signing an executive order intended to lower their cost.",
      "The order sets a 30-day deadline for drugmakers to electively lower prices in the U.S. or face new limits in the future over what the government will pay. If favorable deals are not reached, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be tasked with developing a new rule that ties prices the U.S. pays for medications to lower prices paid by other countries.",
      "Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "CLAIM: \u201cWe were subsidizing others\u2019 healthcare, the countries where they pay a small fraction of what \u2014 for the same drug that what we pay, many, many times more for, and will no longer tolerate profiteering and price gouging from Big Pharma. But again, it was really the countries that forced Big Pharma to do things that frankly, I'm not sure they really felt comfortable doing. But they've gotten away with it, these countries. European Union has been brutal, brutal.\u201d",
      "THE FACTS: This is misleading. Prices for most prescription drugs \u2014 unbranded generics are the exception \u2014 are higher in the U.S. than they are in other high-income countries. But, experts say, it is in large part the way drug prices are negotiated in the U.S. that drives up costs.",
      "\u201cThere are structural differences in the way that we price drugs in the United States and in the way that other developed, industrialized countries price drugs,\u201d said Mariana Socal, an associate professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins University who studies the U.S. pharmaceutical market. \u201cAnd those differences really are the ones that account for these differences in price that we see at the end of the day.\u201d",
      "A 2024 report published by the RAND research organization found, using 2022 data, that prices in the U.S. were 2.78 times higher than those in 33 comparable countries across all drugs. Brand-name drugs represented the largest gap. The U.S. made up 62% of sales out of $989 billion of total drug spending among the countries studied, according to the report, but only 24% of volume.",
      "According to experts, drug companies in the U.S. are generally able to price medications higher in the U.S. because the country's drug market operates as a fragmented system where companies negotiate with individual insurers or pharmacy benefit managers, commonly known as PBMs. Many countries with lower costs have one regulatory agency that negotiates prices on behalf of the entire population, a significant bargaining chip given that drug companies can't divide and conquer as they can in the U.S. If a regulator walks away, the company loses out on profits entirely \u2014 in other words, something is better than nothing.",
      "\u201cAnything you can do to kind of bring more bargaining power to the table against the drug companies by making a decision for more beneficiaries, or more patients, that's going to put more downward pressure on drug prices,\u201d said Courtney Yarbrough, an assistant professor of health policy and management at Emory University.",
      "As it stands, drug costs in the U.S. and other countries are not directly linked, though they can affect each other. Trump\u2019s executive order establishes a \u201cmost favored nation\u201d pricing model should drugmakers not voluntarily lower costs. This means that the U.S. would peg the cost of prescription drugs to the lowest prices in comparably developed countries. It\u2019s unclear what \u2014 if any \u2014 impact the order will have on millions of Americans who have private health insurance. The federal government has the most power to shape the price it pays for drugs covered by Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "But the U.S. paying less for prescription drugs doesn\u2019t mean other countries will automatically pay more. For example, Yarbrough explained that instead of agreeing to higher prices, other countries could simply enter into secret arrangements for increased discounts and then hide what they actually pay.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not in a static global pharmaceutical market,\u201d she said.",
      "Manufacturers, wholesalers, PBMs and other members of the supply chain also have a motivation to maximize profits, not lower costs for consumers. In this spirit, manufacturers often use patents to make it impossible for cheaper versions of drugs to come to market. Although he repeatedly defended pharmaceutical companies at Monday's news conference, Trump simultaneously threatened the companies with federal investigations into their practices.",
      "\u201cThere are no saints in this industry, these are all for-profit companies,\u201d said Geoffrey Joyce, director of health policy at the University of Southern California\u2019s Schaeffer Center. \u201cTheir incentives are all wrong. Everybody makes more money off of higher list prices, so they just push list prices up.\u201d",

      "Denka also attributed much of its financial woes to what it has described as \u201cunfair and targeted\u201d pollution control measures.",
      "Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency sought to rein in dangerous chemical emissions from hundreds of facilities including Denka's. The Biden administration's environmental justice campaign spotlighted Denka's plant, located about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of New Orleans in St. John the Baptist Parish.",
      "Under the Trump administration, the EPA withdrew a federal lawsuit against Denka alleging it exposed a predominantly Black population to unacceptable cancer risk \u2014 the highest nationwide \u2014 from the facility's emissions of chloroprene. Last year, officials shut down a nearby elementary school due to concerns about emissions exposure.",
      "\u201cI am elated that we are waking up every day now with no chloroprene in our air,\u201d said Tish Taylor, a local environmental activist.

They care about their bottom line.\u201d",
      "Denka produces Neoprene, a synthetic rubber used in wetsuits, laptop sleeves and other common products.",

The company also cited \u201ca shortage of qualified staff necessary to operate new pollution control equipment and implement other emission reduction measures.\u201d",
      "In court filings last year, Denka said it had spent more than $35 million on equipment to reduce emissions by 85% since 2017. But harmful emissions consistently remained higher than federal guidelines.",
      "Denka said it remains \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d to Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who supported the company last year as it fought an EPA rule mandating the facility swiftly reduce chloroprene emissions. While the Trump administration has pledged to rewrite this policy, the company noted the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "Denka said it is working with Landry's administration to consider \u201call options,\u201d including \u201ca potential sale of the business or its assets.\u201d But no decision had been made regarding a \u201cpermanent closure\u201d of the facility or \u201cworkforce reductions.\u201d",
      "Landry did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Denka said it \u201cfaces a sustained slowdown in the global market demand for Neoprene, along with increases in energy prices, raw materials, and repair work that have been exacerbated by inflation.\u201d",
      "The company's statement noted \u201crising energy costs,\u201d \u201cweakening global economic environment for chloroprene\u201d and \u201csupply chain disruptions\" as other factors.",
      "The Denka facility needed large amounts of chlorine to produce chloroprene, said George Eisenhauer, an analyst with commodities consulting company Argus Media. It costs more than twice as much to purchase and import chlorine into the U.S. as it does in other leading chloroprene production sites like Europe, Japan and China, he said.",
      "The costs rose over the past few years after a major U.S. chlorine producer shut down, Eisenhauer added.",
      "Trump's tariff policies have not significantly affected the price because chlorine is typically imported into the U.S. through Mexico or Canada.",
      "Denka's facility is in the 85-mile (137-kilometer) stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge officially called the Mississippi River Chemical Corridor and commonly referred to by environmental groups as \u201cCancer Alley.\u201d",
      "Robert Taylor, 84, and other environmental activists warily celebrated Denka's announcement. Taylor, who lives near the facility, pushed for stronger environmental regulations, only to watch the Trump administration roll them back.",

They each had more than 25 years of intelligence experience. The two were fired because of their opposition to Trump, Gabbard's office said in an email, without offering examples.",
      "\u201cThe director is working alongside President Trump to end the weaponization and politicization of the intelligence community,\u201d the office said.",
      "The firings, which were first reported by Fox News Digital, follow the release of a declassified memo from the National Intelligence Council that found no coordination between Venezuela's government and the Tren de Aragua gang. The Trump administration had given that as reasoning for invoking the Alien Enemies Act and deporting Venezuelan immigrants. The intelligence assessment was released in response to an open records request.",
      "While it's not uncommon for new administrations to replace senior officials with their own picks, the firings of two respected intelligence officials who had served presidents of both parties prompted concern from Democrats. U.S. Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he's seen no details to explain the dismissals.",
      "\u201cAbsent evidence to justify the firings, the workforce can only conclude that their jobs are contingent on producing analysis that is aligned with the President\u2019s political agenda, rather than truthful and apolitical,\u201d Himes said in a statement.",
      "Though it\u2019s not widely known to the public, the National Intelligence Council plays a key role in the nation\u2019s spy services, helping combine intelligence gathered from different agencies into comprehensive assessments used by the White House and senior national security officials.",
      "Collins was considered one of the intelligence service's top authorities on East Asia. Langan-Riekhof has served as a senior analyst and director of the CIA's Strategic Insight Department and is an expert on the Middle East.",
      "Attempts to reach both were unsuccessful Wednesday. The CIA declined to comment publicly, citing personnel matters.",
      "Gabbard also is consolidating some of the intelligence community's key operations, moving some offices now located at the CIA to ODNI buildings, her office said. They include the National Intelligence Council as well as the staff who prepare the President's Daily Brief, the report to the president that contains the most important intelligence and national security information.",
      "The move will give Gabbard more direct control over the brief. While the brief is already ODNI's responsibility, the CIA has long played a significant role in its preparation, providing physical infrastructure and staffing that will have to be moved to ODNI or re-created.",
      "Gabbard oversees and coordinates the work of 18 federal intelligence agencies. She has worked to reshape the intelligence community \u2014 eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs under Trump's orders and creating a task force to examine ways to cut costs and consider whether to declassify material relating to COVID-19 and other topics.",
      "Gabbard also has vowed to investigate intelligence leaks and end what she said was the misuse of intelligence for political aims.",

      "A key prosecutor assigned to the classified documents case against President Donald Trump has invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during a congressional interview",
      "WASHINGTON -- A key prosecutor on the classified documents case against President Donald Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during a congressional interview Wednesday, declining to answer questions because of concern about the Trump administration's willingness to \u201cweaponize the machinery of government\u201d against perceived adversaries, a spokesman said.",
      "Jay Bratt had been subpoenaed to appear before the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee for a closed-door interview but did not answer substantive questions because of his Fifth Amendment constitutional right to remain silent.",
      "Bratt spent more than three decades at the Justice Department before retiring in January, just weeks before President Donald Trump took office. He was a key national security prosecutor on special counsel Jack Smith's team, which in 2023 charged Trump with illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and with obstructing the government's efforts to recover them.",
      "\u201cHe did not choose to investigate Mar-a-Lago; rather, the facts and evidence of a serious breach of law and national security led him there,\u201d said Peter Carr, a spokesman for Justice Connection, a network of Justice Department alumni.",
      "\u201cThis administration and its proxies have made no effort to hide their willingness to weaponize the machinery of government against those they perceive as political enemies,\u201d Carr added. \u201cThat should alarm every American who believes in the rule of law. In light of these undeniable and deeply troubling circumstances, Mr. Bratt had no choice but to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights.\u201d",
      "The statement describes Bratt as someone who spent his career in public service \u201cprotecting our nation from some of the gravest national security threats\u2014including spies, murderers, and other criminal actors\u2014always without fear or favor.\u201d",
      "A federal judge in Florida dismissed the prosecution last year after concluding that Smith had been illegally appointed to the special counsel role. The Justice Department's appeal of that decision was pending at the time of Trump's presidential win in November, at which point Smith's team abandoned that case and a separate prosecution charging Trump with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 election.",
      "Since taking office, Trump has engaged in a far-reaching retribution campaign against officials he regards as adversaries.",
      "His administration has issued executive orders aimed at punishing major law firms, including some with current or past associations with prosecutors who previously investigated him. The Justice Department, meanwhile, has fired lawyers who served on Smith's team and also established a \u201cweaponization working group\u201d aimed at reviewing actions taken during the Biden administration. That group is led by Ed Martin, whose nomination to be the top federal prosecutor in Washington was pulled by the White House last week.",

      "The head of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s immigration enforcement agency has recognized the right of members of Congress to visit detention facilities \u2014even unannounced",
      "WASHINGTON -- The head of the Department of Homeland Security's immigration enforcement agency on Wednesday recognized the right of members of Congress to visit detention facilities, even unannounced, while the department's secretary said members of Congress should have requested a tour of an immigration detention facility in New Jersey where a skirmish broke out last week.",
      "The slightly divergent comments by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, came in separate congressional committee hearings Wednesday.",
      "Three members of Congress have said that they went to the facility to inspect it as a matter of congressional oversight and that federal agents escalated the situation by arresting the mayor of Newark, who was also trying to enter. DHS has blamed the lawmakers, accusing them of trying to break into the detention center.",
      "Noem dived straight into the brewing controversy during her opening statement.",
      "\u201dWhat happened on May 9 was not oversight. It was a political stunt,\" she said. DHS later followed up on Noem's remarks with a news release once again accusing the representatives of storming the facility and \u201creminding\u201d members of Congress of the visitation rules.",
      "Lyons addressed the issue as well after being questioned by Rep. Lauren Underwood, a Democrat from Illinois.",
      "\u201cWe do acknowledge that any member of Congress has the right to show up for an inspection at one of our facilities in their oversight capability,\u201d Lyons said. He also said that while those visits are \u201cunannounced,\u201d members need to show identification and go through screening and can\u2019t bring contraband.",
      "By law, members of Congress are allowed to visit ICE facilities and don\u2019t have to give any notice, although congressional staff members need to give 24 hours' notice.",
      "Federal prosecutors charged Newark Mayor Ras Baraka with trespassing after agents arrested him outside the fence of the Delaney Hall detention center on Friday. The interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey says Baraka, a Democrat who is running for governor, ignored warnings to leave while he was at the 1,000-bed ICE facility with three members of New Jersey\u2019s congressional delegation.",
      "The arrest escalated into a brief but tense confrontation in the parking lot that included the members of Congress and federal agents, some of whom wore masks.",
      "The representatives \u2014 Reps. LaMonica McIver, Bonnie Watson Coleman and Robert Menendez Jr. \u2014 have said they went to the facility to inspect it as a matter of congressional oversight.",
      "\u201cWe were able to get in, speak to detainees, check out the facilities, and make sure everything was OK there,\u201d Rep. Watson Coleman told CNN in an interview Sunday that also included her two New Jersey colleagues. \u201cWe were there almost two hours before the confrontation took place, but ICE kept giving us the runaround and kept saying that they needed to talk to someone else.\u201d",
      "Watson Coleman spokesperson Ned Cooper has said the three lawmakers went there unannounced because they planned to inspect the site, not take a scheduled tour.",
      "DHS and ICE are integral to President Donald Trump's goal of carrying out mass deportations.",
      "Lyons defended ICE's performance, saying his agents were finally able to do the job they signed up for. He said the agency is focusing on \u201cthe worst of the worst,\" and Homeland Security touts daily the arrests they've made of people convicted of crimes in the U.S. or alleged gang members. But critics dispute that, saying the agency is sweeping up people who pose no threat in their push to increase deportations.",
      "Lyons said there had been nine deaths in custody, and the agency investigates all of them.",
      "Republicans are planning to pour billions of dollars into immigration enforcement with more money for deportation officers, detention space and removal flights.",
      "The plan aims to remove 1 million immigrants annually and house 100,000 people in detention centers. It calls for 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and investigators.",
      "ICE houses people it arrests at a network of detention centers around the country, including government-run facilities, privately contracted facilities and local jails.",
      "Lyons also said the agency has about 3,500 beds available at Fort Bliss in Texas and is currently holding 69 detainees there. He said money to pay for detaining those people at Fort Bliss and other military bases would come out of the Defense Department's budget.",
      "Asked about some of the bottlenecks when it comes to removing people from the country, Lyons mentioned the need for more airplanes and charter companies to remove people as well as more ICE lawyers to help them deal with backlogged immigration courts.",

      "A former FBI agent and Pentagon contractor has sued the founder of a conservative nonprofit known for its hidden camera stings",
      "WASHINGTON -- A former FBI agent and Pentagon contractor has sued the founder of a conservative nonprofit known for its hidden camera stings over secretly recorded videos showing the contractor criticizing President Donald Trump to a woman he thought he had taken on a date.",
      "Jamie Mannina says in his lawsuit that he was misled by a woman he met on a dating website who held herself out as a politically liberal nurse but who was actually working with the conservative activist James O'Keefe in a sting operation designed to induce Mannina into making \u201cinflammatory and damaging\u201d remarks that could be recorded, \u201cmanipulated\u201d and posted online.",
      "Clips from their January conversations were spliced together to make it appear that Mannina was \u201cessentially attempting to launch an unlawful coup against President Trump,\u201d and an article released online with the videos defamed Mannina by painting him as part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d effort with senior military officials to undermine Trump's presidency, according to the lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Washington.",
      "Mannina does not deny in the lawsuit making the comments. He says his words were taken out of context and were misrepresented in a description of the video that was posted on YouTube.",
      "O'Keefe founded Project Veritas in 2010 but was removed from the organization in 2023 amid allegations that he mistreated workers and misspent funds. He has continued to employ similar hidden camera stings as part of a new organization he established, O'Keefe Media Group, which also is named in the lawsuit.",
      "O\u2019Keefe told The Associated Press that Mannina \u201cvoluntarily\u201d offered up the comments in the recording and that it was important for the public to hear Mannina's remarks. O'Keefe pointed out that the District of Columbia only requires the consent of one party, not both, for a conversation to be recorded. O'Keefe said the lawsuit was an \u201cattack on the First Amendment\u201d and that he was prepared to fight it in an appeals court if necessary.",
      "\u201cHe said what he said. We did not take him out of context. The words that we reported came out of his mouth,\u201d O\u2019Keefe said, adding, \u201cWe stand by our reporting.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit includes claims of defamation, false light, fraudulent misrepresentation and violations of the Wire Tap Act. Though the lawsuit acknowledges that the city's consent law for recording conversations, the filing asserts that the law nonetheless prohibits \u201cthe interception and recording of a communication if it was for the purposes of committing a tortious act.\u201d",
      "A recording that O\u2019Keefe released shows Mannina being asked at one point by the woman, whose name was not disclosed in the lawsuit, about his \u201coverall assessment of Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a sociopathic narcissist who\u2019s only interested in advancing his name, his wealth and his fame,\u201d Mannina can be heard saying. Asked in the recording whether there was anything he could do to \u201cprotect the American people,\u201d Mannina replied that he was in conversation with some retired generals to explore what could be done.",
      "The lawsuit was filed by Mark Zaid, a prominent Washington lawyer who routinely represents government officials and whistleblowers. Zaid himself sued Trump last week after the president revoked his security clearance.",
      "\u201cLying or misleading someone on a dating app, which no doubt happens all the time, is not what this lawsuit seeks to address,\u201d Zaid said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cThe creation of a fake profile for the specific purposes of targeting individuals for deliberately nefarious and harmful purposes is what crosses the line.\u201d",
      "The complaint arises from a pair of dates that Mannina had in January. During their first date, the lawsuit alleges, the woman expressed her distaste for Trump and repeatedly pressed Mannina on his political views and about his work with the government. Mannina told her that included working as a \u201cspy catcher\u201d several years earlier when he was an FBI counterintelligence agent.",
      "The lawsuit says Mannina and the woman met for lunch the following day, and as they left the restaurant, a man with a microphone approached Mannina and said, \u201cJamie, you\u2019re a spy hunter, you say. Well, I\u2019m a spy hunter, too, but I\u2019m evidentially a better spy hunter than you.\u201d The man was O\u2019Keefe, the lawsuit says.",
      "The complaint says Mannina was swiftly fired from Booz Allen, where he worked as a contractor, after O'Keefe contacted the press office and presented at least parts of the videos.",
      "O'Keefe then released a video on his organization's YouTube channel titled, \u201cPentagon Advisor Reveals Conversation \u2018to Explore What We Can Do\u2019 to \u2018Protect People from Trump.\u2019\"",
      "The lawsuit says the O'Keefe Media Group painted Mannina in a false light by misconstruing his words and his title, including by referring to him as a \u201cTop Pentagon Advisor\u201d when he was actually just \u201cone of a countless number of defense contractors.\u201d It says that characterization was intended to support \"fabricated claims that Mr. Mannina was essentially attempting to launch an unlawful coup against President Trump.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit does not directly say why Mannina was targeted, but it does note that in 2017, when he was working at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, he published three articles in the Huffington Post and The Hill newspaper that were critical of Trump.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- The former court clerk in South Carolina who helped with the trial of attorney Alex Murdaugh, a powerful, wealthy lawyer convicted of killing his wife and son, showed sealed court exhibits to a reporter and then lied about it, authorities said Wednesday.",
      "In all, former Colleton County Clerk of Court Becky Hill was arrested on four charges. She faces obstruction of justice and perjury for showing a reporter photographs that were sealed court exhibits and then lying about it, according to court documents. Sealed exhibits are only for viewing by the jury, lawyers in the case, and court workers.",
      "She also faces two counts of misconduct in office for taking bonuses and promoting through her public office a book she wrote on the trial, according to the warrants.",
      "Hill, 57, was released on bail after court appearances in Colleton County and Richland County. Her lawyers didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "\u201cShe lives here. She turned herself in. We found out about these charges last night,\u201d Hill's attorney Will Lewis said during her appearance in Colleton County court, according to a livestream of the hearing by WCIV-TV.",
      "Hill was in charge of taking care of the jury, overseeing exhibits and helping the judge during Murdaugh's six-week trial in 2023 when he was convicted of killing his wife and younger son. The case involved power, danger, money and privilege and an attorney whose family had lorded over his small South Carolina county for nearly a century.",
      "Murdaugh is appealing his conviction and a sentence of life without parole, in part accusing Hill of trying to influence jurors to vote \u2018guilty\u2019 and being biased against Murdaugh for her book. Murdaugh is also serving a separate sentence of decades in prison for admitting to stealing millions of dollars from settlements for clients who suffered horrible injuries or deaths \u2014 and from his family\u2019s law firm.",
      "An initial appeal by Murdaugh's lawyers was denied, but Judge Jean Toal said she wasn\u2019t sure Hill told the truth about her dealings with jurors and was \u201cattracted by the siren call of celebrity\u201d status.",
      "Some of Hill's charges concern Murdaugh's murder trial. The arrest warrant said Hill violated a judge's order to keep sealed photographs from the public. A second warrant said Hill lied to Toal during a January 2024 hearing when the judge asked: \u201cDid you allow anyone from the press to view the sealed exhibits?\u201d",
      "The documents do not specify who Hill is accused of showing the photos to.",
      "Murdaugh's lawyers, Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin, said they weren't surprised by Hill's arrest.",
      "\u201cWe have long raised our concerns about her conduct during and after the trial and this arrest further underscores the need to protect the integrity of the judicial process. Every defendant is entitled to a fair and impartial trial and we look forward to Alex Murdaugh finally getting that fair treatment,\u201d their statement said.",
      "One of the charges \u2014 misconduct in office \u2014 involves money that investigators said Hill took for herself. They said that included nearly $10,000 meant for bonuses from federal money meant to improve child support collection and about $2,000 in money from the Clerk of Court's office.",
      "The warrant on the other misconduct charge said Hill used her public role as clerk of court to promote her book on the Murdaugh trial on social media.",
      "All four charges are felonies. Hill faces up to five years in prison if convicted of perjury, There are no limits on the sentences for the other charges.",
      "Hill was also accused last May of 76 counts of ethics violations. Officials said Hill allowed a photo of Murdaugh in a holding cell to be taken to promote her book on the trial and used county money to buy dozens of lunches for her staff, prosecutors and a vendor.",
      "Hill also struck a deal with a documentary maker to use the county courtroom in exchange for promoting her book on the trial, which later she admitted had plagiarized passages, according to the South Carolina Ethics Commission complaint.",
      "Hill resigned in March 2024 during the last year of her four year term, citing the public scrutiny of Murdaugh\u2019s trial and wanting to spend time with her grandchildren.",

      "A Michigan congressman is on a doomed mission to impeach President Donald Trump as he faces challenges at home in his Detroit-area district",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- A Michigan congressman is charging ahead \u2014 largely without support from his own party \u2014 in his attempt to impeach President Donald Trump, a move that comes as the congressman faces political trouble at home.",
      "Second-term U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar has introduced seven articles of impeachment against the Republican president. Thanedar, who represents a safely Democratic Detroit-area district, is facing multiple primary challengers for a second time as some Democrats seek to shake up the party following the 2024 election.",
      "Here's the background.",
      "Thanedar, 70, represents Michigan's 13th Congressional District, a solidly Democratic district in Detroit. He easily won reelection in the November general election.",
      "Previously, he lost the Democratic gubernatorial primary to current Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2018 and then served one term in the state House of Representatives.",
      "An immigrant from India, Thanedar has said he is pushing an impeachment resolution because he feels compelled to defend the Constitution. He has put up advertisements in Michigan demanding that Congress impeach Trump.",
      "Thanedar was poised to force a vote on the resolution Wednesday, but backed down in the face of criticism from fellow Democrats. Still, Thanedar insisted he was not abandoning the effort and would seek to build more support.",
      "Thanedar beat eight other Democratic candidates for the party nomination in 2022 before he went on to win his first term in Congress in November of that year. The win, however, left the city of Detroit without Black representation in Congress for the first time since the 1950s \u2014 a notable omission for a city that is nearly 80% Black.",
      "Many prominent Black leaders of Wayne County and Michigan Democrats \u2014 including Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan \u2014 threw their support behind other primary candidates in 2024. One of his most viable competitors, state Sen. Adam Hollier, was kept off the ballot after election officials found that he had not submitted enough valid signatures.",
      "A businessman who made his career in the pharmaceutical and chemical world, Thanedar has poured millions of dollars of his own money into his political races, including $10 million on his unsuccessful run for governor.",
      "Two young Black Democrats, including Hollier, recently announced campaigns to unseat Thanedar in 2026. A spokesperson for Thanedar's campaign did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment about the incumbent's challengers.",
      "Michigan Rep. Donovan McKinney launched his campaign for the position about two weeks ago. He has the backing of Justice Democrats, a group known for helping to elect progressive members to Congress, and he earned the endorsement of U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who represents the neighboring 12th Congressional district.",
      "Thanedar\u2019s district features part of one of the largest Arab American populations in the U.S. Since the Israel-Hamas war, many of his constituents have decried his support for Israel. Tlaib, who represents the city of Dearborn, is the only Palestinian American in Congress and opposed the Biden and Trump administrations' unwavering support for Israel over the Gaza war.",
      "\u201cYou all know I need a real partner in Washington, D.C. who will fight to represent and deliver for our Wayne County families,\u201d Tlaib said in a video endorsing McKinney posted on social media Monday.",
      "Adrian Hemond, a Michigan-based political strategist, said the impeachment effort is likely to drive fundraising and mobilize support for Thanedar's primary race, even as it is destined to fail. The move may also be an attempt to \u201cbox out\u201d Thanedar's primary challengers from media attention early in the race, he said.",
      "\u201cSo it's smart politics for him,\u201d Hemond said.",
      "Hollier called the impeachment resolution a \u201cpublicity stunt\u201d in an interview with the Associated Press. He accused Thanedar of ignoring real needs of his district, such as veteran benefits and childcare.",
      "\u201cThis is the kind of thing that Donald Trump wants Democrats to be doing,\u201d Hollier said.",
      "Thanedar is expected to force a floor vote on the matter before the end of the day, but Republicans and possibly some Democrats will likely vote to table it.",
      "Given the Republican majority in Congress, almost certainly not. Thanedar's resolution is expected to fail in the House chamber if he calls it up for a vote.",
      "If impeachment gained traction \u2014 more likely if Democrats gained a majority in next year's midterm elections \u2014 it would represent a historic third time that Trump has faced efforts to impeach him after he was twice impeached during his first term as president \u2014 first in 2019 on charges related to withholding military aid to Ukraine as it confronted Russia and later on a charge of inciting insurrection over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters.",
      "Trump was acquitted both times by the Senate.",

      "A rock climber in Washington who survived a fall of hundreds of feet that killed his three companions lay unconscious for hours before waking in the dark, trekking out with internal bleeding and driving to a pay phone to summon help, authorities said he told them on Wednesday.",
      "Speaking from a Seattle hospital, Anton Tselykh, 38, confirmed investigators\u2019 theory that an anchor, called a piton, that he and his companions were using Saturday evening to rappel down the Early Winters Spires in the North Cascade Range had ripped out of the rock.",
      "Tselykh was in satisfactory condition Wednesday morning at Harborview Medical Center, meaning he was not in the intensive care unit, Susan Gregg, media relations director for UW Medicine, said in an email.",
      "One climber was rappelling off the piton \u2014 a metal spike pounded into rock cracks or ice that climbers anchor their ropes to \u2014 and the three others were tied into it and waiting to descend, said Cristina Woodworth, who leads the sheriff\u2019s search and rescue team and spoke with Tselykh by phone.",
      "When the piton tore out of the rock, all four plunged roughly 200 feet (60 meters) past sheer mountainside, landing in a gully and tumbling another 200 feet (60 meters) before coming to a rest, said Woodworth.",
      "It\u2019s still unclear if they had a backup anchor to the piton, which is a common practice for rock climbers, said Joshua Cole, a guide and co-owner of North Cascades Mountain Guides who has been climbing in the area for about 20 years.",
      "Tselykh lost consciousness for several hours, awaking in the dark in a tangle of ropes and gear, suffering from internal bleeding and head trauma, said Woodworth.",
      "It took Tselykh eight hours to disentangle himself, work his way down the rough terrain of rock and snow \u2014 with help from a pick-like ice tool \u2014 to his car, where he drove for some 40 miles (67 kilometers) to the unincorporated community of Newhalem and called for help, authorities said.",
      "The four climbers were friends, some of whom had climbed together before and appeared fairly experienced, Woodworth said, adding that Tselykh was \u201cobviously very much affected by this.\u201d",
      "The climbers who were killed were Vishnu Irigireddy, 48; Tim Nguyen, 63; and Oleksander Martynenko, 36, the county coroner said.",
      "Olga Martynenko, Martynenko\u2019s wife, said Tuesday in a Facebook post that her husband, whom she referred to as Alex, also left behind their son. She shared a link to a fundraiser to help \u201cduring the most devastating time of our lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cI still cannot believe that you are gone, my love,\u201d she said.",
      "Fluke Corporation, a test equipment manufacturing company, shared in a statement Wednesday that Irigireddy was the manufacturer's vice president of engineering.",
      "\u201cVishnu was an extraordinary leader, and his loss is felt profoundly across our organization,\u201d the statement read.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Gov. Josh Shapiro warned Wednesday that the Medicaid cuts Congress is considering would mean billions of dollars in lost federal aid to Pennsylvania, hundreds of thousands of people losing access to the health insurance program and more struggling rural hospitals shutting their doors.",
      "Shapiro, a Democrat who is considered a potential White House contender in 2028, said that if the cuts are made, the state would be unable to make up that amount of lost federal aid.",
      "\u201cI just need to stress: there is no back-filling at the state level,\u201d Shapiro told WILK-FM radio in Wilkes-Barre. \"There are no dollars available at the state level to make up for these cuts at the federal level. So if they cut someone off Medicaid, they\u2019re off. We will not be able to fix that for them.\u201d",
      "Besides hundreds of thousands of people losing access to Medicaid in Pennsylvania, billions of dollars in funding cuts would accelerate the shuttering of rural hospitals \u201cwhich are teetering on the brink of closure,\u201d Shapiro said.",
      "Pennsylvania is already facing a thorny situation with Medicaid costs.",
      "Shapiro\u2019s proposed budget for the fiscal year starting July 1 seeks $2.5 billion more for Medicaid after budget-makers belatedly realized that the people remaining on Medicaid rolls after the COVID-19 pandemic are sicker than anticipated \u2014 and costlier to care for.",
      "The governor does have a cushion of about $10.5 billion in reserve, thanks to federal COVID-19 relief and inflation-juiced tax collections over the past few years.",
      "His administration is also trying to reduce the fast-rising amount Pennsylvania pays for popular GLP-1 drugs such as Wegovy, Ozempic and Zepbound, as are a number of other states.",
      "Medicaid is a federal-state partnership that helps pay for the health care of low-income people of any age and long-term nursing care. There are 72 million enrollees nationwide, including 3 million in Pennsylvania, or almost one in four Pennsylvanians. Its annual cost is approaching $1 trillion, including about $50 billion in Pennsylvania.",
      "The precise contours of forthcoming cuts to Medicaid are being hammered out in the Republican-controlled U.S. House as part of a bill package that includes tax breaks of more than $5 trillion and sizable reductions in food stamps and programs to fight climate change.",
      "As part of it, Republicans are proposing cuts of nearly $800 billion over the decade to Medicaid.",
      "Estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office show that at least 7.6 million people could lose health insurance with the Medicaid cuts.",
      "Republicans say they are trying to make Medicaid work better by rooting out waste and inefficiencies. Shapiro disputed that, saying voting to cut Medicaid spending is \"voting to cut their constituents off from lifesaving health care access.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 23:17:16 GMT",
    "summary": "The Caribbean island is building a power station that will use steam naturally heated by volcanic rock.",
    "story": [
      "With rainforests, waterfalls, volcanoes and hot springs, the Caribbean island of Dominica's dramatic landscape is a haven for adventure-seeking ecotourists.",
      "It attracted 83,966 visitors last year, a 13% rise from 2023, and led by new direct flights from the US, and the opening of more hotels.",
      "Nicknamed the \"Nature Island\", and now recovered from the extensive damage caused by 2017's Hurricane Maria, Dominica's government is set to harness its natural resources to generate clean electricity for its 66,000 residents and tourism sector.",
      "To end the country's long reliance on generators fuelled by imported diesel, a geothermal power station is being built in the south of the country. It will access the boiling hot water contained in natural underground reservoirs that are heated by the surrounding volcanic rock.",
      "The 10-megawatt plant, under construction near the village of Laudat in the lush Roseau Valley, is on track to become operational by the end of the year.",
      "Steam will be drawn up to the surface to drive turbines that will generate electricity. The used steam will then be cooled to the point where it becomes water again, and reinjected back underground for the process to restart.",
      "Dominica country profile",
      "\"We hope to totally eliminate the need for diesel generation for electricity in Dominica by 2030,\" Dominica's energy minister Dr Vince Henderson tells the BBC. The government also says that the geothermal plant will reduce electricity bills.",
      "And it is not just Dominica (not to be confused with the similarly named Dominican Republic), that is set to benefit. Long-term plans include exporting surplus electricity via undersea cables to neighbouring islands.",
      "Dr Henderson adds that he hopes the success of the geothermal plant will inspire other Caribbean nations to explore more renewable energy sources.",
      "Dominica's geothermal plant will be just the second in the Caribbean. Guadeloupe, an overseas department of France, has had a 15-megawatt station in operation for three decades.",
      "The Roseau Valley facility is being created through a public-private partnership between the Dominican government and US-Israeli renewable energy company Ormat Technologies.",
      "It is costing tens of millions of US dollars, partially funded by grants and investments from several governments, including the US, UK, Japan and New Zealand. Additional funding has come from various non-governmental organizations from around the world, and loans from the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB).",
      "The Dominican government has also ploughed significant resources into the project, which required high upfront costs and a complex exploration process including drilling deep underground to test temperatures.",
      "\"Finding the resource is the first challenge. Then you need someone like us to build the facility,\" says Ormat's chief executive Doron Blachar. \"Ormat is doing the entire project, from making the plant's elements, shipping them to Dominica, mainly from Israel, and then constructing the power plant.\"",
      "Ormat has been designing and building renewable energy systems for more than five decades, and owns and operates geothermal plants in various countries from the Americas to Africa.",
      "\"Geothermal is a great, zero-emission electricity that doesn't depend on wind or sun, and operates 24/7,\" Mr Blachar explains. \"It brings jobs to a country, both during construction and, more importantly, during the plant's operations, along with new technology and expertise.\"",
      "Yet despite geothermal's green credentials, Dominica's new plant has raised concerns among some local residents, including environmentalist Atherton Martin who fears for the effects on the ecologically valuable Roseau Valley.",
      "\"There is no other area like it in the Caribbean,\" he says, adding that the removal of vegetation during the exploration process \"decimated wildlife\" including endemic frogs.",
      "Other residents told the BBC of some controversy over the amount of money the project was costing. It has certainly been several years in the making with the Dominican government alone said to have invested around $15m (\u00a311.3m).",
      "Dr Henderson admits that the project is \"not easy\" for a country that \"faced a big challenge\" when it had to substantially repair its electricity network after 2017's Hurricane Maria. But he insists \"it will be worth it in the end\".",
      "Another common fear about geothermal plants is the potential for triggering earthquakes.",
      "Ormat says it has never had a such an incident in its many years of operations.",
      "Mr Blachar believes the Caribbean could become \"a hub\" for geothermal technology.",
      "Ormat acquired Guadeloupe's plant from the French government in 2017 and is currently expanding it to boost its capacity to 25 megawatts.",
      "With support from the CDB and driven by the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Commission, work is also under way to explore and develop geothermal potential in fellow volcanic island nations Grenada, St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.",
      "Ormat will operate the Dominica plant for 20 years before handing it over to state electricity provider Domlec. Mr Blachar estimates it will employ around 30 local people when it comes on stream later this year.",
      "It should initially generate enough power to meet half of Dominica's peak electricity demand, says Fred John, managing director of the government-owned Dominica Geothermal Development Company, which is also involved in the scheme.",
      "Authorities are confident the plant will then soon support the entire country, and have enough spare electricity for some to be exported to neighbouring islands.",
      "Mr John says that the facility will \"serve as a test case for an attractive alternative\" to fossil fuels. \"The rest of the OECS will benefit from the lessons learned here \u2013 both what worked and what didn't,\" he adds.",
      "The OECS recently set a target to reach 30% renewable energy within 10 years, with some countries, including Dominica and St Kitts, aiming for 100% by then.",
      "OECS Director General Dr Didacus Jules describes Dominica's geothermal project as a \"bold and visionary step\".",
      "\"As a region heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, the transition to green energy is not optional - it is existential,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This development also breathes new life into the long-held vision of a regional energy grid - one that connects our islands through clean, reliable, and affordable energy.\""

    "story": [
      "The owner and crew of a luxury superyacht that sank off the coast of Sicily, killing tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and six others, were unaware wind speeds of over 73mph could tip it over, according to an interim report.",
      "Modelling commissioned after the disaster indicates gusts of that speed hitting the side of the Bayesian, when it had its sails down and centreboard up, would \"likely result\" in its capsize.",
      "The UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB), leading the international investigation, said winds of over 80mph \"violently\" hit the vessel, causing it to flood within seconds.",
      "It sank near the town Porticello on 19 August last year during freak weather, with reports of water spouts.",
      "Seven of the 22 people onboard were killed, including Mr Lynch, 59, and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah.",
      "Investigators say the yacht was knocked to a 90-degree angle within 15 seconds at 04:06 am local time, causing people, furniture and loose items to fall across the deck.",
      "\"There was no indication of flooding inside Bayesian until water came in over the starboard rails and, within seconds, entered the internal spaces down the stairwells,\" the report says.",
      "The MAIB's chief inspector of marine accidents Andrew Moll said the situation was \"irrecoverable\" once the yacht tilted beyond 70 degrees.",
      "The yacht had its sails down and centreboard up when it sank.",
      "The MAIB commissioned modelling from the University of Southampton to examine the stability of the yacht in these conditions.",
      "It indicated that - if the wind was blowing directly across the beam, or side, of the boat - wind speeds in excess of 73mph were sufficient to tip the boat over and \"it is possible\" the yacht was similarly vulnerable to lower wind speeds, the MAIB said.",
      "But this information was not included in the onboard stability information book and \"consequently, these vulnerabilities were also unknown to either the owner or the crew of Bayesian\", the report found.",
      "The MAIB is investigating the incident as the Bayesian was registered in the UK. No date has been set for when its final report will be published.",
      "It said its report was based on \"a limited amount of verified evidence\" as a criminal investigation by Italian authorities has restricted access to the wreck.",
      "An operation to raise the 56-metre vessel from the seabed was paused over the weekend after a diver died while working on the wreck. Work was set to resume on Thursday.",
      "The report lays out more detail as to how the sinking unfolded.",
      "Investigators say the yacht sailed to the site where it sank on the previous day, in order to \"shelter\" from forecast thunderstorms. The sails were furled at the time.",
      "Wind speed was \"no more than eight knots (9mph)\" at 03:00 - about an hour before the incident. Some 55 minutes later it had increased to 30 knots (34.5mph), and it had accelerated to 70 knots (80.6mph) by 04:06 when the yacht capsized.",
      "As the storm intensified, several crew members were working in response to the conditions. The deck hand went onto the deck to close the yacht's windows.",
      "Five people were injured \"either by falling or from things falling on them\" and the deck hand was \"thrown into the sea\", the report says.",
      "Two of the yacht's guests used furniture drawers \"as an improvised ladder\" to escape their cabin, it adds.",
      "Dr Simon Boxall, Oceanographer at the University of Southampton, said the Bayesian was in \"the wrong place at the wrong time\".",
      "\"The priorities for the crew would have been to shut the hatches and the doors, which they did,\" he told the BBC.",
      "This means speculation about water flooding in because everything was open is \"obviously not the case\".",
      "\"The next priority\u00a0would have been to start the engines - so they would have some manoeuvrability to position themselves within a storm - and to then lift anchor, which the crew did, but this takes time,\" he added.",
      "\"It's not like a car where you jump in and turn the key. It would take 5 or 10 minutes before you can start the engines with a vessel of this size.\"",

      "Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?",
      "'No water for five days, I want compensation'",
      "In addition to talks with Ofwat, Thames Water is in discussions with private investment group KKR about a cash injection of up to \u00a35bn.",
      "That deal being completed is also dependent on lenders to the company accepting a discount on the nearly \u00a320bn they are owed. Some junior lenders could see their entire loan being written off.",
      "On Tuesday, heated exchanges broke out between MPs on the Environment Select Committee and Thames Water chairman Sir Adrian Montague, Mr Weston, and chief financial officer Steve Buck.",
      "Questions were asked about why the water company had whittled down potential bidders from five to just one, and why Thames had pressed ahead with an additional, high-interest loan earlier this year of \u00a33bn when cheaper options seemed available.",
      "Sir Adrian insisted that in both cases, those were the most credible options when the company faced completely running out of cash and being forced into a government-sponsored administration.",
      "Thames originally appealed a decision by Ofwat to limit bill rises to 35% above inflation over the next five years, insisting it needed 53% to deliver the investments needed to improve services.",
      "However, it paused its appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority partly because the process could take several months and also because it hoped to reach an agreement with Ofwat to water down fines, which would make further bill increases unnecessary.",
      "Some have bristled at the idea of Thames being given special treatment after getting into financial distress of its own making.",
      "\"Customers will have little sympathy for a company with such a poor track record on service delivery and complaints,\" said Mike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW).",
      "But even sources close to the matter admitted that the current regime does not always result in the right outcomes for customers and the environment.",
      "A source told the BBC: \"This is special treatment but this is a special case. There is no point pretending that Thames is not in serious financial distress and deserves a chance to turn things around.\"",
      "Thames Water is not alone. Heavily indebted Southern Water is also in gritty conversations with its lenders to accept a discount on what they are owed in order to attract an injection of new equity (money that doesn't need to be paid back).",
      "Meanwhile, a major review of the entire structure of the water industry is being conducted by former deputy Bank of England governor Sir Jon Cunliffe.",
      "He is expected to recommend a major overhaul of the way the sector is run and regulated in a report understood to be released at the end of May."

    "published": "Sat, 10 May 2025 04:01:38 GMT",
    "summary": "How consumers are reacting to shipping changes that mean low-value packages entering the US no longer avoid tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Earlier this year, Deborah Grushkin, an enthusiastic online shopper from New Jersey, \"freaked out\".",
      "US President Donald Trump had signed an order to stop allowing packages from China worth less than $800 (\u00a3601) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures.",
      "It was a move, backed by traditional retailers, that had been discussed in Washington for years amid an explosion of packages slipping into the US under the limit.",
      "Many countries, including the UK, are considering similar measures, spurred in part by the rapid ascent of Shein and Temu.",
      "But in the US, Trump's decision to end the carve-out while ordering a blitz of new trade tariffs, including import taxes of at least 145% on goods from China, has delivered a one-two punch that has left businesses and shoppers reeling.",
      "US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the system, are warning the changes could spark failures of smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah brace for price hikes and shortages.",
      "With the 2 May deadline bearing down, the 36-year-old last month rushed in some $400 worth of items from Shein - including stickers, T-shirts, sweatshirts, Mother's Days gifts and 20 tubes of liquid eyeliner.",
      "\"I felt like maybe it was my last sort of hurrah,\" she says.",
      "Use of rules known as \"de minimis\", which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections and other regulatory requirements, has surged over the last decade.",
      "Take-up accelerated during Trump's first term in office, when he raised tariffs on many Chinese goods.",
      "By 2023, such shipments represented more than 7% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.4 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 3.7 million a day.",
      "Advocates of the carve-out, which include shipping firms, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for customers.",
      "Those in favour of change, a group that includes lawmakers from both parties, say businesses are abusing rules intended to ease gifts between family and friends, and the rise has made it easier to slip products that are illegal, counterfeit or violate safety standards and other rules into the country.",
      "Trump recently called de minimis a \"scam\", brushing off concerns about higher costs. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said.",
      "However, polls suggest concerns about his economic policies are rising as the changes start to hit home.",
      "Krystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has nervously been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently cancelling an order for curtains after seeing the price more than triple.",
      "Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had more than doubled.",
      "\"I don't know who pays the tariff except the customer,\" she says. \"Everywhere is selling cheap stuff from China so I actually prefer being able to order directly.\"",
      "When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be handled by \"locally based sellers\", with orders fulfilled from within the US.",
      "'End of an era'",
      "Even without the latest tariffs, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that ending de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in new costs, which they found would be disproportionately borne by lower income and minority households.",
      "\"It does kind of feel like the end of an era,\" says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as an electric can opener and kitchen cabinet organisers.",
      "She says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like a \"money grab\" by the government to benefit big, entrenched American retailers like Amazon and Walmart that sell similar products - but at a bigger mark-up.",
      "\"I don't think it's right or fair that little treats should be [restricted] to people who are richer.",
      "\"It just would be a real bummer if everyone who was under a certain household income threshold was just no longer able to afford anything for themselves.\"",
      "As with other Trump policy changes, questions remain about the significance of the shift.",
      "The president was already forced to suspend the policy once before, as packages began piling up at the border.",
      "Lori Wallach, director at Rethink Trade, which supports ending de minimis for consumer safety reasons, says the end of the exemption is significant \"on paper\", but she fears the administration is taking steps that will weaken its implementation.",
      "She points to a recent customs notice, which said products affected by many of the new tariffs could enter the country through the informal process, a move that eases some regulatory requirements.",
      "\"Practically, because all of this stuff can come though informal entry, it's going to be extremely hard to collect tariffs or to be able to inspect really very much more than before the change happened,\" she says.",
      "'An insurmountable shift'",
      "Customs and Border Protection deny the move will undermine enforcement, noting that firms are still required to supply more information than before.",
      "Businesses have indicated they are taking the changes seriously.",
      "Both Shein and Temu last month warned customers that prices would rise, while Temu says it is rapidly expanding its network of US-based sellers and warehouses to protect its low prices.",
      "Other business groups say many smaller, less high-profile American brands that manufacture abroad for US customers are struggling - and may not survive.",
      "\"If the tariffs weren't in place, it would be like taking a little bit of bitter medicine,\" says Alex Beller, board member of the Ecommerce Innovation Alliance, a business lobby group and a co-founder of Postscript, which works with thousands of smaller businesses on text messaging marketing.",
      "\"But paired with the other tariffs, especially for brands that manufacture in China, it just becomes an insurmountable shift.\"",
      "In a letter to the government last month, men's clothing company Indochino, known for its custom suits made-to-order in China, warned that ending de minimis posed a \"significant threat to the viability\" of its business and other mid-size American firms like it.",
      "Steven Borelli is the chief executive of the athleisure clothing firm CUTS, which manufactures outside the US, shipping products to a warehouse in Mexico, from where packages are mailed to customers in the US.",
      "His firm has been pushing to reduce its reliance on China, halting orders in the country months ago. Still, he says he is now considering price increases and job cuts.",
      "He says his business has room to manoeuvre, since it caters to higher income customers, but he expects \"thousands\" of other brands to die without changes to the situation.",
      "\"We want more time,\" he says. \"The speed at which everything is happening is too fast for businesses to adjust.\""

    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 23:03:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The US currently has no high-speed rail services, but two are under construction, and more planned.",
    "story": [
      "The US is a country of 340 million people, 71 interstate highways, more than 5,000 public airports, and currently no high-speed railways.",
      "Yet with two high-speed rail (HSR) projects now under construction, and others planned, is the US finally on track to start catching up with the fast trains seen in China, Japan and Europe?",
      "Rick Harnish, of US campaign group High Speed Rail Alliance, says it is at least good to see the first two schemes being built.",
      "\"The first is the San Francisco to Los Angeles route,\" he explains. \"That's an incredibly challenging route to build because of the mountains in California.",
      "\"Then there's Las Vegas to Los Angeles, a relatively easy project to build, as it is flat land.\"",
      "In addition, there are plans for a HSR line from Portland in Oregon to Seattle in Washington State, and onto Vancouver in Canada. And another between Dallas and Houston.",
      "Yet Mr Harnish warns that planning efforts for the former are \"moving slowly\", while the Texas line is now more doubtful after President Trump's government cancelled a $63.9m (\u00a348m) grant.",
      "By marked contrast, the total length of China's HSR network will reportedly exceed 50,000 km (31,000 miles) this year.",
      "Meanwhile, the European Union has 8,556 km of HSR lines, led by Spain's 3,190 km.",
      "In the UK, the only current HSR line is High Speed 1, the 68 miles link between the Channel Tunnel and London St Pancras. But High Speed 2 continues to be constructed from London Euston to Birmingham, despite well-publicised funding issues.",
      "While there is no universally agreed definition on what constitutes HSR, global railways trade group International Union of Railways says that trains generally need to be moving at more than 250 km/h (155 mph).",
      "So why does US lag behind Europe and especially China?",
      "\"We're a very car-addicted nation,\" says American rail industry journalist and author Will Doig. \"There's lots of people who just don't think we need it, or don't really want it coming through their area.",
      "\"And the US government has really shown a willingness to shut down investment in a lot of projects, especially rail.\"",
      "Further complicating the situation in the US is that the boss of the government-owned passenger train service Amtrak, Stephen Gardner, resigned last month. It was widely reported that he stood down after pressure from the White House.",
      "Amtrak currently does not operate any HSR trains. Later this year it is due to enter 28 new 160mph NextGen Acela trains into service on its Northeast Corridor route between Boston and Washington DC. However, only around 50 miles of the 457-mile line can presently allow trains to travel at more than 150mph.",
      "Amtrak is not involved in the high-speed lines being built in California and Nevada. The LA to San Francisco project, called California High-Speed Rail, is being led by the state of California, and due to be completed by 2033.",
      "The line from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Brightline West, is a privately-run project. It is expected to open in 2028.",
      "Globally, there are 23 nations with HSR, according to Mr Harnish. His non-profit organisation has the sole mission of bringing it to the US.",
      "Allowing HSR trains to run safely is far from straightforward, he adds. \"You can't have any crossings with highways, it needs to be very straight and a sealed corridor.\"",
      "In China the country is still building more and more HSR lines, with the total distance expected to reach around 60,000km by 2030.",
      "Chinese cities that get HSR links see their economies increase by 14.2%, according to data from Denmark-based think tank 21st Europe.",
      "Chinese firms are also helping to build HSR systems in other Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Will Doig, who wrote a book called High-Speed Empire, Chinese Expansion, and the Future of Southeast Asia, says that China is not just interested in helping its neighbours improve their rail networks.",
      "\"It is a way of China spreading its influence across a region that it felt was geopolitically strategic,\" he says.",
      "\"In some of these cases, countries have taken out loans from China so that China can then build the railways.\" He warns that this may put them \"in a position where they're beholden to China\".",
      "Europe's growing HSR network is testament to the continent's history of investing in its public infrastructure, says Kaave Pour from 21st Europe.",
      "His think tank is now calling for further expansion of HSR, so that it connects most capitals and main cities in the EU, and those in the UK.",
      "Mr Pour says that if the US wants to develop HSR it needs to start with a cultural shift, a move towards more public transport, and asking itself \"what type of future does it want?\".",
      "Mr Harnish from the High Speed Rail Alliance says that in order for HSR to work in the US, \"the federal government is an essential component\".",
      "Yet as already flagged, the White House has pulled the plug on giving the planned high-speed line between Houston and Dallas a federal grant. US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy described the project as a \"waste of taxpayers' money\".",
      "Scott Sherin is an executive at French train manufacturer Alstom. His firm is suppling Amtrak's new high-speed trains, but he questions whether the US has the political will \"to spend the public purse on rail versus other modes of transportation\".",
      "He also notes that any future HSR lines would struggle to get into city centres such as Dallas and Houston, because there are too many buildings. \"The issue is that the cities are so densely built [in their centres]\".",
      "Will Doig says that going forward he would love to see China helping to build more HSR in the US, but that he is not holding his breath.",
      "\"It's politically very difficult,\" he says. \"Which is too bad because without the animosity between the US and China, you could see how a partnership between them could really create great things for America, that America is not so good at building itself.\""

      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",

      "\"President Trump wants the announcement [of more Gulf money for the US],\" says economist Karen Young, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank.",
      "\"He wants to have a big poster in a meeting that describes where these investments might go. And some estimation of what they will do to the American economy in terms of job creation or his big push, of course, on domestic manufacturing.\"",
      "Trump is due to arrive in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday 13 May, to meet the country's de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "Trump is then expected to attend a summit of Gulf leaders in the city on 14 May, before travelling to Qatar that same day, and then ending his three-day trip in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 15 May.",
      "The economic importance of the region to Trump is highlighted by the fact that the visit to Saudi Arabia was due to be the first overseas trip of his second term in the White House. That was before the death of Pope Francis necessitated Trump attending his funeral in Rome towards the end of April.",
      "Saudi Arabia was also the first country that Trump visited during his first term of office, going against the modern practise of US presidents to start with the UK, Canada or Mexico.",
      "Securing new investments in the US from Gulf states, and particularly from their state-backed sovereign wealth funds, will help Trump to signal back home that his \"America First\" agenda is delivering results.",
      "The presidential visit is drawing top Wall Street and Silicon Valley leaders to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-US investment forum on 13 May in Riyadh will feature CEOs from BlackRock, Palantir, Citigroup, IBM, Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Franklin Templeton.",
      "The push comes amid economic headwinds, as President Trump's new import tariffs have significantly disrupted global trade, confidence, and the US economy itself. US economic output fell in the first three months of this year, its first fall in three years.",
      "Back in January, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn (\u00a3450bn) in the US over the next four years. However, Trump has already said that he'd like that to rise to $1tn, including purchases of more US military equipment.",
      "According to Ali Shihabi \u2013 a Saudi commentator and author, with close ties to the Saudi government \u2013 a number of economic agreements will be signed during the trip.",
      "\"These deals will further integrate the Saudi and US economies together, joint ventures in the kingdom, in the United States, procurements of American weapons and goods,\" says Mr Shihabi.",

      "US economy shrinks as firms import more ahead of tariffs",
      "Optimism and uncertainty at summit as Middle East awaits Trump\u2019s return",
      "Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment fund (PIF), which controls assets worth $925bn, already has numerous investments in the US. These include Uber, gaming firm Electronic Arts, and electric car firm Lucid.",
      "Meanwhile, the UAE has already committed to investing $1.4tn in the US over the next 10 years, in sectors such as AI, semiconductors, energy and manufacturing. This was announced by the White House in March after the UAE's national security advisor, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met President Trump in Washington.",
      "Yet Ms Young from the Middle East Institute says that the scale of these investments is not realistic in the short term. She instead says that they are long-term strategic moves, and that the figures should be taken \"with a little bit of a grain of salt\".",
      "Regarding specific deals that could be announced during Trump's visit, it is widely reported that Saudi Arabia will agree to buy more than $100bn of US arms and other military items.",
      "These are said to include missiles, radar systems and transport aircraft.",
      "The US has been a longstanding arms supplier to Saudi Arabia, but in 2021 the then Biden administration stopped selling Riyadh offensive weapons, citing concerns about the country's role in the war in neighbouring Yemen.",
      "The 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was also widely reported to be a factor. A US report said that Prince Mohammed had approved the murder.",
      "The Biden White House resumed the sale of these weapons last year. While it cited that the Saudis had stopped bombing Yemen, some commentators said that the US was seeking Saudi assistance to help end the conflict in Gaza and aid its future reconstruction.",
      "Mr Shihabi says Saudi Arabia will be seeking assurances from the White House that the US will implement a \"more efficient procurement system\", enabling the Gulf state to access ammunition and military equipment far more quickly and easily.",

      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer led the tributes saying Norfolk had been \"absolutely integral\" in helping to change the law so more grooming gang members could be convicted.",
      "His reporting in 2011 revealed a pattern of mainly white teenage girls being groomed by gangs of men of Pakistani heritage after a growing number of prosecutions across the country.",
      "It led to an inquiry into child sexual exploitation in the south Yorkshire town dating from 1997 to 2013.",
      "It was estimated that around 1,400 children were sexually exploited over a 16 year period.",
      "'Protect the most vulnerable'",
      "Sir Keir, who was director of public prosecutions at the time, told The Times he was \"deeply sorry\" to hear of Norfolk's death.",
      "\"He wasn't just an incredibly talented reporter, at The Times and elsewhere, he was driven by the desire to call our attention to injustice and protect the most vulnerable,\" the prime minister said.",

      "Tony Gallagher, the editor of The Times, said Norfolk was \"without doubt, one of the greatest investigative reporters of our or any age.",

    "summary": "BBC News speaks to psychologists about the line-up's likely faithfuls, traitors and frontrunners.",
    "story": [
      "The line-up for UK's celebrity edition of The Traitors has finally been revealed - with enough star power to rival Graham Norton's chat show sofa.",
      "The 19-strong roundtable of stars joining Claudia Winkleman at Ardross Castle in Scotland boasts household names across sport and the arts.",
      "Among them are comedians Stephen Fry and Alan Carr, chat show host Jonathan Ross and Olympic diver Tom Daley - all vying to win the game of deception.",
      "Singers Paloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church will also be there, alongside others including historian David Olusoga, broadcaster Clare Balding, actress Celia Imrie and Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed.",
      "The third series of The Traitors, which aired in January, attracted more than 10 million viewers.",
      "The show's format is deceptively simple. A handful of contestants, known as traitors, pick off their castmates, the faithful, with nightly \"murders\" - while the faithful try to work out their identity. If any traitors remain at the end, they nab the cash prize (though this time the money goes to a charity of the winner's choosing).",
      "The celebrity season, which airs this autumn, will bring a unique mix of fame, ego and public image to the popular format. BBC News speaks to psychologists to uncover likely faithfuls, traitors and frontrunners.",
      "The comedians",
      "Alan Carr, Jonathan Ross, Stephen Fry, Joe Wilkinson and Lucy Beaumont",
      "Comedians are likely to be \"the obvious frontrunners to go the distance\", says Susie Masterson, a psychotherapist registered with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).",
      "Humour can be a highly adapted defence mechanism, she says, which can make comedians more opaque than other contestants.",
      "Comics are also quick on their feet, used to presenting a persona and masking in public - this makes them well-equipped traitors, notes Masterson.",
      "\"I think Alan Carr could well be a frontrunner,\" she says. \"There is an affability about him, but he's also not afraid of stirring the pot. He's very authentic and has a big personality without necessarily dominating the space.\"",
      "But fame could disadvantage the high-profile names in the group, like Jonathan Ross. Status, explains consultant counselling psychologist Dr Ritika Suk Birah, can create a power imbalance.",
      "\"It can make others feel threatened or suspicious of their motives, even when there's no evidence,\" she says.",
      "This may be a particular challenge for those understood as both intelligent and articulate, like Stephen Fry.",
      "This perception can lead others to assume strategic manipulation, potentially forcing early elimination out of fear rather than logic, adds Dr Birah.",
      "Unfortunately, Masterson also believes Fry could fit into the category of contestants who \"struggle with criticism or scrutiny\".",
      "\"He might struggle with banishing people as well as any potential heat he might receive,\" she says.",
      "The singers",
      "Paloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church",
      "Stage performers like Cat Burns are used to high-pressure situations, interacting with a variety of people in a live environment. \"This could help at the round table,\" says Masterson.",
      "She adds that Paloma Faith and Charlotte Church are both \"big personalities and have direct communication styles\". While this may make them good motivators, Masterson is unsure whether they can appear contained or measured enough to endure as traitors.",
      "The sports stars",
      "Tom Daley, Joe Marler and Clare Balding",
      "Sports people will likely make good faithfuls, says Masterson, as strong physical types tend to do better in most of the challenges and can also both lead and motivate the rest of the group. They are also usually goal-driven and able to handle pressure.",
      "\"They are quite different personalities in this group, and I'm interested to see how it might play out,\" says Masterson.",
      "\"Clare Balding is very practical and pragmatic, but we have also seen her emotional side on TV recently\".",
      "She feels Tom Daley, and to a lesser extent Balding, could well be \"golden retriever types\" - loyal and supportive - whereas rugby star Joe Marler may be less likely to want to talk things through.",
      "As for the in-built competitive edge, she says success depends on whether they can \"play as a team rather than against each other.\"",
      "The actors",
      "Nick Mohammad, Mark Bonnar, Tameka Empson, Ruth Codd, Celia Imrie",
      "Actors, like comics, may also face distrust depending on how much their castmates expect them to be naturally deceptive.",
      "However, among the group of actors, there is a good mix of ages, types of acting and levels of fame - from soap star Tameka Empson to established film names like Mark Bonnar and Celia Imrie. This could \"balance out this superficial disadvantage\" by muddying the threat level, says Masterson.",
      "She says cast members with lesser-known personalities, like Ruth Codd and Nick Mohammed, might be harder to read.",
      "The media personalities",
      "David Olusoga, Niko Omilana and Kate Garraway",
      "Presenters like Kate Garraway will be used to live interactions, giving them a potential advantage at the roundtable, notes Masterson.",
      "Historian David Olusoga, as a heavyweight intellect, will likely face the same preconception struggle as Fry, she says.",
      "Masterson also adds that quiet people can struggle to go the distance on the show, as they can either be perceived as threatening or unsupportive by the group.",
      "But the show's history has shown this isn't always the case. Last year's contestant Francesca was hardly visible in the first few episodes, even prompting memes about her supposed irrelevancy, before growing into the show and making it to the final.",
      "One dark horse is YouTube prankster Niko Omilana, says author Eloise Skinner, who holds a diploma in psychotherapy.",
      "His career in social media and online content might offer an edge in the game, as someone fluent in an online world that is hyper-aware of perception."

      "On Tuesday, a Los Angeles judge ordered DDG, whose full name is Darryl Dwayne Granberry Jr, to stay away from Bailey and their son until a hearing on 6 June.",
      "Bailey, 25, alleged there had been \"multiple acts of physical violence\" from Granberry since their split in October. BBC News has asked representatives for Granberry for comment.",

      "Bailey and Granberry, 27, were in a relationship from 2022 until last year.",

      "She further alleged that, when she called a relative for help, he took her phone and  slammed a car door on her as she was holding the baby. Bailey filed a police report over the incident.",

      "Although she was unable to be there in person, it was a coup for organisers. The singer has stepped away from the limelight in recent years due to health issues related to stiff-person syndrome (SPS), a neurological condition that causes muscle spasms and makes it difficult for her to walk.",

      "Taking a lighter note was Estonia's Tommy Cash, whose quirky anthem Espresso Macchiato was interrupted by a \"stage invader\" - actually a dancer who replicated his noodle-limbed dance moves.",

      "Speaking to the BBC, the band - who are actually from the Swedish-speaking part of Finland - said it was strange to enter the contest as the presumed favourite.",

      "An open \"come as you are\" invite has been extended to anyone who wishes to go to the funeral of The Alarm singer Mike Peters.",
      "The front man of the Welsh rock band died last month, aged 66 after having lived with blood cancer for 30 years following his diagnosis of lymphoma in 1995.",
      "Peters formed his band in 1981 in Rhyl, Denbighshire, out of the punk era and had a top 20 hit, Sixty Eight Guns, two years later.",
      "His family posted on Facebook that those who could not fit inside the church could hear the service from the grounds outside.",

      "Extending the open invitation to the funeral, Mrs Peters said: \"There is no dress code - please wear whatever you feel most comfortable in, camo, Alarm, formal, rock'n'roll or Love Hope Strength attire. Come as you are!",

    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 17:54:40 GMT",
    "summary": "The celebrity businesswoman grew tearful as she gave evidence in the trial of 10 people accused of robbing her at gunpoint.",
    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian has given emotional testimony to a Paris court, telling judges she thought she was going to die at the hands of masked gunmen who stole millions of dollars of jewellery from her in a luxury hotel suite in 2016.",
      "The reality TV star and businesswoman - who was bound and had a gun held to her head during the ordeal - faced her alleged attackers for the first time while giving evidence in the case.",
      "Nine men and one woman are on trial for the armed burglary of \u00a310m (\u00a37.55m) worth of jewellery, including a diamond engagement ring from her ex-husband Kanye West.",
      "Kardashian, who gave testimony in a seat in front of the BBC, spoke for more than three hours in court on Tuesday.",
      "Her evidence was at times interrupted by apologies from two defendants.",
      "After one of the defendants, Aomar Ait Khedache, 71, sitting metres from Kardashian in the courtroom expressed his regret, she turned to him and said she forgave him.",
      "Referencing her activism in the US to improve the justice system and her dreams of becoming a lawyer, she thanked Khedache for his apology letter.",
      "\"I do appreciate it, I forgive you,\" she said to him in the stand, while crying.",
      "\"But it doesn't change the emotion, the feelings and the trauma and the way my life has changed.\"",
      "\"I just want to thank everyone, especially the French authorities, for allowing me to testify today and tell my truth,\" the TV star told the court on Tuesday which was packed with media.",
      "The trial for the crime committed more than nine years ago has been long-anticipated and closely followed by press.",
      "Wearing a tailored black suit and diamond jewellery, Kardashian was supported in the courtroom by her mother, Kris Jenner, several friends, and a bevy of bodyguards.",
      "She faltered at times in her first hour of giving testimony, fidgeting with her long nails, and pausing when overwhelmed by emotion and fighting back tears. However she appeared to relax and gather strength the longer she went on, her voice becoming steadier.",
      "Tuesday's session in court was the first time Kardashian had relayed to a criminal court her account of the armed burglary, and the extent of her fears during and after the attack.",
      "'I was sure they were going to shoot me'",
      "She recounted how she had been in town for Paris Fashion Week on 2 October, and had retired for the night at around 03:00 when two masked gunmen wearing police uniforms burst into her room, dragging with them the hotel's receptionist who had been bound and gagged.",
      "She managed to call her bodyguard before one of the men then took her phone off her. They snatched her engagement ring, which had been lying on the bedside table, and then \"picked me up off the bed and grabbed me and took me down the hallway\" to look for more jewellery,\" she said.",
      "One of the men held a gun to her back at this point, and \"that was the first moment I thought, should I run for it? But it wasn't an option so I just stayed,\" she said, adding that she realised she should just \"do whatever they say\" for her safety.",
      "Kardashian said she was then thrown onto the bed and her hands bound with zip ties. At this point, she told the concierge: \"Please translate to them that I have babies, I have to make it home.\"",
      "One of the men then pulled her towards him, which opened her robe, under which she wasn't wearing anything.",
      "She told the court she was afraid she was going to be raped, saying she said a prayer to mentally prepare herself.",
      "But then her legs were tied together and a gun pointed at her. She said at that point, \"I was sure that's when they were going to shoot me.\"",
      "She thought of her family at that point, offering them a \"prayer\" that they would not have to experience her killing.",
      "She expressed fear for her sister,  Kourtney, having to walk into the hotel room to find that \"I would be shot dead on the bed and she would see that and have that memory forever.\"",
      "When asked by the judge David de Pas if she thought she was going to die she replied in a small voice: \"I absolutely did think I was gonna die.\"",
      "Kardashian said she looked in the eyes of the man who tied her up to try to remember details - and that he told her if she remained quiet, she would be ok.",
      "After the robbers took the jewellery, they dashed out of the suite, leaving Kardashian in the bathroom. She said she then managed to free her hands from the cable ties and hopped down the staircase to the first floor of the suite, where her stylist and friend Simone Harouche helped release the other ties.",
      "The two then ran out onto the balcony where they called for help while hiding in the bushes. Kardashian said she was worried the men would return, and that when Parisian police turned up, she couldn't trust them because the robbers had also been wearing police uniforms.",
      "During the testimony in the packed courtroom, Kardashian also answered several questions from the judge about why her security were not present at the time.",
      "Her usual team had been sent to accompany her sister Kourtney to the club, while Kim had stayed in.",
      "She told the court she did not have a bodyguard with her because up until the robbery, she and her family had not believed they needed that level of security. She said she had previously always felt safe to go out on the streets of Paris on her own, and they had been comfortable with their security team staying at a different hotel.",
      "\"Everything changed\" after Paris, she said, noting that she employs up to six people to guard her house at night now, and that she started to get a \"phobia of going out\" because she thought people would \"see me out and know my home was empty\".",
      "\"I can't even sleep at night if I know there's not multiple security\" guards, she said, noting her concern about copycat attacks, and that her Los Angeles house was robbed even before the family returned from the Paris trip.",
      "Seeking closure",
      "Kardashian's testimony on Tuesday was interrupted at several points by offers of apology from two of the defendants in the court room, who have pleaded guilty to the charge. While she accepted Khedache's apology, she did not acknowledge the presence of the other defendants who are contesting the charges.",
      "She ignored her former driver Gary Madar who is accused of having tipped off the burglary ring about her whereabouts. He has denied the charges.",
      "She also expressed anger over one of the defendants who has pleaded guilty, Yunice Abbas, who published a memoir in 2021 prior to the trial titled '\"I Held Up Kim Kardashian\".",
      "Kardashian told the court on Tuesday she was \"really shocked when I saw there was a book\".",
      "\"Not only did he do this, but now [he's] making money off that - my jewellery, my memories, the watch my dad who passed away gave me when I graduated high school. I can't get that back.\"",
      "She also told the court she wanted closure from the trial's proceedings.",
      "\"I wanted to be a part of today because I am a victim in this case and it's the first time I'm able to really hear from everyone and follow along,\" she said.",
      "\"This is what I do. I want to become a lawyer and I do believe everyone has the opportunity to speak their truth, and this is my closure and my opportunity to put this to rest after everything I've been through.\"",
      "Kardashian added that her job is \"to tell my truth and hope this doesn't happen to anyone else\".",
      "\"It was terrifying and life-changing and I don't wish that kind of terror on anyone - to think you could be killed or raped - I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.\""

    "story": [
      "Yuval Raphael never dreamt she'd be at Eurovision.",
      "The last major music event she attended was the Nova festival, in Israel, where she was nearly killed. On 7 October 2023, the singer fled the festival when Hamas gunmen started shooting.",
      "Now she's preparing to go on stage at the world's largest music event.",
      "\"It's something I deal with every day,\" she told the BBC. \"It feels like a personal win, just to be having this experience and representing my country and doing it with such pride.\"",
      "On that day - one and a half years ago - Ms Raphael was attending her first outdoor rave. As rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, and Hamas gunmen started shooting at revellers, she attempted to flee the carnage.",
      "She and her friends took refuge in a concrete bomb shelter at the side of a road. Around 50 people were crammed in, lying on top of each other.",
      "But there was no escape as the gunmen shot repeatedly into the mass of bodies in the shelter and then threw in hand grenades.",
      "Ms Raphael managed to call her father in tears, as heard in a recording played in an Israeli documentary. \"Dad, lots of people are dead. Send the police here. Please dad, send the police, it's urgent.. they're crushing me,\" she said.",
      "\"Be quiet,\" he replied. \"Yuvali my daughter. Yuvali, breathe deep. Hide. Play dead.\"",
      "\"Bye,\" she said, thinking that was the end.",
      "Ms Raphael was one of only 11 people in the shelter to survive. She hid under a pile of dead bodies for eight hours until they were rescued.",
      "That day, around 1,200 people were killed by gunmen led by Hamas, and 251 were taken hostage.",
      "Ms Raphael's professional singing career started after the attack. \"I wished for myself to be happy and to really understand the gift that I had been given, and that's to live,\" she says. \"To have more experiences, to be happy and to live fully.\"",
      "On Thursday, the 24-year-old will sing her song, New Day Will Rise, at the Eurovision semi-final with shrapnel still in her leg.",
      "The rules of the European Broadcasting Union \u2013 which is in charge of Eurovision \u2013 means no political statements can be made. The singer won't describe what happened to her at Nova during the run-up to the competition. She previously gave testimony about her experience to the United Nations.",
      "The Israeli entrant has had to contend with protests about her country's participation in the song contest.",
      "Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 asked the EBU for a discussion on Israel's inclusion. Its director general, Kevin Bakhurst, said he was \"appalled by the ongoing events in the Middle East and by the horrific impact on civilians in Gaza, and the fate of Israeli hostages\". Spain and Slovenia's broadcasters also asked for a discussion.",
      "Last week, more than 70 former Eurovision contestants signed a letter calling on the organisers to ban Israel from the competition.",
      "More than 52,800 people have been killed in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, including 2,700 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's health ministry.",
      "In previous years, other countries have been banned from the contest. Belarus was suspended in 2021 after submitting an overtly political entry and a year later Russia was barred over the war in Ukraine.",
      "Ms Raphael said she was trying not to deal with those who say her country shouldn't be competing. \"Everybody has opinions,\" she said. \"I'm really putting everything aside and just concentrating on the most important thing. The slogan this year is 'united by music' and that's what we are here for.\"",
      "Eurovision said it understood the concerns and views about the current situation in the Middle East, but insisted members should ensure Eurovision remained a \"universal event that promotes connections, diversity and inclusion through music\".",
      "Nevertheless, Israeli fans have been warned by their country's National Security Council not to wear Jewish or Israeli symbols while attending Eurovision.",
      "On Sunday, during the Eurovision opening parade in the Swiss host city of Basel, the Israeli broadcasting delegation made a complaint to the police and the EBU after accusing a pro-Palestinian demonstrator of making a throat-slitting gesture and spitting at the delegation.",

      "She said they had done a few rehearsals with sounds in the background so she could practise with distractions. Asked if that was upsetting, she told the BBC she had a lot of emotions she was putting aside to stay focused.",

      "Lauren: It was really treacherous\u2026 but then, the next Easyjet flight we had to catch, Charlotte was like, 'What a breeze'.",

      "Holly-Anne: We do have a preference. And I think the closer we get to it, the more hungry we are for a good result. A placement in the single digits would be nice.",
      "You have loads of festival performances booked for the summer \u2013 so life won't   grind to a halt afterwards.",
      "Lauren: That's so true. And actually, every experience that we're having in the lead-up to May 17, that's Eurovision as well.",
      "Charlotte: All the places we've been to and the people we've met \u2013 it literally feels like a girls' holiday.",

      "The 2025 Eurovision Song Contest pops its cork on Sunday, with a \"turquoise carpet\" parade featuring competitors from all 37 nations.",
      "But the competition really begins on Tuesday, when the first semi-final will see five countries unceremoniously kicked out.",
      "Another six will lose their place at the second semi-final on Thursday, before the Grand Final takes place in Basel, Switzerland, on Saturday, 17 May.",
      "This year's entrants include two returning contestants, one professional opera singer, a thinly veiled allusion to sexual emissions and a dance anthem about a dead space dog.",
      "It's a lot to take in.",
      "To help you prepare, here's a guide to all 37 songs in the contest, which I've sorted into rough musical categories, mainly for my own sanity (it didn't work).",
      "Left-field pop bangers",
      "Win or lose, UK contestants Remember Monday have given headline writers a gift with the title of their entry: What The Hell Just Happened?",
      "A souped-up, full throttle pop anthem, it cherry-picks the best bits of Queen, Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Beatles, presumably to remind voters of Britain's rich musical heritage.",
      "With eight tempo changes, it could prove tricky for voters to grasp, but the band's stellar harmonies and sparkling personalities should carry them through.",
      "Crucially, the song avoids the Eurovision cliches of jackhammer dance anthems and windswept balladry \u2013 something Remember Monday have in common with this year's favourites.",
      "Sweating it out at the top are Swedish representatives KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is an ode to the restorative powers of the sauna, complete with dancers in skimpy towels.",
      "Unreasonably catchy, it's won the approval of Abba's Bjorn Ulvaeus, whose been   singing the track in his own private sauna. As you do.",
      "Stiff competition comes from Austrian singer JJ, and his operatic ballad Wasted Love.",
      "A timeworn story of unrequited love, it leans on his training as a counter-tenor, before exploding into an unexpected techno breakdown.",
      "A favourite with the bookies, the song's only Achilles heel is its similarity to last year's winner, Nemo.",
      "Distinctive in a different way is Ireland's entry, Laika Party \u2013 a 90s trance-pop anthem about a dog who was sent to space by Russia and left to die there.",
      "Singer Emmy aims for a hopeful spin on a tragic story but, despite a peppy performance, it's a bit of a downer.",
      "More palatable is Luxembourg's Laura Thorn, whose La Poup\u00e9e Monte Le Son is a callback to France Gall's 1965 winning entry, Poup\u00e9e De Cire, Poup\u00e9e De Son.",
      "Where the original was about a \"fashion doll\" operated by songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, Thorn's response is all about taking control.",
      "\"If you think a man like you can manipulate me, go back to your mum,\" she scolds. Yeouch.",
      "Other countries sucking up to Italy",
      "Rome must be blushing. This year features not one, but two, songs about the vibrant culture of Il Bel Paese.",
      "The first comes, not surprisingly, from San Marino \u2013 the independent microstate that nestles inside north-central Italy.",
      "Titled Tutta L'Italia, it celebrates everything from the county's football team and its vineyards, to the Mona Lisa (under her Italian name Gioconda).",
      "Written by Gabry Ponte \u2013 one of the brains behind Eiffel 65's Blue (Da Ba Dee) \u2013 it's a slight, but fun, mixture of dance beats, traditional accordion playing and the folk dances of Calabria.",
      "The staging could be its downfall, though, with Gabry marooned behind his DJ decks while the singers, who for some reason wish to remain anonymous, obscure their faces with masks.",
      "More memorable, but definitely more unhinged, is Estonia's Espresso Macchiato.",
      "Performed by Tommy Cash (the only Eurovision contestant to have appeared on a Charli XCX record) it's an affectionate-ish caricature of Italian stereotypes, featuring the indelible lyric: \"Life is like spaghetti, it's hard until you make it\".",
      "Smut!",
      "I'm trying to give up sexual innuendo, but Eurovision is making it har... difficult.",
      "A trio of artists are trying to sneak smut past the censors, led by Malta's Miriana Conte, with a throbbing club track called Serving.",
      "In its original form, the song's chorus revolved around the phrase \"serving kant\" \u2013 the word kant being Maltese for \"singing\" and a homophone for an English term that definitely doesn't mean singing.",
      "It's a reference to a well-known phrase in the drag / ballroom world; but several countries complained it broke broadcasting guidelines, prompting a hasty re-write.",
      "If the stunt was meant to generate headlines it worked, but now that Miriana has our attention, she's not letting go.",
      "Her performance, featuring a giant disco ball pursed between two red lips, is gloriously OTT, and she has an enviable set of pipes. Too bad the song is riddled with Europop cliche.",
      "Another contestant doubling his entendres is Australia's Go-Jo, who wants us to \"take a sip\" of milkshake from his \"special cup\". Interpret that how you want but I'd be wary of hitching a lift in his ice cream van, if I were you.",
      "With a smattering of Electric Six's saucy disco funk, Milkshake Man is tasty enough to get Australia back in the finals after only achieving a semi last year.",
      "Finally, we have Finland's Erika Vikman, whose song Ich Komme is billed as a \"joyous message of pleasure, ecstasy and a state of trance\".",
      "Structured to mimic the pneumatic realities of lovemaking, it recalls iconic gay anthems such as Kylie's Your Disco Needs You and Donna Summer's Hot Stuff \u2013 and ends with Erika shooting into the sky astride a massive gold microphone that's definitely not a stand-in for a phallus.",
      "Three songs inspired by cancer",
      "Little in life is more devastating than the phrase \"I'm afraid it's cancer\".",
      "The disease will affect one in two of us and, although survival rates have dramatically improved, the impact can be devastating.",
      "This year, three separate Eurovision contestants have been touched by cancer, inspiring songs of unmatched heartbreak and reflection.",
      "French singer Louane captures it best. Her song Maman, is an intimate conversation with her mother, who died when she was just 17 years old.",
      "Over three verses, Louane describes the \"emptiness\" she was felt; and how she filled the void with bad behaviour and meaningless love affairs. But, as the song progresses, she tells her mum she's settled down and found purpose... by becoming a mother herself.",
      "She sings it beautifully, with a mixture of regret and strength. And when her daughter's voice appears in the final moments of the song, it would take a steely heart not to shed a tear.",
      "Over in Norway, 19-year-old Kyle Alessandro shared a similar story, when his mother was diagnosed with cancer in autumn 2023. Thankfully, she's now in remission, but something she said during her treatment inspired his Eurovision entry: \"Never lose your light.\"",
      "Kyle took that phrase and turned it into a thumping pop song about surviving adversity. \"Nothing can burn me now,\" he sings. \"I'm my own Lighter.\"",
      "Klemen Slakonja, meanwhile, is a comedian best known in Slovenia for his impressions of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin -  but his ballad, How Much Time Do We Have Left was written after his wife, actress Mojca Fatur, was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer.",
      "As he sings, Klemen's dancers raise him into the air and hold him upside down, to represent the disorientation the family felt.",
      "\"When she read her diagnosis, our world turned upside down and I felt that rush of blood in my head, the same one I feel whenever I am upside down in the performance,\" he told Eurovision World.",
      "Defying the odds, Mojca survived, and joins him on stage at Eurovision. It's a deeply intimate and moving moment.",
      "The bops",
      "Listening to this year's line-up, it's like the contestants all heard Cascada's Evacuate the Dancefloor and went, \"Nah, we're good, thanks\".",
      "There are club bangers everywhere, with Belgium's Red Sebastian (named after the crab in The Little Mermaid, bless him) submitting an entire song about the loved-up liberation of an all-night rave.",
      "\"Where no words are needed to feel the connection / Where clocks never tick and where love is the ending.\"",
      "A favourite with fans, the 90s rave elements of Strobe Lights feel a little dated to me, but his meticulously-choreographed performance is a treat.",
      "Denmark's Sissal takes a similar sound, with a throwback Euro-bop called Hallucination that effortlessly evokes two-time Eurovision winner Loreen.",
      "Sissal said her biggest goal was for the audience to feel they couldn't sit down during the song. Mission accomplished.",
      "Germany, meanwhile, are pitching for a home run with Baller, a super-catchy trance anthem that wouldn't sound out of place at Berlin superclub Berghain.",
      "Performed by Austrian siblings Abor & Tynna, it's languishing in the middle of the field, after Tynna developed laryngitis, robbing the duo of the chance to impress fans at Eurovision's various pre-parties. But now that she's recovered, the song could rise up the rankings.",
      "That's less likely for V\u00e6b, aka the Icelandic Jedward. Their energetic dance-rap song, R\u00f3a, is all about rowing from Iceland to the Faroe Islands, \"because no matter what happens in life you just keep on rowing through the waves\".",
      "Sadly, it's not as deep as it sounds.",
      "Spanish star Melody fares better with Esa Diva, a pumping house track with a sprinkling of flamenco guitar, that documents her journey to fame.",
      "And Azerbaijan's Mamagama go all Maroon 5 on Run With U, a smooth pop song elevated by a twinkling riff on the saz \u2013 a long-necked plucked instrument similar to the lute.",
      "Post-immigrant pop",
      "OK, so I've stolen that description from Shkodra Elektronike.",
      "They're an Albanian duo living in Italy, who fuse the ethnic music of their hometown, Shkod\u00ebr, to a progressive electronic sound.",
      "Their song Zjerm (Fire) imagines a time when cross-cultural understanding would lead to peace and harmony \u2013 a world without a need for soldiers and ambulances, and where \"oil would smell like lilac\" (no, me neither).",
      "Greece's entry, Asterom\u00e1ta, is also rooted in history and memory, as Klavdia describes the unbreakable bond that refugees share with their homeland.",
      "\"Even if they cross the seas / They shall never forget the sacred earth they called home,\" she sings, in a haunting ballad that blends traditional Greek and Pontic elements with soaring strings.",
      "Taking a more upbeat approach is Dutch singer Claude. A refugee from the bloody civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he moved to the Netherlands at the age of nine and fell in love with Eurovision while waiting in the refugee centre.",
      "His song, C'est La Vie, is a tribute to his mum, who taught him to see the positive in their situation.",
      "Fizzing with freedom and joy, it combines elements of chanson and French-Caribbean zouk, and looks set for a top 10 placing.",
      "Witchcraft, sorcery and moody goth boys",
      "The success of \"goth gremlin witch\" Bambie Thug at last year's Eurovision has conjured a veritable coven of imitators in 2025.",
      "Polish singer Justyna Steczkowska, representing her country for the second time, even includes a Slavic magic spell in her song, Gaja \u2013 summoning the spirit of the mother Earth to \"cleanse\" her of a toxic relationship.",
      "It's a suitably intense performance, with Justyna singing long sustained notes and playing a furious violin solo, before being hoiked into the rafters on a pair ropes.",
      "What a time to be alive.",
      "Marko Bo\u0161njak, meanwhile, is cooking up a Poison Cake to feed to his tormentors - chiefly the people who bombarded him with homophobic hate messages after he was selected to represent Croatia.",
      "The criticism was so intense that he lost his voice and couldn't leave the house for five days.",
      "His song is suitably melodramatic, replete with guttural synths and creepy playground chants. It's a little overbaked, but should still sail through to the finals.",
      "Taking a more ethereal approach are Latvian group Tautumeitas, whose song Bur Man Laimi translates as \"a chant for happiness\".",
      "Reminiscent of Bjork and Enya, its overlapping folk harmonies are based on traditional Latvian wedding songs, making it one of this year's most captivating entries. I fear it may be too subtle to score well, though.",
      "Further mystery is provided by, Theo Evan, Cyprus's answer to Nick Jonas. The lyrics to his song, Shh, are a riddle, written by former tennis player Elke Tiel, whose \"hidden truth will only be revealed on the Eurovision stage in May\".",
      "He opens his performance perched between two pieces of scaffolding in a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Vitruvian Man sketch \u2013 so there's a clue.",
      "Shh is one of a number of gothic pop songs, sung by brooding young men with interesting hair.",
      "Among the best is Kiss Kiss Goodbye, by Czechia's Adonxs, who divebombs from an angelic falsetto to an unsettling baritone as he confronts his absent father.",
      "Lithuanian band Katarsis are an interesting experiment, with a deliberately downbeat rock song that declares \"the foundations of everything have begun to rot\".",
      "Titled Tavo Akys (your eyes), it builds to a compelling climax, but it's hard to see it being a vote-winner, unless Eurovision suddenly attracts an audience of depressed emo teens.",
      "Rounding out the field are Armenian singer Parg, with the Imagine Dragons-inspired Survivor and Serbia's Princ, whose overwrought ballad is called Mila.",
      "Both performers give it their all, but the songs don't feel strong enough to survive the semi-finals.",
      "70s rock throwbacks",
      "Four years after M\u00e5neskin's victory, Eurovision's rock revival continues apace.",
      "Italy are back at it again, thanks to Lucio Corsi \u2013 think David Bowie as Pierrot \u2013 and his glam rock ballad Volevo Essere Un Duro (I wanted to be tough).",
      "A delicate anthem for people who feel they don't fit in, it recalls how Lucio was bullied as a kid, and how he's  grown to embrace his fragility. At one point, he sings: \"Instead of a star, [I'm] just a sneeze.\"",
      "It's a timeless bit of songwriting that pulls off that crucial Eurovision trick of sounding new and familiar all at once.",
      "Portuguese indie band Napa also have a 70s vibe, channelling Paul McCartney's Wings on the soft rock tear-jerker Deslocado (out of place).",
      "It's another song about migration, written after the band were forced to relocate from Madeira to the Portuguese mainland due to the economic crisis.",
      "\"Even though we've been here for a few years we always have that desire to go back, and that anguish of saying goodbye to family,\" said singer Guilherme Gomes.",
      "Last but not least are Ukraine's Ziferblat, who continue the country's astonishing run of high-quality entries in the midst of a war with Russia.",
      "Their song, Bird Of Pray, is an unexpected mix of 70s new wave band Cars, birdsong and the guitar riff from Rachel Stevens' Sweet Dreams My LA Ex \u2013 while the lyrics are full of hope for a peaceful reunion with their loved ones.",
      "It's better than that makes it sound.",
      "The ballads",
      "Where would Eurovision be without a raven-haired woman bellowing into a wind machine set to \"hurricane\"?",
      "Israel has strong form in this category, and sets the bar again with New Day Will Rise, a melancholy piano ballad sung in a mixture of English, French and Hebrew.",
      "The song's performed by Yuval Raphael, a 24-year-old who narrowly escaped with her life at the 2023 Nova music festival, where an attack by Hamas claimed the lives of 378 people and triggered Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza.",
      "It's hard not to interpret her lyrics as a response to those events \u2013 \"everyone cries, don't cry alone\". As a result, her participation hasn't received the same level of criticism as Eden Golan, who represented Israel last year.",
      "That can't be said for Georgia's contestant, Mariam Shengelia, who has been booed during pre-Eurovision appearances for her alleged support of the country's authoritarian, pro-Russian, anti-LGBT ruling party, Georgian Dream.",
      "Shengelia has denied the accusations, pointing out that her song \u2013 a stirring, quasi-militaristic ballad called Freedom \u2013 is about \"freedom of choice, freedom to love, freedom to live as you want to live\".",
      "\"No amount of manufactured hate will change that,\" she told the Eurovision fan site Wiwibloggs.",
      "Montenegro's Nina \u017di\u017ei\u0107 tackles domestic abuse in Dobrodo\u0161li, a brooding and refined orchestral ballad.",
      "The singer, who previously entered Eurovision in 2013 with the cyborg pop oddity Igranka, delivers her lyrics with passion and sincerity, but somehow the song never quite takes off.",
      "Last but not least, we have defending champions Switzerland, represented by 24-year-old Zo\u00eb M\u00eb, who describes herself as a \"little fairy\".",
      "Appropriately enough, her self-penned song, Voyage is delicate as a fairy's wings,   fluttering with a soft-spoken plea to treat each other with kindness.",
      "Automatically qualifying for the final, it's a welcome oasis of calm amidst the steamy sauna sessions, moody goth haircuts and thrusting innuendo.",
      "But that's Eurovision for you. All human life is here. See you in Basel!",
      "UK's Eurovision Song Contest hopefuls revealed",
      "The surprising history of Eurovision",

    "summary": "Eurovision songwriters, judges and more discuss crafting the ideal anthem.",
    "story": [
      "The Eurovision Song Contest was watched by around 163 million people last year \u2013 meaning there are potentially 163 million different opinions on what makes a perfect entrant.",
      "Do you go for a soulful ballad, guaranteed to leave Europe misty-eyed and full of love and peace?",
      "Or do you opt for a cheesy extravaganza, complete with saucy takes on regional costumes and eye-popping staging that will have the entire continent (and Australia) raving in their living rooms?",
      "The perfect song",
      "Forensic musicologist at Boston's Berklee College of Music Joe Bennett has analysed hundreds of Eurovision finalists, identifying two dominant musical styles.",
      "One is the \"Euro-banger\" - high-energy, 120+ BPM songs with kick drums and synth-heavy production, like Sweden's winning entries Euphoria (Loreen, 2012) and Heroes (M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w, 2015).",
      "The other is the slow-burning ballad - typically around 70 BPM, such as Portugal's Amar Pelos Dois (Salvador Sobral, 2017) and the Netherlands' Arcade (Duncan Laurence, 2019).",
      "There is a clich\u00e9 that Eurovision songs are only about love and peace \u2013 reinforced by a song performed during the 2016 contest's interval about writing a perfect Eurovision song, called Love Love Peace Peace.",
      "According to Bennett, there is some validity to this, with every Eurovision song falling under six broad lyrical themes: \"love, unity, self-assertion, partying, history and songs about making music\".",
      "He adds that \"songs of self-assertion or lyrical self-empowerment do very well\" - as seen with Austria's 2014 winner Rise Like a Phoenix (Conchita Wurst).",
      "Keep staging simple and effective",
      "Acts might be tempted to go over the top on staging, but this may not be the way to secure victory, according to our experts.",
      "Songwriter Thomas Stengaard co-wrote Denmark's 2013 winner Only Teardrops (as well as this year's UK entry What the Hell Just Happened by Remember Monday). He puts his success down, in part, to its simple staging, which he says made it easy to remember.",
      "\"If you asked a kid to draw that staging, they could. It was a girl with no shoes on, two guys playing the drums and a flute guy. Very simple, but it worked.\"",
      "Vocal coach Carrie Grant, who led the UK's jury in 2014 and came sixth in the contest as part of Sweet Dreams in 1983, agrees.",
      "\"There is nothing worse than having an artist whose stage has lots of money but their performance doesn't warrant it,\" she says. \"It makes that performance seem worse.\"",
      "The 2014 winner (and Carrie's personal favourite) was Conchita Wurst \u2013 the first act to win the contest without backing singers or dancers on stage since 1970.",
      "What made Conchita stand out was that she was a bearded drag queen. Carrie believes Eurovision fans love things that are quirky and that \"embrace the LGBT community\".",
      "But she adds that Conchita wasn't a gimmick but instead \"a brilliant singer who could deliver what we call in vocal coaching 'money moments'\".",
      "The key is key",
      "Minor-key songs increasingly dominate Eurovision.",
      "Bennett debunks the idea that \"major equals happy, minor equals sad\", adding that \"minor keys are more a shorthand for emotional depth\".",
      "In 2023, 85% of finalists performed in minor keys, according to the Press Association. In the last 20 years, only two major-key songs have won - 2011's Running Scared (for Azerbaijan) and 2017's Amar Pelos Dois.",
      "Professor Elizabeth Hellmuth Margulis, a researcher in music cognition at Princeton, highlights source sensitivity \u2013 our instinct to associate a song's sound with its intended context. A few bars of a techno song, for example, and we have a mental image of a dark nightclub, and of the sort of DJ who might perform there.",
      "This means certain minor keys now immediately signal \"Eurovision-ness\" to audiences.",
      "Remember Monday's What the Hell Just Happened was written at a songwriting camp, with multiple songwriters working together at a countryside retreat to write the perfect song for this year's UK act.",
      "The song was intentionally written in a major key to stand out in a sea of minor-key songs - similar to the UK's 2022 second-place entry, Spaceman by Sam Ryder (B Major).",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 of this year\u2019s Eurovision songs",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 of this year\u2019s Eurovision songs",
      "Have a surprise up your sleeve",
      "Repetition is important to make a song stick in the mind, says Margulis. But songs should avoid being too repetitive. Margulis says that what particularly makes a song catchy is \"not only when they are heard repeatedly, but also when they throw in some kind of surprise twist\".",
      "Bucks Fizz's 1981 winner for the UK, Making Your Mind Up, is a classic example. First, the song changes key, quickly followed by a memorable costume change in which the female singers' skirts were ripped off to reveal shorter skirts \u2013 a joint visual and musical twist.",
      "Earlier Eurovision winners were often mocked for their nonsense lyrics, like Sweden's 1984 winner Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley, but Bennett argues this highlights Eurovision's strong focus on melody.",
      "\"Eurovision really needs big melodic hooks. You want people across Europe to be singing that melody. The need for a very accessible, catchy chorus is essential.\"",
      "Key changes have long been a way to introduce novelty into Eurovision songs. The 2000s saw multiple winners follow this formula, including Olsen Brothers' Fly on the Wings of Love for Norway (2000), and Serbia's Molitva in 2007.",
      "But as Bennett points out, though they are still present in around a fifth of finalists, no song with a final chorus key change has won since Molitva almost 20 years ago.",
      "Stengaard's song for this year's UK act Remember Monday is certainly full of surprises. BBC music correspondent Mark Savage said the song featured \"a dizzying array of key changes and tempo shifts\".",
      "The song is the songwriter's answer to the question he asks himself whenever he writes for Eurovision: \"How do you stand out in a contest where everyone wants to stand out?\"",

    "summary": "The city at the crossroads of France, Germany and Switzerland gears up amid global tensions over diversity and inclusion.",
    "story": [
      "The Swiss city of Basel is going into party mode this weekend, as it prepares to welcome the Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "It's been 36 years since Switzerland last hosted the contest, after Celine Dion won in 1988, so the wait to roll out Eurovision's famous turquoise carpet has been long.",
      "Switzerland hosted the first ever Eurovision at Lugano in 1956, but its record since Dion's victory in Dublin has been mixed.",
      "Between 2007 and 2010, and again between 2015 and 2018, its entries failed to even qualify for the final. Swiss singer Nemo finally won last year with The Code.",
      "Perhaps because of that, Basel is determined to make this contest memorable for all the right reasons. At 1.3km (0.8 miles), its turquoise carpet will be Eurovision's longest ever, stretching from Basel town hall, across the river Rhine all the way to the Eurovision village.",
      "The head of Basel's government, Conradin Cramer, believes his city of just 175,000 residents is the natural home for Eurovision's estimated half a million visitors.",
      "Because of its borders with both France and Germany, Basel is \"the heart of Europe\", he says. What's more, he points out, the city has a long humanist tradition; when other cities in medieval Europe were cracking down on free thinkers, Basel welcomed them.",
      "So Basel, with its geographic location and its history of tolerance, and Eurovision with its tradition of inclusivity and diversity are, he says \"the perfect match\".",
      "How to win Eurovision, according to the experts",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 Eurovision songs",
      "Ireland asks Eurovision organisers for discussion over Israel",
      "Last year's contest in Malmo attracted thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators and further protests against the war in Gaza are expected in Basel too.",
      "Police have not yet released their plans to manage this, but have said that everyone should have the right to express their opinion, as long they stay within the law, and do not risk the safety of others.",
      "Throughout the contest they say 1,300 officers will be on duty. Basel has also unveiled a security operation to ensure visitors can enjoy the song contest safely. They are promising \"mobile awareness teams\", safe retreats for victims of violence or hostility and a 24-hour hotline. The concept, which Basel officials describe as unique, aims to prevent violence, sexual assault or harassment, and racist aggression and insults.",
      "The awareness teams, recognisable by their pink jackets, will be available 24 hours a day across the city. Basel's security director Stephanie Eymann said the teams were a \"low-threshold\" measure to give visitors a chance to report harassment or assaults, and seek protection, even if some might not want to approach the police.",
      "The entire town appears to have embraced the event, with turquoise welcome flags now waving from every lamp post. Tickets for the contest itself sold out in minutes, but Basel is promising that there will be \"something for everyone\", ticket or no ticket, and most of it will be free.",
      "\"There will be concerts all over the city, there will be art projects,\" says tourism director Letizia Elia. Basel has 40 museums and galleries in a space of just 37 square kilometres, a record for a European city, and they are all getting involved.",
      "An exhibition featuring works by Andy Warhol, Mark Rothko, Wassily Kandinsky, and Pablo Picasso has opened at the Beyeler Foundation, where Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone's We are Poems rainbow sculpture sits on the roof. There's also a Glitz and Glam exhibition at Basel's museum of natural history.",
      "The celebrations have spread across Switzerland, with competitions across the country for the best school band \u2013 the top four will get a spot on stage in Basel.",
      "But hosting an event like Eurovision is never hitch-free, and this one is no exception. The final choice of Basel as a venue was only made at the end of August last year, allowing just over seven months to organise everything.",
      "Then came objections from evangelical Christian groups, who claimed Eurovision undermined traditional family values and that performers regularly sang about satanism and the occult. They gathered enough signatures to force a referendum aimed at banning public money for the event.",
      "But on 24 November voters gave a huge yes to the song contest; with 66.6% approving Basel's budget of almost $40m. Conradin Cramer had expected a referendum, because \"that's how Switzerland works, it's perfectly fine.\" But he was still delighted at the size of the vote in favour: \"It shows this is a city where people really want to do this.\"",
      "He is very conscious that the global debate around diversity and inclusion has changed in the year since Swiss singer Nemo became the first non-binary person to win Eurovision.",
      "The overriding message of Basel, Mr Cramer says, is \"everyone is welcome\".",
      "On-stage and in the dressing rooms though, things are stricter. EBU, which runs the contest itself, has stuck to its rules saying performers can only bring their own national flags onstage or into the green rooms. This means that they will not be able to fly the Pride flag or that of any other gender identity or sexuality.",
      "Fans, however, will be able to bring whatever flags they like into the arena.",
      "Last year Swiss winner Nemo did wave a non-binary flag during the performance, but said they had to 'smuggle' the flag in. This year LGBTQ+ groups say they are disappointed the EBU has not relaxed the rules.",
      "\"Banning our symbols is a slap in the face for the LGBTIQ community', said Swiss group Pink Cross. \"It sends the wrong message at a time when queer communities across Europe are facing increasing hostility.\"",
      "EBU has said that the guidelines were designed to create clarity and balance explaining: \"Eurovision needs no flag to demonstrate its alliance and celebration of the LGBTQ+ community.\"",
      "Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump's administration is actively removing government support for diversity and inclusion measures, and he is asking partnered European institutions (including some Swiss universities) to do the same.",
      "That's why Basel, says Mr Cramer, should take a stand, even if the EBU will not.",
      "\"These are our European values. People and nations are coming together in a friendly championship. Whoever you are, if you are young, if you are not that young, if you are straight, if you are gay, if you are female, male, or if you are non-binary, this is all perfectly fine. And I think this is not just what Basel stands for, this is what Europe should stand for.\"",
      "So if everyone is welcome, how do they get there? The host country being Switzerland, punctual transport is catered for. Swiss railways is laying on hundreds of extra trains. In Basel, the trams will run 24 hours a day.",
      "And, for those who are really in Eurovision mode, there is even a karaoke tram, where passengers can take a free 90-minute journey right across town, all the while singing their hearts out."

    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 00:57:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Senior figures in the UK TV industry are contemplating how best to secure its future",
    "story": [
      "Just before Christmas, in a private dining room in the upmarket Charlotte Street Hotel in the heart of London's Fitzrovia area, the BBC's director general gathered some of the UK's leading TV creatives and executives for lunch. As they ate, surrounded by kaleidoscopic-patterned wallpaper and giant artworks, they were also chewing over the future survival of their own industry.",
      "As solutions were thrown around to what many see as an acute funding crisis in the age of global streaming, one of the invitees suggested, in passing, that BBC Studios (the corporation's commercial content-producing arm) could merge with Channel 4 to create a bigger, more powerful force to compete with the likes of Disney Plus, Netflix and Amazon.",
      "As another diner knocked down the idea, I'm told that Tim Davie, the BBC's DG, asked why it was so ridiculous.",
      "I relate that not because it has come to fruition. It hasn't. Nor even to suggest that the Director General supports the idea.",
      "Instead the story illustrates the belief, among some within the broadcasting industry, that nothing should be off the table when it comes to contemplating how to ensure the survival of British-originated and British-focused TV as we know it.",
      "Many of the people I spoke to for this piece didn't want to be quoted. But Sir Peter Bazalgette, the former Chairman of ITV, told me that what he termed the current \"generous spread\" of British broadcasters (BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5) will need some consolidation or, at the very least, more cooperation in future.",
      "\"We're in danger of having no public service broadcasting within a decade, certainly within 20 years,\" he says. \"We don't have a strategy for their survival. It's that serious. The regulators need to start thinking about it.",
      "\"Mergers may well be part of the answer. There should be fewer companies in the future.\"",
      "Lord Vaizey, who was Culture Minister under David Cameron, put it baldly. \"ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 should merge.",
      "\"The UK only has room for two domestic broadcasters.\"",
      "Others, however, argue that distinctiveness is good for viewers. Channel 5 President Sarah Rose told me she \"couldn't disagree with Ed Vaizey more\" \u2013 calling it a \"Doomsday prophecy\".",
      "Channel 5 is profitable, she tells me; it invests in smaller production companies and offers plurality for British audiences. By having just one commercial channel, \"You're taking the funnel from three to one types of content for British audiences.\"",
      "Channel 4 also rejects the suggestion of any merger. Its outgoing CEO Alex Mahon argues that, \"The unique structure of competition between our publicly funded and commercially funded broadcasters\" is what makes UK public service TV \"so excellent\".",
      "And yet the days of turning on your TV and finding an electronic programme guide listing channels \u2013 with BBC1 and BBC2 at the top, then ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 \u2013 are disappearing. The proposed date for the dawn of a new era is 2035; the end of traditional terrestrial TV as we know it.",
      "When the increasingly expensive contracts to provide broadcast channels and digital terrestrial services like Freeview come to an end, the UK's broadcasters are likely to pivot to offering digital-only video on demand. (However this won't happen without a campaign to ensure older people are protected, as well as rural and low-income households who may not have high quality internet access.)",
      "But if the aerials are turned off in 2035, is this the moment TV as we know it changes forever? If it becomes a battle between online-only British streamers and their better-funded US rivals, can the Brits survive? And, crucially, what will audiences be watching?",
      "How TV could look by 2035",
      "Flash forward to switching on the television in 2035 and there will of course have been certain technological transformations \u2013 perhaps more immersive viewing experiences or some shows viewed through augmented reality glasses. What's highly likely, though, is that the communal big screen will still be a staple, (albeit probably voice-activated by then).",
      "It's a shift that has already begun with YouTube viewers changing their viewing habits and moving to the bigger screen. In 2024, for the first time, TV sets were the most-used device for watching content on the video sharing site at home, according to recent data from Barb Audiences. In all, 41% of YouTube viewing was done on TV sets, ahead of 31% on smartphones.",
      "With YouTube an apparently unstoppable force, in ten years' time it could well become the go-to viewing for the majority.",
      "\"We are likely to continue to see a shift in the share of viewing time and advertising revenue towards globally-scaled players and user-generated content platforms like YouTube and TikTok,\" all within the next five years, according to Kate Scott-Dawkins, Global President for Business Intelligence at media investment company Group M.",
      "There'll also likely be Netflix, Disney, Apple, Amazon. In other words, the global players, based in the US, many of which also have other revenue streams (whether parks, computer hardware or a vast shopping platform).",
      "Kate Scott-Dawkins tells me the UK broadcasters are facing what could be an \"existential\" battle against US-based media companies with \"wildly different business models\".",
      "The shift to streaming TV has, she says, \"enabled large globally-scaled players to get even bigger and pour money into content that they can put in front of worldwide audiences\".",
      "The \"big players with big pockets\" already pay for a bespoke button on certain remote controls, or their own content tile front and centre on the homepage on smart TVs.",
      "Ms Scott-Dawkins believes that in the future it will be \"a position of strength\" to own the operating systems themselves, as well as the media that people are watching on them. Examples include Apple showing its films and television series on Apple TVs and iPhones, or Amazon showing its own productions via its Fire devices, or Google through its own computers and phones.",
      "Questions of revenue",
      "Part of the problem is that the UK terrestrial channels can't compete financially with the streamers. Netflix, for example, is valued at $472bn (\u00a3356bn).",
      "The BBC has lost 30% of its income \u2013 or \u00a31bn a year \u2013 in real terms since 2010, as the licence fee has become worth less. ITV's share price hasn't yet recovered since the advertising downturn in 2022, despite its vast production arm, ITV Studios, boosting its earnings before tax to \u00a3299m.",
      "Meanwhile, Channel 4's recorded a deficit of \u00a352m for 2023. Alex Mahon told Parliament last month, \"We will pretty much break even in the year\".",
      "Some TV insiders think the solution will be one gateway or app for all public service content: one place to find all shows from BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and 5.",
      "Alex Mahon recently told a newspaper that there needs to be \"more collaboration\" between the UK broadcasters \u2013 a way of \"making sure we're not duplicating the same technology\".",
      "ITV has spent hundreds of millions to create ITVX, its streaming platform for the Netflix-age. Channel 4 took a pioneering approach to its own digital transformation, launching 4oD back in 2006; the first broadcaster in the world to offer television content on-demand.",
      "But while its current \u00a31bn a year revenue enables it to compete as a significant content creator, this may not be enough to sustain a modern distribution platform with all the associated investment costs into the long term, according to some insiders.",
      "Lord Hall, the former BBC Director General, is among those arguing that it's not sustainable for individual broadcasters to continue going it alone. \"The notion that everyone has their own portals when you are competing against the huge streamers is not going to survive into the future,\" he says.",
      "'One big streamer under iPlayer'?",
      "Could the solution be for BBC iPlayer, which has been built with public money, to become the portal for the other British public service media content, too? It would be a single place where viewers could find ITV's The Chase, Channel 4's The Great British Bake Off and Channel 5 News, alongside BBC's The Traitors. This was one idea suggested to me by multiple TV insiders. \"One big streamer under iPlayer\", as one TV executive described it to me, \"a modern public service streaming service\".",
      "Part of their argument is that it's the fastest growing streaming service in the UK \u2013 and the only existing platform of plausible scale to compete.",
      "With political support and the right deal, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 could potentially get behind sharing tech (after all, the streaming service Freely, which launched last year, already hosts their content with the BBC's and others).",
      "But the idea of branding this all under the BBC iPlayer is \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 not something that commercial broadcasters would likely entertain, according to conversations I've had.",
      "Lord Hall believes, \"It could be branded differently... It would be a very good step.\"",
      "He says: \"The public would have to get used to the fact that BBC material would be free of advertising, and other parts of the platform would have adverts.\"",
      "If the idea of a shared streaming service sounds familiar, that's because it was proposed years ago. Project Kangaroo was a plan by BBC Worldwide, ITV and Channel 4 for a UK video-on-demand joint venture. Think an early rival to Netflix.",
      "But the UK's Competition Commission blocked the project in 2009 because of concerns it could harm competition in the emerging VoD market.",
      "Other regulators across Europe have also blocked mergers: In France, the TFI and M6 channels were prevented from merging. Two of the largest TV and radio broadcasters in the Netherlands, which would have combined eight national TV channels and four national radio stations, were also stopped for competition reasons.",
      "Any form of merger between different public service broadcasters would be subject to the same scrutiny. It's perhaps why Sir Peter Bazalgette is calling on UK politicians and regulators to focus on creating a strategy \u2013 or risk the end of British TV as we know it.",
      "Should the audiences care?",
      "The BBC remains the most watched of the traditional broadcasters. Today, people in the UK spend more time watching traditional broadcasters than they do streaming services. Figures show 87% of people age four and above watch the traditional broadcasters each month and they spend an average of 137 minutes a day doing so. By comparison, 78% of people watch a streaming service and they spend only 40 minutes a day doing so.",
      "If this does shift and the pattern reverses, TV producers and executives may be worried. But does it really matter to audiences?",
      "Netflix is already making the types of shows that may have previously been made by the likes of the BBC (Adolescence, Toxic Town and Baby Reindeer are all very British stories made by the streamer). So what is the problem? (Aside from the obvious point that you need a subscription to watch Netflix.)",
      "Ms Rose argues that the picture is \"much more complex\". Creatives involved in those shows often cut their teeth in public service TV, she says \u2013 one of benefits of the traditional broadcasters is, she believes, that it is a pipeline of talent.",
      "Sir Peter Bazalgette argues that they're needed more than ever in our AI age to serve as \"a gold standard of trusted news for our democracy, amid the online Tower of Babel.\"",
      "He also argues for programmes that reflect \"our shared values and national conversation\". Would a US-based streamer have chosen to make Mr Bates v the Post Office (ITV), for example, or 'Wolf Hall' (BBC) or 'It's A Sin' (Channel 4) \u2013 stories that are uniquely British and reflect who we are?",
      "Backing producers to take risks is, says Lord Hall, \"exactly what the BBC should be doing \u2013 but of course [it] has been doing less because the licence fee has been consistently cut\".",
      "Start of the 'martini streaming age'",
      "Ultimately, the American streamers are here to stay; they're spending billions and their UK operations are often led by British executives who are supportive of Britain's public service broadcasting scene.",
      "I have also picked up a sense from those inside Netflix that the company is often used as a battering ram to persuade the government that the UK's traditional broadcasters need more protections.",
      "Some have also been critical of the BBC for, as they see it, wanting everything on its own terms: \"'We want you to give us your money for co-productions, but the BBC will make all the creative decisions',\" is how one insider put it to me, unfairly or not.",
      "In 2018, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos was invited to the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. Invitees recall that he talked warmly about how influential the BBC's iPlayer had been to the success of Netflix, describing how impressed he had been by a piece of kit that had got British viewers used to getting their video on demand.",
      "With more than 17 million Brits now subscribed to Netflix, there is a certain irony to that.",
      "Today, as the BBC's Director General Tim Davie starts to position the BBC ahead of the renewal of the corporation's charter after 2027, the TV landscape is changing fast. And the challenges are clear.",
      "Lord Hall tells me: \"Our lives will be enriched by having not only what the streamers can offer, but also what the public service broadcasters can bring. It's unthinkable not to build on what the BBC and others can deliver\".",
      "Sir Peter Bazalgette predicts that, \"Small doesn't cut it,\" adding that, \"The winners will have to be big enough to [both] afford high end dramas for winning subscribers and maintain large back catalogues to keep subscribers happy.\"",
      "He says we now live in \"the 'martini' streaming age - any time, any place, anywhere\".",
      "The question is whether the leaders of the public service broadcasters can forge the right plan to safeguard their industry in that age.",
      "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",
      "The divides behind the scenes in the Vatican ahead of the conclave",

      "\"I decided to have my wedding dress reworked today because wearing it once feels like a travesty,\" she told her Instagram followers.",

      "The Scottish actor and host of the US version of The Traitors greeted us on the red carpet on Sunday afternoon in a black morning-style suit with fabulous white cape detail that looked like angel wings.",
      "Our evening's host was introduced ahead of his arrival on stage in a video showing him in the Traitors' turret, jokingly claiming that taking the helm at the Bafta TV awards was \"the 12th biggest honour of my life\" and promising not to have a wardrobe malfunction (but \"whatever pops out pops out\u201d).",
      "The audience seemed to enjoy his gentle - and sometimes acerbic - humour at their expense and he treated us to three, yes three, costume changes.",
      "The morning suit was replaced with an electric-blue shiny suit featuring wide-leg trousers, complete with leopard-print shirt and corsage. That later changed to a pale pink suit with silver beading before a final switch to a dark brown velvet number. \"I changed again, so sue me,\" he told viewers.",

And I hope that we will carry on working together... we will. Because we both like sitting in a room together. We do a lot of napping, but we do write as well.\"",

      "Following a powerful speech about the impact the drama about the Post Office scandal had, the cast and creatives headed backstage to make a plea.",

    "summary": "The jury in the federal sex trafficking trial will be sworn in on Monday before opening statements are delivered.",
    "story": [
      "The trial of American music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who is accused of running a sprawling sex trafficking operation, has heard opening statements.",
      "The 55-year-old was arrested last September and faces charges including racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.",
      "Mr Combs has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations against him.",
      "Dozens of prospective jurors were screened before being whittled down to 12 - and six alternates.",
      "The first week of testimony will include two witnesses who are expected to speak briefly, prosecutors said, followed by a third witness who will see more time on the stand.",
      "Mr Combs also faces dozens of civil lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people. He has said the individual lawsuits are attempts \"for a quick payday\".",
      "How can I follow the trial?",
      "The court is expected to be open to the public, but proceedings will not be televised or streamed online.",
      "Cameras, phones and electronic devices are normally not allowed in US federal courtrooms.",
      "The trial proceedings began in early May with jury selection at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in lower Manhattan.",
      "US District Judge Arun Subramanian told jurors the trial could last around eight weeks.",
      "How were jurors selected?",
      "Dozens of potential jurors were vetted by the court.",
      "The process included potential jurors looking through a long list of places and people that could be mentioned during trial, with names like Kanye West and Kid Cudi.",
      "The \"People and Places\" list was so long that Judge Subramanian said he \"felt like I was reading an appendix for Lord of the Rings\".",
      "Potential jurors also had to fill out questionnaires that asked whether they had \"views about hip hop artists\" or \"feelings concerning violence, sexual assault\".",
      "The judge reminded the court several times of the importance of choosing a fair and impartial jury.",
      "Nearly all the potential jurors had read news reports of the allegations in the case and many had seen footage of Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a hotel hallway.",
      "What are the charges and allegations against Diddy?",
      "In the federal criminal case being heard in New York, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Many of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.",
      "This includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.",
      "In a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.",
      "Separately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.",
      "Tony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US had either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or intended to do so.",
      "In December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack.",
      "Mr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"",
      "Mr Combs' current legal issues began in late 2023 when he was sued by Ms Ventura, also known as Cassie, for violent abuse and rape.",
      "That lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.",
      "Since then, dozens of other people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all the claims.",
      "His controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CNN leaked CCTV footage from 2016 showing Mr Combs kicking his ex-girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor.",
      "He apologised for his behaviour, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"",

      "'Studio sex' and 'hitman threats': Insiders speak out about Diddy's 90s music",
      "Diddy's violence left me broken, says Cassie",
      "What has Diddy said about the charges against him?",
      "In a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, Mr Combs' lawyer said: \"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"",
      "Diddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss one part of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.",
      "In a hearing in New York a week before the trial officially began, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal.",
      "They said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers.",
      "At the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal.",
      "Mr Combs' lawyers have consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as \"sickening\" and suggesting they were made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".",
      "How long could Diddy spend in jail if he is found guilty?",
      "If convicted on the racketeering charge, Mr Combs faces up to life in prison.",
      "He faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.",
      "Transportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.",
      "Mr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.",
      "Critics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence.",
      "His lawyers argued for his release, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions, but a New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.",
      "Prosecutors previously alleged that Mr Combs had broken prison rules by contacting potential witnesses.",
      "They accused him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".",
      "A judge granted Mr Combs permission to wear non-prison clothing during his trial rather than the jumpsuits he wears in jail.",
      "When he appeared in court for jury selection, the rapper wore a blue sweater and white shirt with glasses on his head.",
      "How did 'Sean 'Diddy' Combs become successful?",
      "Mr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged in the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.",
      "His early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or The Notorious B.I.G.",
      "His music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.",
      "Mr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand C\u00eeroc.",

    "summary": "MPs say new laws and \"deep-rooted cultural change\" are needed at the Department for Work and Pensions.",
    "story": [
      "MPs are calling for a change in the law to prevent benefit claimants from suffering harm at the hands of the government department that is meant to help them.",
      "Several people have died in recent years after failures by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).",
      "A cross-party committee of MPs says new legislation and \"deep-rooted cultural change\" at the DWP are needed to protect vulnerable clients.",
      "A DWP spokesperson said the government was \"currently consulting on a new safeguarding approach\" which \"genuinely supports vulnerable people\".",
      "In recent years, the deaths of Errol Graham, Philippa Day and Kevin Gale have seen the DWP widely criticized for its handling of vulnerable clients.",
      "Mr Graham, who suffered from severe mental health problems, weighed just four-and-a-half stone when he died in 2018 after his benefits were wrongly stoppedIn 2019, a coroner found that Ms Day took her own life after her benefits were cut in error Kevin Gale died by suicide in 2022, having been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, exacerbated by his universal credit application",
      "Mr Graham, who suffered from severe mental health problems, weighed just four-and-a-half stone when he died in 2018 after his benefits were wrongly stopped",
      "In 2019, a coroner found that Ms Day took her own life after her benefits were cut in error",
      "Kevin Gale died by suicide in 2022, having been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, exacerbated by his universal credit application",
      "In Mr Gale's case, the coroner highlighted \"that current DWP procedures may not be practical for those with mental health illness and can exacerbate symptoms\".",
      "The inquest heard of the number and length of DWP forms that claimants were required to complete, the length of telephone queues for DWP advisers, and the requirement to travel long distances for appointments for people affected by mental health illness.",
      "Thursday's report, from the Work and Pensions Select Committee, reveals the deaths of at least 274 people have been investigated internally by the DWP in since April 2015.",
      "Such inquiries - Internal Process Reviews - are launched when there is an allegation that a case has been mishandled by the DWP which has potentially contributed to serious harm or a safeguarding concern.",
      "During the same period, 58 reviews were opened into cases where customers suffered harm - but the MPs said the scale of the failings was likely to be greater.",
      "\"That people continue to face harm after dealing with the DWP is a self-evident failure of safeguarding in the system,\" said committee chair Debbie Abrahams MP.",
      "\"Until recently, getting people back into work to cut costs had been prioritised over providing support and care for vulnerable people,\" Ms Abrahams added.",
      "\"We heard evidence that the process of engaging with the DWP... too often led to mental distress.",
      "\"Deep-rooted cultural change of the DWP is desperately needed to rebuild trust and put safeguarding at the heart of policy development.",
      "\"Introducing a statutory duty to safeguard vulnerable claimants for the department is a fundamental part of this.\"",
      "A new law, holding the secretary of state accountable for safeguarding clients, would ensure that everyone saw it as their responsibility to protect claimants, says the committee.",
      "'Nasty and traumatic'",
      "Carl, 44, a former roofer from Croydon, south London, said his first interaction with the DWP \"felt quite a nasty and traumatic experience\".",
      "He had struggled for 18 months with a degenerative back condition that had left him with mobility issues and constant pain, requiring strong painkillers.",
      "In 2018, after trying a variety of less manual roles, such as plastering and carpet fitting, he realised he could no longer hold down a job.",
      "He applied for universal credit, his first ever benefit application, which led to an appointment at his local job centre.",
      "Carl says the work coach was \"very dismissive and patronising\".",
      "\"He said: 'If you want money from us, you're going to have to jump through these hoops.'",
      "\"It almost felt like he was trying to imply that I was being dishonest and I was putting it on.",
      "\"It was a very uncaring response. I wanted support to get a non-manual job.\"",
      "'Absolutely life-changing'",
      "Shannon Johnstone, 28, who found herself sleeping rough about seven years ago before turning to the DWP for help, said the recommendations \"are going to be absolutely life-changing for people... if they're done right\".",
      "At the start of her claim, she remembers the DWP told her: \"We can't help with your homelessness,\" which she says was understandable but off-putting.",
      "She does not know if they referred her case to homeless organisations as she was never told. Now she welcomes the recommendation to include the views of people with lived experience in the design, planning and implementation of DWP policy.",
      "\"People who have gone through the system understand what it feels like to be interviewed by a [DWP] inspector,\" says Shannon who now works for the charity, Expert Link.",
      "\"They understand what it's like to gather lots of paperwork, so by including them in the design of the system, it's going to work so much better.\"",
      "In a statement, the DWP said the government was committed to protecting the people who use its services \"and fixing the broken welfare system we inherited so it works for those who need it\".",
      "\"That's why we are currently consulting on a new safeguarding approach and our reforms will improve people's lives and rebuild trust, by establishing an approach that genuinely supports vulnerable people.\"",
      "The spokesperson added that the government was encouraging people to have their voices heard in the consultation and help build a system \"that works better for all\"."

    "story": [
      "Family doctors in England are deeply divided on the issue of assisted dying, BBC research on plans to legalise the practice suggests.",
      "The findings give a unique insight into how strongly many GPs feel about the proposed new law - and highlight how personal beliefs and experiences are shaping doctors' views on the issue.",
      "BBC News sent more than 5,000 GPs a questionnaire asking whether they agreed with changing the law to allow assisted dying for certain terminally ill people in England and Wales.",
      "More than 1,000 GPs replied, with about 500 telling us they were against an assisted dying law and about 400 saying they were in favour.",
      "Some of the 500 GPs who told us they were against the law change called the bill \"appalling\", \"highly dangerous\", and \"cruel\". \"We are doctors, not murderers,\" one said.",
      "Of the 400 who said they supported assisted dying, some described the bill as \"long overdue\" and \"a basic human right\".",
      "\"We are keeping human bodies alive in the most inhumane manner,\" one said. They asked: \"How do we ethically justify forcing these bodies to continue to exist in decrepitude?\"",
      "We cannot know whether the GPs who responded to the BBC are representative of all family doctors.",
      "How could assisted dying laws change across the UK?",
      "What next for Scotland's assisted dying bill?",
      "California man invites BBC to witness his death as MPs debate assisted dying",
      "'I could live 30 years but plan to die': How assisted dying law is dividing Canadians",
      "It comes as MPs will this week again debate proposed changes to the controversial bill, with a vote in parliament expected on whether to pass or block it next month.",
      "If assisted dying does become legal in England and Wales, it would be a historic change for society.",
      "Current laws prevent medics from helping any patient to carry out their wish to die. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow any doctor to be involved in assisted dying, but GPs are often a large part of the practice in other countries. On Tuesday, a separate bill to legalise assisted dying in Scotland passed an initial vote.",
      "The BBC's research, carried out over a few weeks in March and April, is the first in-depth look at how GPs in England feel about the proposed new law.",
      "Read more on the three GPs' views",
      "Read more on the three GPs' views",
      "Nine out of 10 GPs who said they were against legalising assisted dying worried terminally ill patients would consider it because they felt guilty about being a burden on their loved ones or the health service.",
      "\"The right to die becomes a duty to die for those who feel a burden on family,\" said one GP.",
      "Another common concern was patients might be coerced. Some told us they had treated elderly people with family members they suspected of being more focussed on their inheritance than their relatives.",
      "More than half of the group who opposed a law change said it would be against their religious beliefs.",
      "They spoke about life being \"sacred\" and called assisted dying \"sinful\". Some referred to the commandment \"thou shalt not kill\".",
      "Another argument from those who said they were against assisted dying was the health system should instead focus on improving end-of-life care.",
      "One GP said creating an assisted dying law was \"scandalous\" when hospices were largely funded by charities rather than by the state.",
      "Separately, on Tuesday the Royal College of Psychiatrists said that while the group \"remains neutral\" on the principle of assisted dying, it \"just cannot support this bill\".",
      "In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, the college's president Dr Lade Smith cited a lack of requirements concerning the \"unmet needs\" of patients, and a shortage of psychiatrists to process requests.",
      "\"We're concerned that there isn't a requirement to think about any unmet needs a person might have. A person with a terminal illness... they may be in pain, they have difficulty with their housing, their finances because they haven't been able to work, they might feel lonely, isolated,\" Dr Smith said.",
      "Dr Gordon Macdonald, CEO of Care Not Killing said there was a \"black hole\" in the hospice budget and \"we need better care not killing\".",
      "Dying with dignity",
      "More than 400 GPs told us they supported a law change, with some describing feeling \"traumatised\" and \"haunted\" by watching people die in \"severe pain or distress\".",
      "Of those who said they were in favour, more than nine in 10 respondents believed it could allow patients to have a dignified death.",
      "Some shared personal experiences: telling us about watching their parents losing dignity or begging to die. One said their sick wife prayed every evening to not wake up in the morning.",
      "Those who backed assisted dying often spoke about patient choice, arguing it was patronising not to let people decide how they wanted to die.",
      "Wanting the option of an assisted death for themselves or their loved ones was another common reason for supporting the law.",
      "\"Personally, I would find this a comfort and I resent those who take this choice away from me,\" one told us.",
      "'Unpredictable' timeframe",
      "If assisted dying does become law in England and Wales, it would apply to certain terminally ill patients who were reasonably expected to die within six months.",
      "But more than a quarter of all the GPs who responded told us they would rarely, or never be confident assessing if a patient was expected to die in that time frame.",
      "\"It's unpredictable even in the severely frail,\" one said.",
      "No doctor would be obliged to work in assisted dying. Of the 1,000 GP respondents, more than 500 told us they would be willing to discuss assisted dying with a patient.",
      "Nearly 300 would assess if a patient was eligible and 161 said they would prepare a substance for a patient to take to end their own life.",
      "Legal risks",
      "Prof Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the BBC's research showed GPs had \"real concerns about the practical and legal implications of a change in the law on assisted dying\".",
      "\"These must be acknowledged and addressed, so that any legislation is watertight,\" she said.",
      "Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said GPs and other medics will \"rightly be considering how they will navigate\" the proposed law.",
      "She said evidence from assisted dying laws in Australia and the US showed it could be carried out \"safely and effectively, with far reaching benefits for end-of-life care and robust protections for both patients and doctors\".",

      "Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: \"While this research is still in its infancy, it is an exciting discovery that adding olaparib at a carefully-timed stage of treatment can potentially give patients with this specific type of breast cancer more time with their loved ones.\"",

      "He used a technique known as mesh rectopexy to treat bowel problems.",
      "Through the procedure, mesh implants are placed into the body to treat pelvic organ prolapse which can occur after childbirth.",
      "The mesh, which is usually made from synthetic polypropylene, is intended to repair damaged or weakened tissue.",
      "At the point of his suspension in 2024, the MTPS said Dr Dixon's \"misconduct was so serious that action needed be taken to protect members of the public\".",
      "But, the tribunal considered that a longer period of suspension would be unduly punitive, especially taking into account the period that Dr Dixon had already been the subject of fitness to practise proceedings.",
      "As founder of the Pelvic Floor Society, he drew heavily on claims he had made in medical publications about the success rates of the rectopexy mesh surgery he pioneered.",
      "But now questions are being raised by the MPTS about the honesty his follow-up data which has to be written contemporaneously.",
      "A BBC Inside Out investigation in 2017 first revealed Dr Dixon had carried out unnecessary operations and raised questions about whether he provided adequate medical follow.",
      "Two investigations at Southmead Hospital and Spire Bristol subsequently found Mr Dixon caused harm to hundreds of people by carrying out operations that were not necessary.",
      "Both hospitals apologised to victims after his suspension.",

      "\"Sometimes or often these papers are used when guidelines are formulated or referred to. So their conclusions can go on to influence many different things .\"",
      "The BBC has separately approached more than 40 former mesh patients of Dr Dixon via the Rectopexy Mesh Victims and Support group.",
      "None of them recognise the follow up form which he had claimed to have used in publications for up to five years post operative follow up.",
      "They include Debbie Cooper Jones, a dentist from Gloucester.",

      "He believes the convenience of high-protein snacks, combined with the positive perception of the nutrient among customers, has led to manufacturers using protein as a marketing tool.",
      "For manufacturers to claim their product is a source of protein, they must show regulators at least 12% of its energy value is provided by protein. To make a claim that a product is high in protein, the figure is 20%.",

      "It was previously unclear whether this would apply to the approximately 1.5 million foreign workers who have moved to the UK since 2020.",

      "The Migration Observatory said a 10-year route to settlement would make the UK more restrictive than most other high-income countries but comparable to Switzerland and Japan.",
      "It said the move was unlikely to significantly affect migration levels but it would bring in more visa-fee revenue for the Home Office because people on temporary visas pay ongoing fees.",

      "Enny Choudhury, co-legal director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants charity, said the move was \"a cruel betrayal\".",

      "BBC News sent more than 5,000 GPs a questionnaire asking whether they agreed with changing the law to allow assisted dying for certain terminally ill people in England and Wales.",
      "More than 1,000 GPs replied, with about 500 telling us they were against an assisted dying law and about 400 saying they were in favour.",
      "Some of the 500 GPs who told us they were against the law change called the bill \"appalling\", \"highly dangerous\", and \"cruel\". \"We are doctors, not murderers,\" one said.",
      "Of the 400 who said they supported assisted dying, some described the bill as \"long overdue\" and \"a basic human right\".",
      "\"We are keeping human bodies alive in the most inhumane manner,\" one said. They asked: \"How do we ethically justify forcing these bodies to continue to exist in decrepitude?\"",

      "Nine out of 10 GPs who said they were against legalising assisted dying worried terminally ill patients would consider it because they felt guilty about being a burden on their loved ones or the health service.",
      "\"The right to die becomes a duty to die for those who feel a burden on family,\" said one GP.",
      "Another common concern was patients might be coerced. Some told us they had treated elderly people with family members they suspected of being more focussed on their inheritance than their relatives.",
      "More than half of the group who opposed a law change said it would be against their religious beliefs.",
      "They spoke about life being \"sacred\" and called assisted dying \"sinful\". Some referred to the commandment \"thou shalt not kill\".",
      "Another argument from those who said they were against assisted dying was the health system should instead focus on improving end-of-life care.",
      "One GP said creating an assisted dying law was \"scandalous\" when hospices were largely funded by charities rather than by the state.",
      "Separately, on Tuesday the Royal College of Psychiatrists said that while the group \"remains neutral\" on the principle of assisted dying, it \"just cannot support this bill\".",
      "In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, the college's president Dr Lade Smith cited a lack of requirements concerning the \"unmet needs\" of patients, and a shortage of psychiatrists to process requests.",
      "\"We're concerned that there isn't a requirement to think about any unmet needs a person might have. A person with a terminal illness... they may be in pain, they have difficulty with their housing, their finances because they haven't been able to work, they might feel lonely, isolated,\" Dr Smith said.",
      "Dr Gordon Macdonald, CEO of Care Not Killing said there was a \"black hole\" in the hospice budget and \"we need better care not killing\".",
      "Dying with dignity",
      "More than 400 GPs told us they supported a law change, with some describing feeling \"traumatised\" and \"haunted\" by watching people die in \"severe pain or distress\".",
      "Of those who said they were in favour, more than nine in 10 respondents believed it could allow patients to have a dignified death.",
      "Some shared personal experiences: telling us about watching their parents losing dignity or begging to die. One said their sick wife prayed every evening to not wake up in the morning.",
      "Those who backed assisted dying often spoke about patient choice, arguing it was patronising not to let people decide how they wanted to die.",
      "Wanting the option of an assisted death for themselves or their loved ones was another common reason for supporting the law.",
      "\"Personally, I would find this a comfort and I resent those who take this choice away from me,\" one told us.",

      "If assisted dying does become law in England and Wales, it would apply to certain terminally ill patients who were reasonably expected to die within six months.",
      "But more than a quarter of all the GPs who responded told us they would rarely, or never be confident assessing if a patient was expected to die in that time frame.",
      "\"It's unpredictable even in the severely frail,\" one said.",
      "No doctor would be obliged to work in assisted dying. Of the 1,000 GP respondents, more than 500 told us they would be willing to discuss assisted dying with a patient.",
      "Nearly 300 would assess if a patient was eligible and 161 said they would prepare a substance for a patient to take to end their own life.",

    "story": [
      "Two companies that receive taxpayers' money to house asylum seekers in hotels have said they will hand back some of their profits to the Home Office.",
      "Under contracts signed by the previous Conservative government, Clearsprings, Mears and Serco must pay back any profits of more than 5%.",
      "A report released last week said the three companies had made combined profits of \u00a3383m since 2019, after the expected costs of housing asylum seekers tripled.",
      "Appearing before a parliamentary committee, Clearsprings and Mears said they would be paying money back. Serco said they had not made enough profit to do so.",
      "The cost of asylum accommodation has concerned ministers for a number of years and was an issue raised repeatedly by Reform UK during the recent local elections in England.",
      "A Home Office spokesperson said: \"We inherited a broken asylum system, with tens of thousands stuck in a backlog and claims not being processed \u2013 wasting millions in taxpayer money.",
      "\"We've taken immediate action to fix it \u2013 increasing asylum decision making by 52% and removing 24,000 people with no right to be here, meaning there are now fewer asylum hotels open than since the election.",
      "\"By restoring grip on the system and speeding up decision making we will end the use of hotels and are forecast to save the taxpayer \u00a34bn by the end of 2026.\"",
      "Representatives of the three companies responsible for finding asylum accommodation made a rare appearance at the Home Affairs Select Committee.",
      "The director of health and safety compliance at Mears, Jason Burt, told MPs on the committee that the company expected to pay back \u00a313.8m, \"subject to Home Office audit\".",
      "Clearsprings' managing director, Steve Lakey, said his firm had \u00a332m \"ready to go\" but that they were \"waiting for the Home Office\" before it could be transferred.",
      "The Home Office auditing processing is understood to still be ongoing, with no indication of when it will be completed.",
      "Overall profits at the three companies involved are still expected to rise, due to an increase in the amount of hotels being used to house asylum seekers.",
      "When the taxpayer-funded contracts were signed in 2019, the vast majority of people were housed in accommodation within communities.",
      "Around a third are now housed in hotels, which come at a far greater expense to the public finances.",
      "The National Audit Office (NAO) said last week that three quarters of all the money spent on asylum accommodation currently goes on hotels.",
      "Labour and Conservative governments have both pledged to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers.",
      "Serco, Mears and Clearsprings all said they supported a move away from hotel use, despite the positive impact it has had on their bottom lines.",
      "'Disastrous contracts'",
      "Decisions taken by Boris Johnson's government to stop processing many asylum claims are seen as a major driving force behind the initial increase in the use of hotels.",
      "Clearsprings' founder and director, Graham King, has previously donated to the Conservative Party, through other companies he has owned.",
      "The Sunday Times reported last weekend that King had recently become a billionaire thanks to soaring profits at the company.",
      "A senior Home Office source said the Labour government \"inherited chaos right across the system\".",
      "They said the Conservatives signed \"disastrous contracts that were not properly scrutinised \u2013 wasting millions in taxpayer money\".",
      "The source pointed to a recent government decision to block Clearsprings from using one provider, as evidence that ministers are willing \"to take whatever action necessary to guarantee value for money for the taxpayer\".",
      "When quizzed by MPs about the government's criticism of the contracts, the three companies defended the services they were providing.",
      "Mr Burt said he believed Mears was providing a \"reasonable\" service to the Home Office.",
      "He also told MPs that companies do not take into account the potential impact on local areas when suggesting asylum hotel locations to the Home Office.",
      "Burt said the government had an opportunity to raise any concerns, but that it was not the job of companies such as Mears to carry out those assessments.",

      "It has now emerged that a police misconduct hearing in January 2024 found he had called in sick, to travel to Spain, when he should have been working as a PC.",
      "The misconduct hearing found that was one of two occasions when he reported sick to pursue his outside business interests.",
      "Posting on social media after his election on 1 May, Hamilton-Gray said he had spent most of his life \"serving the Crown\".",
      "He pledged to serve Loughborough North West \"with honour, integrity and transparency\".",
      "Now it has emerged that he was a former police officer, and had been dismissed from Leicestershire Police in January 2024.",

      "Leicestershire Police Federation, which represented the former officer, has confirmed that his misconduct hearing related to selling luxury cars.",
      "The panel heard that the force had given him permission to run a car sales business in his own time.",
      "The misconduct panel heard that PC Gray, as he was then known, applied for leave to deliver a car to Barcelona in April 2023.",
      "Part of his leave request was rejected. But a week later, he booked a return ferry ticket from Portsmouth, returning over two days when he was scheduled to work.",
      "He reported in sick only hours before the outward sailing, the panel heard.",

      "The phrase has led some Labour MPs to accuse him of divisive language - a claim rejected by Cooper.",
      "She added the PM had been seeking to highlight the impact of rising migration in recent years and \"support for integration,\" including English language tests.",
      "She rejected a comparison made by a small number of Labour MPs, notably former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, to the language of Enoch Powell.",
      "Downing Street also rejected the comparison and said the PM stands by his words and \"the argument he was making that migrants make a massive contribution to our country, but migration needs to be controlled\".",
      "Labour's immigration plans at a glance",
      "Starmer's robust language nods to immigration failures",
      "Cooper said she didn't know whether the PM or his speech writers were aware of any similarity to a line in Enoch Powell's notorious Rivers of Blood speech in 1968, in which the Conservative MP described a future in which Britons \"found themselves made strangers in their own country\" due to immigration.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she added that Starmer's speech was \"completely different\", adding: \"I don't think it's right to make those comparisons\".",
      "\"The prime minster said yesterday, I think almost in the same breath, talked about the diverse country that we are and that being part of our strength...",
      "\"I know that everybody always gets caught up in focusing on different phrases and so on, but we do have to be talking about the policies.\"",
      "Asked on BBC Breakfast whether she thought Starmer's language was toxic, she replied: \"I don't agree, no\", adding the PM was \"right to say we need to change\".",
      "Labour Mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan said he understood the \"context\" in which the government had announced its new migration measures, but he would not have used the phrase \"island of strangers\" himself.",
      "Speaking to LBC, he added: \"The sort of language I use is different to the language used by others. That's not the sort of words I would use\".",
      "Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick echoed the prime minister's comments, adding Sir Keir's warning the UK could become an island of strangers was \"already\" true in parts of the country.",
      "'Shockingly divisive'",
      "The comparison to Powell was made by McDonnell, who lost the Labour whip last year after rebelling on a welfare vote,  when questioning Cooper in the Commons on Monday.",
      "The Hayes and Harlington MP said: \"When legislation of this nature is being introduced that is serious and could be contentious, it's critically important that ministers use careful language.",
      "\"When the prime minister referred to... an island of strangers, reflecting the language of Enoch Powell, does she realise how shockingly divisive that could be?\"",
      "In the same debate, Labour MP Nadia Whittome said immigrants were being \"scapegoated for problems that they didn't cause\" and that \"the rhetoric surrounding this\" risked stirring racial abuse.",
      "The Nottingham East MP asked: \"Why are we trying to ape Reform [UK], when that will do nothing to improve our constituents' lives and just stoke more division?\"",
      "The launch of the government's immigration measures on Monday follows local elections in England earlier this month that saw Labour lose the Runcorn and Helsby seat to Nigel Farage's Reform UK in an historically close by-election.",
      "Reform, which has campaigned heavily on the issue of immigration in recent years, also picked up its first two metro mayors and now controls 10 county councils, challenging the dominance of both Labour and the Conservatives.",
      "Also speaking on the Today programme, Jenrick, who was immigration minister from 2022-2023, said the public was \"sick of rhetoric, they want action\".",
      "Jenrick claimed the Conservatives' failure to reduce net migration over 14 years in power was because of \"catastrophic mistakes\" and claimed Labour's plans were a \"con by Keir Starmer to trick the British public into believing that he's going to take action\".",
      "He added Sir Keir's words \"repudiated everything\" he had previously stood for, claiming the prime minister had stood for the Labour leadership in 2020 on a policy of \"supporting mass migration\".",

    "story": [
      "It is perhaps little wonder immigration is as politically charged an issue as it is, when you consider two things.",
      "Firstly, as I wrote here, the numbers point to it being the stand-out UK social and demographic change of the 21st century.",
      "And secondly, it is also one of the biggest and most transparent political failings, when you compare rhetoric to reality.",
      "There were the projections made by Sir Tony Blair's government two decades ago that allowing unlimited migration from central and eastern Europe would tempt modest numbers of people to move here \u2013 and huge numbers turned up.",
      "In the 2010s, the Conservatives repeatedly promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands a year, and repeatedly failed.",
      "The numbers then rocketed after Brexit, the very act that meant UK governments were entirely responsible for immigration policy for the first time in a generation.",
      "Most people miss most political debates most of the time, but some are sufficiently totemic they are not just noticed but make the political weather.",
      "The arguments over immigration are one of them \u2013 and what I have just set out tells you why.",
      "This is the generational context within which this prime minister's promises perch.",
      "It is a longevity of failure that senior politicians of various political persuasions privately accept \u2013 perhaps more so than any other single issue \u2013 has seeded a cynicism and a disillusion with how we are governed.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer's language felt like an acknowledgement of that central point: here was a Labour prime minister, a former human rights lawyer, claiming \"we risk becoming an island of strangers.\"",

      "In practical terms, staffing care homes, building new houses \u2013 can these things be done without an influx of folk from abroad?",
      "Interestingly, Sir Keir took issue with the long-standing view of many that immigration helps drive or at least prop up economic growth.",
      "The other context here is the insurgency of Reform UK.",
      "Nigel Farage argues, as he has for years and years, that politicians have been far too slow to get how much immigration matters to so many people.",
      "Labour are acutely aware of Farage's capacity to communicate in a way that resonates with those who feel successive governments have not just ignored them on this issue, but belittled and demeaned their views too.",
      "That is why the prime minister is using the language he is now.",
      "And there is another thing going on here too.",
      "This is a week of muscular language and intent, firstly primarily on legal migration now, and in a few days on illegal migration too.",
      "By next week the focus will switch to an anticipated new deal between the UK and the European Union, and within it, the likelihood of a youth mobility plan \u2013 meaning young people from the UK can travel more freely around Europe, and those from the EU can come here.",
      "Ministers will insist this doesn't amount to freedom of movement, nor immigration \u2013 because visits in both directions will be strictly age and time limited.",
      "But you can be certain there will be a row about it.",
      "These then are the short, medium and long-term reasons why the prime minister and his team know that their plan for delivering a sustained downward trend to the net migration numbers is absolutely crucial to their credibility.",

      "Here is a summary of the key measures.",
      "Work visas tightened - for some",
      "Overseas workers will now generally need a degree-level qualification to apply for the main skilled worker visa, instead of the equivalent of A-level, reversing a change made under Boris Johnson's government.",
      "This higher threshold will not apply to those already in the UK renewing their visa - but ministers say it will prevent new visa applications for around 180 jobs, reducing immigration by around 39,000 a year by 2029.",
      "Lower qualification requirements will remain on a \"time limited basis\" for sectors deemed to be facing long-term recruitment issues.",
      "What this means in practice is not yet clear, with the government's migration advisory body tasked with recommending roles for inclusion.",
      "Lower-qualification visas will be capped and restricted to employers with a workforce training plan in place, whilst those applying will also face extra restrictions on bringing their dependants to the UK.",
      "But loosened for others",
      "At the same time, the government wants to expand eligibility for its dedicated work visa for graduates of elite universities outside the UK.",
      "It says a \"targeted and capped\" expansion of the scheme could see the number of qualifying institutions double, from around 40 currently.",
      "The visa for international students who plan to set up a business in the UK will also be reviewed, and ministers say they want to make it easier for \"top scientific and design talent\" to apply for the global talent visa.",
      "Longer residency waits",
      "Immigrants will typically have to live in the UK for 10 years before applying for the right to stay indefinitely \u2013 double the current five-year period.",
      "Under the plans, this period could be reduced through a new \"earned settlement\" system, under which people would be awarded points to reflect their contribution to the UK \"economy and society\".",
      "It is not yet clear when this longer qualifying period will kick in - details of the new system, along with a similar scheme that will apply to applications for citizenship, will be consulted on later this year.",
      "Home Office urged to record migrant exits from UK",
      "How many people come to work and study in the UK?",
      "Care visa scrapped",
      "A dedicated visa for social care workers introduced during the Covid pandemic will close to new applicants next month.",
      "Ministers say the visa, which was tightened last year, was a key driver of increased immigration in the years after Brexit, and better pay in the sector can solve longstanding recruitment problems.",
      "Visa extensions will be permitted until 2028, and those who already have working rights will be able to switch sponsor during the term of their visa.",
      "Stricter student rules",
      "Overseas graduates will only be able to stay in the UK for 18 months after their studies, instead of two years currently.",
      "Ministers are also thinking of charging English universities a new 6% tax on tuition fee income from international students, which they are promising to reinvest into the higher education and skills system.",
      "The government says it expects this to be passed on to international students in the form of higher fees, reducing applications by 7,000 per year.",
      "Refugee pilot extended",
      "A \"limited pool\" of people who lack refugee status in the UK but have been recognised as refugees by the United Nations will be allowed to use existing sponsored worker routes to come to the UK to work.",
      "Ministers say this will build on a three-year EU-sponsored pilot project that saw around 100 skilled refugees and their families allowed to work in specified sectors such as IT, construction and engineering.",
      "Tougher English tests",
      "Language requirements for all work visas will increase, whilst adult dependents of visa-holders will be required to demonstrate a basic understanding of English to come on a spousal and partner route.",
      "The government says those extending visas will be required to demonstrate a higher level of English when applying to settle in the UK.",
      "Skills and training",
      "The government says firms in sectors deemed to rely too much on overseas workers will be \"expected to comply\" with strategies to boost workplace skills.",
      "These will also be determined by official migration advisers, but government sources say IT, construction and healthcare are likely to feature.",
      "Labour has previously indicated it wants to link skills training to the visa system - but details of what this means in practice have not yet been set out.",
      "Family rights reviewed",
      "The government says it will table legislation to \"clarify\" how the right to a family life in European human rights law should apply to immigration cases.",
      "It also says Parliament will be able to adopt a \"framework\" aiming to limit the extent to which family rights can be used to delay the removal of people without the right to stay in the UK.",
      "No overall cap",
      "The prime minister said the government wants to \"significantly\" reduce net migration - the number of people coming to the UK minus those leaving - from the record levels it has reached in recent years.",
      "But the prime minister is not putting a number on the overall level of net migration he wants to see \u2013 saying this approach has consistently failed in the past.",

      "BBC Verify examines the measures set out by the government and the challenges ahead.",
      "What's happened to the numbers?",
      "Migration levels have hit \"unprecedented levels\" in recent years, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - reached a record 906,000 in the year ending in June 2023 and then fell to 728,000 in the year ending in June 2024.",
      "The continued high levels persist, despite previous government efforts to bring the numbers down. For example, in 2010 the Conservatives pledged to reduce net migration to the \"tens of thousands\".",
      "Annual net migration is expected to come down to about 315,000 by the end of the Parliament.",
      "That's according to the central forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent body that scrutinises the public finances.",
      "That estimate, however, would still be higher than most years in the past decade.",
      "What's been driving immigration?",
      "The vast majority of migrants come to the UK for study or work.",
      "And many of the work visas have been for people coming to do jobs in health and social care.",
      "However, applications for health and social care visas have come down sharply in the past two years after the rules were tightened by the last Conservative government and this decline will ultimately feed into the official net migration statistics in the coming years.",
      "Does immigration help economic growth?",
      "There's been much discussion about the link between immigration and economic growth.",
      "The White Paper - which sets out the government's plan - says the UK economy needs to wean itself off a reliance on cheap overseas labour.",
      "While taking questions from journalists, the prime minister claimed the idea immigration leads to higher economic growth \"doesn't hold\".",
      "Economists do not agree about the exact impact that simply adding more people to an economy has on growth and prosperity.",
      "New arrivals might increase the country's overall level of economic activity - measured by GDP. But on a per-person basis, GDP could be stagnant or falling. Also a larger population puts more pressure on demand for public services and housing.",
      "However, if immigrants are filling important gaps in the labour market which would otherwise not be filled - especially jobs that require specific skills - then economists generally think that immigrants can boost GDP per head and general prosperity.",
      "The OBR says that increased migration generally increases economic growth but \"the size of this impact and the effect on per person living standards is highly uncertain\".",
      "The OBR's point about growth per person is important because the government has made growth of this measure a key priority.",
      "Growth per person fell in 2023 and was flat in 2024.",
      "What about social care?",
      "There are gaps in our labour market which have been substantially filled by migrants in recent years, most notably social care.",
      "And there were still estimated to be 131,000 vacant posts in adult social care in England in 2023.",
      "Care providers argue stopping them recruiting from overseas will likely make that gap bigger.",
      "Non-immigrants could theoretically fill many of these posts and working-age people who are economically inactive could potentially be deployed in this sector if they could be encouraged and helped into work.",
      "Yet the main barrier to recruitment in social care has been the level of pay, which is currently too low to attract sufficient numbers of British workers.",
      "Labour's immigration plans at a glance",
      "Starmer promises to cut migration as Farage and Badenoch criticise PM's plan",
      "Proposals will lead to significant immigration cut, vows PM",
      "Amy Clark, commercial director of a Cornwall care home chain, told the BBC that the measures could cause challenges because \"recruiting locally is very, very difficult\".",
      "The government could increase the levels of pay in social care, but that would leave them under pressure to increase grants to local authorities and potentially raise taxes to fund it.",
      "Problems with social care recruitment were also highlighted by Madeleine Sumption, deputy chair of the Migration Advisory Committee.",
      "\"We've seen widespread reports of exploitation, people coming in who are quite vulnerable earning very low wages.",
      "\"So I am not surprised the government has chosen to close overseas recruitment because it's caused them so much difficulty,\" she said.",
      "What about universities?",
      "Overseas students have been a major contributor to levels of net migration in recent years.",
      "But they are also a significant source of funding for UK universities.",
      "A large reduction in overseas students numbers would undermine the finances of many universities and a number are already in severe financial difficulties.",
      "The government wants to monitor more closely how universities recruit international students.",
      "It is also proposing a limit on the time international students can remain in the UK after graduating. Foreign students would only have 18 months to look for a job, down from 2-3 years previously.",
      "Universities UK - which represents 141 universities - has urged the government \"to think carefully\" about the impact of its measures.",
      "If overseas student numbers did fall, the government could make up the shortfall in universities' revenue by increasing central government grants but, again, that could require an increase in taxes.",
      "Alternatively, it could further increase domestic students' tuition fees, although that would also be contentious.",
      "What about skilled migrants?",
      "The government says it still wants to attract high-skilled individuals \"who play by the rules and contribute to the economy\".",
      "However, the PM also stressed that some parts of the economy are \"addicted\" to importing cheap labour, rather than investing in training UK workers.",
      "As an example, Sir Keir said the number of engineering apprenticeships had fallen in recent years, while visas for overseas workers in this area had gone up.",
      "Figures in the government's new immigration plan show that the number of UK work visas issued for engineering professionals rose from 3,427 in 2021 to 5,495 in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, the number of new apprenticeships in engineering in England fell from 26,970 in 2021-22 to 18,520 in 2024-25.",
      "But if the government wants many more home-trained engineers that will likely come with a cost in terms of a higher training budget.",
      "While that investment could come partly from firms, it could also mean more public spending and possibly tax rises.",
      "According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, total public spending on adult education and skills has fallen by 24% in real terms since 2010.",
      "Reacting to the government's proposals, Make UK - which represents manufacturers - said firms are being forced to recruit overseas staff because domestic skills training is \"fundamentally flawed\".",

      "President Donald Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world still applies to most UK goods entering the US.",
      "But the deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel and aluminium.",

      "This has been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, which matches the number of cars the UK exported last year.",

      "It is currently unclear how much of these products the UK will be able to export to the US under this quota system without paying more.",

      "The dry and sunny weather this year has led to a larger area of the UK burned by wildfires this year compared to in any other entire year.",
      "The last drought was in June-August 2022, which was the joint hottest summer (with 2018) and fifth driest since the 1890s.",

      "There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week.",
      "Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions.",

      "Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas.",
      "If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes.",

      "Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought.",
      "Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed.",
      "And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms.",
      "Mr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than \u00a31m.",
      "It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions.",
      "But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult.",

      "Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.",
      "She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.",
      "\"It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside \u2013 to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.\"",
      "Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.",
      "\"The lower part is where you put your solid waste,\" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. \"And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.\"",
      "Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.",
      "\"There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.\"",
      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",
      "The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.",
      "\"It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,\" she tells us, \"But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.\"",
      "Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" Rosemary says, \"If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.\"",

      "I grew up in Nepal's capital watching the Himalayas. Ever since I left, I've missed sweeping, panoramic views of some of the highest mountain peaks on Earth.",
      "Each time I visit Kathmandu, I hope to catch a glimpse of the dramatic mountain range. But these days, there's usually no luck.",
      "The main culprit is severe air pollution that hangs as haze above the region.",
      "And it's happening even during the spring and autumn months, which once offered clear skies.",
      "Just last April, the international flight I was in had to circle in the sky nearly 20 times before landing in Kathmandu, because of the hazy weather impacting visibility at the airport.",
      "The hotel I checked in at was at a reasonable height from which mountains are visible on a clear day \u2013 but there was no such day during my two-week stay.",
      "Even from the major vantage point of Nagarkot, just outside Kathmandu, all that could be seen was haze, as if the mountains did not exist.",
      "\"I no longer brand the place for views of 'sunrise, sunset and Himalayas' as I did in the past,\" said Yogendra Shakya, who has been operating a hotel at Nagarkot since 1996.",
      "\"Since you can't have those things mostly now because of the haze, I have rebranded it with history and culture as there are those tourism products as well here.\"",
      "During an earlier trip a year ago, I was hopeful I would be able to see the mighty Himalayan peaks on a trek in the mesmerising Annapurna region \u2013 but had hardly any luck there either.",
      "Scientists say hazy conditions in the region are becoming increasingly intense and lasting longer, reducing visibility significantly.",
      "Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change.",
      "June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low.",
      "Traditionally, March to May and October to November were the best times for business because that was when skies remained clear and visibility was best.",
      "But with rising temperatures and a lack of rain, and worsening air pollution, the spring months are now seeing thick haze with low visibility. Those conditions are beginning as early as December.",
      "'No sighting means no business'",
      "Lucky Chhetri, a pioneering female trekking guide in Nepal, said hazy conditions had led to a 40% decrease in business.",
      "\"In one case last year, we had to compensate a group of trekkers as our guides could not show them the Himalayas due to the hazy conditions,\" she added",
      "An Australian tourist who has visited Nepal more than a dozen times since 1986 described not seeing the mountains as a \"major let-down\".",
      "\"It wasn't like this 10 years ago but now the haze seems to have taken over and it is extraordinarily disappointing for visitors like me,\" said John Carrol.",
      "Krishna Acharya, the provincial chair of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal in the western Gandaki province, says the trekking industry is in deep trouble.",
      "\"Our member trekking operators are getting depressed because no sighting of the Himalayas means no business. Many of them are even considering changing professions,\" he told the BBC.",
      "On the Indian side, near the central Himalayas, hoteliers and tour operators say haze is now denser and returns quicker than before.",
      "\"We have long dry spells and then a heavy downpour, unlike in the past. So with infrequent rain the haze persists for much longer,\" said Malika Virdi, who heads a community-run tourism business in the state of Uttarakhand.",
      "However, Ms Virdi says tourists are persistent - with many who didn't catch the mountain range returning to try their luck again.",
      "The western Himalayas in Pakistan have been relatively less affected by the haze because the mountains are relatively far from cities.",
      "But locals say that even the ranges that were once easily visible from places like Peshawar and Gilgit are often no longer seen.",
      "\"The sheet of haze remains hanging for a longer period and we don't see the mountains that we could in the past,\" said Asif Shuja, the former head of Pakistan's environmental protection agency.",
      "Hazes and dust storms increasing",
      "South Asian cities regularly top lists of places with highest levels of air pollution in the world.",
      "Public health across the region has been badly impacted by the toxic air, which frequently causes travel disruption and school closures.",
      "Vehicular and industrial emissions, dust from infrastructure construction and dry gravel roads as well as the open burning of waste are major sources of air pollution year-round.",
      "This is compounded by soot from massive forest fires - which are increasing due to a longer dry season - and the burning of crop residues after the harvest by farmers in northern India, Pakistan and Nepal.",
      "Weather conditions keeping warmer air above cooler air trap these pollutants and limit vertical air movement - preventing pollution from dispersing.",
      "\"Hazes and dust storms are increasing in South Asia, and this trend is projected to continue due to climate change and other factors,\" Dr Someshwor Das from the South Asia Meteorological Association told the BBC.",
      "In 2024, the number of hazy days recorded at the airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in western Nepal, was 168 - up from 23 in 2020 and 84 in 2021, according to Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology.",
      "Experts believe the Himalayas are probably the worst affected mountain range in the world given their location in a populous and polluted region.",
      "This could mean the scintillating view of the Himalayas could now largely be limited to photographs, paintings and postcards.",

    "story": [
      "Rosemary Coogan is surrounded by a team of people pushing, pulling, squishing and squeezing her into a spacesuit.",
      "It takes about 45 minutes to get all her gear on before a helmet is carefully lowered over her head.",
      "The British astronaut is about to undergo her toughest challenge yet \u2013 assessing whether she is ready for a spacewalk. The test will take place in one of the largest pools in the world: Nasa's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.",
      "The pool \u2013 which is 12m deep (40ft) \u2013 contains a life-sized replica of the International Space Station (ISS), and a \"spacewalk\" here is as close as it gets to mimicking weightlessness on Earth.",
      "\"It's a big day,\" Rosemary says before the dive, which is going to last more than six hours. \"It's very physically intense \u2013 and it's very psychologically intense.\"",
      "But Rosemary doesn't seem too fazed. She smiles and waves as the platform she's standing on is slowly lowered into the water.",
      "Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach.",
      "\"At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,\" Rosemary says. \"You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories.\"",
      "So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people.",
      "ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015.",
      "Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.",
      "She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.",
      "\"It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside \u2013 to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.\"",
      "Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.",
      "\"The lower part is where you put your solid waste,\" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. \"And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.\"",
      "Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.",
      "\"There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.\"",
      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",
      "The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.",
      "\"It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,\" she tells us, \"But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.\"",
      "Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" Rosemary says, \"If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.\"",

      "An artificial intelligence (AI) tool has been used to sort through comments  about botox and lip fillers, that were submitted as part of a public consultation, in what officials said was the first use of this kind in the UK.",
      "Officials set the tool to work sifting responses to a Scottish government consultation on regulating non-surgical cosmetic procedures.",
      "They found it came up with \"nearly identical\" results, when compared to humans set the same task.",
      "It is hoped the tool, dubbed \"Consult\", will spare civil servants from similar time-consuming tasks in future, and save taxpayers an estimated \u00a320m.",
      "Consult is one of a planned set of government AI-powered tools that have collectively been dubbed \"Humphrey\" after the wily senior civil servant, Sir Humphrey Appleby, from the classic 1980s sitcom Yes, Minister. The series often took aim at excessive bureaucracy in government.",
      "In this trial the AI tool examined 2,000 submissions. But public consultations, which gather the views of UK citizens on issues under consideration by ministers, can generate tens of thousands of responses.",
      "It was able to identify themes amongst the responses, and counted and catalogued answers accordingly - with human experts checking its work at both stages.",
      "Consult's findings were then examined to see how they compared to a team of human experts working in parallel.",
      "Technology secretary Peter Kyle said the initial success of the trial meant that Consult would be used across government \"very soon\".",

      "One is that they sometimes invent information - a failing known as \"hallucinating\".",
      "Because the AI was only being asked to carry out a relatively limited task, officials said hallucination would not be a major problem.",
      "Such AI tools, built using what are known as \"large language models\" have also displayed bias, as they adsorb the prejudices inherent in the human-generated data on which they are trained.",
      "But experts who worked with Consult had found it reduced bias overall,  the government said, by removing opportunities for individual human analysts to \"project their own preconceived ideas\".",
      "Consult has also been tested to check it can handle language containing spelling mistakes and other errors.",

      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",

      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",

      "A few seconds earlier, Ukrainian artillery strikes Russian positions, places where we'd seen Russian soldiers moving about as they try to advance towards a key road going into Pokrovsk.",
      "At least one Russian soldier is injured, possibly dead after the strike.",
      "It's chilling to watch the live footage. It drives home the bloody consequences of the war that Russia started, in which hundreds of thousands have so far been killed, a \"never-ending bloodbath\" as US President Donald Trump calls it.",
      "We are in a rural house converted into a command centre for the 155th mechanised brigade of the Ukrainian army. It's a few miles from front-line artillery positions.",
      "The scale of the devastation that we see on the screens, homes and buildings completely flattened, is far greater than what we saw six months ago.",
      "It is evidence of the fierce battle that has been fought over the past several months to defend Pokrovsk, a crucial transport hub in the Donetsk region.",
      "This week, there's cautious optimism, even among sceptical soldiers who have witnessed hopes of a ceasefire being dashed over and over again, as diplomatic efforts from the US, Europe, Turkey and others have pushed Russia and Ukraine to direct talks for the first time in three years.",
      "\"I think something should happen since Russia was the first one to push for these talks. I mean since 2022, they have refused to go into any contact,\" says an officer who wants to be referred to with his call sign \"Kozak\".",
      "\"I want to believe this would be the beginning of the end of the war.",
      "\"But now I see, we have been successful in destroying their rear positions and their supply lines. Russia does not have the same strength and power it had at the beginning. So I think that something will happen.\"",
      "Yurii, 37, used to work in a technology company before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \"They (Russia and Ukraine) have to start talking. Us soldiers, we wish this war would end. But it's important to remember that we cannot stop it because we did not start it,\" he says.",
      "He looks up at the screen and spots Russian soldiers moving again. He and his colleagues calculate the co-ordinates of their positions and pass them on to their artillery unit.",
      "We drive from the command centre to the artillery position, on mud tracks running through a wide expanse of open fields. Clumps of mud fly in the air, our car slips and slides, as we move as fast as possible. The speed is a mitigation against strikes from drones, which have sharply increased fatalities for both Russia and Ukraine since they were deployed in large numbers in 2023.",
      "And war technology keeps evolving. Now there's a new threat \u2013 drones equipped with a real fibre optic cable which unrolls as they fly. \"We cannot detect them or neutralise them, so there are probably a lot more drones in the area right now than we know,\" says Yurii.",
      "As we drive into the artillery position hidden under trees and bushes, soldiers are already loading the gun. It's a French made self-propelled artillery gun called the \"Caesar\". Scores have been deployed in Ukraine since the start of the war, and France has been trying to ramp up production.",
      "\"I'm very impressed by its accuracy, and we can use a large range of ammunition. The most important thing is that bringing it into combat is very fast. It is much more effective than the old Soviet equipment I've used,\" says Kozak.",
      "Ukrainian soldiers fire four rounds, each one emitting a deafening sound. From around us, we also hear the sound of incoming shells. The battle rages on.",
      "\"As you can hear, there is a wave of assaults from the enemy and we need a lot of ammunition to suppress that. We hope our international partners can give us as much ammunition as possible, because if we have to start choosing priority and non-priority targets then the enemy will be successful,\" says Kozak.",
      "We ask the soldiers how they feel about suggestions that Ukraine will have to make concessions, that it might have to give up land to secure peace.",
      "\"It's painful to hear that. Even I want to go home to my family. My daughter is eight and I miss her so much. But we need to be strong. I don't believe that if we give up some territory, they will stop. In a couple of years, they will return and start over,\" says Yurii.",
      "\"A person who has not come here, who hasn't felt the consequences of Russian aggression, those armchair commentators say you can give up land and everything will be over. They will never understand how many brothers and friends we have lost. We shouldn't give up a single metre of our land,\" says Kozak.",
      "The cost Ukraine has paid to defend its land is visible everywhere, most acutely in the photos of smiling, young soldiers posted by the side of highways, on memorial walls in central city squares, and on rows and rows of freshly dug graves in the country.",
      "Yana Stepanenko lovingly buys her son's favourite treats - a cup of steaming hot chocolate and a chocolate roll.",
      "Then she drives out to a cemetery in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, and places them neatly by 22-year-old Vladislav's grave. She and her daughter, 13-year-old Nicole, wipe the grave with wet tissues. Before long, they break down inconsolably into each other's arms.",
      "Vladislav was a drone operator with the Ukrainian military. He was killed in combat in a Russian strike on 21 February this year.",
      "For Yana, news of direct talks resuming bring no hope.",
      "\"It seems to me that this war is eternal. Of course, I hope they will find a solution. Because people are dying here and there (in Russia). But Putin is greedy. His hunger for our land is insatiable,\" says Yana.",
      "Parts of the Zaporizhzhia region are currently occupied by Russia, the front line less than 40 miles from the city. But Russia has on more than one occasion demanded control of the full regions of Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, Donetsk and Kherson as part of any peace deal.",
      "\"No way. I want to live in Ukraine, not Russia. We have seen what they do under occupation, what they did in places like Bucha \u2013 their cruelty and torture,\" says Yana. \"Can you imagine, they've not even spared this graveyard,\" she adds, pointing to a big crater nearby where a bomb exploded some months ago.",
      "Tears rolling down her eyes, she adds: \"I hope my child did not die for nothing. That there will still be a victory and all of Ukraine will become free.\"",

    "summary": "Investigators say 80mph winds \"violently\" knocked over the vessel, causing it to flood within seconds.",
    "story": [
      "The owner and crew of a luxury superyacht that sank off the coast of Sicily, killing tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and six others, were unaware wind speeds of over 73mph could tip it over, according to an interim report.",
      "Modelling commissioned after the disaster indicates gusts of that speed hitting the side of the Bayesian, when it had its sails down and centreboard up, would \"likely result\" in its capsize.",
      "The UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB), leading the international investigation, said winds of over 80mph \"violently\" hit the vessel, causing it to flood within seconds.",
      "It sank near the town Porticello on 19 August last year during freak weather, with reports of water spouts.",
      "Seven of the 22 people onboard were killed, including Mr Lynch, 59, and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah.",
      "Investigators say the yacht was knocked to a 90-degree angle within 15 seconds at 04:06 am local time, causing people, furniture and loose items to fall across the deck.",
      "\"There was no indication of flooding inside Bayesian until water came in over the starboard rails and, within seconds, entered the internal spaces down the stairwells,\" the report says.",
      "The MAIB's chief inspector of marine accidents Andrew Moll said the situation was \"irrecoverable\" once the yacht tilted beyond 70 degrees.",
      "The yacht had its sails down and centreboard up when it sank.",
      "The MAIB commissioned modelling from the University of Southampton to examine the stability of the yacht in these conditions.",
      "It indicated that - if the wind was blowing directly across the beam, or side, of the boat - wind speeds in excess of 73mph were sufficient to tip the boat over and \"it is possible\" the yacht was similarly vulnerable to lower wind speeds, the MAIB said.",
      "But this information was not included in the onboard stability information book and \"consequently, these vulnerabilities were also unknown to either the owner or the crew of Bayesian\", the report found.",
      "The MAIB is investigating the incident as the Bayesian was registered in the UK. No date has been set for when its final report will be published.",
      "It said its report was based on \"a limited amount of verified evidence\" as a criminal investigation by Italian authorities has restricted access to the wreck.",
      "An operation to raise the 56-metre vessel from the seabed was paused over the weekend after a diver died while working on the wreck. Work was set to resume on Thursday.",
      "The report lays out more detail as to how the sinking unfolded.",
      "Investigators say the yacht sailed to the site where it sank on the previous day, in order to \"shelter\" from forecast thunderstorms. The sails were furled at the time.",
      "Wind speed was \"no more than eight knots (9mph)\" at 03:00 - about an hour before the incident. Some 55 minutes later it had increased to 30 knots (34.5mph), and it had accelerated to 70 knots (80.6mph) by 04:06 when the yacht capsized.",
      "As the storm intensified, several crew members were working in response to the conditions. The deck hand went onto the deck to close the yacht's windows.",
      "Five people were injured \"either by falling or from things falling on them\" and the deck hand was \"thrown into the sea\", the report says.",
      "Two of the yacht's guests used furniture drawers \"as an improvised ladder\" to escape their cabin, it adds.",
      "Dr Simon Boxall, Oceanographer at the University of Southampton, said the Bayesian was in \"the wrong place at the wrong time\".",
      "\"The priorities for the crew would have been to shut the hatches and the doors, which they did,\" he told the BBC.",
      "This means speculation about water flooding in because everything was open is \"obviously not the case\".",
      "\"The next priority\u00a0would have been to start the engines - so they would have some manoeuvrability to position themselves within a storm - and to then lift anchor, which the crew did, but this takes time,\" he added.",
      "\"It's not like a car where you jump in and turn the key. It would take 5 or 10 minutes before you can start the engines with a vessel of this size.\"",
      "Survivors escaped on the Bayesian's life raft and were rescued by a small boat dispatched from another nearby yacht, the report says.",
      "Mike Lynch was a prominent figure in the UK tech industry, where his backing of successful companies led to him being dubbed the British equivalent of Microsoft founder Bill Gates.",
      "But the latter years of his life were consumed by a long-running legal dispute which resulted in him being controversially extradited to the US.",
      "Inquest proceedings in the UK are looking at the deaths of Mr Lynch and his daughter, as well as Morgan Stanley International bank chairman Jonathan Bloomer and his wife, Judy Bloomer, who were all British nationals.",

      "The Israeli government suspended food and medicine deliveries into Gaza in March.",
      "Ministers said the move, which has been condemned by UN, European and Middle Eastern leaders, was intended to put pressure on Hamas to release its remaining hostages. Israel also accused Hamas of stealing aid \u2013 an allegation the group has denied.",
      "The UN has said the blockade has caused severe shortages of food, medicines and fuel, and an assessment on Monday warned that Gaza's population of around 2.1 million people was at \"critical risk\" of famine.",
      "The US confirmed last week that it was preparing a new system for providing aid from a series of hubs inside Gaza, which would be run by private companies and protected by security contractors and Israeli forces.",
      "Images analysed by BBC Verify show that land has already been cleared, with new roads and staging areas constructed at a number of locations in southern and central Gaza in recent weeks.",
      "Israel has not publicly said where the hubs will be, but humanitarian sources - briefed previously by Israeli officials - told BBC Verify that at least four centres will be built in the southern section of Gaza and one further north near the Netzarim Corridor, a strip of land controlled by the military that effectively divides the territory.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation - an organisation set up to support the plan - initially said food, water and hygiene kits would be supplied to 1.2 million people, less than 60% of the population.",
      "On Wednesday it announced it would start operations before the end of May, and appeared to call for Israel to allow aid through normal channels until its distribution centres were fully operational. It also called for aid hubs to be built in northern Gaza, something not envisaged under the original plan and which had led to criticism that people would be forced to move south.",
      "UN agencies have insisted they will not co-operate with the plan - which is in line with one previously approved by Israel's government - saying it contradicted fundamental humanitarian principles.",
      "A spokesperson for the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) accused Israel of seeking to use \"food and fuel as leverage, as part of a military strategy\".",
      "\"All aid would be channelled through a handful of militarised hubs,\" Olga Cherevko told BBC Verify.",
      "\"That kind of arrangement would cut off vast areas of Gaza \u2013 particularly the most vulnerable, who can't move easily, or are otherwise marginalised \u2013 from any help at all.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Bushra Khalidi of Oxfam described the new plan as a \"farce\".",

      "BBC Verify used satellite imagery to identify four potential sites based on the limited available information about their locations.",
      "The sites are similar in size, shape and design to existing open-air distribution sites inside Gaza, such as at Erez, Erez West and Kisufim. The largest site we've looked at is bigger - more comparable to the area inside Gaza at Kerem Shalom crossing.",
      "Our analysis of the imagery shows significant development at one of the sites in south-west Gaza, close to the ruins of a village that is now an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) base.",
      "Satellite photos since early April show the construction of a road there and a large staging area, surrounded by berms - large defensive barriers made of piled sand or earth - about 650m (2,130ft) from the border with Egypt.",
      "A high-resolution image captured on 8 May shows bulldozers and excavators working on a section of land spanning about 20 acres (8 hectares). IDF armoured vehicles are at a fortified building nearby.",
      "A photo taken on site, geolocated by BBC Verify, also shows lighting being installed on the perimeter.",
      "Further imagery from 11 and 12 May shows this, along with three other sites, continuing to expand. One site is about half a kilometre from a collection of eight UN warehouses, and 280m from another large warehouse.",
      "Stu Ray - a senior imagery analyst with McKenzie Intelligence - agreed the sites were likely to be secure distribution centres. He noted that some of the facilities are in \"close proximity to IDF Forward Operating Bases which ties in with the IDF wishing to have some control over the sites\".",
      "Analysts with another intelligence firm, Maiar, said the facilities appeared to be designed with separate entrances for trucks to move in and out, and with other gaps in the berms that would be suitable for pedestrian entrances.",
      "The IDF did not comment on the potential aid centres when approached by BBC Verify, but said that its operations in Gaza were carried out \"in accordance with international law\".  Cogat - the Israeli body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza - did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "What is the Morag Corridor?",
      "This is an Israeli military zone that runs across the Gaza Strip and separates the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah.",
      "Since the IDF established a security zone there in early April, a six-mile (10km) road has been built covering two thirds of the width of Gaza, bordered by defensive berms and dotted with IDF outposts.",
      "This new road leads directly to one of the development sites visible in satellite imagery, and a pre-existing road connects it to two more.",
      "This entire area has been subjected to extensive land clearance by the IDF.

    "story": [
      "A New Zealand parliamentary committee has proposed that three M\u0101ori MPs be suspended from parliament for their protest haka during a sitting last year.",
      "Opposition MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke began the traditional group dance after being asked if her party supported a controversial bill - which has since been voted down - to redefine the country's founding treaty.",
      "The haka could have \"initimidated\" other lawmakers, the committee ruled, recommending that she be suspended for a week and Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori (M\u0101ori Party) co-leaders Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer be banned for 21 days.",
      "The M\u0101ori Party criticised the recommendations as a \"warning shot to all of us to fall in line\".",
      "\"When tangata whenua resist, colonial powers reach for the maximum penalty,\" it said in a statement on Wednesday, using a M\u0101ori phrase that translates to \"people of the land\".",
      "It also said these are among the harshest punishments ever recommended by New Zealand's parliament.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, who is M\u0101ori, said the trio were \"out-of-control MPs who flout the rules and intimidate others with outrageous hakas\".",
      "Their proposed suspensions will be put to a vote on Tuesday.",
      "The Treaty Principles Bill, which sought to redefine New Zealand's founding treaty with M\u0101ori people, was voted down 112 votes to 11 last month - days after a government committee recommended that it should not proceed.",
      "The bill had already been widely expected to fail, with most major political parties committed to voting it down.",
      "Members of the right-wing Act Party, which tabled it, were the only MPs to vote for it at the second reading on 10 April.",
      "Act, a minor party in the ruling centre-right coalition, argued that there is a need to legally define the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi - the 1840 pact between the British Crown and M\u0101ori leaders signed during New Zealand's colonisation - which it said resulted in the country being divided by race.",
      "Critics, however, say the legislation will divide the country and lead to the unravelling of much-needed support for many M\u0101ori.",
      "The proposed legislation sparked widespread outrage across the country and saw more than 40,000 people taking part in a protest outside parliament during its first reading in November last year.",
      "Before that, thousands participated in a nine-day march against the bill- beginning in the far north and ending in Auckland.",

      "The extraordinary encounter, unthinkable just months ago, was short but significant.",
      "\"I think he has got the potential,\" Trump remarked after his meeting in Riyadh, 37 minutes long, with the former Syrian fighter formerly linked to al-Qaeda.",

      "\"Tough guy, very strong past,\" is how Trump later described Sharaa to journalists travelling with his high-powered American delegation on his first official four-day tour.",
      "It was a very Trump gloss about Sharaa's old links to al-Qaeda. His Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), was al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria until he severed ties in 2016. HTS is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US and UK.",
      "Since assuming power in December, Sharaa has been wearing Western business suits and trying to present himself as a president for all Syrians.",

      "She told the BBC's Newshour programme they had been calling for sanctions relief ever since their \"Liberation Day\".",

    "summary": "Experts tell the BBC the air strikes showcase the growth of advanced drone warfare in Africa.",
    "story": [
      "Paramilitary fighters appear to have opened a new phase in Sudan's civil war after being driven from the capital, in a move which some experts have described as a \"shock and awe campaign\".",
      "Just weeks after the army celebrated the recapture of Khartoum, its foe the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launched a series of unprecedented drone strikes on Port Sudan in the east of the country.",
      "The attacks have led to worsening power blackouts, as well as city residents facing water shortages.",
      "\"It's a level of power projection within this region that we haven't seen yet,\" says Alan Boswell, the Horn of Africa expert for the International Crisis Group.",
      "\"I think it raises the stakes quite a bit,\" he added.",
      "The barrage of attacks on the war-time capital and humanitarian hub signals that the RSF is determined and able to carry on the fight despite significant territorial losses.",
      "And it has showcased the growth of advanced drone warfare in Africa.",
      "Drones have played an increasing role in the conflict, which has entered its third year.",
      "The war began as a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF and has drawn in other Sudanese armed groups and foreign backers, plunging the country into what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis.",
      "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) helped the army advance earlier this year. And the RSF escalated its own use of drones as it was pushed out of central Sudan, especially Khartoum, back towards its traditional stronghold in the west of the country.",
      "In recent months the paramilitaries had stepped up drone strikes on critical civilian infrastructure in army-controlled areas. That continued on Wednesday night with attacks on three power stations in the city of Omdurman, which lies across the Nile River from Khartoum. The damage has caused widespread electricity outages in the capital region.",
      "But it was the RSF's sustained strikes on Port Sudan, until now seen as a safe haven home to government officials, diplomats and humanitarian organisations, that underlined a shift in strategy to a greater emphasis on remote warfare, and aimed to demonstrate strength.",
      "\"The RSF is trying to show that they don't need to reach Port Sudan by land in order to be able to have an impact there,\" says Sudanese political analyst Kholood Khair.",
      "The group is trying to achieve a \"narrative shift\" away from \"the triumphant SAF that took over Khartoum,\" she says.",
      "\"It is saying to the Sudanese Armed Forces: 'You can take Khartoum back, but you'll never be able to govern it. You can have Port Sudan, but you won't be able to govern it, because we will cause a security crisis for you so large that it will be ungovernable'... They want to unequivocally show that the war is not over until they say so.\"",
      "The paramilitary group has not directly addressed the Port Sudan drone attacks. Rather, it has repeated its assertion that the SAF is supported by Iran and accused the armed forces of targeting civilian infrastructure and state institutions, calling the military strikes on Khartoum and RSF-held areas in the west and south of the country war crimes.",
      "Both sides stand accused of war crimes which they have denied, but the RSF has been singled out over allegations of mass rape and genocide.",
      "The change in its tactics may have been triggered by battlefield necessity, but is possible because of technological advancement.",
      "The RSF had previously used what are known as suicide or loitering drones, small UAVs with explosive payloads that are designed to crash into targets and can carry out coordinated attacks.",
      "It seems to have deployed this method in Port Sudan, with the commander of the Red Sea Military Zone Mahjoub Bushra describing a swarm of 11 Kamikaze drones in the first strike on a military airbase.",
      "He said the army shot them down, but they turned out to be a tactical distraction to divert attention from a single strategic drone that successfully struck the base.",
      "The make of this drone is not clear. But satellite images reported by Yale researchers and the Reuters news agency have shown advanced UAVs at an airport in South Darfur since the beginning of the year.",
      "The defence intelligence company Janes has determined them to most likely be sophisticated Chinese manufactured CH-95s, capable of long-range strikes.",
      "Jeremy Binnie, an Africa and Middle East analyst at Jane's, told the BBC that photos of what appear to be the remnants of the smaller kamikaze drones suggest they are probably a different version than the RSF had used before, and might be better at penetrating air defences because of their shape.",
      "One regional observer suggested the RSF had been able to breach the SAF's anti-drone technology with signal jammers attached to the drones, but cautioned this was still unproven.",
      "The South Darfur airport in Nyala, the presumptive capital and military base of the Rapid Support Forces, has been repeatedly bombed by the SAF, which destroyed an aircraft there earlier this month.",
      "Some experts see the RSF's bombardment of Port Sudan at least partly as retaliation.",

      "Sudan war: A simple guide to what is happening",
      "The escalating drone warfare has again highlighted the role of foreign actors in Sudan's civil conflict.",
      "\"This is a war of technology,\" says Justin Lynch, managing director at Conflict Insights Group, a data analytics and research organisation.",
      "\"That's why the foreign supporters are so important, because it's not like the RSF is making the weapons themselves. They're being given this stuff.\"",
      "The army has accused the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of supplying the paramilitary fighters with the drones, and cut diplomatic ties with Abu Dhabi because of the attacks.",
      "The UAE has strongly rejected the charges. It has long denied reports from UN experts, US politicians and international organisations that it is providing weaponry to the RSF.",
      "But Mr Lynch says the evidence is overwhelming.",
      "He was the lead author of a US State Department-funded report late last year that concluded with \"near certainty\" the the UAE was facilitating weapons to the RSF by monitoring imagery and flight patterns of airlines previously implicated in violating a UN arms embargo.",
      "He told the BBC it would be surprising if the Emiratis were not helping deliver the drones used in the Port Sudan attacks.",
      "He also determined with similar near-certainty that the Iranians were supplying weapons to the SAF, and he helped authenticate documents provided to the Washington Post that detail the sale of drones and warheads to the army by a Turkish defence firm.",
      "Iran has not responded to the allegations. Turkish officials have denied involvement.",
      "The increasing use of drones by both sides may be redefining the war, but it is the ability of the RSF to strike strategic targets hundreds of kilometres from its positions that has rattled the region.",
      "Over a week of daily attacks on Port Sudan, the paramilitaries hit the country's only working international airport, a power station, several fuel depots, and the air base, apparently trying to disrupt the army's supply lines.",
      "The city is also the main entry port for relief supplies and the UN has warned that this \"major escalation\" could further complicate aid operations in the country and lead to large-scale civilian casualties.",
      "\"This was such a shock and awe campaign that it has not only stunned SAF, I think it's also stunned Egypt, Saudi Arabia, others who were behind SAF, and remakes the entire war,\" says Mr Boswell, adding that it closing the gap in air power between the RSF and the army.",
      "\"The RSF is widely viewed as a non-state actor,\" he says \"and normally, groups like that can muster quite a bit of an insurgent force. But the government with the air force is the one that always has the aerial capacity, and this just turns all those old adages on its head.\"",
      "The development has triggered comparisons to the long-range drone warfare between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "\"These weapons have more precision, you don't need a manned aircraft any more, and they are much more affordable than operating sophisticated jets,\" says Mr Binnie.",
      "\"This is part of a broader trend in technological proliferation where you can see what used to be really high-end capabilities being used in a civil war in sub-Saharan Africa.\"",
      "The Sudanese foreign ministry has warned that the attacks threaten regional security and the safety of navigation in the Red Sea, calling on international actors to take \"effective action against the regional sponsor of the militia,\" a reference to the UAE.",
      "Mr Lynch believes that only an agreement between the UAE and the Sudanese army will end the war.",
      "\"This war is always evolving, always changing,\" he says, \"but you'll see it will continue for years and decades unless there is serious diplomatic action to stop it.\"",

      "The Qatari royal family plans to give the luxury Boeing 747-8, estimated to be worth $400m (\u00a3300m), to the US Department of Defence to be used as part of a fleet of planes dubbed Air Force One \u2013 the president's official mode of air travel.",
      "The current fleet includes two 747-200 jets which have been in use since 1990, along with several smaller and somewhat secretive 757s.",

      "Trump found little support for the plan in more mainstream outlets as well.",
      "The New York Post, which usually can be counted on to back much of the populist Maga agenda, ran a blunt editorial: \"Qatar's 'Palace in the Sky' jet is NOT a 'free gift' - and Trump shouldn't accept it as one.\"",

      "It's an ominous sign of Israel's threat to significantly expand its military campaign in Gaza.",

      "The European Commission was wrong to refuse to release text messages sent by Ursula von der Leyen to the head of Pfizer during negotiations to secure Covid-19 vaccines, the EU's top court has ruled.",
      "The General Court said the commission had not given a plausible explanation as to why the exchanges between its president and Pfizer's Albert Bourla could not be made public when an investigative journalist requested them in 2021.",
      "That year, Pfizer signed billions of euros in vaccine contracts with the EU, including a deal for 1.8bn extra doses.",
      "The content of the messages between von der Leyen and Mr Bourla remains secret, in a simmering case that has become known in Brussels as Pfizergate.",
      "Anti-corruption group Transparency International has hailed the European Court's ruling as a \"landmark victory for transparency in the EU\", adding that it should serve as a catalyst to put an end to a \"restrictive attitude to freedom of information\".",

      "She won a second five-year term late last year. Wednesday's ruling threatens to damage her reputation, because of the apparent lack of transparency surrounding the Pfizer vaccine deal, in which she played such a significant role.",
      "The Commission said it would closely study the ruling and consider its next steps, but it insisted that transparency had \"always been of paramount importance\".",
      "The controversy erupted in April 2021, when New York Times journalist Matina Stevis revealed how Ursula von der Leyen had negotiated privately with the Pfizer boss after his German partner BioNTech won regulatory approval for its Covid drug.",
      "The article spurred investigative journalist Alexander Fanta, who worked for a German publication, to use a Freedom of Information request to see the exchange of messages between January 2021 and May 2022. But the European Commission turned him down, saying it did not have the documents.",
      "Under the Commission's transparency rules, all staff including the president, have to archive their documents.",
      "However, mobile text messages are a grey area, and the case has largely hinged on whether or not they should be considered as important records.",
      "One EU official argued this week that SMS messages were not \"systematically considered public documents\" and not recorded as such.",
      "Fanta took the case to the European Ombudsman in 2021, where an inquiry found that the Commission's failure to look for the text messages beyond its usual record-keeping amounted to maladministration.",
      "Stevis and the New York Times followed up, and when the messages were still not released, they took the European Commission to court.",
      "Ruling on Stevis's challenge, the court said on Wednesday that the EU's executive had relied \"either on assumptions or on changing or imprecise information\", while the journalist and the New York Times had succeeded in rebutting their claims.",
      "The court said that if a presumption was rebutted then it was up to the Commission to prove that documents either did not exist or it did not possess them.",
      "The Commission had not clarified whether or not the text messages had been deleted, the court ruled, and if they had been deleted, whether that was done deliberately or whether von der Leyen had since changed her mobile phone."

      "Human rights groups are warning of a \"surge\" of deaths of migrant construction workers in Saudi Arabia, as it prepares to host the World Cup in 2034.",
      "Labourers are already dying from preventable workplace accidents in the country, according to Human Rights Watch and FairSquare which have both published reports today.",
      "Many such deaths are wrongly classified as having occurred due to natural causes and the families of workers are not compensated, the reports say.",
      "Both groups have called on the Saudi Authorities to ensure basic safety protections for the country's huge migrant work-force.",
      "\"The 2034 Saudi World Cup will be the largest and most expensive ever, but it could also have the highest cost in human lives, as millions of migrant workers build infrastructure, including 11 new stadiums, a rail and transit network, and 185,000 hotel rooms,\" Minky Worden, director of Global Initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said.",
      "The warnings come a day after the President of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, visited the country along with Donald Trump - attending a US-Saudi investment forum.",

      "But Human Rights Watch has accused FIFA of failing to learn lessons from migrant worker deaths in the lead-up to the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.",
      "Data on migrant deaths is hard to come by in a country where human rights groups have very limited access and labour unions are banned.",

      "FIFA also praised \"significant steps\" taken by Saudi Arabia to reform its labour laws since 2018.",

      "\"Hundreds of thousands of young men, many of whom have young families, are being pitched into a labour system that poses a serious risk to their lives, a medical system that doesn't have the capacity to determine the cause of their deaths, and a political system that doesn't appear to either protect them or find out how they died, let alone compensate the families shattered by Saudi Arabia's negligence,\" FairSquare co-director James Lynch said.",
      "He described FIFA's human rights policies as a \"sham.\"",
      "\"While FIFA praises Saudi Arabia to the rafters and highly-paid western law firms generate vast profits for curating Saudi's reputation, children in places like Nepal grow up without their fathers and never even learn how they died, he said.\"",
      "FIFA told Human Rights Watch that it plans to establish a workers' welfare system dedicated to mandatory standards and enforcement mechanisms for World Cup-related construction and service delivery in Saudi Arabia.",
      "In a letter it said: \"We are convinced that the measures implemented to ensure construction companies respect the rights of their workers on FIFA World Cup sites can set a new standard for worker protection in the country and contribute to the wider labour reform process, helping to enhance protections for workers on World Cup sites and beyond.\"",
      "But Human Rights Watch said no further details were provided on how the welfare system would work.",

      "Current President Yamand\u00fa Orsi announced his predecessor's death on X, writing: \"thank\u00a0you\u00a0for\u00a0everything\u00a0you\u00a0gave\u00a0us\u00a0and\u00a0for\u00a0your\u00a0deep\u00a0love\u00a0for\u00a0your\u00a0people.\"",
      "The politician's cause of death is not known but he had been suffering from oesophageal cancer.",
      "Because of the simple way he lived as president, his criticism of consumerism and the social reforms he promoted - which, among other things, meant Uruguay became the first country to legalise the recreational use of marijuana - Mujica became a well-known political figure in Latin America and beyond.",
      "His global popularity is unusual for a president of Uruguay, a country with just 3.4 million inhabitants where his legacy has also generated some controversy.",
      "In fact, even though many tended to see Mujica as someone outside the political class, that was not the case.",
      "He said his passion for politics, as well as for books and working the land, was passed on to him by his mother, who raised him in a middle-class home in Montevideo, the capital city.",
      "As a young man, Mujica was a member of the National Party, one of Uruguay's traditional political forces, which later became the centre-right opposition to his government.",
      "In the 1960s, he helped set up the Tupamaros National Liberation Movement (MLN-T), a leftist urban guerrilla group that carried out assaults, kidnappings and executions, although he always maintained that he did not commit any murder.",
      "Influenced by the Cuban revolution and international socialism, the MLN-T launched a campaign of clandestine resistance against the Uruguayan government, which at the time was constitutional and democratic, although the left accused it of being increasingly authoritarian.",
      "During this period, Mujica was captured four times. On one of those occasions, in 1970, he was shot six times and nearly died.",
      "He escaped from prison twice, on one occasion through a tunnel with 105 other MLN-T prisoners, in one of the largest escapes in Uruguayan prison history.",
      "When the Uruguayan military staged a coup in 1973, they included him in a group of \"nine hostages\" who they threatened to kill if the guerrillas continued their attacks.",
      "During the more than 14 years he spent in prison during the 1970s and 1980s, he was tortured and spent most of that time in harsh conditions and isolation, until he was freed in 1985 when Uruguay returned to democracy.",
      "He used to say that during his time in prison, he experienced madness first hand, suffering from delusions and even talking to ants.",
      "The day he was freed was his happiest memory, he says: \"Becoming president was insignificant compared to that.\"",
      "From guerrilla to president",
      "A few years after his release, he served as a lawmaker, both in the Chamber of Representatives and in the Senate, the country's lower and upper houses respectively.",
      "In 2005, he became minister in the first government of the Frente Amplio, the Uruguayan leftist coalition, before becoming Uruguay's president in 2010.",
      "He was 74 years old at the time, and, to the rest of the world, still unknown.",
      "His election marked an important moment for the Latin American left, which was already strong on the continent at that time. Mujica became leader alongside other left-wing presidents such as Luis In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in Brazil and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela.",
      "However, Mujica governed in his own way, demonstrating pragmatism and audacity on several occasions, political commentators say.",
      "During his administration, amid a fairly favourable international context, the Uruguayan economy grew at an average annual rate of 5.4%, poverty was reduced, and unemployment remained low.",
      "Uruguay also drew global attention for the social laws passed by parliament during those years, such as the legalisation of abortion, the recognition of same-sex marriage, and state regulation of the marijuana market.",
      "While in office, Mujica rejected moving into the presidential residence (a mansion), as heads of state around the world usually do.",
      "Instead, he remained with his wife - politician and former guerrilla Luc\u00eda Topolansky - in their modest home on the outskirts of Montevideo, with no domestic help and little security.",
      "This combined with the fact that he always dressed casually, that he was often seen driving his light blue 1987 Volkswagen Beetle and gave away a large portion of his salary, led some media outlets to call him \"the world's poorest president\".",
      "But Mujica always rejected that title: \"They say I'm the poorest president. No, I'm not,\" he told me in a 2012 interview at his home. \"Poor are those who want more [...] because they're in an endless race.\"",
      "Despite Mujica preaching austerity, his government did significantly increase public spending, widening the fiscal deficit and leading his opponents to accuse him of waste.",
      "Mujica was also criticised for failing to reverse the growing problems in Uruguayan education, despite having promised that education would be a top priority for his administration.",
      "However, unlike other leaders in the region, he was never accused of corruption or of undermining his country's democracy.",
      "By the end of his administration, Mujica had a high domestic popularity rating (close to 70%) and was elected senator, but also spent part of his time travelling the world after he stepped down as president.",

      "\"I'd love nothing more than to be with you,\" she said in a video, apparently ruling out that possibility. \"Switzerland will forever hold a special place in my heart. It's the country that believed in me and gave me the chance to be part of something so extraordinary.\"",
      "The semi-final saw 10 acts qualify for Saturday's grand finale, including Swedish entrants KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is the runaway favourite.",
      "Their song, an accordion-led comedy number whose title translates to \"let's take a sauna\", has a 40% chance of winning, according to bookmakers.",

      "Although she was unable to be there in person, it was a coup for organisers. The singer has stepped away from the limelight in recent years due to health issues related to stiff-person syndrome (SPS), a neurological condition that causes muscle spasms and makes it difficult for her to walk.",

      "The acrobatics continued with Slovenian musician Klemen, who was suspended upside down during his ballad How Much Time Do We Have Left?",
      "The song was a tribute to his wife, who has recently recovered from cancer, but the emotional performance wasn't enough to clinch him a position in the final.",
      "Taking a lighter note was Estonia's Tommy Cash, whose quirky anthem Espresso Macchiato was interrupted by a \"stage invader\" - actually a dancer who replicated his noodle-limbed dance moves.",
      "The arena was awash with Ukranian flags for Ziferblat, whose prog-pop anthem Bird Of Pray is a message of hope and resilience to families separated by the country's ongoing war with Russia.",

      "Speaking to the BBC, the band - who are actually from the Swedish-speaking part of Finland - said it was strange to enter the contest as the presumed favourite.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v5r1erdpgo",
    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 23:48:46 GMT",
    "summary": "As one of 25 member groups on the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited, say experts.",
    "story": [
      "Last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1bn (\u00a3756m) bailout to Pakistan \u2013 a move that drew sharp disapproval from India as military hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared, before a US-led ceasefire was unexpectedly declared.",
      "Despite India's protests, the IMF board approved the second instalment of a $7bn loan, saying Islamabad had demonstrated strong programme implementation leading to a continuing economic recovery in Pakistan.",
      "It also said the fund would continue to support Pakistan's efforts in building economic resilience to \"climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters\", providing further access of around $1.4bn in funding in the future.",
      "In a strongly worded statement India raised concerns over the decision, citing two reasons.",
      "Delhi questioned the \"efficacy\" of such bailouts or the lack thereof, given Pakistan's \"poor track record\" in implementing reform measures. But more importantly it flagged the possibility of these funds being used for \"state-sponsored cross-border terrorism\" \u2013 a charge Islamabad has repeatedly denied - and said the IMF was exposing itself and its donors to \"reputational risks\" and making a \"mockery of global values\".",
      "The IMF did not respond to the BBC's request for a comment on the Indian stance.",
      "Even Pakistani experts argue that there's some merit to Delhi's first argument. Pakistan has been prone to persistently seeking the IMF's help \u2013 getting bailed out 24 times since 1958 \u2013 without undertaking meaningful reforms to improve public governance.",
      "\"Going to the IMF is like going to the ICU [intensive care unit]. If a patient goes 24 or 25 times to the ICU then there are structural challenges and concerns that need to be dealt with,\" Hussain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, told the BBC.",
      "But addressing Delhi's other concerns \u2013 that the IMF was \"rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism\" thereby sending a \"dangerous message to the global community\" \u2013 is far more complex, and perhaps explains why India wasn't able to exert pressure to stall the bailout.",
      "India's decision to try to prevent the next tranche of the bailout to Islamabad was more about optics then, rather than a desire for any tangible outcome, say experts. As per the country's own observations, the fund had limited ability to do something about the loan, and was \"circumscribed by procedural and technical formalities\".",
      "As one of the 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited. It represents a four-country group including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Pakistan is part of the Central Asia group, represented by Iran.",
      "Unlike the United Nations' one-country-one-vote system, the voting rights of IMF board members are based on a country's economic size and its contributions \u2013 a system which has increasingly faced criticism for favouring richer Western countries over developing economies.",
      "For example, the US has the biggest voting share - at 16.49% - while India holds just 2.6%. Besides, IMF rules do not allow for a vote against a proposal - board members can either vote in favour or abstain \u2013 and the decisions are made by consensus on the board.",
      "\"This shows how vested interests of powerful countries can influence decisions,\" an economist who didn't want to speak on the record told the BBC.",
      "Addressing this imbalance was a key proposal in the reforms mooted for the IMF and other multilateral lenders during India's G20 presidency in 2023.",
      "In their report, former Indian bureaucrat NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers recommended breaking the link between IMF voting rights and financial contributions to ensure fairer representation for both the \"Global North\" and the \"Global South\". But there has been no progress so far on implementing these recommendations.",
      "Furthermore, recent changes in the IMF's own rules about funding countries in conflict add more complexity to the issue. A $15.6bn loan by the fund to Ukraine in 2023 was the first of its kind by the IMF to a country at war.",
      "\"It bent its own rules to give an enormous lending package to Ukraine - which means it cannot use that excuse to shut down an already-arranged loan to Pakistan,\" Mihir Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) think tank in Delhi told the BBC.",
      "If India really wants to address its grievances,  the right forum to present them would be the United Nations FATF (Financial Action Task Force), says Mr Haqqani.",
      "The FATF looks at issues of combating terror finance and decides whether countries need to be placed on grey or black lists that prevent them from accessing funds from bodies like the IMF or the World Bank.",
      "\"Grandstanding at the IMF cannot and did not work,\" said Mr Haqqani. \"If a country is on that [FATF] list it will then face challenges in getting a loan from the IMF \u2013 as has happened with Pakistan earlier.\"",
      "As things stand though, Pakistan was officially removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2022.",
      "Separately, experts also caution that India's calls to overhaul the IMF's funding processes and veto powers could be a double-edged sword.",
      "Such reforms \"would inevitably give Beijing [rather than Delhi] more power\", said Mr Sharma.",
      "Mr Haqqani agrees. India should be wary of using \"bilateral disputes at multilateral fora\", he said, adding that India has historically been at the receiving end of being vetoed out by China in such places.",
      "He points to instances of Beijing blocking ADB (Asian Development Bank) loans sought by India for the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, citing border disputes between the two countries in the region.",

      "\"We call it the Formula 1 tyre change,\" says Richard van Rouwendaal, the affable  Dutch stage manager who makes it all work.",
      "\"Each person in the crew can only do one thing. You run on stage with one light bulb or one prop. You always walk on the same line. If you go off course, you will hit somebody.",
      "\"It's a bit like ice skating.\"",
      "The stage crew start rehearsing their \"F1 tyre change\" weeks before the contestants even arrive.",
      "Every country sends detailed plans of their staging, and Eurovision hires stand-ins to play the acts (in Liverpool 2023, it was pupils from the local performing arts school), while stagehands start shaving precious seconds off the changeovers.",
      "\"We have about two weeks,\" says Van Rouwendaal, who's normally based in Utrecht but is in Basel for this year's contest.",
      "\"My company is around 13 Dutchies and 30 local guys and girls, who rock it in Switzerland.",
      "\"In those two weeks, I have to figure out who's right for each job. Someone's good at running, someone's good at lifting, someone's good at organising the backstage area. It is a bit like being good at Tetris because you have to line everything up in a small space, in the perfect way.\"",
      "As soon as a song finishes, the team are ready to roll.",
      "As well as the stagehands, there are people responsible for positioning lights and setting pyrotechnics; and 10 cleaners who sweep the stage with mops and vacuum cleaners between every performance.",
      "\"My cleaners are just as important as the stage crew. You need a clean stage for the dancers  - but also, if there's an overhead shot of somebody lying down, you don't want to see shoeprints on the floor.\"",
      "The attention to detail is clinical. Backstage, every performer has their own microphone stand, set to the correct height and angle, to make sure every  performance is camera perfect.",
      "\"Sometimes the delegation will say the artist wants to wear a different shoe for the grand final,\" says Van Rouwendaal. \"But if that happens, the mic stand is at the wrong height, so we've got a problem!\"",
      "Spontaneously changing footwear isn't the worst problem he's faced, though. At the 2022 contest in Turin, the stage was 10m (33ft) higher than the backstage area.",
      "As a result, they were pushing heavy stage props \u2013 including a mechanical bull \u2013 up a steep ramp between every act.",
      "\"We were exhausted every night,\" he recalls. \"This year is better. We've even got an extra backstage tent where we prepare the props.\"",
      "Props are a huge part of Eurovision. The tradition started at the second ever contest in 1957, when Germany's Margot Hielscher sang part of her song Telefon, Telefon into (you guessed it) a telephone.",

    "summary": "Claims of a white genocide are widely discredited, so how do Afrikaners feel about Trump's claims \u2013 and offer of refugee status?",
    "story": [
      "Ulrich Janse van Vuuren has made it his passion to share and showcase some of South Africa's best features with his legion of social media followers.",
      "The 38-year-old white South African often takes snapshots capturing scenes such as a cold Johannesburg morning, the purple Jacaranda trees famously associated with Pretoria or Cape Town's popular beachfronts.",
      "\"Promoting South Africa is something I am passionate about - I have no intention of taking up [US President Donald Trump's] offer because South Africa is my home,\" the proud Afrikaner tells the BBC, days after a small group of his fellow white compatriots left South Africa for their new life as refugees in the US.",
      "The US president, and his South-Africa born ally Elon Musk, says that white Afrikaners are being persecuted in their home country, and that they are being subjected to a \"genocide\".",
      "This is a claim that has been circulating for many years even though it has been widely discredited.",
      "Although some white farmers have been attacked and killed, South Africa has one of the world's highest murder rates, so this is an issue that affects all of its citizens, whatever their race.",
      "\"For me, South Africa is home. It's a place where my roots and heritage are, where I can contribute to the story of our nation and make a meaningful impact,\" said Mr Janse van Vuuren, who has more than one million followers on social media.",
      "\"I'm deeply invested in South Africa's success and I am proud to be part of its journey.\"",
      "And while he wished those who have taken up Trump's offer all the best in the US and urged them to \"not look back\", he insisted that none of them were refugees, but rather \"opportunists\".",
      "\"They've enjoyed more than their share of South Africa's resources and privileges, and none are fleeing racial persecution,\" he said.",
      "Thirty years after the end of the racist system of apartheid, average living standards among South Africa's white community remain far higher than for the black majority.",
      "Mr Janse van Vuuren said that the debate about the status of Afrikaners in South Africa had only served to make him \"more determined than ever to step up and contribute to South Africa in every way I can\".",
      "Four centuries after the first group of Dutch settlers arrived in what is now South Africa, most Afrikaners regard themselves as fully African \u2013 as seen in the name \u2013 and no longer identify with their European roots.",
      "But many are unhappy both with the high crime rate and the government's policies aimed at reducing economic inequality in the country \u2013 especially a law passed earlier this year that allowed the government to seize land without compensation \"when it is just and equitable and in the public interest\". White South Africans are 7% of the country's population, but own half of its farmland.",
      "Some Afrikaners are farmers and see the law as being aimed at them.",
      "Trump said the legislation prompted him to offer to help resettle \"Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination\".",
      "The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics.",
      "But despite numerous claims in the past of the systematic targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority group, local crime statistics figures paint a different picture.",
      "South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.",
      "On Monday, the first group of 59 Afrikaners granted refugee status arrived at the Dulles airport near Washington DC after choosing to leave their home country.",
      "The arrival of the group drew dismay and outrage across South Africa, as the country's civil society and leadership sought to dispel the claims that the white minority was being persecuted.",
      "\"They are leaving because they don't want to embrace the changes that are taking place in our country and our constitution,\" said South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.",
      "He later labelled their move a \"cowardly act\" as he addressed farmers at a convention held in the Free State province.",
      "The president's sentiments were echoed by many South Africans, including Mr Janse van Vuuren, who is proud of his Afrikaner origins.",
      "While he was not raised in a farming family, he has relatives and friends in agriculture who have been victims of crime.",
      "He said that while it was undeniable that some farmers faced \"genuine threats and hardships\", it was important to be cautious \"when discussing claims of persecution or discrimination that portray an entire group as victims of targeted violence or systemic oppression\".",
      "While many white South Africans echo Mr Janse van Vuuren's sentiments, there are also those who see themselves as a persecuted minority.",
      "Among them is Ilse Steenkamp, who along with her family, has applied for the programme but has not received feedback. She did not want us to use her real name.",
      "Ms Steenkamp, 47, and her husband, both Afrikaners, were commercial farmers but said they had lost their land recently after it was invaded by people who \"took over the whole farm\" just as they were about to sell it in order to \"downscale\".",
      "She said they had bought the land two decades ago, after the end of apartheid.",
      "The people who invaded destroyed critical infrastructure, making it impossible to sell, she said.",
      "Despite efforts to have them removed through the courts, Ms Steenkamp said they were forced to abandon the land as it was repossessed by the bank.",
      "Ms Steenkamp said that while she and her family were familiar with South Africa's high crime levels and often tried to \"not let it get us under\", this latest attack \"was the straw that broke the camel's back\".",
      "Even though her family were eager to embrace Trump's offer when it was first announced, the mother-of-three told the BBC that the decision to leave \"was very difficult because you're... leaving a whole way of life\".",
      "Asked whether it was unfair that Afrikaners were being granted refugee status at a time when the US was cracking down on refugees and asylum seekers from everywhere else in the world, Ms Steenkamp said she \"completely disagreed\".",
      "She pointed to assaults on farmers, saying there was a \"hatred that seems to go with these attacks\".",
      "\"Any farmer that has gone through that [kind of] attack and is now wanting to flee, I think should be treated as a refugee because they are fleeing from a government that will not even admit that these things are happening,\" she said.",
      "Sam Bus\u00e0, 60, is another white South African who has applied for the refugee programme.",
      "She is the founder of Amerikaners, a platform aimed at providing information to white South Africans interested in the US resettlement offer.",
      "While Ms Bus\u00e0, who is of English, not Afrikaner, descent, and her three sons have submitted their applications, they have not been interviewed yet.",
      "While it was initially believed that the executive order, vague in its original wording, only applied to white Afrikaners, Ms Bus\u00e0 said it \"clearly is targeting white South Africans\".",
      "On Monday, the US embassy in South Africa released a statement clarifying the criteria for those applying for resettlement, which said applicants need to be:",

      "Of South African nationality",
      "Afrikaner or from a racial minority",
      "Able to cite an incident of past persecution or fear of persecution in the future",
      "Responding to the criticism that they were not genuine refugees, Ms Bus\u00e0 said: \"When someone strips away your hope for the future, even though you're not in a warzone... someone ripping away your dreams and hope for the future, that is very dramatic.

      "But Dr Piet Croucamp, an associate professor in political studies at South Africa's North West University, disagreed, echoing the view that those taking up this offer were not refugees as \"South Africa does not persecute people\".",
      "Rather, he speculated that it may be those who have been victims of a crime and \"could define their existence as an unsecure one\".",
      "Dr Croucamp, who is an Afrikaner, said that while he did not expect a significant number of white South Africans to follow suit, there would always be \"opportunistic\" people taking advantage of the situation.",

Even the right-wing Afrikaners\u2026 [like] AfriForum and Solidarity have said they are not going anywhere. So even within Afrikaner circles, this is a small group of people,\" he said.",
      "Despite their criticism of the government and its race-based policies, prominent Afrikaner lobby groups AfriForum and the Solidarity Movement have both reiterated their intention to remain in South Africa.",
      "AfriForum said that while the government was to blame for the departure of the group granted refugee status, they would stay and continue their \"efforts to help create a future for Afrikaners here at the southern tip of Africa\".",
      "This is a view with which Mr Janse van Vuuren agreed.",

      "In 1989, brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents by shooting them multiple times at close range at their mansion in Beverly Hills.",
      "They were found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996, and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.",
      "However, in a resentencing hearing in Los Angeles a judge reduced their term, making them eligible for parole.",
      "Public interest in the case has grown since a new Netflix drama, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, was released in September.",
      "Why was there a hearing to resentence the brothers?",
      "In 2024, the previous district attorney of Los Angeles, George Gasc\u00f3n, requested that the brothers' sentence of life without the possibility of parole be changed to 50 years to life.",
      "The issue was put to Los Angeles County superior court Judge Michael Jesic on 13 May, who agreed.",
      "\"I do believe they've done enough in the past 35 years that they should get that chance,\" he said, concluding a day-long hearing.",
      "Menendez sentences reduced, given them chance of freedom",
      "Menendez sentences reduced, given them chance of freedom",
      "The brothers are now eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law which allows individuals who committed crimes before the age of 26 to seek a reduced sentence.",
      "The siblings were aged 18 and 21 at the time. They are now aged 54 and 57.",
      "What happened at the resentencing hearing?",
      "During the hearing, family members and a former fellow inmate were among those who testified in support of the resentencing.",
      "People who worked with the brothers in prison spoke about the educational courses they had completed, and described a hospice initiative they created for the elderly and sick.",
      "The district attorney's office, which fiercely opposes a lower sentence, said the brothers have continued to \"make excuses\" for their conduct instead of taking full responsibility and were not rehabilitated.",
      "The brothers spoke to the court via video and apologised for their actions.",
      "They also expressed their hope to work with sex abuse victims and help those incarcerated if they were given a second chance outside prison.",

      "Menendez brothers feel 'hope' for parole after decades in jail",
      "Who decides whether the Menendez brothers will be released?",
      "The California parole board will now decide whether to release the brothers from prison.",
      "Separately, the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, is considering a request from the brothers for clemency. If approved, it could lead to a reduced sentence or a pardon.",
      "Governor Newsom requested that the parole board conduct a risk assessment that examines whether the brothers pose a risk to the general public if released.",
      "The full report has not been released, but the district attorney said it indicated a \"moderate risk of violence\".",
      "The parole board hearing on the clemency petition is set to take place on 13 June.",
      "It is unclear whether the board will also consider the possibility of parole based on Judge Jesic's resentencing at the same hearing.",
      "What did the Menendez brothers do?",
      "Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, on 20 August 1989 at their home in Beverly Hills.",
      "Their father, a 45-year-old Hollywood executive, was shot six times with a shotgun the brothers had purchased days before the attack.",
      "Their mother died after suffering 10 shotgun blasts to several parts of her body.",
      "The brothers initially told police they found their parents dead when they arrived home.",
      "They were arrested after the girlfriend of a psychologist that had been treating Erik Menendez went to police to say that he had physically threatened the doctor.",
      "Why did the Menendez brothers kill their parents?",
      "The brothers claimed they committed the murders in self defence after years of alleged physical, emotional and sexual abuse, although no molestation was ever proven in court.",
      "They said they feared their father would kill them after they threatened to expose him.",
      "However, prosecutors argued that the young men had killed their successful parents to inherit their multi-million-dollar estate.",
      "What happened during the original Menendez trials?",
      "The brothers were taken into custody in 1990, and in 1993 they were tried for the murders, first individually, with one jury for each brother.",
      "However, both juries were deadlocked in 1994, resulting in a mistrial, and the pair were later tried again together in 1995.",
      "During their joint trial the judge excluded apparent evidence of abuse from their defence case. Taped sessions with a doctor, in which the killings were discussed, were ruled admissible in court by the judge.",
      "A jury found them guilty and the pair were convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996.",
      "The brothers, who were separated during their detention after a detective who investigated the slayings said they may conspire to escape if housed together, reunited in jail in 2018.",
      "What impact has the Netflix drama had on the case?",
      "The case was thrust back into the spotlight after Netflix released a drama series about the brothers in September 2024.",
      "Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, shot to the top of the platform's streaming chart and was reported to have had more than 12 million views in the first weekend after release alone.",
      "The programme explores what might have led the siblings to kill their parents and presents the murders from different perspectives.",
      "Its creators said the series was based on extensive research.",
      "It includes the brothers' claims of abuse as well as showing things from the parents' point of view.",
      "The show introduced the case to a new generation and garnered attention from celebrities - including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O'Donnell - who called for the brothers to be released.",
      "The series was a follow-up to the controversial first Monsters series about US serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.",
      "What have the Menendez brothers said about the Netflix series?",
      "Following its release, Erik Menendez shared a statement, released on X by his wife.",
      "He said the show was \"disheartening slander\" and he \"believed we had moved beyond the lies and ruinous character portrayals of Lyle\".",
      "\"It is sad for me to know that Netflix's dishonest portrayal of the tragedies surrounding our crime have taken the painful truths several steps backward - back through time to an era when the prosecution built a narrative on a belief system that males were not sexually abused, and that males experienced rape trauma differently than women,\" he added.",
      "Members of the family also spoke out and said the brothers had been \"victimised by this grotesque shockadrama,\" and the show was \"riddled with mistruths\".",
      "Ryan Murphy, who created the show, told Variety that the comments were \"predictable at best\".",
      "He added that the family's response was \"interesting because I would like specifics about what they think is shocking or not shocking. It's not like we're making any of this stuff up. It's all been presented before\".",

    "story": [
      "Virat Kohli's retirement from Tests has left Indian cricket beleaguered and the sporting world gasping in surprise.",
      "Coming on the heels of captain Rohit Sharma quitting a few days earlier, it adds up to a double whammy for India who embark on a tough tour of England for a five-Test series come June without their two most experienced batters.",
      "Like Sharma, Kohli took to Instagram, where he commands more than 270 million followers, to make his retirement public.",
      "\"As I step away from this format, it's not easy \u2013 but it feels right\u2026'' he explained to his disconsolate fans.",
      "Tributes for Kohli have come in a deluge since: from fellow cricketers, past and present, old and young, and also legends from other disciplines like tennis ace Novak Djokovic and football star Harry Kane, which highlights the sweep and heft of Kohli's global appeal.",
      "Leading India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in 2008, Kohli was fast tracked into international cricket by the then-chairman of selectors, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar, against the judgement of others in the cricket establishment.",
      "\"Many in the Indian cricket board felt he was too young but he was scoring heavily in domestic cricket, and the hunger to succeed was palpable in him,\" recalls Vengsarkar.",
      "An example of Kohli's obsessive passion for the sport comes imbued with poignancy. Kohli was playing his second Ranji Trophy match for Delhi. His father passed away suddenly with his team in a crisis. After the funeral, he went back and scored a battling 90.",
      "Vengsarkar's approving eye earned Kohli an ODI debut in 2009. At 23, he was the youngest member of India's 2011 ODI World Cup winning team under MS Dhoni. A few weeks later, he made his Test debut in the West Indies. Some months on, during the disastrous tour of Australia with his place under threat, Kohli made a gritty maiden century and never looked back. Within a couple of years he established himself as the pre-eminent batter of his generation.",
      "Brash and provocative, without a benign muscle in his body, he was as volatile as potassium on water in his early years. He was unafraid to take on the most reputed opponents, often indulging in on-field fracases that sometimes earned him criticism.",
      "Happily, this was not to become his defining identity in cricket. Prolific run-getting in dashing style across formats provided another more compelling dimension and was to take him to the pinnacle.",
      "When his idol Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013, Kohli, allying unbridled ambition with his abundant skills, grabbed the baton hungrily and went on to sketch one of the most stellar careers in cricket history.",
      "He wielded the bat like a Jedi, with great skill and telling thrust to slay opponents, as it were. Coupled with his high-octane persona, his scintillating batting made him a cult hero whose very presence ensured blockbuster box-office returns everywhere he played.",
      "Kohli always wore his passion on his sleeve. He was always demonstrative and dramatic on the field but over a period of time, misplaced angst was sublimated into a raging inner pursuit of excellence that took him to dizzying heights.",
      "Marriage to film star Anushka Sharma made them the country's foremost power couple, putting both under the glare of even more intense spotlight.",
      "Metaphorically, Kohli's outstanding exploits, especially in the first decade of his career, epitomised the emerging India of the 21st century: unabashedly, unrelentingly ambitious, discarding all past demons, willing to take on the best in the world.",
      "His achievements across formats are monumental.",
      "In ODIs, he is third in run aggregate behind Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakarra, but boasts the best average (57.88) among batters who have played more than 100 games. His ability to win ODI matches in the most daunting run chases is the stuff of folklore, many of his record 51 centuries coming in such pursuit.",
      "In T20s, his run aggregate and centuries don't put him in the top five, but he's immortalised himself with incredible knocks, notably 82 not out in an emotion-charged, pulsating match against arch-rivals Pakistan in the 2022 World Cup and a vital 76 in the 2024 final against South Africa, which helped India win the title.",
      "He is also the highest run scorer in the history of the Indian Premier League.",
      "At one point, Kohli averaged 50-plus in all three formats, making him the most productive and versatile batter of his era - way ahead of contemporaries Joe Root, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith. The four were locked in a fascinating, long-running race for batting supremacy.",
      "When it appeared he would break all batting records, Kohli's career took an inexplicable downturn. From the start of the pandemic, the flow of runs began to ebb and centuries became a trickle. In his pomp \u2013 between 2014 and 2019 \u2013 he had been unstoppable, at one time scoring six double centuries in just 18 months.",
      "The drought of runs hit him most adversely in Test cricket where his average, from a high of 55-plus in 2019 slumped to the current 46.75. In this period, Kohli also lost the captaincy, though his stellar standing in international cricket remained untouched.",
      "Kohli finishes his Test career with 9,230 runs, which puts him 19th overall in aggregate, and fourth among Indians behind Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar, all of whom finished with a 50-plus average and more centuries. But to judge him only on this yardstick would diminish the massive impact he has had on this format .",
      "As captain, Kohli easily hurdles over Gavaskar, Tendulkar and Dravid. In Test cricket, winning 40 of the 68 matches he led in, making him the fourth most successful in the format. In the Indian context, this assumes Himalayan proportions.",
      "Former Australia captain Greg Chappell says that Kohli's energy, grit, sense of purpose and aura was \"transformative\" for Indian cricket. Chappell marks him out as the most influential Indian captain, ahead of even Sourav Ganguly and M S Dhoni.",
      "Former India captain and chief coach Ravi Shastri, who collaborated with Kohli for years, gives first-hand perspective.",
      "\"Kohli made India into a fighting unit, especially when playing overseas,\" says Shastri.",
      "The lack of ICC and IPL titles according to Shastri, is misleading as an index to his  captaincy ability.",
      "\"He always played to win, sought and nurtured fast bowlers to win overseas, demanded high intent and supreme fitness from all players, putting himself in the forefront, not as a backseat driver.\"",
      "For seven years when Kohli and Shastri collaborated, India were in the top three in ICC rankings in all formats almost continuously which is unprecedented.",
      "The most cherished and significant triumph of  this period came in 2018 when India beat Australia in its own backyard in a Test series for the first time ever.",
      "Australia is where Kohli had launched himself into batting greatness, scoring 692 runs in four Tests in 2014-15. In 2018, he contributed as captain and batter to break an hitherto unassailable psychological barrier. In 2020 touring Australia, Kohli played only one match (which was lost) returning home for the birth of his child. But India, having overcome the mental barrier two years earlier, went on to win the rubber in a melodramatic see-saw series.",
      "Australia was Kohli's happy hunting ground and his last visit Down Under in late 2024 grabbed worldwide attention. He began with a roar, hitting  a century in the first test at Perth. But his form fizzled out alarmingly and made only 190 runs in the five Tests.",
      "How much this contributed to his decision to retire is moot. Advancing years, the dislike of being constantly under harsh scrutiny, wanting to be close to his young family and behind the scene shenanigans that abound in Indian cricket have doubtless played a part too.",
      "Kohli ends his retirement post on Instagram enigmatically.",
      "\"I'll always look back at my Test career with a smile. #269 signing off,\" he wrote.",
      "The greatest ambassador for the five-day format in the last decade and a half had moved into the sunset.",

    "story": [
      "Kenya's President William Ruto is a man of many nicknames.",
      "El Chapo, Kasongo, Hustler, Deputy Jesus and Chicken Seller are just some that he has acquired in recent years.",
      "As is often the case when people are given alternative monikers, some are affectionate but some are intended to mock, while others reflect a profound anger.",
      "A history of the president's aliases offer a window into how the perception of him has changed.",
      "Ruto has acknowledged the rechristening trend, joking recently that Kenyans are \"finishing\" him with the numerous labels.",
      "\"You have given me so many names. I had the name William Kipchirchir Samoei Ruto. You added Survivor\u2026 Zakayo... now you are at Kasongo [the title of a Congolese song about abandonment and heartbreak]. Will you stop at 10, or should I prepare for more?\" he recently asked.",
      "The crowd, at a rally in the capital, Nairobi, responded that they had even more.",
      "Before he was elected president in 2022, Ruto attracted handles that bolstered his reputation as a man of the people.",
      "Hustler - Kenyan parlance for someone eking out a living against the odds - helped portray him as someone who would prioritise the needs of the struggling folk.",
      "Chicken Seller, referring to his childhood when he hawked poultry on the roadside, resonated with many who saw his life as an epitome of their own.",
      "\"These were very positive [names]. They sold him to the public in terms of votes,\" political analyst Prof Herman Manyora told the BBC, arguing that they helped catapult him into the top job.",
      "\"Names really stick with Ruto,\" he added.",
      "But the president has been a high-profile figure in Kenyan politics for a long time, including serving as deputy president for nine years until 2022, and has never been far from controversy.",
      "Prof Manyora recalls the label Arap Mashamba \u2013 which translates as \"son of farms\" \u2013 coined just under a decade ago and relates to Ruto's ownership of vast tracts of land across the country. Concerns have been raised about how some of these have been acquired.",
      "In 2013, a court ordered Ruto to surrender a 100-acre (40-hectare) farm and compensate a farmer who had accused him of grabbing it during the 2007 post-election violence. He denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Ruto's penchant for quoting Bible verses also earned him the Deputy Jesus tag. He has also been given the name Nabii, or prophet.",
      "However, it is since his rise to the presidency that the nickname manufacturers have been working overtime \u2013 with at least a dozen being created - and they have become increasingly critical.",
      "One that has stood out is Zakayo - Swahili for the name Zaccheaus, a Biblical figure who is portrayed as a greedy tax collector who climbed a tree to see Jesus.",
      "The \u2018tax collector\u2019 president sparking Kenyan angerBBC identifies security forces who shot Kenya anti-tax protesters",

      "Ruto's government introduced a raft of unpopular taxes and many Kenyans began to say that he had betrayed the \"hustlers\".",
      "\"He failed to deliver after becoming president,\" Prof Manyora said.",
      "The pain of paying more taxes, and a perception that the extra money will be wasted, is the focus of many conversations.",
      "Last year, young people came out onto the streets of Nairobi for weeks of protests, which turned deadly, against a fresh government proposal to raise taxes that was later dropped.",
      "The chant \"Ruto must go\" became a rallying call for the demonstrators and now Must Go has become another way to refer to the leader.",
      "The creative christeners have also focussed on the allegation that the president enjoys foreign travel.",
      "Hence the title Vasco da Ganya \u2013 a play on the name of the 15th Century Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, and the Swahili word danganya, which means \"to lie\".",
      "Africa's 'flying presidents' under fire",
      "Africa's 'flying presidents' under fire",
      "Ruto's honesty has also been called into question with Kaunda Uongoman, which mimics late Congolese musician Kanda Bongoman.",
      "The first part refers to the president's love for the Kaunda suit - a safari jacket with matching trousers \u2013 and Uongoman, which incorporates the Swahili word uongo, meaning \"lies\".",
      "But the president seems impervious to this volley of verbal attacks.",
      "Government spokesman Isaac Mwaura said the manifold nicknames \"don't raise concerns\" in the office of the president but simply \"capture how people view a person\".",
      "Ruto is \"very hands-on and doing his best to transform the economy... It's normal for any leader to have many nicknames as this signifies his various attributes and initiatives as a leader\", he told the BBC.",
      "Mwaura also argued that the government has had to raise taxes to pay for new projects, reduce the budget deficit and fix the economy.",
      "Nevertheless, when people have gone beyond inventing new names and used satire and forms of art to ridicule the president, there has been a negative reaction from officials.",
      "Some cartoons and AI-generated images, including showing the president in a casket, have been described as \"reckless\" and \"distasteful\".",
      "Some of the alleged producers of this online content have been victims of abductions. This, Prof Manyora said, should be seen as a sign of intolerance by the government.",
      "Lachon Kiplimo, a 23-year-old university student, said that while he supported the president, some of the promises he has made have been \"unrealistic\", which fuels the nicknames.",
      "He cited the use of El Chapo, referring to the former Mexican drug lord, after Ruto promised a machine that would produce a million chapatis (also known as chapo in Kenya) every day to feed schoolchildren in the capital.",
      "Mr Kiplimo however reckons that the way the president brushes off the monikers, and in fact seems to embrace them, shows how strong he is.",
      "Prof Manyora believes the young people who come up with the alternative labels for the president do it as a form of catharsis, a way of releasing tension.",
      "This view is backed up by 24-year-old student Margaret Wairimu Kahura, who said that many Kenyans \"are in a lot of pain\".",
      "She feels that the mockery is a way of letting Ruto know how the youth are feeling.",
      "She says that no other Kenyan president has been subjected to this level of lampooning, and \"so this is unique [but] in a bad way\".",
      "It is true that previous heads of state had nicknames but they have not been so numerous.",
      "The last President, Uhuru Kenyatta, was called Kamwana (\"young boy\"), Jayden (a Kenyan reference to a pampered or lazy child) and Wamashati (for his love of print shirts).",
      "His predecessor, Mwai Kibaki, was known as General Kiguoya (a general who is afraid) and Fence Sitter.",
      "Perhaps the age of social media, with its insatiable appetite for new content to keep people amused, has increased the trend towards name calling.",
      "But for many, like Ms Kahura, the volume of nicknames for Ruto are a genuine reflection of \"the different problems that people are facing\".",

    "title": "How real is the risk of nuclear war between India and Pakistan?",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e373yzndro",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 23:35:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Recent hostilities were a reminder of how easily a crisis could escalate into catastrophe.",
    "story": [
      "In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons.",
      "Yet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre.",
      "Even scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan.",
      "Six years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be.",
      "As the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral.",
      "President Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a \"nuclear conflict\". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats.",
      "\"Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,\" Modi added.",
      "India and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons.",
      "The bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US.",
      "\"India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,\" he told the BBC.",
      "One reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the \"time or money\" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a \"clear qualitative\" edge in naval nuclear capability.",
      "Since testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine.",
      "India, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions.",
      "Further ambiguity emerged in 2016, when then\u2013defence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel \"bound\" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)",
      "The absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Pakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation.",
      "In 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that \"nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India\", and would only be used if \"the very existence of Pakistan as a state\" was at stake.",
      "In his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India.",
      "Around the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official issuing a stark warning to India: \"I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surprise\u2026 You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region.\"",
      "During the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not \"hesitate to use any weapon\" to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment.",
      "But there is scepticism on both sides over such claims.",
      "Former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan \"knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory\" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts.",
      "\"Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,\" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC.",
      "But nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. \"This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,\" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC.",
      "In March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the \"accidental firing of a missile\".)",
      "Yet, the danger of nuclear war remains \"relatively small\" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary.",
      "\"So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,\" he said.",
      "\"In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy.\" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)",
      "Sumit Ganguly, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, believes that \"neither India nor Pakistan wants to be labelled as the first violator of the post-Hiroshima nuclear taboo\".",
      "\"Furthermore, any side that resorts to the use of nuclear weapons would face substantial retaliation and suffer unacceptable casualties,\" Mr Ganguly told the BBC.",
      "At the same time, both India and Pakistan appear to be beefing up their nuclear arsenal.",
      "With new delivery systems in development, four plutonium reactors and expanding uranium enrichment, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could reach around 200 warheads by the late 2020s, according to The Nuclear Notebook, researched by the Federation of American Scientists' Nuclear Information Project.",
      "And as of early 2023, India was estimated to have about 680kg of weapons-grade plutonium - enough for roughly 130-210 nuclear warheads, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials.",
      "Despite repeated crises and close calls, both sides have so far managed to avoid a catastrophic slide into nuclear conflict. \"The deterrent is still holding. All Pakistanis did was to respond to conventional strikes with counter-conventional strikes of their own,\" writes Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst.",
      "Yet, the presence of nuclear weapons injects a constant undercurrent of risk - one that can never be entirely ruled out, no matter how experienced the leadership or how restrained the intentions.",
      "\"When nuclear weapons can be involved, there is always an unacceptable level of danger,\"John Erath, senior policy director at the non-profit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told the BBC.",
      "\"The Indian and Pakistani governments have navigated these situations in the past, so the risk is small.  But with nuclear weapons, even a small risk is too large.\""

    "summary": "The US leader has faced criticism over his plan to accept a plane from Qatar worth an estimated $400m.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has said his administration wants to accept a plane worth an estimated $400m (\u00a3303m) as a gift from Qatar, calling it \"a great gesture\" that he would be \"stupid\" to turn down.",
      "The potential move has been labelled \"wildly illegal\" by some members of the rival Democratic Party - something the White House denies - and it has attracted criticism from some of Trump's supporters.",
      "Qatar itself earlier said the reports about the plane were \"inaccurate\", and that negotiations were continuing.",
      "The news comes as Trump visits several countries in the Middle East, including Qatar.",
      "BBC Verify has been looking into the legality of presidents accepting gifts.",
      "What do we know about the plane?",
      "On Sunday, US media reported that the Trump administration was preparing to accept a Boeing jumbo jet from the Qatari royal family - saying that the plane would be refitted and used temporarily as Air Force One, the name for the plane used by presidents.",
      "Trump later posted on Truth Social: \"The Defense Department is getting a gift, free of charge, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction.\"",
      "When questioned by reporters, Trump said: \"It's a great gesture from Qatar. I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer.\"",
      "In February, Trump said he was \"not happy with Boeing\" about delays to two new Air Force One jets that he is expecting to receive directly from the firm. He added that the White House could instead \"buy a plane or get a plane, or something\".",
      "The Qatari plane was pictured in Palm Beach, Florida, in February where Trump inspected it. It is currently fitted with three bedrooms, a private lounge and an office, according to its specification summary document from 2015.",
      "Trump and Saudi crown prince sign partnership on first leg of president's diplomatic tour",
      "Trump heads to Saudi Arabia eyeing more investment in US",
      "A Qatari official has told CNN the plane is being given from the Qatari defence ministry to the Pentagon, and that it will be modified to meet Air Force One's safety and security standards.",
      "Experts say this is likely to take years, which means the plane may not be ready for use until near the end of Trump's term.",
      "Trump has said the plane will go directly to his presidential library after he leaves office, and that he \"wouldn't be using it\" after his presidency.",
      "Nonetheless, the move has led to criticism from Democrats as well as some long-time Trump supporters, including Laura Loomer who said: \"This is really going to be such a stain on the admin if this is true.\"",
      "Is the gift legal?",
      "Several senior Democrats have claimed that accepting the gift would be illegal.",
      "Democratic Senator Adam Schiff quoted a section of the US Constitution that said no elected official could accept \"any present... of any kind whatever\" from the leader of a foreign state without congressional approval.",
      "Frank Cogliano, a professor of American history at the University of Edinburgh, says this clause \"was intended to prevent bribery to influence the government\".",
      "\"It is certainly stretching the Constitution and we have not seen a gift on this scale, or of this nature\", says Professor Andrew Moran, a constitutional law expert at London Metropolitan University.",
      "There have been a number of other laws passed by Congress relating to the acceptance of foreign gifts, such as the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act of 1966, which means that congressional consent is required for the acceptance of foreign gifts above a certain value.",
      "Currently US officials can accept gifts valued at less than $480 (\u00a3363).",
      "Although Trump has referred to the plane ultimately going to his \"library\", experts have suggested he really means his museum foundation.",
      "Ex-presidents typically have a library housing their archive of documents, and a museum - typically funded by private donations - full of memorabilia and open to the public.",
      "Experts who BBC Verify spoke to said the fact that the plane could be given to the administration - and not to the president directly - before being transferred to his museum, may not get around the potential violation of the constitution.",
      "Jordan Libowitz - from the organisation Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington - said any use of the plane by Trump after leaving office would cross a line: \"Reagan's Air Force One ended up in his presidential library, but there's a difference there. The plane was decommissioned, Reagan never flew on it again, and it sits inside as a museum piece.\"",
      "The US Justice Department has reportedly drafted a memo explaining why it thinks accepting the jet would be permissible, although this has not been made public.",
      "When the White House Press Secretary, Karoline Leavitt was asked about the legality of the deal, she said: \"The legal details of that are still being worked out, but of course, any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law.\"",
      "What is Trump's family doing in the Middle East?",
      "President Trump is on a four-day trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE, hoping to drum up investment for the US.",
      "His visit follows a series of business deals announced by the Trump Organization, which is run by the president's sons, Eric and Donald Jr.",
      "These include plans to build golf courses and luxury villas in Qatar and the UAE.",
      "President Trump is not currently affiliated with the Trump Organization, having handed over management responsibilities to his children after entering the White House on 20 January.",
      "A deal was announced by the Trump Organization at the beginning of May to develop a Trump-branded luxury 18-hole golf course and a collection of luxury villas north of Qatar's capital, Doha.",
      "At the time, Eric Trump said: \"We are incredibly proud to expand the Trump brand into Qatar through this exceptional collaboration with Qatari Diar and Dar Global.\"",
      "Dar Global is a publicly owned Saudi construction company; Qatari Diar is a Qatari state-owned company.",
      "Separately, on 30 April, the Trump Organization announced it would build \"the region's first Trump International Hotel & Tower\" in the \"heart of Dubai\" consisting of 80 floors of \"luxury living and world-class hospitality\".",
      "Eric Trump also visited the UAE recently, speaking at Token 2049, a cryptocurrency conference, on 1 May.",
      "Asked if Trump was likely to meet anyone involved in the family business during his trip, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was \"ridiculous\" to suggest the president was doing anything for his own benefit.",

      "Emma is the strategies director of Hatton Garden Metals, a family-run gold dealership in London's Hatton Garden jewellery district, and this unprepossessing tub of bric-a-brac is a small sample of what they buy over the counter each day. It is, in effect, gold scrap, which will be melted down and recycled.",
      "Also on the table, rather more elegantly presented in a suede-lined tray, is a selection of gold coins and bars. The largest bar is about the size and thickness of a mobile phone. It weighs a hefty 1kg, and it's worth about \u00a380,000.",
      "The coins include biscuit-sized Britannias, each containing precisely one ounce of 24 carat bullion, as well as smaller Sovereigns. These are all available to buy - and the recent surge in gold prices has led to a surge in demand.",
      "Zoe Lyons, who is Emma's sister and the managing director, has never seen anything like it \u2013 often she finds would-be sellers queuing in the street. \"There's excitement and buzz in the market but also nervousness and trepidation,\" she tells me.",
      "\"There's anxiety about which way the market is going to go next, and when you get those emotions, ultimately it creates quite big trades.\"",
      "At MNR jewellers a couple of streets away, a salesman agrees: \"Demand for gold has increased, definitely,\" he says.",
      "Gold is certainly on a roll. Its price has increased by more than 40% over the past year. In late April it rose above $3,500 (\u00a32,630) per troy ounce (a measurement for precious metals). This marked an all-time record, even allowing for inflation, exceeding the previous peak reached in January 1980. Back then the dollar price was $850, or $3,493 in today's money.",
      "Economists have attributed this to a variety of factors. Principal among them has been the unpredictable changes in US trade policy, introduced by the Trump administration, the effects of which have shaken the markets. Gold, by contrast, is seen by many as a solid investment. Fears about geopolitical uncertainty have only added to its allure. Many investors have come to appreciate the relative stability offered by a commodity once dismissed by the billionaire Warren Buffett as \"lifeless\" and \"neither of much use nor procreative\".",
      "\"It's the kind of conditions that we consider a bit of a perfect storm for gold,\" explains Louise Street, senior markets analyst at the World Gold Council, a trade association funded by the mining industry.",
      "\"It's the focus on potential inflationary pressures. Recessionary risks are rising, you've seen the IMF [International Monetary Fund] downgrading economic forecasts very recently\u2026\"",
      "But what goes up can also come down. While gold has a reputation as a stable asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations. In fact, in the past, major surges in the price have been followed by significant falls.",
      "So what is the risk this could happen again, leaving many of today's eager investors nursing big losses?",
      "What really triggered the goldrush",
      "Helped by its relative rarity, gold has been seen as an intrinsic store of value for centuries. The global supply is limited. Only around 216,265 tonnes have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council, (the total is currently increasing by about 3,500 tonnes per year). This means that it is widely perceived as a \"safe haven\" asset that will retain its value.",
      "As an investment, however, it has both advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Unlike shares, it will never pay a dividend. Unlike bonds, it will not provide a steady, predictable income, and its industrial applications are relatively limited.",
      "The draw, however, is that it is a physical product that exists outside of the banking system. It is also used as an insurance policy against inflation: while currencies tend to lose value over time, gold does not.",
      "\"Gold can't be printed by central banks, and it can't be conjured out of thin air,\" says Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. \"In recent times, a big policy response from authorities when there's been a crisis has been: slash interest rates, boost money supply, quantitative easing, print money. Gold is seen as a haven from that, and therefore a store of value.\"",
      "There has recently been a significant rise in demand for gold from so-called Exchange Traded Funds, investment vehicles that hold an asset such as gold themselves, while investors can buy and sell shares in the fund.",
      "They are popular with large institutional investors \u2013 and their actions have helped to push up the price.",
      "When gold hit its previous record in January 1980, the Soviet Union had just invaded Afghanistan. Oil prices were surging, driving up inflation in developed economies, and investors were looking to protect their wealth. The price also rose sharply in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, leading to another peak in 2011.",
      "The recent increases appear to owe a great deal to the way markets have responded to the confusion triggered by the Trump administration.",
      "The most recent surge came after US President Donald Trump launched an online attack on Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve. Calling for immediate interest rate cuts, he described Mr Powell as a \"major loser\" for failing to reduce the cost of borrowing quickly enough.",
      "His comments were interpreted by some as an attack on the independence of the US central bank. Share markets fell, as did the value of the dollar compared to other major currencies \u2013 and gold hit its most recent record.",
      "But gold's recent strength is not wholly explained by the Trump factor.",
      "Fears of weaponisation of the dollar system",
      "The price has been on a steep upward curve since late 2022, partly, according to Louise Street, because of central banks. \"[They] have been net buyers of gold, to add to their official reserves, for the past 15 years,\" she explains. \"But we saw that really accelerate in the past three years.\"",
      "Central banks have collectively bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold each year since 2022, up from an average of 481 tonnes a year between 2010 and 2021. Poland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan and China were among the leading buyers last year.",
      "Analysts say central banks may themselves have been trying to build up buffers at a time of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty.",
      "According to Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs: \"In 2022 the reserves of the Russian Central Bank got frozen in the context of the invasion of Ukraine, and reserve managers of global central banks around the world realised, 'Maybe my reserves aren't safe either, what if I buy gold and hold it in my own vaults?'",
      "\"And so we have seen this big structural fivefold increase in demand for gold from central banks\".",
      "Simon French, chief economist and head of research at investment firm Panmure Liberum also believes that independence from dollar-based banking systems has been a major driver for central banks. \"I would look at China, but also Russia, their central bank is a big buyer of gold, also Turkey.",
      "\"There are a number of countries who fear weaponisation of the dollar system and potentially the Euro system,\" he says.",
      "\"If they are not aligning themselves with the US or the Western view, on diplomatic grounds, on military grounds\u2026 having an asset in their central bank that is not controlled by their military or political foes is quite an attractive feature.\"",
      "Another factor may now be helping to drive the gold market upwards: FOMO, or fear of missing out. With new all-time records being set, it has filtered through into everyday conversation in some quarters.",
      "Zoe Lyons believes that this is the case in Hatton Garden. \"[People] want a piece of the golden pie,\" she says, \"and they're willing to do that through buying physical gold.\"",
      "Safe, but for how long?",
      "The big question, though, is what happens next. Some experts believe the upward trend will continue, fuelled by unpredictable US policy, inflationary pressures and central bank buying. Indeed Goldman Sachs has forecast gold will reach $3,700/oz (\u00a32,800/oz) by the end of 2025 and $4,000 (\u00a33,000) by mid 2026.",
      "But it adds that in the event of a recession in the US or an escalation of the trade war it could even hit $4,500 (\u00a33,400) later this year.",
      "\"The US stock market is 200 times bigger than the gold market, so even a small move out of the big stock market or the big bond market would mean a big percent increase in the much smaller gold market,\" explains Daan Struyven.",
      "In other words, it wouldn't take a huge amount of turbulence in major investment markets to drive gold upwards.",
      "Yet others are concerned that the price of gold has risen so far, so fast that a market bubble is forming \u2013 and bubbles can burst.",
      "Back in 1980, for example, the dramatic spike in the gold price was followed by an equally remarkable correction, dropping from $850 (\u00a3640) in late January to just $485 (\u00a3365) in early April. By mid-June the following year, it stood at just $297 (\u00a3224) \u2013 a decline of 65% from its peak.",
      "The peak in 2011, meanwhile, was followed by a sharp dip, then a period of volatility. Within four months it had dropped by 18%. After plateauing for a while, it continued to fall, reaching a low point in mid-2013 that was 35% down from its highest.",
      "The question that remains is, could something similar happen now?",
      "Could the bubble burst?",
      "Some analysts do think prices will ultimately fall significantly. Jon Mills, an industry expert at Morningstar, made headlines in March when he suggested the cost of an ounce of gold could drop to just $1,820 over the next few years.",
      "His view was that as mining firms increased their production and more recycled gold entered the market, the supply would increase. At the same time central banks would ease off their buying spree, while other short-term pressures stimulating demand would subside, bringing prices down.",
      "Those forecasts have since been revised upwards slightly, largely because of increased mining costs.",
      "Daan Struyven disagrees. He believes there could be a short-term dip, but prices will generally continue to rise. \"If we were to get a Ukraine peace deal, or a rapid trade de-escalation, I think hedge funds would be willing to take some of their money out of gold and put it into risky assets, such as the stock market\u2026",
      "\"So you could see temporary dips. But we are quite confident that in this highly uncertain geopolitical setup, where central banks want safer reserve holdings, that they will continue to push demand higher over the medium term.\"",
      "Russ Mould believes there will, at the very least, be a lull in the upwards trend. \"Given that it has had such a stunning run, it would be logical to expect it to have a pause for breath at some stage,\" he says.",
      "But he believes that if there is a sharp economic slowdown and interest rates are slashed, the gold price could go higher in the long run.",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",
      "The curious case of why a billionaire wants to buy Royal Mail",
      "David Dimbleby: I thought the free market was with us forever - then Trump came along",
      "One problem for investors is working out whether the recent record price for gold was simply a staging point in a continued upward climb \u2013 to more than $4,000 for example \u2013 or the peak.",
      "Simon French at Panmure Liberum believes the peak may now be very close, and people piling into the market now in the hope of making big money are likely to be disappointed. Others have warned that those recently lured into buying gold by hype and headlines could lose out if the market goes into reverse.",
      "\"Short-term speculating can backfire, even though there will be a temptation to hang on to the coat-tails of the record run upwards,\" is how Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, has put it.",
      "\"Investors considering investing in gold should do so as part of a diversified portfolio \u2013 they shouldn't put all their eggs in a golden basket.\"",

    "story": [
      "I grew up in Nepal's capital watching the Himalayas. Ever since I left, I've missed sweeping, panoramic views of some of the highest mountain peaks on Earth.",
      "Each time I visit Kathmandu, I hope to catch a glimpse of the dramatic mountain range. But these days, there's usually no luck.",
      "The main culprit is severe air pollution that hangs as haze above the region.",
      "And it's happening even during the spring and autumn months, which once offered clear skies.",
      "Just last April, the international flight I was in had to circle in the sky nearly 20 times before landing in Kathmandu, because of the hazy weather impacting visibility at the airport.",
      "The hotel I checked in at was at a reasonable height from which mountains are visible on a clear day \u2013 but there was no such day during my two-week stay.",
      "Even from the major vantage point of Nagarkot, just outside Kathmandu, all that could be seen was haze, as if the mountains did not exist.",
      "\"I no longer brand the place for views of 'sunrise, sunset and Himalayas' as I did in the past,\" said Yogendra Shakya, who has been operating a hotel at Nagarkot since 1996.",
      "\"Since you can't have those things mostly now because of the haze, I have rebranded it with history and culture as there are those tourism products as well here.\"",
      "During an earlier trip a year ago, I was hopeful I would be able to see the mighty Himalayan peaks on a trek in the mesmerising Annapurna region \u2013 but had hardly any luck there either.",
      "Scientists say hazy conditions in the region are becoming increasingly intense and lasting longer, reducing visibility significantly.",
      "Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change.",
      "June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low.",
      "Traditionally, March to May and October to November were the best times for business because that was when skies remained clear and visibility was best.",
      "But with rising temperatures and a lack of rain, and worsening air pollution, the spring months are now seeing thick haze with low visibility. Those conditions are beginning as early as December.",
      "'No sighting means no business'",
      "Lucky Chhetri, a pioneering female trekking guide in Nepal, said hazy conditions had led to a 40% decrease in business.",
      "\"In one case last year, we had to compensate a group of trekkers as our guides could not show them the Himalayas due to the hazy conditions,\" she added",
      "An Australian tourist who has visited Nepal more than a dozen times since 1986 described not seeing the mountains as a \"major let-down\".",
      "\"It wasn't like this 10 years ago but now the haze seems to have taken over and it is extraordinarily disappointing for visitors like me,\" said John Carrol.",
      "Krishna Acharya, the provincial chair of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal in the western Gandaki province, says the trekking industry is in deep trouble.",
      "\"Our member trekking operators are getting depressed because no sighting of the Himalayas means no business. Many of them are even considering changing professions,\" he told the BBC.",
      "On the Indian side, near the central Himalayas, hoteliers and tour operators say haze is now denser and returns quicker than before.",
      "\"We have long dry spells and then a heavy downpour, unlike in the past. So with infrequent rain the haze persists for much longer,\" said Malika Virdi, who heads a community-run tourism business in the state of Uttarakhand.",
      "However, Ms Virdi says tourists are persistent - with many who didn't catch the mountain range returning to try their luck again.",
      "The western Himalayas in Pakistan have been relatively less affected by the haze because the mountains are relatively far from cities.",
      "But locals say that even the ranges that were once easily visible from places like Peshawar and Gilgit are often no longer seen.",
      "\"The sheet of haze remains hanging for a longer period and we don't see the mountains that we could in the past,\" said Asif Shuja, the former head of Pakistan's environmental protection agency.",
      "Hazes and dust storms increasing",
      "South Asian cities regularly top lists of places with highest levels of air pollution in the world.",
      "Public health across the region has been badly impacted by the toxic air, which frequently causes travel disruption and school closures.",
      "Vehicular and industrial emissions, dust from infrastructure construction and dry gravel roads as well as the open burning of waste are major sources of air pollution year-round.",
      "This is compounded by soot from massive forest fires - which are increasing due to a longer dry season - and the burning of crop residues after the harvest by farmers in northern India, Pakistan and Nepal.",
      "Weather conditions keeping warmer air above cooler air trap these pollutants and limit vertical air movement - preventing pollution from dispersing.",
      "\"Hazes and dust storms are increasing in South Asia, and this trend is projected to continue due to climate change and other factors,\" Dr Someshwor Das from the South Asia Meteorological Association told the BBC.",
      "In 2024, the number of hazy days recorded at the airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in western Nepal, was 168 - up from 23 in 2020 and 84 in 2021, according to Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology.",
      "Experts believe the Himalayas are probably the worst affected mountain range in the world given their location in a populous and polluted region.",
      "This could mean the scintillating view of the Himalayas could now largely be limited to photographs, paintings and postcards.",

      "Those in the know, then, are not surprised that US President Donald Trump - known for his unorthodox diplomacy - has touched a raw nerve in Delhi.",
      "On Saturday, he took to social media to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\", brokered by the US.",
      "Later, in another post he said: \"I will work with you both to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be arrived at, concerning Kashmir.\"",
      "The Kashmir dispute dates back to 1947, when India got independence from British rule and was partitioned to create Pakistan. Both neighbours claim the Kashmir region in whole, but administer it only in part.",
      "Several rounds of bilateral talks over the decades have not yielded any resolution. India treats Kashmir as an integral part of its territory and rules out any negotiation, particularly through a third party.",

      "India blames Pakistan of involvement in the incident, a charge denied by Islamabad.",
      "Trump's intervention came as fighting between the two nuclear-armed rivals was threatening to spiral into a full-blown conflict.",

      "Indian officials also argue that even when they reach an understanding with a civilian government in Pakistan, the country's powerful military launched operations undermining those deals. They point to the Kargil war in 1999, when another conflict between the two countries began after a group of Pakistan-backed militants occupied strategic areas in Indian-administered Kashmir.",

      "Pakistani strategic experts like Syed Muhammad Ali argue it is because of India's consistent refusal to engage with Pakistan that the international community should step in to avoid any future conflict.",
      "\"Kashmir is one of the most critical issues for the international community. The recent rapid escalation proves that the sabre-rattling can go out of hand,\" Mr Ali says.",
      "India's assertive diplomacy, particularly since Modi took over in 2014, has been seen as a sign of its confidence as a rising global economic power.",
      "But it will have to pull off a tough balancing act, to stave off Trump's advances.",
      "The US has courted India in recent years as a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. India is a key member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue group (Quad), along with the US, Australia and Japan, that was formed to counter Chinese expansionism in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "In recent decades, Washington has also sold modern transport planes, helicopters and other military equipment to Delhi, which is keen to modernise its 1.4 million strong military, that relies heavily on Russian weaponry.",
      "The previous American administrations were aware of India's sensitivities towards the Kashmir issue and largely stayed away from interfering with it. But with Trump, there's a question mark over whether that position still holds.",
      "The US is the largest trading partner of India with bilateral trade reaching about $130bn (\u00a398bn) in 2024. Modi's government is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington to avoid tariffs.",
      "Delhi will have to walk a fine line. It will be averse to taking up Trump's offer to mediate,  or see the US-brokered ceasefire, or \"understanding\" as it calls it, going beyond the current military tensions. But it's also keen to have a favourable trading relationship with the US.",
      "Any attempt to broaden the talks - on contentious bilateral issues like the now suspended river water-sharing treaty or the status of Kashmir - will invite strong criticism at the domestic level, a trap that Modi is well aware of."

      "The US and China have agreed a truce to lower import taxes on goods being traded between the two countries.",
      "The agreement marks a major de-escalation of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies, which has sent shockwaves impacting countless other countries, including the UK.",
      "Here's what it all means.",
      "What has been announced?",
      "Both the US and China have confirmed a reduction in the tariffs they imposed on each other following the initial escalation by President Donald Trump earlier this year.",
      "The deal involves both nations cancelling some tariffs altogether and suspending others for 90 days, by 14 May.",
      "The result is that additional US tariffs on Chinese imports - that's the extra tariffs imposed in this recent stand-off - will fall to from 145% to 30%, while recently-hiked Chinese tariffs on some US imports will fall from 125% to 10%.",
      "China has also halted and scrapped other non-tariff countermeasures, such as the export of critical minerals to the US, which it put in place in response to the initial escalation.",
      "The US measures still include an extra 20% component aimed at putting pressure on Beijing to do more to curb the illegal trade in fentanyl, a powerful opioid drug.",
      "The announcement came after the two countries held talks in Switzerland, the first between the two countries since Trump sparked the latest tariff war.",
      "What happens after 90 days?",
      "Trying to predict the next steps in this ongoing trade war between the US and China  these past few months has been difficult to say the least.",
      "But this is a major agreement between the world's two powerhouse economies and has been broadly welcomed.",
      "Even if the suspended tariffs are reinstated after 90 days, because the vast majority of the tariffs that were announced after Liberation Day have been cancelled, US tariffs on China would only rise to 54% and Chinese tariffs on the US would rise to 34%.",

      "In a word - lots.",
      "In 2024, the biggest category of goods exported from the US to China were soybeans \u2013 primarily used to feed China's estimated 440 million pigs. The US also sent pharmaceuticals and petroleum.",
      "Meanwhile, China exported large volumes of electronics, computers and toys.",
      "The biggest category of US imports from China is smartphones, accounting for 9% of the total. A large proportion of these smartphones, Apple iPhones, are made in China.",
      "However, the US buys much more from China ($440bn) than it sells to it ($145bn), which is something Trump has long been unhappy with.",
      "His reasoning in part for introducing tariffs, and higher ones on countries which sell more to the US than they buy, is to encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and boost manufacturing jobs.",
      "The escalating trade war in recent months has led to a collapse in the amount of goods being shipped across the Pacific Ocean, but investors believe the truce will lead to a rebound, with shares up for some of the world's biggest shipping firms.",
      "Has either side won?",
      "Politicians on both sides have started and will no doubt continue to claim victory over this truce.",
      "Despite the US and China calling this a joint agreement, people in Beijing will interpret it as the Trump administration walking back from the tariffs, according to Janka Oertel, director of the Asia programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"We are back to square one, now negotiating can begin. The outcome is uncertain but China is in a psychologically stronger position now than before,\" she said.",

    "summary": "The president promises sweeping price cuts \"almost immediately\", but experts say these are unlikely.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to reduce high prescription drug prices \u2013 but its details and long-term effects are far from clear.",
      "Citing figures that patients in other countries pay much less than Americans for pharmaceuticals, Trump said he would order drug companies to reduce their prices inside the US.",
      "He touted the move as \"one of the most consequential\" executive orders in US history, claiming prices would fall \"almost immediately, by 30% to 80%\".",
      "But experts are highly sceptical of the claims, and stock market moves indicate that investors think they will have little immediate effect.",
      "Why are American drug prices so high?",
      "The US has a particularly complex healthcare system - including a large private insurance industry, employer subsidies, and publicly funded insurance programmes for the elderly and poor, known as Medicare and Medicaid respectively.",
      "In many other developed countries, more centralised systems mean that officials can negotiate blanket rates for drugs, and in some cases refuse to buy if they deem the price too high.",
      "In 2021, the US Government Accounting Office made a comparison with Australia, Canada and France, and found that prescription drugs were on average two to four times more expensive in the US.",
      "Politicians from both US political parties have taken aim at the costs. During Monday's White House announcement, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr noted that prices had been a preoccupation of Democrats and a main target in socialist Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns.",
      "Both Trump in his first term and former President Joe Biden tried to tackle the issue, particularly the cost of life-saving drugs such as insulin, but US prices remain stubbornly high.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump and his health officials blamed the lack of progress on pharmaceutical lobbying efforts and large donations to members of Congress.",
      "\"The drug lobby is the strongest lobby,\" Trump told reporters. \"But starting today, the United States will no longer subsidise the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing.\"",
      "It should also be noted that Trump's trade tariffs \u2013 which he has consistently used to threaten other countries - could increase costs even further. Trump has previously said he will tax drugs imported into the US.",
      "What was in Trump's order?",
      "Trump's order is much wider than previous efforts to bring down costs - however, many details are yet to be worked out.",
      "The wording directs US officials to make sure that deals over drug costs made by foreign countries do not result in \"unreasonable or discriminatory\" price hikes for Americans.",
      "But what exactly is covered by those terms is unclear \u2013 as is the question of what measures the White House would take if \"unreasonable\" practices are discovered.",
      "The White House also wants drug companies to sell more products directly to consumers - cutting out insurance companies and pharmaceutical benefit managers - and look into importing drugs from foreign countries where they are sold at lower prices. That idea has previously hit stumbling blocks over safety and trade rules.",
      "An official said that Monday's order was the start of negotiations between the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and industry.",
      "What is Most Favoured Nation status?",
      "The order also proposed that the US be given Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status \u2013 meaning drug companies would be asked to match the lowest price for a drug abroad when selling to US consumers.",
      "\"Big pharma will either abide by this principle voluntarily or we'll use the power of the federal government to ensure that we are paying the same price as other countries,\" Trump told reporters.",
      "It was unclear what mechanism the White House would use to punish drug companies that refuse to voluntarily comply.",
      "Drug prices are very opaque, according to Alan Sager, a professor of health policy at Boston University. Drug manufacturers could easily argue that they were complying with the order by touting the price discounts that they already routinely provide on very high listed retail prices, he told the BBC.",
      "\"Will they act? Maybe. Will they claim they act? Sure,\" Prof Sager said.",
      "\"Whether this will signal a durable and meaningful cut in extraordinarily high US drug prices is very unclear,\" he said. \"This is rhetoric, not reality.\"",
      "How did markets react?",
      "Trump's preview of the announcement hit share prices of major drug makers, such as Pfizer, Eli Lilly and the UK's GSK.",
      "But they staged a quick recovery, rallying after the administration shared the scope of its plans \u2013 an indication that investors do not expect the moves to have a major impact.",
      "What else could hinder Trump's plan?",
      "To try to retain their profits in the US, drugs companies could simply pull out of other nations in which they are selling their products more cheaply, according to researchers Darius Lakdawalla and Dana Goldman at the University of Southern California.",
      "The researchers also said that foreign governments routinely underestimated the true value of drugs to patients, and that \"shifting to a European pricing model in the US would lead to shorter, less healthy lives for Americans\".",
      "Meanwhile, it is unclear how lower prescription drug prices would fit into Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda. The health secretary has consistently emphasised diet and exercise as the key to improving Americans' health \u2013 and has criticised the proliferation of many pharmaceutical products, including vaccines and drugs to treat mental illness.",
      "However, any potential reduction in drug prices is likely to be popular with Americans - as polls consistently show that high costs are a top concern when it comes to the US healthcare system.",
      "C Michael White, a pharmacy professor at the University of Connecticut, said that the results of the Trump administration's actions on drug prices \"will be minimal for many Americans\" but that any attempts towards greater transparency and lower costs \"are a positive step in the right direction\".",
      "But the order is expected to face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in courts and Congress.",
      "What does industry say?",
      "Industry groups are largely opposed to the executive order and say it will be counterproductive \u2013 potentially choking off the supply of drugs and funds for research while doing little to quell high costs.",
      "Stephen J Ubl, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement that \"importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal\" for American patients.",
      "John F Crowley, president of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, called MFN status \"a deeply flawed proposal that would devastate our nation's small- and mid-size biotech companies\" by potentially choking off funding for research.",
      "\"Patients and families are not a bargaining chip in a trade war, but that's exactly how they are being treated \u2013 first through proposed tariffs on our nation's medicines, now with foreign reference pricing in the name of fairness.\"",
      "But Alan Sager, the Boston University professor, was sceptical about the industry's arguments. He pointed out that the money used to research a drug was spent before any profits were made, and suggested that there might be other ways to fund research - such as large cash prizes for cures for specific diseases.",
      "Prof Sager suggested that real action to drive down drug prices would depend on the president's attention span.",
      "\"Given the president's apparent public vacillation on many topics, it just isn't clear that he'll stay with this problem or that he'll be willing and able to act effectively,\" he said.",

The alleged incident with the gun was the final straw.",
      "Moshe Sharvit did not respond to BBC Eye's requests for a response to Ayesha's account.",
      "Back on the mountainside, the man accused of this violence stopped his car and approached us. Nodding towards Gil Alexander he asked us: \"Do you know he's a very dangerous guy?\"",

      "Addressing our translator he said: \"So, do you understand that they're the people who are most dangerous to the State of Israel?\"",
      "Then he phoned the police, asking them to come to the scene. When he wasn't calling the police he filmed us filming him.",
      "Moshe Sharvit and Gil Alexander represent starkly different visions of Israel's future.",
      "Moshe Sharvit believes all of the West Bank - which settlers and the Israeli government call Judea and Samaria - were given by God to the Jews.",
      "In this he is supported by senior ministers in the government, including the Minister of Finance, Bezalel Smotrich, and the Minister of Public Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir. Both men are settlers and leaders of far-right ultranationalist parties.",
      "Smotrich has said Gaza will be \"totally destroyed\" and that its people will be \"totally despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places\".",
      "The 'other places' he envisages are foreign countries. Ben-Gvir, who is responsible for the police, has convictions for inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organisation.",
      "Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, relies on the support of the far-right settler movement to keep his government in power.",
      "He criticised the sanctions imposed on Moshe Sharvit and other settlers, saying his government viewed the move \"with great severity\". US sanctions against Moshe Sharvit were dropped when President Donald Trump came to power.",
      "The UN's top court ruled last year that Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is against international law and that all settlement activity is illegal.",
      "Israel rejects this and argues that settlements are necessary for security, citing lethal attacks by Palestinian gunmen on settlers, such as the killing of three people last January in the West Bank.",
      "Settlement expansion is anathema to Gil Alexander. He considers himself a Zionist, but within the existing borders of Israel.",
      "These are the frontiers that existed before it seized the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war.",
      "He is part of a network called the Jordan Valley Activists \u2013 Moshe Sharvit calls them \"anarchists\" - offering solidarity, and working for peaceful co-existence with the Palestinians.",
      "\"What they [the settlers] want to see happen,\" Gil Alexander told us, \"[is] that it will be an area completely free of Arabs. It isn't Moshe. It's all the people above him who sent him here. Meaning from the top\".",
      "Moshe Sharvit's desire to have the Jordan Valley empty of Palestinians is shared by the leader of the regional council, a government-supported body, David Elhayani, who has visited the sanctioned settler.",
      "In his air conditioned office about 15km (9 miles) from Moshe Sharvit's settler outpost he told us \"the notion of settler violence is an invention of the anarchist, extreme left meant to harm the settlement image\".",
      "As for the future of the Palestinians, he was emphatic. They should go to neighbouring Jordan.",
      "\"This country needs to be free of Arabs. It's the only way. It's a global interest. Why global? Because the minute there won't be Arabs here it will be a Jewish nation for the Jews who won't have to hurt each other, there won't be conflict, there won't be anything.\"",

      "During our encounter the settler claimed that Gil Alexander had breached his restraining order by taking us to the high ground overlooking the valley. The peace activist told us later that he had mistakenly strayed just over half a kilometre inside the area of the order.",
      "Although Moshe Sharvit's settlement is illegal, even under Israeli law, it has not been removed.",
      "Human rights organisations and numerous eyewitnesses testify that the Israeli army and police frequently stand by while settlers attack Palestinian villages.",

      "The Israeli human rights group, Yesh Din (There is Law), reported that only 3% of complaints made against settlers resulted in a conviction. In six days last month - from 22 to 28 April - the UN recorded 14 incidents involving settlers that left 36 Palestinians injured.",
      "In the tense atmosphere on the mountainside, and wanting to avoid any escalation, we decided to leave.",
      "As we walked away, Moshe Sharvit went to his jeep and drove ahead of us, stopping where the track turned down the mountain. Our way out was blocked. There was no-one we could appeal to apart from the man preventing us from leaving.",
      "Again, he phoned the police asking them to come. Gil Alexander phoned the police and his lawyer. Our team was worried that more settlers would come.",

      "Why did local Bedouin shepherds say they were very afraid of him? I asked.",

    "summary": "Many children in a Brazil town lost the ability to walk, so one scientist set about discovering why.",
    "story": [
      "Before Silvana Santos arrived in the little town of Serrinha dos Pintos more than 20 years ago, residents had no idea why so many local children had lost the ability to walk.",
      "The remote town in north-eastern Brazil is home to fewer than 5,000 people, and is where biologist and geneticist Santos identified and named a previously unknown condition: Spoan syndrome.",
      "Caused by a genetic mutation, the syndrome affects the nervous system, gradually weakening the body. It only appears when the altered gene is inherited from both parents.",
      "Santos's research marked the first time the disease had been described anywhere in the world. For this and later work, she was named one of the BBC's 100 most influential women in 2024.",
      "Before Santos arrived, families had no explanation for the illness affecting their children. Today, residents talk confidently about Spoan and genetics.",
      "\"She gave us a diagnosis we never had. After the research, help came: people, funding, wheelchairs,\" says Marquinhos, one of the patients.",
      "Serrinha dos Pintos: a world of its own",
      "Where Santos is from in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil's largest and wealthiest city, many of her neighbours were members of the same extended family originally from Serrinha. Many of them were cousins of varying degrees, married to each other.",
      "They told Santos that many of people in their hometown couldn't walk, but that no-one knew why.",
      "One of the neighbours' daughters, Zirl\u00e2ndia, suffered from a debilitating condition: as a child, her eyes moved involuntarily and over time, she lost strength in her limbs and needed to use a wheelchair, requiring help with even the simplest tasks.",
      "Years of investigation would lead Santos and a research team to identify these as symptoms of Spoan syndrome.",
      "They would go on to find 82 other cases worldwide.",
      "At the invitation of her neighbours, Santos visited Serrinha on holiday. She describes her arrival as stepping into \"a world of its own\" - not just because of the lush scenery and mountain views, but also due to what seemed to be a notable social coincidence.",
      "The more she walked and spoke with locals, the more surprised she was at how common marriages between cousins were.",
      "Serrinha's geographical isolation and little inward migration mean that many of the population are related, making marriage between cousins far more likely and more socially acceptable.",
      "Worldwide, marriages between relatives were estimated at around 10% in the early 2010s. More recent data shows the rate varies widely, from over 50% in countries like Pakistan, to 1-4% in Brazil and less than 1% in the US and Russia. Most children born to pairs of cousins are healthy, experts say.",
      "But these marriages do face a higher risk of a harmful genetic mutation being passed down through the family.",
      "\"If a couple is unrelated, the chance of having a child with a rare genetic disorder or disability is about 2\u20133%. For cousins, the risk rises to 5\u20136% per pregnancy,\" explains geneticist Luzivan Costa Reis from Brazil's Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.",
      "A 2010 study led by Santos showed that more than 30% of couples in Serrinha were related, and a third of them had at least one child with a disability.",
      "Long road to diagnosis",
      "Santos set out to find a diagnosis for the people of Serrinha and she began planning a detailed genetic study, requiring multiple trips and eventually leading to her relocating to the region.",
      "She drove the 1,250 miles (2,000km) to and from S\u00e3o Paulo many times in the early years of her research. She collected DNA samples door-to-door, chatting to locals over coffee and gathering family stories, all the while trying to locate the mutation causing the disease.",
      "What was supposed to be three months of fieldwork turned into years of dedication.",
      "It all led to the publication in 2005 of the team's study revealing the existence of Spoan in the Brazilian hinterland.",
      "Santos's team found that the mutation involves the loss of a small fragment of a chromosome, which causes a gene to overproduce a key protein in brain cells.",
      "\"They said it came from Maximiano, a womaniser in our family,\" recalls farmer Lol\u00f4, whose daughter Rejane has Spoan.",
      "Lol\u00f4, now 83, married his cousin and never left Serrinha. He still tends cattle and relies on family to care for Rejane, who struggles with daily tasks.",
      "But the genetic mutation behind Spoan is far older than the legend of Old Maximiano: it likely arrived more than 500 years ago with early European settlers in the north-east of Brazil.",
      "\"Sequencing studies show strong European ancestry in patients, supporting records of Portuguese, Dutch, and Sephardic Jewish presence in the region,\" says Santos.",
      "The theory gained strength after two Spoan cases were found in Egypt, and further studies showed that the Egyptian cases also shared European ancestry, pointing to a common origin in the Iberian Peninsula.",
      "\"It likely came with related Sephardic Jews or Moors fleeing the Inquisition,\" says Santos. She believes more cases may exist globally, especially in Portugal.",
      "Understanding the risks",
      "Although there's been little progress toward a cure, tracking patients has brought some change. Rejane recalls how people used to be called \"cripples\". Now, they're simply said to have Spoan.",
      "Wheelchairs brought not just independence, but also helped prevent deformities - in the past, many with the condition had been left simply lying in bed or on the floor.",
      "As Spoan progresses, physical limitations worsen with age and by 50, nearly all patients become fully dependent on carers.",
      "This is the case for In\u00e9s's children, who are among the oldest in Serrinha. Chiquinho, 59, can no longer speak, and Marquinhos, 46, has limited communication abilities.",
      "\"It's hard to have a 'special' child. We love them the same, but we suffer for them,\" says In\u00e9s, who is married to a second cousin.",
      "Larissa Queiroz, 25, the niece of Chiquinho and Marquinho, also married a distant relative. She and her husband, Saulo, only discovered their common ancestor after several months of dating.",
      "\"In Serrinha dos Pintos, deep down, we're all cousins. We're related to everyone,\" she says.",
      "Couples like Larissa and Saulo are the focus of a new research project which Santos is also involved in. Backed by Brazil's Ministry of Health, it will screen 5,000 couples for genes linked to serious recessive diseases.",
      "The goal is not to stop cousin marriages, but to help couples understand their genetic risks, says Santos. Now a university professor, she also leads a genetics education centre and works to expand testing in the north-east of Brazil.",
      "Though she no longer lives in Serrinha dos Pintos, every visit feels like coming home.",
      "\"It's as if Santos is family,\" says In\u00e9s."

      "Here's what to know about the charges and key names in the case.",
      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",
      "In her testimony, she said she signed with Bad Boy Records when she was 19, and Combs first kissed her on her 21st birthday. She and Combs dated off-and-on for more than 10 years, from about 2007 to 2018.",

      "\"The representations of Chinese and Asians in early Hollywood were really like kind of one-dimensional and really demeaning,\" said Herb Tam, Director of Exhibitions at the Museum of Chinese in America.",
      "In response, the board told them to make their own movies if they wanted to change stereotypes. That's when Harold and his uncle Lee Kee Do founded and financed the Great Wall Film Company in 1921.",
      "\"In the 1920s, they had a small population here, but they still had the yearning for culture and film and art,\" Lee told Brooklyn reporter Hannah Kliger.",

      "The streets of the city can look almost unrecognizable more than 100 years later, but researchers say I.S. 281 Joseph B. Cavallaro along Cropsey Avenue in Gravesend now stands on the site of the former studio. Some of its early films, distributed both in the U.S. and in China, were shot out of Southern Brooklyn.",
      "\"The film company the Lee family created is really reflective of a kind of 'do-it-yourself' mentality, and an entrepreneurialship within Chinese-American communities,\" Tam said.",
      "The studio eventually moved to Shanghai, producing around two dozen films in a decade. Few still remain, most were lost. The company went dark with the onset of the Great Depression, but the Lee family's impact in the world of cinema continued with the creation of the New York Chinese Film Exchange.",

    "summary": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' ex-girlfriend, the singer Cassie Ventura, took the stand this week at his sex trafficking trial in New York City.",
    "story": [
      "As federal prosecutors called witnesses to the stand in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' criminal trial, his ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie Ventura, continued her testimony Wednesday inside the New York City courthouse as the trial entered its second day.",
      "Ventura is a critical witness in the prosecution's case against Combs, who has been accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and exploiting women for decades until his\u00a0arrest\u00a0on multiple charges last September. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The music mogul could receive a lifetime prison sentence if convicted on all of them.",
      "Ventura's testimony will likely last the rest of the week. Here are some key takeaways from it so far.",
      "Violence occurred \"frequently\"",
      "In her initial statements before the court, Ventura, now pregnant with her third child and married to personal trainer Alex Fine, recalled her and Combs' early interactions and how she started to see a different side of him over time. She said she met Combs when she was a newly signed singer at 19, and their burgeoning friendship became romantic two years later.",
      "She also described his alleged violence throughout their 10-year on-off relationship, recounting instances where he knocked her over, kicked and dragged her, and stomped on her head, causing black eyes and bruises on her body. When asked, Ventura said the abuse she endured happened \"frequently.\"",
      "Combs is seen attacking Ventura in video footage CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0last year, which shows him throwing her to the floor, kicking and dragging her in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel.",
      "\"Control was everything\"",
      "Ventura characterized Combs as physically and psychologically abusive throughout the first hours of her testimony.",
      "\"Control was everything \u2014 from the way that I looked, to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to,\" she said. \"Control was an all-around thing to a certain point.\"",
      "Combs allegedly introduced Ventura to \"freak offs,\" drug-fueled events where he is accused of forcing women to perform sex acts with hired sex workers, which were a focus of the indictment outlining his alleged crimes.",
      "Ventura said Combs broached the idea of sexual encounters involving voyeurism during the first year of their relationship, and he would hire an escort or dancer with whom he would watch her engage while he directed them. The singer testified she felt confused and nervous, \"but I also loved him very much and wanted to make him happy.\"",
      "She testified she worried about making Combs angry because of how much control he had over her life and career, and the possibility that he could blackmail her by releasing images of the \"freak offs.\" Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Combs often recorded these performances with or without participants' consent.",
      "A shift in the relationship",
      "Ventura recalled Combs looking out for her when she first met him. They fell in love, she said, while spending time together in the studio or traveling elsewhere.",
      "\"I think I was just enamored by him. We were just having a good time. It was really fun at this point,\" she told the court. But as her appearance, transportation, rent and overall lifestyle came under Combs' control, Ventura said her music career \u2014 and record deal \u2014 eventually took a backseat to the alleged \"freak offs,\" which left her feeling humiliated.",
      "She testified that despite recording hundreds of songs and nine albums while she was with Combs, the work was never released because \"freak offs\" became her job. They took up too much time and energy to leave room for other pursuits, Ventura said, adding that she would stay up for several days at a time to party, drink and have sex with strangers.",
      "The \"freak offs\" could last from 36 to 72 hours at a time, she said, with the longest continuing for four days. She recalled them happening almost weekly for years.",
      "Ventura felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by \"freak offs\"",
      "Ventura began to cry during her testimony when asked whether she wanted to participate in every \"freak off.\" She said she didn't and that she felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by them, but she also didn't want to disappoint Combs.",
      "Ventura told the court Combs dismissed her when she expressed how she felt about them, calling her predictable for not wanting to engage.",
      "Testifying at length about the \"freak offs,\" Ventura said Combs provided ecstasy and cocaine, which she took to stay awake during the incidents.",
      "2016 hotel incident",
      "Ventura recalled the 2016 hotel altercation seen on video footage. After being shown a clip from the incident during the second day of her testimony, she recounted that Combs was yelling and threw something at her during the attack.",
      "She said she told Combs via text message she had a black eye from the incident and reminded him of a premiere she was supposed to attend.",
      "\"You are sick for thinking it's OK to do what you've done,\" she wrote in a text to Combs. \"Please stay far away from me.\"",
      "Ventura told the court she wore sunglasses to cover her eyes and used makeup to hide bruises on other parts of her body when she attended the premiere.",
      "Prosecutors showed several photos of Ventura at the premiere event and after party, where the injuries could be seen.",
      "Drug use",
      "Combs allegedly provided stimulant drugs, like cocaine, to keep participants awake for the length of his \"freak offs,\" Ventura said. She also testified about a time when she requested ketamine, an anesthetic that has been used recreationally for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects.",
      "Prosecutors allege Combs' \"freak offs\" involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and accuse him of using substances in part to exercise control over the people he targeted.",
      "She said Combs didn't like the drug and argued a successful \"freak off\" can be remembered, but explained ketamine was her preference because it allowed her to be less present in the moment.",

      "\"All my life I've been a chameleon. Everything is a costume,\" Simmons said in an interview for \"CBS Mornings\" that aired on Wednesday.",
      "But his devilish make-up and theatrical persona are a stark contrast to his very humble upbringing as the son of an immigrant single mother. Long before he became a KISS icon, he was known simply as Chaim Witz, meaning \"life\" in Hebrew.",
      "The road to KISS",
      "\"You want to be in a rock band?\" Simmons recalled his mother asking. \"That's not going to fly, babe.\"",
      "Before moving to New York at age 8, Simmons was born in Israel \u2013 a child of Jewish refugees from Hungary. His mother, Flora Klein, survived the Holocaust.",
      "\"After the horrific unimaginable life my mother went through where she saw her entire family, our family, wiped out in front of her face, every decision I was going to make I thought about my mother first,\" Simmons said.",
      "Simmons vowed to be there for his mother every step of the way, reminding himself, \"Don't break your mother's heart. Don't do it.\"",
      "He said it was an observation his mother made that inspired him to be a musician. While watching The Beatles perform on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" one night, Simmons recalled his mother coming in and commenting in Hungarian.",
      "\"I'll never forget this\u2026she said something like, in Hungarian, 'They're really weird people.' And at that point, I thought they're cool,\" Simmons said.",
      "The birth of \"Rock and Roll All Nite\"",
      "After making some money from singing background for other artists at New York City's Electric Lady Studios, Simmons and his pal Paul Stanley went on to form the legendary band KISS in their early 20s.",
      "Eddie Kramer, who worked with The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, agreed to produce and engineer their first demo. But they struggled in obscurity until a challenge from their label's president led to one of the most famous lines in rock history.",
      "While buying frozen hot dogs and a can of beans in San Francisco, Simmons recalls Stanley turning to him and humming some of the lyrics to the song that would later become the iconic 1975 hit \"Rock and Roll All Nite.\"",
      "\"We were in San Francisco, we went downstairs to buy frozen hotdogs and a can of beans. And Paul said, what do you think of this?\"",
      "\"That's really good. What do you got? He goes, 'That's all I've got,'\" said Simmons after Stanley sang the chorus. They eventually put more verses together.",
      "\"And that's how the song was born,\" he said.",
      "By 1977, following the release of their concert album \"Alive!\", they were one of the most famous bands in America. Today, KISS has more gold albums than any other American band and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.",
      "Though KISS retired from performing as a band, Simmons, now 75, is currently on tour.",

    "summary": "During a 40-year screen career, Robert Benton received six Oscar nominations and won three times.",
    "story": [
      "Robert Benton, the Oscar-winning filmmaker who helped reset the rules in Hollywood as the co-creator of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" and later received mainstream validation as the writer-director of \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and \"Places in the Heart,\" has died at age 92.",
      "Benton's son, John Benton, said that he died Sunday at his home in Manhattan of \"natural causes.\"",
      "During a 40-year screen career, the Texas native received six Oscar nominations and won three times: for writing and directing \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and for writing \"Places in the Heart.\" He was widely appreciated by actors as attentive and trusting, and directed Oscar-winning performances by Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and Sally Field. Although severe dyslexia left him unable to read more than a few pages at a time as a child, he wrote and directed film adaptations of novels by Philip Roth, E.L. Doctorow and Richard Russo, among others.",
      "Benton was an art director for Esquire magazine in the early 1960s when a love for French New Wave movies and old gangster stories \u2014 and news that a friend got $25,000 for a Doris Day screenplay \u2014 inspired him and Esquire editor David Newman to draft a treatment about the lives of Depression-era robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, imagining them as prototypes for 1960s rebels.",
      "Their project took years to complete as Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard were among the directors who turned them down before Warren Beatty agreed to produce and star in the movie. \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" directed by Arthur Penn and starring Beatty and Faye Dunaway, overcame initial critical resistance in 1967 to the film's shocking violence and became one of the touchstones of 1960s culture and the start of a more open and creative era in Hollywood.",
      "The original story by Benton and Newman was even more daring: they had made Clyde Barrow bisexual and involved in a 3-way relationship with Bonnie and their male getaway driver. Beatty and Penn both resisted, and Barrow instead was portrayed as impotent, with an uncredited Robert Towne making numerous other changes to the script. \"I honestly don't know who the 'auteur' of 'Bonnie and Clyde' was,\" Benton later told Mark Harris, author of \"Pictures at a Revolution,\" a book about \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and four other movies from 1967.",
      "Over the following decade, none of Benton's films approached the impact of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" although he continued to have critical and commercial success. His writing credits included \"Superman\" and \"What's Up, Doc?\" He directed and co-wrote such well-reviewed works as \"Bad Company,\" a revisionist Western featuring Jeff Bridges, and \"The Late Show,\" a melancholy comedy for which his screenplay received an Oscar nomination.",
      "His career soared in 1979 with his adaptation of the Avery Corman novel \"Kramer vs. Kramer,\" about a self-absorbed advertising executive who becomes a loving parent to his young son after his wife walks out, only to have her return and ask for custody. Starring Hoffman and Streep, the movie was praised as a perceptive, emotional portrait of changing family roles and expectations and received five Academy Awards, including best picture. Hoffman, disenchanted at the time with the film business, would cite \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and Benson's direction for reviving his love for movie acting.",
      "Five years later, Benton was back in the Oscars race with a more personal film, \"Places in the Heart,\" in which he drew upon family stories and childhood memories for his 1930s-set drama starring Fields as a mother of two in Texas who fights to hold on to her land after her husband is killed.",
      "\"I think that when I saw it all strung together, I was surprised at what a romantic view I had of the past,\" Benton told The Associated Press in 1984, adding that the movie was in part a tribute to his mother, who had died shortly before the release of \"Kramer vs. Kramer.\"",
      "Benton was born in Waxahachie, Texas, outside of Dallas. He owed his early love for movies to his father, telephone company employee Ellery Douglass Benton, who, instead of asking about homework, would take his family to the picture shows. The elder Benton would also share memories of attending the funerals of outlaws Barrow and Parker, Texas natives who grew up in the Dallas area.",
      "Robert Benton studied at the University of Texas and Columbia University, then served in the U.S. Army from 1954 until 1956. While at Esquire, Benton helped start the magazine's long-standing Dubious Achievement Award and dated Gloria Steinem, then on staff at the humor magazine Help! He married artist Sallie Rendigs in 1964. They had one son.",
      "Between hits, Benton often endured long dry spells. His latter films included such disappointments as the thrillers \"Billy Bathgate,\" \"The Human Stain\" and \"Twilight.\" He had much more success with \"Nobody's Fool,\" a wry comedy released in 1994 and starring Paul Newman, in his last Oscar-nominated performance, as a small-town troublemaker in upstate New York. Benton, whose film was based on Russo's novel, was nominated for best adapted screenplay.",
      "\"Somebody asked me once when the Academy Award nominations came out and I'd been nominated, 'What's the great thing about the Academy Awards?'\" Benton told Venice magazine in 1998. \"I said, 'When you go to the awards and you see people, some of whom you've had bitter fights with, some of whom you're close friends with, some people you haven't seen in ten years, some people you just saw two days before \u2014 it's your family.' It's home. And home is what I've spent my life looking for.\"",

Kardashian testified that one member of the gang pulled her to him while she was in just a bathrobe.",
      "\"I was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,\" Kardashian said. \"I absolutely did think I was going to die,\" she added.",

      "\"Then I heard one of the gentlemen forcefully say, 'Ring! Ring!' in English, with an accent, pointing,\" she told the court, according to Reuters, apparently referring to the $4 million diamond ring given to her by her then-husband Kanye West, now known as Ye.

      "\"It was at the end of the bed, so he grabs my leg and pulls me toward him on the bed so the robe is opened and everything is exposed,\" Kardashian said. \"And that was the moment when I thought he would rape me. But he ended up tying me up and closed my legs.\"",

      "\"I forgive you,\" Kardashian told Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the man alleged to be the brains behind the robbery, after his lawyer read a letter to the court sent by his client to the celebrity a year after the robbery, in which he said he was sorry.",

A side room was set up for 200 more journalists to watch a live transmission from inside the courtroom.",

      "Before the celebrity took the stand herself, her longtime friend-turned-stylist Simone Harouche told the court on Tuesday that she heard Kardashian begging for her life during the attack in the hotel suite they were sharing.",
      "\"'I have babies and I need to live!' That is what she kept on saying, 'Take everything. I need to live,'\" Harouche told the court. \"I was scared that she was raped or violated. I thought the worst.\"",
      "Prosecutors have told the court that when the gang, dressed as police officers, arrived at the luxury suites hotel known only as \"The No Address\" where Kardashian was staying, they demanded that the concierge, at gunpoint, guide them to \"the rapper's wife,\" a reference to her then-husband.",
      "In interviews and on her family's reality TV show, Kardashian has described being terrified during the intrusion, thinking she was going to be raped and killed.",
      "\"They dragged me out to the hallway on top of the stairs, that's when I saw the gun, like clear as day,\" she said on her show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" adding: \"It makes me so upset thinking about it.\"",
      "The robbers, some of whom escaped on bicycles, have been dubbed \"the Grandpa robbers\" as most of the suspects were in their 60s at the time of the heist.",
      "As they fled, they dropped a diamond and platinum cross that was found the next morning by a local resident. The rest of the haul has not been recovered.",
      "The DNA of two of the accused was found at the scene, and they have admitted taking part in the robbery. Khedache, now 69, is accused of masterminding the heist. Known as \"Old Omar,\" he reportedly told investigators he had no idea who Kardashian was, but had heard from a waiter friend about the amazing jewelry she wore when she was out dining in Paris.",
      "Khedache wrote to Kardashian in 2017, while he was in custody, to apologize. Her lawyers said he wrote after he heard her speak of how traumatic the experience had been.",
      "\"I want to reach out to you as a human being to tell you how much I regret my actions, how much I was moved and touched to see your tears,\" Khedache wrote. \"Of course, we cannot undo the past but I hope this letter will make you gradually forget the traumatism you experienced through my fault.\"",
      "Kardashian wept as she listened, then said: \"I appreciate the letter. I forgive you for what happened. That said, it doesn't change my trauma nor the fact that my life was changed forever.\"",
      "Khedache responded: \"Your forgiveness is like the sun lighting me up. Thank you.\"",
      "Yunice Abbas, the 71-year-old who has already admitted in court that he was the lookout, told Kardashian: \"I formally, sincerely apologize.\"",
      "In court on April 29, he expressed \"total regret\" for his part in the heist. He said he understood afterward that, \"when you steal a lady's purse, it can be traumatic\" for her.",
      "A police officer who testified for the prosecution told the court Kardashian appeared \"traumatized\" in the immediate aftermath of the robbery.",
      "Lawyers for some of the accused expressed concern as the trial opened last month that Kardashian's fame would distract from the essentials of the case.",
      "Chloe Arnoux, who represents Khedache, told reporters: \"He is, in fact, rather worried about seeing all you, journalists, because he is afraid that his case will not be treated the same way it would be if there were not such a famous person involved in it.\"",
      "Kardashian's lawyer Michael Rhodes said in April that the reality TV star and entrepreneur had \"tremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system,\" and \"wishes for the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion in accordance with French law and with respect for all parties to the case.\"",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu was convicted Tuesday of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in Paris in 2021 and handed an 18-month suspended sentence. The 76-year-old actor had denied the charges that he forcefully groped a set decorator and an assistant producer on the set of \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\").",
      "Depardieu was not in court for the verdict or sentencing on Tuesday, as he's currently filming in Portugal. His lawyer said he would appeal the verdict.",
      "Depardieu was accused by a set decorator, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, who said the actor grabbed and groped them during filming in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "\"I am deeply moved, I'm very happy with this decision,\" the assistant producer, identified in court only as Am\u00e9lie, said after Tuesday's decision was handed down. \"It is a victory for me, a step forward. Justice was served, I feel.\"",
      "Taking the stand in March for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses, but after the Depardieu published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court in March that Depardieu was diabetic and had undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse in March, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They said they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all.\"",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial on federal charges in New York City. Jury selection began May 5, and 12 jurors were seated\u00a0along with six alternates on Monday, May 12. The selected group included 12 men and six women.",
      "Opening statements immediately followed, and the prosecutors' case against Combs started to take shape.",
      "\"To the public, he was Puff Daddy or Diddy, a cultural icon, a businessman, larger than life. But there was another side to him,\" one prosecutor said.",
      "Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal.",
      "As the trial is underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs is being tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"freak offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"freak off.\" Combs' lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "A jury of 12 jurors and six alternates was sworn in on Monday.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers.",
      "It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",

      "TV, film and media executive Barry Diller spent a decade at ABC, where he helped popularize the made-for-TV \"Movie of the Week.\" In his new memoir, \"Who Knew\" (to be published on May 20 by Simon & Schuster), Diller writes about his career, including a lesson about the limitations of too much information \u2013 when instinct (for, like, what makes an intriguing Movie of the Week?) may be a better predictor of success.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Tracy Smith's interview with Barry Diller on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" May 11!",
      "\"Who Knew\" by Barry Diller",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We were good on titles in the early days",
      "Women in Chains was one of my favorites; it was a horrible movie, but what a promotable title.",
      "Scream, Pretty Peggy wasn't bad, either.",
      "Sometimes the staff would ask, \"Is it commercial?\" and I would brutalize them, because rather than using their instincts, they were trying to predict the public's appetite, which I said then and say now, over and over again, simply isn't possible. Neither is using research to help make decisions. No amount of research on ideas is worth the paper (or computer screen) it's printed on. Data can tell you what has happened, not what can or will happen.\u00a0Data is often harmful to instinct, and I believe this to be true for making not only creative decisions but many business decisions. PowerPoint can be the enemy; structured information often narrows the sieve just when you need to broaden it out in the spaces between information and real understanding. Overtraining our brains on data alone doesn't confer an advantage, and it can be a deterrent if it's the only decision-making component. That's often the problem with MBA students, who come armed with all the business tools and case studies but little simple human instinct. I do not believe that using instinct rather than deep, hard numerical or fact-based data to help with decision-making is the lazier process. Too much information can overload, overcomplicate, and obscure what is at the essence of any proposal: Is it a good idea, and does it make any common sense?",
      "You rarely get the perfect project or the perfect script. In all my experience I probably haven't read ten scripts out of a thousand that are so fully realized, so utterly and incontrovertibly great that you just scream, \"Make it!\" One of those, though, was the day in 1970 that Leonard Goldberg, who had recently moved on from ABC to run a large television production company, called up and said, \"You must read this script right now.\" It was called Brian's Song, the story of the deep bond between a Black and a white pro football player, one who will die of cancer. I wept as I read it. I called him up and said, \"We can only screw it up from here\u2014it's perfect\u2014let's go.\" Often referred to as one of the finest television films ever made\u2014and one of the greatest sports films as well\u2014it was nominated for nine Emmys and won five. Another of those few times, Dan Curtis, a leading ABC daytime producer, sent me a manuscript of an as-yet-unpublished novel called The Kolchak Papers. I read it in two or three hours\u2014it was the contemporary tale of a vampire in Las Vegas\u2014and I told Dan, \"This is as good a story as I've ever read.\" And what a great idea: Las Vegas, a city most alive at night\u2014the perfect place for a vampire to live.",
      "Out of that novel we made The Night Stalker, which turned out to be so good that we held a screening for the senior ABC management, who all said, \"That's a great movie. We should release it theatrically!\" I fought against that, saying, \"Yes, it's a great movie, but it's a Movie of the Week, and that's where it belongs.\" We aired the film in early January 1972, and it became ABC's highest-rated Movie of the Week, drawing about 50 million people, a record. The Night Stalker spawned a sequel (The Night Strangler) and a television series (Kolchak: The Night Stalker), and it was followed by two more made-for-TV movies and a subsequent remake of the series. All that from one good idea!",

    "published": "Sun, 11 May 2025 10:14:20 -0400",
    "summary": "In his combination business memoir and personal journey, the former media exec opens up about topics he had vowed never to talk about, including his early relations with men, as well as his decades-long relationship with designer Diane von Furstenberg.",
    "story": [
      "Last week, a few steps from Manhattan's Little Island, the people enjoying sunshine on the High Line took little notice of the man who helped create this corner of the world, the legendary businessman Barry Diller.",
      "\"When you're up here, even though you're not up very high, you really are elevated, [with] a totally different perspective of the city,\" Diller said.",
      "Talk about different perspectives: At 83, Diller himself is now inviting people to take another look at him. Next week he'll release his memoir, more than ten years in the making. In \"Who Knew\" he names plenty of names, tells wild stories, and bares his soul about things he says he'd vowed never to talk about in public.",
      "In his preface he writes, \"When I was young, I was far too afraid. I'm no longer that. And I'm too old to care.\"",
      "Afraid of what? \"I was afraid of secrets being revealed,\" he said. \"I was afraid of, I thought I didn't qualify. I think, just afraid of revealing myself.\"",
      "Diller says he was in grade school when he first realized he might be gay. \"Eleven or twelve years old, or 13, I got on my bike, and I rode down to the Beverly Hills Public Library. And I looked for books on homosexuality. And everything I read was, like, horrible. And I got on my bike and I rode home and thought, I'm a condemned person. I mean, for a little kid, that's not great.\"",
      "He had his first sexual encounter at age 16. I asked, \"Did you tell your friends? Did you tell anybody about it?\"",
      "\"Of course not! Are you kidding? I didn't tell myself,\" Diller replied. \"I mean, I thought \u2013 oh, what did I think? I thought, Oh, I did that. I don't have to do it again.\"",
      "\"I did this thing with a guy, but that's the end of it?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, I don't need to do that again,\" Diller said. \"And then a month later, I did. And then I knew.\"",
      "But at the time, he thought it best to keep it a secret. He vowed never to lie about it, only to keep it quiet. He writes that, through his life, his sexuality was like an \"anvil on a wire\" hanging over his head. \"Yes, because I was afraid,\" he said. \"Listen, this is in the '60s and '70s. Well, I think probably I was being realistic that, first of all, my sexuality was confused. And I thought, Well, if I reveal it, what am I actually gonna reveal?",
      "\"I didn't want to risk what a lot of other people had risked, even at that time. I mean, talking about homosexuality, talking about bi-, whatever sexuality is, was something that scared the hell out of me,\" he said.",
      "In private, Diller lived in fear of being found out, but in public he was one of the gutsiest leaders in the game. As a junior executive at ABC, he pioneered the highly-successful movie of the week, and later created the even-more successful TV miniseries, with landmark events such as \"Roots.\"",
      "When \"Roots\" first aired in 1977, more than half the U.S. population tuned in. \"You really were having 30 to 40 to 50,000,000 people watching at one time, 'cause there was of course no recorder,\" he said. \"It was appointment viewing. And everyone in America came to the appointment.\"",
      "And then, the man who conquered TV went to the movies, becoming, at age 32, head of Paramount.",
      "Did he feel like he belonged? \"Oh my God, no,\" he said. \"When I became chairman of Paramount \u2013 and I was this kid from television, of all things \u2013 it was like, 'How in God's name did that happen? That is an accident of history that will be quickly corrected.'\"",
      "But the kid from TV knew how to tell a good story, and gave the green light to a string of films that have since become classics, like 1977's \"Saturday Night Fever.\"",
      "It was during those early days at Paramount that Diller met fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. Interestingly, they didn't click at first. \"Yeah, the first time I met her, I never wanted to see her again, 'cause she was dismissive of me and whatever,\" he said. \"But then, the second time that we met, which was a few months later, within minutes, it was pure desire.\"",
      "\"It was a steamy romance,\" I said.",
      "\"Yes. Oh, yes, it was those things.\"",
      "\"And you make it clear \u2013 I mean, I'll just put it out there \u2013 your relationship with Diane is not just platonic.\"",
      "\"No. No. It didn't start that, no, no, no, no.\"",
      "\"You're lovers.\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"It seems to me like one of the points you're trying to make in the book is that it doesn't have to be a mutually-exclusive thing \u2013 that you can be in love with Diane and, at the same time, be attracted to men?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Diller. \"I don't see anything mutually exclusive with that, no. I mean, other people may, but I don't. If I know that the person cares about me, I'm not jealous of anything else. So, that's just luck, I guess.\"",
      "Diller says he owes much of his professional success to luck as well. And he has had a lot of it: In the '80s, as the chairman of Fox, he created a fourth TV network, Homer Simpson and all.",
      "Asked if he gets bored by success, Diller replied, \"Yes, definitely. I mean, once it's there, what are you going to do with it?\"",
      "In the '90s, Diller switched gears again, investing in home shopping, and eventually scooping up a bunch of internet businesses that became household names, like Expedia and Match.com.",
      "And in-between, he and Furstenberg helped create the High Line, donating their time and tens of millions of dollars. \"It doesn't cure cancer,\" he said. \"It's not going to change the dynamics of the world, eradicate disease, or whatever. But it brings pleasure to people.\"",
      "He says he has a similar goal with this book: to share a good story. And that means telling the truth \u2013 to finally let go of a secret he's been holding onto for a lifetime.",
      "I asked, \"You do touch on these feelings of, Maybe I was wrong?\"",
      "\"I don't know that I was wrong about not talking about my private life; I think I was a coward,\" Diller said. \"And I don't like that. But that is the truth. I was. I did not have \u2013 and I wish I did \u2013 I did not have the courage, at that time, to make declarations.\"",
      "\"Does that weigh on you?\"",
      "\"I wouldn't call it weighing on me,\" he said, \"but it is something that, of course, I've thought \u2026\"\u00a0 He paused. \"But it didn't turn out so terribly.\"",
      "The same might be said of his personal life, too: Diller and von Furstenberg were married in 2001, and they're as strong as ever.",
      "He calls his relationship with her the bedrock of his life. \"Well, I don't know any better description than bedrock,\" Diller said. \"The best times for us are when it's just us. And after almost 50 years, how lucky do you get?\"",

      "On a quiet plot of land in rural New Mexico, Jeff Deming feels like he's really living, once again.",
      "\"Mentally, it's day and night,\" he said.",
      "He's able to do the things that make him happy, like woodworking, despite living with Parkinson's Disease.",
      "\"Physically, I feel better than I did 2-3 years ago,\" he said.",
      "Deming credits the treatment he received during a first-of-its-kind clinical study he participated in at the University of California, San Francisco: Psilocybin therapy for people with Parkinson's Disease.",
      "\"This is very clich\u00e9, but it truly gave me my life back,\" he said.",
      "Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in 'magic mushrooms.' When administered in controlled, clinical research settings, it has shown promise in treating depression and anxiety, both of which are mood symptoms associated with Parkinson's that are linked to a faster physical decline.",
      "\"The neurodegeneration that is happening isn't just impacting motor circuitry \u2013 it's impacting a lot of brain circuitry. That creates this huge burden of symptoms that we often overlook and don't talk about enough, maybe,\" said Dr. Ellen Bradley, of UCSF. \"We were really surprised by how well this trial went.\"",
      "Bradley and a team of researchers at UCSF are trying to figure out how Psilocybin may help treat mood dysfunction and more in those living with the neurodegenerative disease.",
      "\"This is a first step, and now we've opened the door to being able to really investigate the effects of Psilocybin for people with Parkinson's,\" she said.",
      "12 patients participated in this first-round study, which involved a first and second course of Psilocybin treatment.",
      "\"We had folks do a lower dose of Psilocybin \u2013 a 10 mg dose initially \u2013 and monitored them for a couple of weeks to see how that went,\" Bradley said. \"If it did go well, if we didn't have safety concerns, then they were eligible for the full therapeutic dose of 25 mg.\"",
      "All 12 patients were able to complete both courses of treatment without reporting any serious side effects, according to Bradley.",
      "\"We want to find out not just does Psilocybin therapy work, but if it does, how does it work? That mechanistic piece is so important,\" she said. \"Can it change the brain's ability to adapt to its environment and to rewire itself?\"",
      "While there were no serious adverse effects reported, every patient didn't have the same life-changing experience as Deming says he experienced. Though many did report their motor and cognitive functions improved afterwards, per Bradley.",
      "\"We don't have a reason to believe that this is a treatment that is going to be a good fit for every patient. That is never really our expectation in medicine. But our goal is to figure out when is it the right treatment and how much for which patient,\" Bradley said.",
      "Bradley says her team is scaling up their work and are in the process of recruiting for a larger study, due to the success with the initial research.",
      "\"That was really exciting just to see that promising safety profile in this initial pilot. That kind of gives us a green light to go forward with more in-depth research,\" she said. \"We really desperately need new treatments for Parkinson's. It's a very quickly growing disease that's becoming more and more prevalent in our population, so, we really feel like we have to be investigating every possible route that could mean new treatments for patients.\"",
      "Two years removed from his controlled Psilocybin dosing, Deming says he feels better now than he did when he received his initial diagnosis four years ago.",
      "\"Something about this experience just freed everything back up so I could think again, I could dream again,\" he said.",
      "He'd like to see more research into psychedelic therapies for a range of conditions, with the hopes that more people will be able to reclaim the reins of life, as he has.",

    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 16:34:13 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump is now seeking to implement the idea through an executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats and the Biden administration dropped plans to set drug price caps based on the amount paid in other high-income countries, during talks years ago to push through the law that empowered Medicare to negotiate down the cost of prescription medications.",
      "A version of the idea was revived by President Trump in the executive order signed Monday, which called on the Department of Health and Human Services next month to draw up regulations to impose price restrictions tied to lower amounts paid in other developed nations, if drugmakers did not voluntarily reduce what they were charging in the U.S.",
      "\"Democrats could have done this a long time ago. They have fought like hell, for the drug companies. And they knew they were doing the wrong thing,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking at a White House event to announce the move.",
      "For Democrats on Capitol Hill, this kind of approach to price controls has roots in a bill their own party successfully passed under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.",
      "As part of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate the price of costly drugs it covered, the bill passed by House Democrats wanted the maximum price to be tied to an average based on prices paid in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.",
      "\"We were hoping to get Trump. Trump said, 'I want to negotiate.' But then Republicans in Congress got to him,\" said Wendell Primus, who served for nearly two decades as Pelosi's top aide on health policy.",
      "The bill did not make it through the Senate at the time, which was controlled by Mr. Trump's party. After Democrats flipped control of the Senate, the idea ran into headwinds years later, as Biden aides and lawmakers tried to incorporate the measure into the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Multiple Democrats involved in the talks on Capitol Hill at the time blamed a series of meetings in early 2021 with the staff from the Senate Finance Committee and party leadership for scuttling the idea.",
      "Staff on the committee said that they were worried that moderate Democrats like then-Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would not support the bill if it included the measure, Primus said. Menendez and Sinema are no longer in the Senate.",
      "\"Members did not want to have something referencing foreign countries. They wanted it to make a function of the manufacturer's price here, what drug companies were offering to commercial insurers,\" Primus said.",
      "One former Biden White House aide involved in the talks said that there were several senators who understood that drug prices were too high, but they worried those price caps could undercut innovation from drugmakers in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the deal struck by lawmakers and White House aides to pass the law in 2022 ultimately turned to a different formula: capping them using calculations based on the price previously paid by Medicare and a fixed discount off the list price in the private U.S. market.",
      "\"President Biden and Democrats in Congress cared about getting something done, and so there was a compromise on the table that wasn't perfect, but it was going to make a huge amount of difference. And so that's the law they ultimately enacted,\" said Christen Linke-Young, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Mr. Biden.",
      "Medicare has gone on to implement the law, resulting in talks that are continuing under the current Trump administration to lower the maximum price that the federal insurance program will pay for a growing list of costly drugs.",
      "\"It's a good thing for prescription drug costs in this country to be lower, we need to continue to work on that. And one of the ways to do that is actually put a proposal before Congress and get it enacted, so it has the force of law,\" said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, as the White House was working with their allies in Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration moved to formally scrap a bid by Mr. Trump to impose caps tied to lower prices in other high-income countries using executive power during his first term.",
      "Called the \"most favored nation\" model, Trump officials had directed Medicare to only reimburse hospitals and clinics for some costly drugs based on the lowest price paid for in other high-income countries.",
      "CMS under Mr. Biden ultimately rescinded that move in 2022, after a legal fight that had blocked the proposal on the grounds that the Trump administration had unlawfully shortcutted the normal rulemaking steps to finalize the policy.",
      "\"The proposal was always pretty transparently illegal. The statute says that Medicare has to pay for prescription drugs in one particular way, and the Trump administration proposal was that we are going to ignore the statute and pay for drugs in an entirely different way. If the statute allowed that, a president before Donald Trump would have done it,\" Linke-Young said.",
      "A White House official under Mr. Trump disagreed with the accusation that their initial proposal was unlawful, arguing that the initial authority they used for the \"demonstration\" model in Medicare used powers that were broadly written by Democrats.",
      "While they are not planning to go down the exact same path, the official said, saying that they \"learned certain things from that first demonstration,\" the Trump administration believes they \"absolutely have that authority in our pocket.\"",
      "\"We are confident that we have authorities within our government programs to do this. And any dispute from the Biden administration is an intentional misinterpretation of the statute for political reasons, because they are the ones that walked away,\" the White House official said.",
      "Trump administration officials have painted their second run at the \"most favored nation\" idea as even broader in scope than their first term, which had been limited to only some costly drugs administered by healthcare providers through Medicare Part B.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday that they \"firmly believe\" they have the ability to pursue wider actions to push drugmakers to lower their prices within Medicare. They cited other authorities in the law being considered like section 402, which affords HHS powers to \"develop and engage in experiments\" which could affect payment rates in Medicaid as well.",
      "Asked this week on Fox Business Network whether the president's promise of steep drug price cuts would also extend to Medicare Part D, which covers the broad swath of prescriptions filled at drug store pharmacies, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said \"they absolutely will.\"",
      "\"They'll apply to Medicare, and they'll apply in the private market as well,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Asked Tuesday whether he supported the president's plan, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he thought \"it'll be the subject of probably multiple lawsuits, and I think the courts will probably have something to say about it.\"",

The Trump Administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters, and under the Secretary's leadership, NIOSH's essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations,\" HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email.",
      "A handful of NIOSH staff working in the agency's World Trade Center Health Program previously had their layoffs reversed, after a second round of cuts at the agency earlier this month.",
      "\"While we celebrate with those who received a rescission letter from HHS, I am mindful that others did not. I am hopeful that we can continue to make the case for reinstating everyone at NIOSH,\" the agency's now-reinstated director, Dr. John Howard, wrote in the email.",
      "The reinstatements mean that some NIOSH programs might soon be able to resume, after they were previously hobbled by the layoffs.",
      "For example, the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory had been forced to suspend new approvals of equipment like new N95 respirators and protective gear for firefighters after the initial round of cuts on April 1. Investigations of workplace health risks through NIOSH's Health Hazard Evaluation program were also upended by the layoffs, but staff working in those probes have now been reinstated.",
      "But many workers also remain effectively laid-off at the wide-ranging agency, which functions as the research and testing counterpart to the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration.",
      "In NIOSH's Spokane and Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, laid-off scientists and engineers were called back to work, but only for a few more weeks to wind down their laboratories and research before their layoff notices take effect. Those NIOSH employees have not received letters formally rescinding their layoffs, unlike some of their colleagues.",
      "Part of their work includes overseeing miner safety programs like the personal dust monitors, or PDM, required by the Department of Labor for coal miners. NIOSH is responsible for testing PDM's accuracy. The monitors are needed to reduce the risk of black lung disease.",
      "NIOSH had also been in the process of developing similar monitors for miners exposed to silica dust, before the layoffs gutted the teams overseeing that work.",
      "Other NIOSH teams like the Health Effects Laboratory Division were also not listed among the reinstatements.",
      "Other parts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which currently houses NIOSH, also remain off the job, despite calls from states and lawmakers for their reinstatements. HHS previously said it was planning on moving what remained of NIOSH into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "Among the CDC scientists still laid-off include the agency's laboratories for investigating STD and viral hepatitis, which upended work helping states investigate outbreaks. Staff in the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for a range of issues including lead poisoning and cruise ship outbreaks, also have not been reinstated.",
      "Other workers who have been promised by their supervisors that they would be reinstated elsewhere at HHS have also so far not received notices, like at the Food and Drug Administration's drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit.",
      "While their counterparts at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco were reinstated, multiple scientists in those labs said they had yet to receive formal written notices revoking their layoffs, weeks after they were told they would be reinstated.",

    "story": [
      "There were 30,000 fewer U.S. drug overdose deaths in 2024 than the year before \u2014 the largest one-year decline ever recorded. An estimated 80,000 people died from overdoses last year, according to provisional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released Wednesday. That's down 27% from 110,000 in 2023.",
      "Still, annual overdose deaths are higher than they were before the COVID-19 pandemic. In a statement, the CDC noted that overdoses are still the leading cause of death for people 18-44 years old, \"underscoring the need for ongoing efforts to maintain this progress.\"",
      "Some experts worry the recent decline could be slowed or stopped by reductions in federal funding and the public health workforce, or a shift away from the strategies that seem to be working.",
      "\"Now is not the time to take the foot off the gas pedal,\" said Dr. Daniel Ciccarone, a drug policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco.",
      "The CDC has been collecting comparable data for 45 years. The previous largest one-year drop was 4% in 2018, according to the agency's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "All but two states saw declines last year \u2014 with some of the biggest in Ohio, West Virginia and other states that have been hard-hit in the nation's decades-long overdose epidemic. Experts say more research needs to be done to understand what drove the reduction, but they mention several possible factors. Among the most cited:",
      "Increased availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone.Expanded addiction treatment.Shifts in how people use drugs.The growing impact of billions of dollars in opioid lawsuit settlement money.The number of at-risk Americans is shrinking, after waves of deaths in older adults and a shift in teens and younger adults away from the drugs that cause most deaths.",

      "The number of at-risk Americans is shrinking, after waves of deaths in older adults and a shift in teens and younger adults away from the drugs that cause most deaths.",
      "The provisional numbers are estimates of everyone who died of overdoses in the U.S., including noncitizens. That data is still being processed, and the final numbers can sometimes differ a bit. But it's clear that there was a huge drop last year.",
      "A CDC report late last year showed that overdose deaths in the U.S. fell 17% between July 2023 and July 2024 \u2014 credited in part to wider naloxone access. Naloxone, also sold under the brand name Narcan,  was made\u00a0available for over-the-counter purchase\u00a0in 2023 and is\u00a0standard for first responders\u00a0to carry. It's even popped up\u00a0in some classrooms.",
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting a $56 million grant that teaches first responders how to use the lifesaving overdose reversal drug naloxone, which experts have previously said could reverse progress the U.S. has made in lowering opioid overdose deaths.",
      "The grant money can be used by state and local organizations for training people on how to use naloxone, as well as administering and distributing the medication. The grant is administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
      "Experts note that there have been past moments when U.S. overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go down, only to rise again. That happened in 2018.",
      "But there are reasons to be optimistic.",
      "Drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacy chains and other businesses have settled lawsuits with state and local governments over the painkillers that were a main driver of overdose deaths in the past. The deals over the last decade or so have promised about $50 billion over time, with most of it required to be used to fight addiction.",
      "Another settlement that would be among the largest, with members of the Sackler family who own OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma agreeing to pay up to $7 billion, could be approved this year.",
      "The money, along with federal taxpayer funding, is going to a variety of programs, including supportive housing and harm reduction efforts, such as providing materials to test drugs for fentanyl, the biggest driver of overdoses now.",
      "But what each state will do with that money is currently at issue. \"States can either say, 'We won, we can walk away'\" in the wake of the declines or they can use the lawsuit money on naloxone and other efforts, said Regina LaBelle, a former acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. She now heads an addiction and public policy program at Georgetown University.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration views opioids as largely a law enforcement issue and as a reason to step up border security. That worries many public health leaders and advocates.",
      "\"We believe that taking a public health approach that seeks to support \u2014 not punish \u2014 people who use drugs is crucial to ending the overdose crisis,\" said Dr. Tamara Olt, an Illinois woman whose 16-year-old son died of a heroin overdose in 2012. She is now executive director of Broken No Moore, an advocacy organization focused on substance use disorder.",
      "Olt attributes recent declines to the growing availability of naloxone, work to make treatment available, and wider awareness of the problem.",

      "Dick's said Thursday that it expects to run Foot Locker as a standalone unit and keep the Foot Locker brands, which include Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS and Japanese sneaker brand atmos.",
      "\"Sports and sports culture continue to be incredibly powerful, and with this acquisition, we'll create a new global platform that serves those ever evolving needs through iconic concepts consumers know and love, enhanced store designs and omnichannel experiences, as well as a product mix that appeals to our different customer bases,\" Dick's CEO Lauren Hobart said in a statement.",
      "Skechers announced that it was being taken private earlier this month by the investment firm by 3G Capital in a transaction worth more than $9 billion.",
      "Foot Locker shareholders can choose to receive either $24 in cash or 0.1168 shares of Dick's common stock for each Foot Locker share that they own.",
      "The footwear industry has been growing increasingly concerned over Mr. Trump's trade war with other countries, particularly China. Athletic shoe makers have invested heavily in production in Asia.",
      "Fool Locker's stock price down 40%",
      "Shares of sporting goods and athletic shoe companies have been under pressure all year. Foot Locker's stock price has tumbled more than 40% this year. The company's shares surged $10.78, or nearly 84%, to $23.65 before the start of trade on Thursday.",
      "About 97% of the clothes and shoes purchased in the U.S. are imported, predominantly from Asia, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Using factories overseas has kept labor costs down for U.S. companies, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb price increases due to new tariffs.",
      "Foot Locker offers Dick's a lot of potential, namely its huge real estate footprint, and would give the Pittsburgh company its first foothold overseas.",
      "\"The addition of Foot Locker, with its 4.3% share of the sporting goods market, would produce an immediate boost,\" retail industry analysts Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, said in an email. \"It would also give Dick's substantially more bargaining power with national brands, especially in the sneaker space. As the chains operate in a similar segment there would also likely be scope for synergistic savings.\"",

      "Flying can be a hassle even under the best of circumstances. When trips are marred by delays, cancellations and mishandled luggage, air travel can become a nightmare.",
      "In 2024, customers lodged a record 66,675 complaints against U.S. airlines, according to a new report from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy group, based on data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. Passenger complaints have surged since the pandemic, rising every year since 2021, according to PIRG.",
      "\"When you file a complaint, the DOT asks if you talked to airline, so it's not like the DOT complaint line is your first stop,\" U.S. PIRG consumer watchdog director Teresa Murray told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When people try to get their money back and the airline hasn't done it, that's when people file complaints.\"",
      "For example, some customers sought refunds they were due related to flight cancellations or delays, while others sought reimbursement they were owed for lost or damaged piece of luggage. Airlines now face added pressure under new rules\u00a0adopted in 2024 that require them to provide automatic refunds to customers when their flights are canceled or significantly delayed.",
      "Pandemic impacft",
      "Prior to 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in the U.S., annual complaints against all airlines hovered below 20,000. That year, they jumped to more than 102,000 during what was a catastrophic period for air carriers, given travel restrictions and plummeting demand for flying. Airlines struggled to ramp capacity back up in 2021 and 2022, resulting in plenty of cancellations and delays.",
      "At the top 10 U.S. airlines, cancellations rose from 1.28% of flights in 2023 to 1.36% last year, resulting in a total of 102,908 canceled flights in 2024, according to the report. Delays also worsened, with 78.1% of flights arriving on time last year, down from 78.3% in 2023. In total, roughly 1.7 million flights were either delayed or canceled in 2024.",
      "Nationwide air traffic controller shortages could lead to more snarls in schedules for the remainder of 2025, PIRG said.",
      "One relative bright spot in the report: Airlines mishandled fewer bags and wheelchairs in 2024 compared to the previous year. While that showed some modest improvement, 2.7 million bags were still lost or damaged, as were 11,357 wheelchairs and scooters.",
      "The carrier with the highest rate of complaints per 100,000 passengers: Frontier Airlines, which had the worst cancellation record, worst record for on-time arrivals and worst record for involuntary bumping, PIRG found.

    "summary": "Expired sales labels led to overcharges on more than 150 grocery items, according to an investigation led by Consumer Reports and others.",
    "story": [
      "Kroger shoppers might be paying more at checkout than they bargained for.",
      "A new investigation\u00a0found price tag errors at the supermarket giant's stores leading to customers being overcharged on many items marked as discounted or on sale. Expired discount tags were found on everyday products ranging from Cheerios cereal to Nescaf\u00e9 instant coffee, according to an investigation by Consumer Reports, The Guardian and the Food & Environment Reporting Network (FERN).",
      "The probe stems from allegations made by Kroger employees in Colorado who are currently in labor negotiations with the supermarket chain.",
      "\"People should pay the price that is being advertised, that's the law,\" Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate and former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts, who runs the Consumer World website, told Consumer Reports. \"The issue here is that shoppers can't rely on the shelf price being accurate, and that's a big problem.\"",
      "Kroger operates roughly 2,700 stores throughout the U.S., according to the company's\u00a0website, and owns a suite of supermarkets that includes Harris Teeter, Fred Meyer, Fry's and Ralphs.",
      "To conduct the investigation, Consumer Reports, The Guardian and FERN recruited people to shop at more than two dozen Kroger and Kroger-owned stores in 14 states and the District of Columbia over a roughly three-month period this year.",
      "The investigation found that expired sales labels led to overcharges on more than 150 grocery items, with an average overcharge of $1.70 per item, or 18.4%. For instance, a bag of Mission Flour Tortillas at a Harris Teeter in Alexandria, Virginia, was advertised as on sale for $2.99, while customers were charged $4.99.",
      "Although pricing mistakes were not found at all the Kroger stores in the investigation, the probe found issues at over half of the 26 locations it examined.",
      "Kroger took issue with the findings, saying the investigation greatly overstates the pricing issues.",
      "The \"characterization of widespread pricing concerns is patently false,\" a Kroger spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, adding that the errors cited by the investigators represented only a \"few dozen examples across several years out of billions of customer transactions annually.\"",
      "Although Consumer Price Index\u00a0data shows\u00a0the rate of inflation and grocery prices eased last month, Americans continue to face higher\u00a0costs for household goods.",
      "\"Even if the incidents are careless rather than calculated, it creates a perception that Kroger is ripping people off,\" said Neil Saunders, an analyst with retail industry research firm GlobalData in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not what any grocery retailer wants or needs when the consumer is looking to maximize value for money.\"",
      "Kroger not alone in overcharging claims",
      "The overcharging problem is not unique to Kroger: Retailers like Walmart, Safeway, Albertsons and Vons have\u00a0been hit with similar allegations.",
      "Grocery giant Albertsons in October agreed to pay $4 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the California chain of selling items for more than their lowest advertised price.",
      "But the Kroger case stand out for several reasons said Derek Kravitz, an investigative journalist and author of the Consumer Reports story. One is that in states in the Midwest and the South, where the retailer has a strong foothold, Kroger is often one of just a few places to choose from for grocery shopping.",
      "Kravitz also pointed to the persistent flow of complaints from Kroger customers over out-of-date sales prices, dating back to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Ohio, for example, the attorney general's office has received nearly 60 complaints of price tag and overcharge issues at Kroger since 2021.",
      "\"Almost every single time I go in the store, the listed price of an item is NOT what rings up at the register,\" Belpre resident Allison Hadfield noted in one of three complaints she and her husband, Derek, filed against their local Kroger store, according to Consumer Reports.",
      "In addition to individual complaints, customers have also filed multiple class-action lawsuits alleging pricing errors at Kroger locations, with cases ongoing in California, Ohio and Illinois, according to The Guardian.",
      "Kroger said it has taken steps to fix price discrepancies. That includes instituting a policy that gives employees the authority to fix price problems on the spot.",
      "\"Kroger is committed to affordable and accurate pricing, and we conduct robust price check processes that reviews millions of items weekly to ensure our shelf prices are accurate,\" a spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Potential staffing issues",
      "Between 2019 and 2024, the average number of employees at the Kroger-owned stores that the researchers focused on fell by 10.3%, or 17 employees per store, according to the report, which cites data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The average number of hours worked also fell by 2.7 hours per week.",

    "summary": "A new Uber service will operate shuttles in select cities along set routes, offering pickups every 20 minutes.",
    "story": [
      "Uber is introducing a new feature that the ride-share company says can cost half as much as traditional fares and that might remind some users of taking the bus.",
      "Called \"Route Share,\" the new service resembles public transportation in that it will operate Uber shuttles along busy routes, offering pickups every 20 minutes.",
      "Route Share is available during weekday commuting hours, and passengers can ride with up to two other people. It's half the cost of an UberX, Uber said in an announcement Wednesday. The costs of traditional Uber rides vary based on the location and duration of the trip.",
      "Uber also said it's looking to partner with employers to make Route Share eligible for commuter benefits, offering customers more savings when they spend their pre-tax dollars on rides.",
      "Uber's new service also caters to riders who live and work in highly populated areas and expands on an existing service that lets riders share cars with strangers in exchange for a lower fare.",
      "Here's how Route Share works. When you hail a ride, users are instructed to walk to a pre-determined point at a set time. The Uber vehicle will travel along a fixed route, and other riders may join the trip.",
      "Your ride could include a seven-minute walk to a pick-up point, a 20-minute drive and a five-minute walk to the eventual end point. It can cost up to 50% less than a traditional UberX rider, Uber said at an event announcing several new products.",
      "Route Share is launching on Wednesday in select cities, including New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, Boston and Baltimore. Shuttles will run from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.",
      "What is Price Lock?",
      "Uber is also launching another feature aimed at reducing costs for regular commuters. \"Price Lock\" lets customers choose a fixed price for a specific route, so the costs of a ride won't fluctuate based on traffic, weather or demand on a particular day, according to Uber.\u00a0It costs $2.99 per month, and can lead to savings of up to $50 a month, the company said.",
      "Ride-sharing rival Lyft offers a similar product, which it launched in September 2024. Lyft at the time said its Price Lock option addressed the issue of fluctuating prices.",
      "Uber served 175 million customers across 70 countries last year, according to the company. Sixty percent of those customers have household incomes of less than $75,000, according to the company.",
      "\"The reality is, for a lot of our customers, Uber is a daily necessity,\" Uber's chief product officer Sachin Kansal said at the product event Wednesday. \"These are regular commuters, who are working really hard \u2014 they're just going to work. They don't have access to a car. They are not close to a transit stop. They are shift workers, so they have to get to work on time and they are using Uber for that.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 13:35:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The bottom 60% of U.S. households don't make enough money to afford a \"minimal quality of life,\" according to a new analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The gap between what Americans earn and how much they need to bring in to achieve a basic standard of living is growing, according to a new report.",
      "The analysis, from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP), looks beyond whether people can afford daily necessities like food and shelter to consider whether they have the means to pay for things like the technology tools necessary for work, higher education, and health and child care costs.",
      "In tracking costs associated with what the group calls a \"basket of American dream essentials,\" LISEP says its Minimal Quality of Life index provides a truer picture of how Americans are faring than standard economic data, such as the nation's gross domestic product and jobless rate. The index captures the annual change in the typical costs facing low- and moderate-income households who are looking to maintain a basic quality of life.",
      "\"We analyze these components not just in terms of financial figures but as crucial elements that shape a family's capability to achieve a desirable standard of living,\" the group explains in a paper describing its approach.",
      "The findings? For the bottom 60% of U.S. households, a \"minimal quality of life\" is out of reach, according to the group, a research organization focused on improving lower earners' economic well-being.",
      "\"The middle class has been declining \u2014 we just haven't recognized it fully,\" LISEP Chairman Gene Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's really dangerous because it's the kind of thing that leads to social unrest, and it's not fair. The American dream is not that it's given to you \u2014 it's that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead and achieve the things in life that you want to achieve. It's not living in a tent, not having to steal.\"",
      "Peering beneath the surface",
      "By those standards, the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short, according to LISEP. These households, which in 2023 earned an average of $38,000 per year, would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "\"Traditional headline economic indicators like GDP and unemployment tell us the economy is thriving, but they don't reflect the lived reality of most Americans,\" Ludwig said in a statement. \"Americans are working harder than ever, fueling our economic growth, but the benefits of that hard work are not being distributed in a way that supports upward mobility for too many middle- and low-income Americans.\"",
      "From 2001 to 2023, the cost of affording what amounts to a basic level of economic security doubled, according to LISEP's analysis. Housing and health care costs surged, while the amount of savings required to attend an in-state, public university soared 122%.",
      "Meanwhile, median earnings for the bottom 60% of income earners fell 4% over that span when adjusting for the cost of goods tracked by the group's index, according to LISEP. Income growth for these households has also lagged, rising 0.37% per year during the same period \u2014 less than half as much as for the top 40% of earners, the group found.",
      "The gap between how much low-income families earn and how much they need to afford a minimum cost of living is expected to keep widening, Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Unfortunately, it is growing because the items that go into the basket of goods and services that make the minimal quality of life are inflating at a higher rate than wages are inflating,\" he said.",

    "summary": "A Republican-backed House bill includes a range new tax breaks, including a $4,000 deduction for seniors. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "As a Republican-backed bill moves ahead in the House, proposed tax cuts under the measure include some new and surprising changes that could impact the wallets of millions of Americans.",
      "On Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of the bill, which would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other reductions.",
      "The extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions would mean that most taxpayers wouldn't see much of a change because their tax brackets would remain at the same levels they've been at since the cuts took effect in 2018. Without an extension, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "Aside from extending the 2017 tax cuts, the proposed bill would provide taxpayers with an average $1,300 tax reduction, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. Some of the additional tax cuts include those promised on the campaign trail by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on overtime pay, as well as new provisions that would lower taxes for senior citizens and parents.",
      "The proposed bill is likely to change as it moves through the legislative process, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, aiming to send it to the Senate by Memorial Day. Democratic lawmakers have opposed the bill for its proposed cuts to Medicaid\u00a0and food stamps, part of the GOP's goal to find $880 billion in savings to help pay for the tax cuts.",
      "Some Democrats also pointed out that some of the tax cuts promised by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on tips, would expire after 2028, limiting the benefits.",
      "\"[T]hey made provisions like addressing taxes on tips and overtime pay temporary, as opposed to the cuts for the richest 1%, which they made permanent,\" said Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, in a statement.",
      "Still, the bill released Wednesday by the House's tax panel provides a laundry list of tax breaks that could soon become law. Here's what the legislation would do:",
      "Adds a new $4,000 deduction for people 65 and older",
      "Senior citizens who are 65 and older would get a new tax benefit \u2014 an extra deduction of $4,000 per filer.",
      "The new deduction could be used by people who either itemize or take the standard deduction. But there would be an income limit, with the $4,000 deduction available for people with a modified adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for single filers and $150,000 for married couples who file joint returns.",
      "The tax break would be available starting in the current 2025 tax year and extend through 2028.",
      "By contrast, for seniors the latest version of the House bill has one notable omission: There's no plan to eliminate taxes on Social Security income, as Mr. Trump promised in his campaign.",
      "Proposing to scrap income taxes on Social Security proved controversial because those taxes directly fund the retirement program. That would likely hasten the\u00a0insolvency of its trust funds, policy experts have warned.",
      "Increases the standard deduction for all taxpayers",
      "The current standard deduction, which was expanded under the 2017 tax bill, is set to expire on Dec. 31. The House GOP bill would make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's bigger deduction permanent, as well as give it a boost.",
      "Starting in the current 2025 tax year through 2028, here's how the standard deduction would increase:",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000",
      "Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000",
      "Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "The standard deduction reduces your tax liability because it lowers your taxable income by that amount. For instance, single taxpayers earning $50,000 would reduce their taxable income to $34,000 for the 2025 tax year under the proposed standard deduction.",
      "Extends and increases the Child Tax Credit",
      "The House bill also extends the $2,000 Child Tax Credit, which otherwise would revert to its pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act level of $1,000 per eligible child starting in 2026. That change would be permanent, the House Ways and Means Committee said.",
      "The proposal would also increase the Child Tax Credit to $2,500 per child for the current 2025 tax year through 2028, after which it would drop back to $2,000.",
      "Eliminates the 1099-K reporting rule",
      "The proposed legislation would also abolish a\u00a0controversial rule that would have required payment platforms like Venmo or Paypal to send 1099-K tax forms to anyone receiving over $600.",
      "Previously, such payment services only had to report users' income to the Internal Revenue Service if they had more than 200 transactions, exceeding $20,000 in revenue. The IRS had delayed the implementation of the $600 rule after pushback from some online platforms as well as from Republican lawmakers.",
      "Increases the pass-through deduction for small businesses",
      "The pass-through deduction for small businesses, which was enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, also would increase under the House bill.",
      "The deduction allows small businesses, including partnerships, sole proprietorships (who are often gig workers) and S corporations, to subtract 20% of their qualified business income from their taxes, lowering their tax liability. Under the new bill, the deduction would rise to 23%.",
      "Eliminates taxes on tips",
      "This follows Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to eliminate taxes on tipped income, but it would apply only from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "The provision would create \"an above-the-line deduction for qualified tips received by an individual in an occupation which traditionally and customarily receives tips during a given taxable year,\" according to a summary of the bill from the House Ways and Means Committee.",
      "Eliminates taxes on overtime pay",
      "Another proposal from Mr. Trump \u2014 to eliminate taxes on eligible workers' overtime pay \u2014 would also become a reality, but only for three years.",
      "Under the House bill, an above-the-line deduction for OT would be created from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "Allow car loan interest to be deducted",
      "The House bill would also eliminate taxes on car loan interest by allowing consumers to deduct up to $10,000 for interest paid on vehicle loans.",
      "This would have an income limit, phasing out for taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income above $100,000 for single filers or $200,000 for married couples. Vehicles must have been assembled in the U.S. to qualify for the deduction.",

China meanwhile, has agreed to cut its tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "President Trump also recently announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom. Britain says the deal will cut tariffs on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum. As part of the agreement, a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff.",
      "Still,\u00a0uncertainty reigns. With that in mind, CBS News spoke with shopping expert Trae Bodge, who shared the following tips for consumers who are looking to avoid any added strain on their already strained household budgets.",
      "Look for sales: Start at the sales rack",
      "With summer fast approaching, retailers are likely to advertise Memorial Day sales. Official Memorial Day sales tend to start the weekend before Memorial Day. However, many retailers, including Lands' End and DreamCloud mattresses, have started hosting sales as early as the beginning of May.",
      "Father's Day and July 4th sales, along with Amazon Prime Day-scheduled for July, also offer shoppers opportunities to secure discounted retail prices on a range of goods and appliances.",
      "Check where products are from",
      "Not all goods are impacted equally by the tariffs. There is currently a 25% tariff on goods from\u00a0Canada and Mexico. However, certain products under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) are exempt. Under the USMCA, most goods traded between the U.S., Mexico and Canada are exempt from tariffs, as long as they meet rules of origin requirements-meaning the product must be made primarily in North America.",
      "Canadian cosmetics company Lush, for example, does not have tariffs on its products.",
      "Purchase domestic products",
      "Certain produce \u2014 including tomatoes, bell peppers and cucumbers imported from Mexico \u2014 could see price hikes over the coming months. Shoppers should turn to domestically produced staples, like apples, potatoes and oranges to avoid price hikes.",
      "Toilet paper is one item that shoppers shouldn't be worried about. According to the North Carolina State's College of Natural Resources, roughly 99% of toilet paper Americans use is made in the United States.",
      "What items will be hit hardest?",
      "Electronics and toys are the most likely to be hit the hardest by tariffs. 80% of toys are imported from China and toy maker Mattel has already warned of increasing prices. Overall, shoppers should consider whether an item is worth purchasing, especially if price hikes are coming.",
      "According to Trae Bodge, shoppers shouldn't panic shop. Instead, they should consider what items they were already planning on purchasing and possibly move the purchasing timeline up. \"So, if your dishwasher is on its last legs and you were thinking about getting one anyway \u2014 or your car, your laptop \u2014 those are the things that I would think about getting now,\" said Bodge. \"But, again, not in a panic.\""

      "Christmas is Jesusdoll.com's biggest retail season, and Mauro had feared not having products in stock to sell to U.S. customers this year. With sky-high tariffs in place, he had paused shipments from China, and had containers of goods waiting in limbo overseas.",

So we're going to be able to have products to be able to sell this Christmas, and that's huge for us and it's huge for our retailers, who were on the verge of not having any product at all,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Although a 30% tariff on Chinese imports is still \"painful,\" Mauro said, it at least won't prohibit him from doing business. He's importing about $100,000 worth of dolls, which he hopes will arrive within the 90-day period during which the tariff rate is slated to be reduced.",

    "story": [
      "Nissan is slashing about 15% of its global work force, or about 20,000 employees, as the Japanese automaker reported a loss Tuesday for the fiscal year that just ended amid slipping vehicle sales in China and other nations, and towering restructuring costs.",
      "Nissan said it will reduce the number of its auto plants to 10 from 17, under what it called its recovery plan to carry out \"decisive and bold actions to enhance performance and create a leaner, more resilient business that adapts quickly to market changes.\" It did not say which plants were being closed but confirmed the closures will include factories in Japan.",
      "\"We have a mountain to climb,\" CEO Ivan Espinosa told reporters, stressing the task will not be easy, requiring discipline and team work. \"Starting today, we build the future for Nissan.\"",
      "The job cuts to be done by March 2028 include the 9,000 head count reduction announced last year. Nissan also previously announced the scrapping of plans to build a battery plant in Japan.",
      "Espinosa, who took the helm earlier this year, said the latest plans followed a careful review of operations, to align production with demand, including coming up with market and product strategies. Nissan will also leverage its partnerships such as the one with Renault SA of France in Europe and Dongfeng Nissan in China, he said.",
      "Nissan said President Trump's tariffs on auto imports also hurt the company's results. The Yokohama, Japanese-based automaker racked up a loss of $4.5 billion for the fiscal year through March. It also said its recovery plan includes trying to reduce costs by $3.4 billion.",
      "\"As new management, we are taking a prudent approach to reassess our targets and actively seek every possible opportunity to implement and ensure a robust recovery,\" Espinosa said",
      "Nissan aims to return to profitability by fiscal year 2026.",
      "But Nissan Chief Financial Officer Jeremie Papin acknowledged the automaker faces serious challenges. Nissan did not give a profit projection for the fiscal year through March 2026, citing uncertainties.",
      "Tariffs weighing on automakers",
      "The Trump administration in March\u00a0imposed a 25% tariff on the roughly 8 million vehicles assembled abroad that the U.S. imports annually.",
      "General Motors earlier this month said it's\u00a0lowering its profit expectations for the year as it braces for a potential impact from auto tariffs as high as $5 billion in 2025. The revised forecast came after Mr. Trump signed executive orders in April\u00a0to relax some tariffs on automobiles and car parts.",
      "Ford Motors also pointed to higher U.S. tariffs in announcing last week that\u00a0it is raising prices\u00a0on three models produced in Mexico. And Toyota last week said Mr. Trump's tariffs would cost the company $1.3 billion in just two months. The carmaker stopped short of making predictions on future tariff hits on business, with Toyota CEO Koji Sato saying that any future impact would be \"very difficult to forecast.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cpi-report-today-april-2025-inflation-trump-tariffs/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 18:48:56 -0400",
    "summary": "The CPI report was cooler than expected, although inflation is still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in April\u00a0rose\u00a02.3% on an annual basis, rising less than economists had expected yet still reflecting price hikes that remain above the Federal Reserve's goal of bringing down inflation to a 2% rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.4% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "April's reading reflects the lowest level since February 2021, government data shows.",
      "On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%, lighter than the 0.3% pace forecast by economists.",
      "Housing costs were a major driver of inflation last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. And energy costs also ticked higher, despite lower gasoline prices, due to increases in natural gas and electricity costs.",
      "Grocery prices dropped slightly last month, declining 0.1% from March. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs dropped 12.7% to $5.12 in April, marking the first month-to-month decline in egg prices since October 2024.",
      "Still, egg prices remain near historic highs as a persistent outbreak of bird flu continues to wipe out flocks of egg-laying hens. The April figure is 79% higher than the same month a year earlier, when the price averaged $2.86 per dozen.",
      "What experts say",
      "Economists are looking for early signs that Mr. Trump's tariffs are trickling through to American households. Because tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. companies, which largely pass on the added costs to shoppers, they are at some point expected to boost consumer prices.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach on Mr. Trump's tariffs, which he said could boost inflation and blunt economic growth. But so far, the tariff impact hasn't shown up in economic data, which typically is backward-looking because it reflects activity from the previous month.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced tariffs, such as his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" levies, and then backed off from them. On April 9, he hit the pause button with a 90-day delay, scaling back the tariffs to a 10% rate.",
      "And on Monday, the Trump administration and China agreed to a temporary but significant easing of tariffs imposed over the last couple months, scaling back the import duties on Chinese-made goods from 145% to 30%.",
      "Meanwhile, some consumers and businesses rushed to order goods ahead of the tariffs' imposition, aiming to skirt the new import duties by front-loading their purchases. Because of this, the impact of the tariffs might not show up in economic data for another few months, economists say.",
      "\"[I]n reality, the data for April is likely to be largely unaffected by President Trump's announcements on Liberation Day,\" said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, in an email. \"This is because exemptions were granted for goods that had left exporting countries before 2 April, and because consumers and businesses rushed to front-run tariffs in February and March.\"",
      "He added, \"As such, both the Fed and global investors will still need to be a bit more patient before they can properly assess the impact of the trade uncertainty on consumer prices.\"",
      "What does the CPI report mean for your money",
      "Because of the tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S., inflation may not rise as much as earlier anticipated, noted EY's Daco, who said he's lowered his year-end CPI forecast by 0.4 percentage points to 3.2%.",
      "With inflation still expected to pick up later this year, albeit at a lower pace than earlier forecast, the Fed may decide to cut rates twice in 2025, rather than the three cuts Daco had earlier expected. He added that he believes the first rate cut will occur in September, rather than July.",
      "April's cooler-than-expected data may also give the Fed more breathing room to hold off\u00a0on cutting rates as it assesses the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies, said Carl Weinberg, chief economist with High Frequency Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"The Fed can stand still on rate hikes and cuts based on this data while it patiently waits to see the impact of erratic policy changes on prices in the months ahead, at least for now,\" Weinberg said.",
      "The result for consumers and businesses could be a longer wait for relief on borrowing costs, as the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate helps determine what banks, credit card companies and other lenders charge borrowers.",

Among the offerings are skincare kits, flatbed seating with ottomans, champagne service, and exclusive dining options including \"curated food and drinks,\" according to the United website.",
      "Also included are wireless charging, Bluetooth connectivity and 27-inch screens. United Polaris Studio seats will also be 25% larger than standard United Polaris seats and come with privacy doors, the airline said.",

      "\"We've created a everything around it to make sure that we can deliver it reliably and we can deliver it for a price that I think consumers will be excited to pay,\" Nocella said.",

      "The Boeing 787-9 aircraft will have 99 premium seats total, the most of any in United's fleet and the highest percentage among U.S. carriers, according to the airline. That number includes seating in eight United Polaris Studio and 56 United Polaris business class suites.",
      "Despite the focus on offering a more luxurious travel experience, United also wants to enhance flights for passengers with more modest budgets.",
      "\"[W]e also know we need to pay attention to the rear of the aircraft, because the bulk of the passengers are flying in the main cabin, not in the Polaris cabin,\" Nocella said. \"And we've made efforts to make sure that that experience is going to get better, not worse.\"",
      "This nose-to-tail transformation comes as the luxury travel sector continues to expand. Demand for luxury tourism and hospitality is expected to grow faster than any other travel segment, according to a 2024 McKinsey & Company report.",

      "Medicaid recipients also would have to verify their community engagement eligibility twice a year. The bill also adds a more rigorous income verification process for those who enroll in the Affordable Care Act's health care coverage.",
      "There are exceptions for the work requirement, however. The bill states that people who are under 19 years old as well as women who are pregnant or who are under postpartum medical care are among those who can receive a waiver.",
      "If the bill is passed, the requirements would take effect Jan. 1, 2029.",
      "Republicans have previously sought to tie receiving government benefits to work requirements, with one GOP lawmaker in 2023 seeking to tighten these rules for the food-stamp program because he said believed that \"work is the best pathway out of poverty.\"",
      "Some policy experts who study Medicaid, food stamps and other social safety net programs say that there's little evidence that work requirements increase employment, partly because most people who receive such aid and who are able to work are already doing so.",
      "About 92% of people under 65 years old who aren't receiving disability benefits were working full- or part-time in 2023, or else unable to work because of duties such as attending school or caregiving obligations, according to a recent\u00a0analysis from heath publication KFF. The remaining 8% were either retired, couldn't find work or weren't working for another reasons.",
      "Two states \u2014 Georgia and Arkansas \u2014 have added work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped the mandate after a court struck it down in 2019, a year after it was implemented.",
      "Bumped off the rolls",
      "A 2020 analysis of Arkansas' work requirements found that 18,000 adults lost coverage after the policy went into effect, with more than half of those reporting that they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 saying they delayed taking medications because of cost. The requirements didn't boost employment, the study, by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, also found.",
      "Georgia maintains a work requirement for a Medicaid expansion program called Pathways to Coverage, which provides insurance to some low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify for coverage. But that program has fallen short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative hurdles involved in verifying employment as well as technical glitches, according to a Pro Publica report.",
      "\"[W]ork requirements are the worst sort of red tape \u2014 blocking health coverage for working people, people with serious health conditions and people with disabilities,\" said Laura Harker, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Public Policies, a public policy think tank, in a December post about Georgia's program.",
      "An April 2025 estimate from the Urban Institute finds that as many as 5.2 million people ages 19- to 55-years-old could lose coverage if federal work requirements go into effect for Medicaid.",
      "Other cost-cutting measures",
      "Some Medicaid recipients who make more than 100% of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $32,000 a year for a family of four \u2014 would be required under the House GOP bill to pay out-of-pocket costs for some services. Those fees, which would not apply to emergency room visits, prenatal care, pediatric visits or primary care check-ups, would be limited to $35 per visit.",
      "And applicants could not qualify for Medicaid if they have a home that is valued at more than $1 million.",
      "The proposed bill also targets any immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally or without documentation. It reduces by 10% the share the federal government pays to states that allow those immigrants to sign up for Medicaid, such as California or New York. To qualify for Affordable Care Act coverage, enrollees would have to prove they are \"lawfully present.\"",

      "In February, President Trump moved to eliminate the low-value parcel exemption by imposing a 120% tax, or a flat fee of $100 on packages. When the exemption was eliminated on May 2, tariffs of up to 145% became applicable to packages from China worth $800 or less.",
      "Effective May 14, the tariff rate on low-value imports from China will be slashed to 54%. Additionally, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy, for a period of 90 days.",
      "Mr. Trump alleged in an April 2\u00a0executive order\u00a0that shippers in China had been exploiting the loophole to \"hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices.\"",
      "\"These shippers often avoid detection due to administration of the de minimis exemption,\" the executive order stated.",
      "The end of the de minimis exemption has upended the business models of companies like\u00a0Shein and Temu, leaving U.S. consumers\u00a0unable to procure\u00a0\u00a0affordable fashion from the popular e-commerce sites. Temu has\u00a0halted shipments\u00a0of goods from China to the U.S., and is now relying on domestic sellers to fulfill U.S.-based customers' orders and avoid tariffs.",

      "Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu are among the major players that until Friday relied on the loophole that allowed them to ship low-value parcels to the U.S. tax-free, allowing them to undercut U.S.-based sellers. American shoppers relied on the de minimis loophole, too, for bargain-basement prices that couldn't be matched for goods made in the U.S.",
      "Temu, for one, announced a dramatic shift to its business model. \"All sales in the U.S. are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country,\" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "With the end of the loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, many goods from China and other countries will no longer\u00a0be as low-priced as they once were. Trade experts also note that to comply with the law, importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now face a new administrative challenge: the burden of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. That could mean substantial delays in shipments, experts note.",
      "What is the de minimis loophole?",
      "The provision was introduced in 1938 as Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting negligible duties on low-value goods at a high cost to the government.",
      "From 2018 to 2023, the value of low-value e-commerce exports from China ballooned from $5.3 billion to $66 billion, according to a February report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The 1938 provision has been the \"primary path\" for Chinese exports to enter the U.S. market, the report notes.",
      "Why did Trump eliminate the de minimis exemption?",
      "President Trump in February said he would eliminate the loophole because he didn't believe China was taking sufficient action to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump in April signed an executive order eliminating the duty-free treatment for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2. As of Friday, packages that would have qualified for exemption under the de minimis provision will \"be subject to all applicable duties,\" the executive order states.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the de minimis exemption \"a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\"",
      "\"We put an end to it,\" he said.",
      "Goods from China are subject to new tariffs of up to 145%, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S.",
      "What does the end of the exemption mean for consumers?",
      "Retailers are already tacking on hefty tariff surcharges to customers' orders, leading to sticker shock for some U.S. shoppers who had long relied on China for cheap imported goods.",
      "\"The way we shop online will never be the same,\" Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of Publican, a company that authenticates shipment documentation, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Specifically, \"everything will take more time, cost more money, and everything that's price-sensitive won't be available,\" he said.",
      "The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets. But the end of the loophole will lead to a \"much diminished market,\" said Mary Lovely, an international trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "If prices of Chinese goods rise, there will be less demand, and sellers could decide to import fewer goods.",
      "\"You'll see much diminished market and at some point it won't be worth it to import to a small market,\" so you'll see products disappearing, Lovely said.",
      "Could the new rule cause delays?",
      "Requiring millions more packages to be inspected daily will create a challenge for CBP, experts noted.",
      "\"It will be an administrative nightmare, so you will see a lot of delays,\" Ryan Young, a trade policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "It's unclear if the government has enough CBP agents to efficiently inspect packages and enforce policies, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"As these adjustments are made, a key question remains, which is the ability of CBP to effectively regulate and enforce these measures,\" Ben Tzion said. \"As of today. CBP does not have that ability.\"",
      "\"Without personnel, you'll have backlogs and pile ups and U.S. customs might have to get more warehousing space,\" Young added.",
      "Who might benefit?",
      "Companies that sell goods made in the U.S. could face less competition as previously cheap China-made goods rise to new price highs.",
      "\"Consumers could become more wary of foreign brands to avoid paying hefty prices,\" Ines Durand, a retail strategist at Similarweb, a web analytics company.",

    "summary": "Here's what an agreement by the U.S. and China to suspend steep tariffs for 90 days means for consumers, businesses and the economy.",
    "story": [
      "A\u00a0tariff truce\u00a0between the U.S. and China announced on Monday will offer companies some relief, but also prolong the kind of economic uncertainty that makes it hard for businesses to plan for the future.",
      "Beginning May 14, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy. China will reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%.",
      "But clinching a long-term trade deal is likely to prove challenging, while the reduced 30% tariff rate could still lead to price hikes for consumers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It remains to be seen whether the U.S. and China can agree to a trade deal that keeps tariffs from rebounding in 90 days,\" analysts with Gavekal, an investment research firm, said in a report. \"So far, only the U.K. has reached an agreement with the U.S., and that doesn't tell us much.\"",
      "Is the 30% tariff permanent?",
      "No. Absent a formal trade deal, there's no guarantee that President Trump won't again raise tariffs on China once the truce expires after 90 days and that Beijing won't also retaliate. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the new baseline tariff a \"floor\" in an interview with Bloomberg Surveillance.",
      "\"This is just a 90-day pause that allows the two countries to work toward a deal,\" supply-chain expert Sina Golara, an assistant professor at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Is a 30% tariff on Chinese imports still high?",
      "Under the agreement, the U.S. will lower tariffs on Chinese goods from as much as 145% to 30%. Still, that represents a steep hike on the level of U.S. levies on China before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"If you look at where we were pre-'Liberation Day' or when Trump took office, this 'agreement' is just a baseline tariff increase to 30% across the board,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, referring to the phrase President Trump used in announcing a barrage of tariffs on April 2. \"While it's a walk-back from the prohibitive 145% tariffs, it still leaves us no closer to any concessions or renegotiations vis-\u00e0-vis China than we were.\"",
      "Tariff rates aren't the only potential sticking points as the countries continue to negotiate.",
      "\"The two countries have a lot of grievances in many dimensions, so it's not just tariff rates,\" Golara noted. \"It's where they strand on other trade barriers, the trade imbalance, and the U.S. accusing China of currency manipulation, so there's a lot to discuss. It makes sense for them to want to take more time.\"",
      "What does the U.S-China truce mean for economic growth?",
      "There's good news here: If both countries' reduced tariffs remain in place, consumer confidence is likely to improve and boost spending. That should help contain U.S. inflation and help support the job market, according to Oxford Economics associate economist Grace Zwemmer.",
      "The announcement also reduces the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession this year, according to experts. Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet lowered his forecast for a recession to 35% from more than 50%.",
      "Will shipments from China start flowing again?",
      "Large and small businesses alike in the U.S. have warned that higher tariffs will raise consumer prices, while some companies have canceled orders from Chinese factories because of the high levies.",
      "\"It's very clear that Trump was staring down the barrel of a huge drop in imports from China across the busiest shipping season, as companies build inventory for Christmas and the holiday season,\" Groundwork Collaborative's Jacquez told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0 \"There were more announcements from companies about burning through their inventory and having to pass costs to customers, or having to cease importing from China.\"",
      "Freight shipments from China are expected to surge during the 90-day tariff pause, as companies bulk up their inventories to guard against the trade talks foundering and levies rising. \u00a0As a result, shipping rates will rise, and squeeze smaller businesses, whose margins are already thin.",
      "\"Right now, you'll see a huge rush in trying to get imports in from China in this 90-day period. That will strain shipping logistics just as it did in Covid, when everything opened back up,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Will consumer prices still rise?",
      "Businesses still face added costs with 30% tariffs in place, and they are likely to pass some of those expense onto consumers. But the price hikes could be less substantial depending on how companies handle tariffs, according to Georgia State University's Golara.",
      "\"If we have a mix of some companies handling tariffs well, we won't see broad-based inflation rise to a painful level. We might see pocketed effects in different and specific products and sectors,\" he said.",
      "Other experts agree the pause is good news for companies and consumers.",
      "\"The tariffs were so punishing that it was creating this incentive not to import anything from China,\" Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The announcement is also good news because it means supply is not going to be as restrained as it was.\"",
      "It doesn't mean the U.S. it completely out of the woods, though. \"It's still a significant increase in taxes for American consumers. We are still in a worse position than we were,\" de Rugy said.",
      "How are companies reacting?",
      "Businesses are still grappling with significant economic uncertainty, making it hard to plan for the future.",
      "\"If you're a small business and don't know what your inputs will cost next week or in 90 days, it's going to be extremely difficult to do business in this uncertain environment,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Kim Vaccarella, founder and CEO of Bogg, a U.S-based beach bag and accessories company that makes its products in China, has been scrambling to shift at least some of its manufacturing to Vietnam and Sri Lanka because of the Trump administration's stepped-up tariffs.",
      "\"We were looking at alternatives and set up viable sources in both countries, and we were working toward manufacturing there,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Then came The White House's announcement on Monday. With the U.S. earlier this year having raised its country-based tariffs on Vietnam and Sri Lanka to o46% and 44%, respectively, China may again be Vaccarella's best option.",
      "\"Now we are back to square one, because at 30% it's less expensive to manufacture in China,\" she said. \"If tariffs stay at 30% or go lower, it just looks like we spent a lot of money quickly trying to ramp up production somewhere else, because that would have been more acceptable under this current nightmare.\"",
      "A leading index of small business optimism has fallen every month this year, although it remains above its levels before the November presidential election.",
      "Vaccarella had warned customers that the price of her company's\u00a0bags could jump as early as July. \"But 30% we can work with,\" she said. \"There might have to be a small increase, but it won't be what it would have been at 145%.\"",

      "The value of a bitcoin stands at around $102,000, and the reward for mining decreases over time as the number of bitcoin in circulation increases, making mining a lucrative endeavor.",
      "But mining is controversial because it's extremely energy-intensive, with miners operating gigantic data centers filled with server racks that carry out the mathematical operations necessary to mine. A team from Cambridge University estimates bitcoin uses about 187.9 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, more than the entire country of Egypt.",

      "The Trump brothers' foray into bitcoin mining marks the family's latest crypto venture. The president and his two eldest sons are backing the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, which got a multi-billion dollar boost earlier this month from an Abu Dhabi-based firm, and Mr. Trump launched a highly volatile \"meme coin\" called $TRUMP in January.",
      "Crypto investments make up about $2.9 billion of the family's net worth, one report estimates.",
      "The Trump family's interest in cryptocurrency has drawn criticism for conflicts of interest. Last week, Senate Democrats blocked a crypto regulation bill from moving forward and pushed for it to include new limits on elected officials participating in some types of crypto ventures, with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts accusing Mr. Trump of \"crypto corruption.\"",

Early morning gains helped the S&P 500 index float back above where it was on April 2, the day President Trump announced sweeping tariffs that threatened to upend the global economy and spark a recession.",
      "The Nasdaq Composite rose 4.4%, providing a measure of relief to tech companies at risk of retaliatory Chinese tariffs and export restrictions. Nvidia and Apple shares gained 5.4% and 6.3%, respectively.",
      "In a joint statement released by The White House on Monday, the U.S. and China on Monday announced that they would substantially lower tariffs for 90 days. The agreement was struck over the weekend in Switzerland, where Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Administrator Jamieson Greer\u00a0met with a Chinese trade delegation.",
      "Starting May 14, both countries will lower tariffs by 115%, according to the White House. That will bring the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports down to 30% from as high as 145%, and China's rate on American goods down to 10% from 125%. The 10% baseline tariff and other U.S. measures will remain in place.",
      "UBS Global Wealth Management projects the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports will ultimately settle around 30% to 40%.",

      "Still, the Trump administration's success in striking an agreement with China \u2014 which was viewed as one of the more difficult agreements to negotiate \u2014 paves a smoother road ahead for Wall Street investors.",
      "The U.S.\u00a0reached a deal\u00a0with the U.K. last week, the first trade pact to be announced since so-called \"Liberation Day.\" Mr. Trump introduced the 10% tariff baseline on most imports on April 2, which remains in place.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 May 2025 17:07:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Since the pandemic, the monthly rent for a typical apartment around the U.S. has surged almost 30% to $1,858, Zillow data shows.",
    "story": [
      "With home prices near a record high and mortgage rates remaining elevated, renting a place to live around the U.S. is today considered a\u00a0better alternative to buying. But here's the catch: Rents are surging, too.",
      "Zillow calculates\u00a0that renters need at least $80,000 in annual income to comfortably afford the typical apartment rental \u2014 up from $60,000 in 2020. And if you want to live in a larger urban area, apartment hunters now need to earn $100,000 or more to live in Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose, while even modestly sized Riverside, California, requires six figures for people to keep their heads above water, according to the real estate firm.",
      "\"Today renters need to make six figures to afford the typical rental in eight major metropolitan areas \u2014twice as many as before the pandemic,\" said Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow. \"That means renters have less money in their budgets for essentials like groceries and transportation, or for saving for a down payment.\"",
      "The typical guidance is to spend no more than 30% of your income on rent. To put that in perspective, that's $2,500 a month for someone making $100,000. To stay below the 30% threshold, renters in the eight cities listed by Zillow need to make at least six figures.",
      "\"This Zillow data backs up what every renter has been feeling when they've been looking for an apartment or trying to renew their lease,\" said Rachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing. \"Not just in New York City, but across the country, the cost of housing is skyrocketing and they just can't keep up.\"",
      "Here's a look at where around the country you need to earn six figures to afford the rent \u2014 plus cities where you might be able to get away with a lower salary.",
      "Most and least expensive",
      "It's no surprise that New York City tops Zillow's list. The Big Apple has in many ways has come to represent the home affordability crisis. According to the Zillow analysis, New York City dwellers need annual income of roughly $135,000 to be able to comfortably afford rent. That's nearly double the average income for a New York City renter, Fee said.",
      "The average rent in New York City is $2,950, 59% higher than the national average, according to Zillow\u00a0data. The city is doing away with broker fees starting this summer, which could give renters a bit more wiggle room when it comes to their apartment search.",
      "The second-priciest city is Boston, where renters need to earn $127,000 a year to comfortably afford rent, according to Zillow.",
      "Renters in search of more affordable metro areas can look to cities like Buffalo, New York, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In those cities, renters need to earn less than half of what they would to live in New York and Boston \u2013 or around $55,000.",
      "Zillow's data drives home how much rents have risen in recent years. Since April 2020, monthly rent for a typical U.S. apartment has increased almost 30% to $1,858. At the same time, wage growth over that period has lagged, with median annual income rising 22.5% to roughly $82,000, according to the\u00a0Census Bureau.",
      "At the center of the problem is the nation's inadequate housing supply. Even with\u00a0hundreds of thousands of apartments being constructed each year, it's not enough to keep up with demand.",
      "\"We've seen so much pressure since the pandemic and competition for housing,\" Fee said. \"And the inventory just isn't there because, again, we're not building enough as a nation.\"",
      "Fee added that to increase the supply of affordable housing and overall inventory, Congress needs to take action by expanding programs like the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, which subsidizes affordable housing.",
      "\"Renters across the country are looking to Washington for relief, and Congress has yet to take any meaningful action to increase affordable housing supply,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",

The rule requires ticket sellers, hotels, vacation rental platforms and others to disclose processing fees, cleaning fees and other charges up front.",

      "Ticketmaster, which is owned by Beverly Hills, California-based concert promoter Live Nation, is the world's largest ticket seller, processing 500 million tickets each year in more than 30 countries. Around 70% of tickets for major concert venues in the U.S. are sold through Ticketmaster.",

      "The company at the time said its site was overwhelmed by both fans and attacks from bots, which were posing as consumers in order to scoop up tickets and sell them on secondary sites. Thousands of people lost tickets after waiting for hours in an online queue.",
      "\"We now block an average of 200 million bot attempts every day, stopping them from stealing tickets meant for real fans,\" Ticketmaster said in a statement. \"In 2024 alone, we blocked over 53 billion bot attacks, a more than 5x increase from 2019.\"",
      "Monopoly trial",
      "Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Ticketmaster and Live Nation, accusing them of running an illegal monopoly that drives up U.S. ticket prices and asking a court to break them up. That case is ongoing.",
      "President Donald Trump is also eyeing the industry. In March, he signed an executive order that he said will help curb ticket scalping and bring \"commonsense\" changes to the way live events are priced.",

      "The U.S. and China have agreed to a temporary but significant easing of the tariffs imposed over the last couple months, the countries said in a joint statement shared by the White House, heralding significant success in trade negotiations that ramped up over the weekend.",
      "In the joint statement released early Monday morning, the two sides said they had agreed that ongoing \"discussions\u00a0have the potential to address the concerns of each side in their economic and trade relationship,\" and that \"moving forward in the spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect,\" both parties had committed to a 90-day suspension of most of the levies imposed since early April.",
      "\"We have reached an agreement on a 90-day pause,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, where he spent the weekend in meetings with Chinese counterparts. He said Washington and Beijing would reduce their reciprocal tariffs by 115 percentage points for three months to give the negotiations room to move forward.",
      "Bessent said the temporary reductions would effectively reduce the level of U.S. tariffs still in place on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China was reducing its levies on American imports to 10%.",
      "China also agreed to ease some non-tariff barriers. That could include resuming export of rare earths to U.S. customers, which are materials used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries, according to High Frequency Economics.",
      "At the White House, President Trump hailed the agreement while speaking to reporters before leaving for the Middle East.",
      "\"The biggest thing that we're discussing is the opening up China, and they've agreed to do that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But it's going to take a while to paper it.\"",
      "The White House's imposition of levies amounting to some 145% on all goods imported from China, and Beijing's retaliatory tariffs of 125% on American imports, had cast a long shadow over global financial markets as the world's two biggest economies spent the early spring appearing to entrench in a trade war.",
      "The high tariffs had virtually frozen trade between the U.S. and China, with major American ports reporting a drastic drop in traffic.",
      "\"The consensus from both delegations this weekend is neither side wants a decoupling,\" Bessent told reporters in Geneva on Monday. \"And what had occurred with these very high tariff ... was an embargo, the equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balanced trade. And I think that both sides are committed to achieving that.\"",
      "In another sign that the U.S. may be ready to relent on its protectionist trade policies, Mr. Trump on May 8 announced a pact with the United Kingdom under which the U.S. will lower tariffs on British cars from 27.5% to 10%, while also scrapping levies on steel and aluminum.",
      "Stock market boost",
      "Commodities and currency markets in Asia and beyond were buoyed significantly on the news of a breakthrough in the negotiations on Monday. Stock futures in the U.S. also soared, with the Dow gaining more than 1,000 points ahead of trade opening in New York on Monday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.2% and 4%, respectively.",
      "Speaking Sunday, Bessent said there had been \"substantial progress\" in the talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Geneva, while Greer teased that an agreement had been reached but offered no details.",
      "\"It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as far as maybe thought,\" Greer told reporters on Sunday.",
      "Despite the cooldown, some Wall Street analysts questioned whether the truce will last and if the sides are committed to forging a more permanent agreement to ease tensions.",
      "Bessent \"stated that neither the U.S. nor China wants decoupling. We are skeptical,\" Wei Yao, head of research Asia Pacific at Societe Generale Group. \"To us, the thinking on reducing reliance on China for the supply of critical material seems more permanent, even though the U.S. may not mind continuing to buy clothes, toys or even iPhones from China.\"",

      "After a fingerprint match from Flores-Ruiz's first arrest in 2013 and a local case in Milwaukee, a warrant for his arrest and deportation was issued by ICE.",

      "\"Witnesses uniformly reported that Judge Dugan was visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor,\" the agent wrote. Dugan, according to witnesses, told the arrest team to go to the chief judge's office to speak with them about the permissibility of making the arrest inside the courthouse, and looked around the hallway near her courtroom to seek out other law enforcement officers who were waiting to arrest Flores-Ruiz.",
      "One agent, who Dugan did not recognize as part of the arrest team, remained in the hallway waiting for Flores-Ruiz.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Stephanie Haines, a Trump nominee, ruled the president is legally allowed to use the 18th-century law to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of belonging to the gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's push to remove people from the U.S. using the wartime Alien Enemies Act got a rare stamp of approval from a federal judge this week, as one of the more controversial parts of Mr. Trump's immigration strategy faces a slew of court challenges.",
      "U.S. District Judge Stephanie Haines of Pennsylvania, a Trump nominee, ruled Tuesday the president is legally allowed to use the 18th-century law to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of belonging to the gang Tren de Aragua. However, Haines also said the administration hasn't given people facing Alien Enemies Act removal enough notice to bring court challenges.",
      "The ruling is fairly narrow: The case only applies to one person, a Venezuelan man who was arrested in central Pennsylvania and moved to Texas. But it further complicates a nationwide battle over the Alien Enemies Act, which Mr. Trump has used to rapidly expel hundreds of migrants and send them to a supermax prison in El Salvador.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 says the government can remove people during an invasion or a \"predatory incursion\" launched by a foreign nation. Prior to this year, the law had been invoked three times in history, during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In all other cases, the law has been used for citizens of countries at war with the United States. But the Trump administration argued in a March proclamation that accused Tren de Aragua members count as \"alien enemies,\" claiming the gang \u2014 which Mr. Trump has deemed a foreign terrorist group \u2014 has extensive links to the Venezuelan government.",
      "The use of the Alien Enemies Act has drawn controversy, with critics arguing the administration hasn't given people an opportunity to challenge their cases in court. Many of the migrants who were sent to a Salvadoran prison don't have clear criminal records, CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" found last month. The Trump administration has stood by its use of the law, casting it as a necessary step to crack down on crime by the notorious Tren de Aragua.",
      "Why does the judge say the Trump administration can use the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "Haines wrote on Tuesday the Alien Enemies Act can apply to Tren de Aragua members. The judge defined a \"predatory incursion\" as a \"hostile entry into the United States by a cohesive group,\" like a U.S.-designated terrorist group, with a \"common goal of causing significant disruption\" \u2014 which she said lines up with Mr. Trump's proclamation in March.",
      "Haines also deferred to Mr. Trump on the question of whether Tren de Aragua is directed by Venezuela's government, though some U.S. intelligence agencies disagree with the administration, according to a memo obtained by several news outlets.",
      "But the judge broke with the administration in one key respect: She said the government must give people facing Alien Enemies Act removal at least 21 days' notice, in both English and Spanish, so they can bring court challenges. That's far more than the 12 hours' notice Haines said the government had promised to give in the past.",
      "The case reached Haines' desk after a Venezuelan man, referred to as A.S.R., filed a habeas corpus petition last month asking her to stop the government from deporting him.",
      "The man's lawyers say he was detained by ICE agents, asked about his tattoos and accused of links to Tren de Aragua, which he strongly denies. He was later moved to Texas. The petition says the man \u2014 who entered the U.S. in 2023 and is seeking asylum \u2014 fears the government will try to use the Alien Enemies Act against him.",
      "Why is Judge Haines' Alien Enemies Act ruling unusual?",
      "Haines is the first judge to explicitly say the Trump administration can use the Alien Enemies Act to remove Venezuelan migrants, making the Pennsylvania jurist an \"outlier among all of the other federal courts,\" says Columbia Law School professor Elora Mukherjee.",
      "Judges in three other states \u2014 Texas, Colorado and New York \u2014 have blocked Alien Enemies Act removals in their court districts. In some of these cases, the judges have said outright that the Trump administration's use of the 1798 law is likely illegal, often concluding that Tren de Aragua likely isn't involved in an invasion under the law.",
      "Last week, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein of Manhattan rejected the government's arguments. His ruling also took aim at the Trump administration for transporting hundreds of Alien Enemies Act subjects to the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador under a deal with that country's government, calling it a \"notoriously evil jail.\"",
      "Ahilan Arulanantham, a University of California, Los Angeles Law School professor who has worked on cases involving the Alien Enemies Act, called Haines' ruling \"wrong on a couple of key points.\"",
      "He says it gives too much legal weight to the fact that the Trump administration considers Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization, calling it \"deeply misguided\" and at odds with other rulings on terrorism designations. He also believes Haines gives excessive deference to the administration on whether an invasion is taking place.",
      "\"If every group of individuals \u2026 who the U.S. government says are controlled by a foreign government can be therefore treated as an invading force, then the Alien Enemies Act power is truly unbounded,\" Arulanantham told CBS News.",
      "Georgetown Law School Professor David Super also questioned the amount of deference that Haines gave the administration, including on the questions of whether Tren de Aragua is invading the U.S. and whether the Venezuelan government is responsible.",
      "\"This is involving individual liberties, and sweeping deference to the executive to abridge individual liberties is not part of our tradition,\" Super told CBS News.",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have defended his use of the law, arguing it's a necessary tool to deport Tren de Aragua members and halt gang violence. His March proclamation said Tren de Aragua members have \"unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.\"",
      "Tren de Aragua \"is one of the most violent and ruthless terrorist gangs on planet earth. They rape, maim and murder for sport,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has said.",
      "In court papers, the administration has argued it is \"the President's call alone\" whether the Alien Enemies Act applies, and whether the U.S. faces a \"predatory incursion\" is the type of foreign policy decision that's typically left to the president. The government's lawyers have also said the term \"predatory incursion\" can apply to Tren de Aragua members, arguing it can have a broader definition than just military action.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Haines' ruling.",
      "What does Judge Haines' ruling mean for migrants?",
      "The ruling is fairly narrow because \u2014 at least for now \u2014 it appears to only impact the Venezuelan man who initially brought the habeas corpus petition.",
      "In an earlier ruling last month, the judge treated the case as a class action, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from removing anybody from western Pennsylvania under the Alien Enemies Act unless they've gotten 14 days' notice.",
      "But Haines wrote Tuesday that there is no evidence anyone in her court district is currently being held under the law \u2014 including the man who brought the case, since he was transferred to Texas last month. For that reason, she narrowed the case to just the one petitioner.",
      "\"My read of it is that Judge Haines' order is extremely limited,\" Mukherjee said.",
      "Mukherjee also noted that Haines' ruling still requires the administration to give migrants plenty of notice \u2014 a view that other courts have held, including the Supreme Court.",
      "\"Universally, the federal courts are trying to curb the executive branch's reliance on the Alien Enemies Act as a mechanism for swift deportations from the United States without providing meaningful due process and notice to people,\" Mukherjee said.",
      "Still, Arulanantham said the ruling will be \"enormously significant\" if it's upheld on appeal.",
      "If the government can keep using the Alien Enemies Act to remove alleged Tren de Aragua members, but those migrants can challenge their detentions in court based on the specific facts of their situation, it could \"become an enormous drain on the legal system,\" requiring judges to hold a \"mini-trial\" for each planned removal, Arulanantham said.",
      "Has the Supreme Court ruled on the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "The Supreme Court hasn't weighed in directly on the question of whether the Alien Enemies Act is being used properly, but it has said the government needs to give migrants held under the law a chance at judicial review \u2014 which Haines' ruling cites.",
      "The high court handed down that ruling in April. In the same order, the justices overturned a ruling from a Washington, D.C., judge blocking Alien Enemies Act removals \u2014 but the Supreme Court focused on whether the judge had jurisdiction over migrants held in Texas, not on whether the Trump administration was allowed to use the 1798 law.",
      "The court also temporarily blocked Alien Enemies Act rulings in one part of Texas last month, in a brief emergency order that still remains in effect.",
      "Super believes the Supreme Court is likely to weigh in on the Alien Enemies Act again \u2014 possibly before its summer recess.",
      "\"This is certainly going back to the Supreme Court sooner rather than later,\" Super said.",
      "Can the Trump administration suspend habeas corpus?",
      "Many of the cases challenging the Alien Enemies Act are brought under writs of habeas corpus \u2014 a centuries-old legal concept that grants people the right to challenge their imprisonment.",
      "Last week, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told reporters the Trump administration is \"actively looking at\" suspending habeas corpus, citing a provision of the Constitution that allows it to be suspended \"in cases of rebellion or invasion.\" That step has only been taken under extremely rare circumstances in the past, including during the Civil War.",
      "Many legal experts believe the idea of suspending habeas corpus to deal with illegal immigration is unlikely to pass legal muster. Super told CBS News the gambit would put \"an even higher burden on the administration that we are at war.\"",
      "\"Habeas corpus goes all the way back to the Magna Carta,\" Super said. \"I think courts will be very concerned about discarding a provision that is 800 years old in defense of our liberties.\"",
      "It's also widely believed that suspensions of habeas corpus must be authorized by Congress.",
      "\"There are centuries of case law on this question,\" Mukherjee said. \"If the executive branch tries to suspend habeas corpus, that would be unconstitutional and illegal, and a dramatic escalation of the authoritarian overreach of the executive branch.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's bid to enforce its birthright citizenship executive orders gives the Supreme Court an opportunity to address the soundness of nationwide injunctions.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday is set to consider a bid by the Trump administration to narrow three lower court orders blocking President Trump from ending birthright citizenship, in cases that test judges' power to block a president's policies nationwide.",
      "The arguments before the court, taking place in a rare May session, will be the first involving a policy rolled out by Mr. Trump in his second term. But the high court is not examining the legality of the president's birthright citizenship executive order, which seeks to deny U.S. citizenship to children born to a mother or father who are in the U.S. unlawfully or on a temporary basis.",
      "Instead, the Trump administration has said district court judges overseeing three legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policy lacked the authority to issue sweeping injunctions that extend beyond the parties involved in the litigation. The plaintiffs that brought the three lawsuits are 22 states, two organizations and seven individuals, and the Justice Department is pushing for the injunctions to apply only to them.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court in favor of the administration could allow it to partially enforce the birthright citizenship measure while the litigation proceeds \u2014 but not enforce it against the plaintiffs, including residents of California, New York and 20 other states.",
      "\"This is one of a range of efforts to close the courthouse doors, to make it harder, more expensive, more complicated, slower to challenge illegal government action,\" said Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the Immigrants' Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"A case like birthright citizenship puts that in really stark relief where you have an executive order that is blatantly illegal, but the administration is asking the Supreme Court to make it harder for courts to protect people and vindicate constitutional rights.\"",
      "The fight over nationwide, or universal, injunctions has been simmering for years, and several of the justices themselves have indicated that the Supreme Court would have to clarify their legality.",
      "\"Universal injunctions are legally and historically dubious,\" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion to the Supreme Court's 2018 decision upholding the travel ban\u00a0Mr. Trump put in place during his first term. \"If federal courts continue to issue them, this court is dutybound to adjudicate their authority to do so.\"",
      "But criticisms of these broad orders reached a fever pitch this year, as the Trump administration fends off more than 200 legal challenges targeting nearly every aspect of the president's second-term agenda, and courts around the country issue injunctions that stop his policies from taking effect.",
      "Most of these decisions have been appealed, and the Trump administration has sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court in more than a dozen cases, including over his birthright citizenship executive order. The high court left the lower court injunctions preventing implementation of the birthright citizenship policy in place for now.",
      "Among the president's other plans that have been blocked were his transgender military ban, which the Supreme Court then allowed to take effect; his effort to restrict federal funding to medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care for young people; and cuts to certain federal funds.",
      "\"The pace of universal injunctions has gotten to the point where it really is an urgent issue for the court to resolve, not just because it has meant the thwarting of the president's ability to implement the policies for which he was elected, but also because it has led to an inundation of emergency petitions to the Supreme Court as a result of these universal injunctions,\" said Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America.",
      "These sweeping orders have frustrated not just Mr. Trump and his agenda, but also his predecessors. A study from the Harvard Law Review published in April 2024 found that at least 127 nationwide injunctions were issued from 1963 through 2023, though most of those, 96, were entered from 2001 through 2023.",
      "In March, the Congressional Research Service identified 86 nationwide injunctions that were issued under Mr. Trump's first four years in office and 28 during former President Joe Biden's term. But the report warned that it is \"not possible to provide a single definitive count of nationwide injunctions.\"",
      "As to Mr. Trump's second term, the Congressional Research Service identified 17 nationwide injunctions issued during his first two months back in office. The Trump administration estimates there have been at least 28 of these orders entered against it by judges.",
      "\"What universal injunction practice effectively means is that a single district court judge has a veto over the president's national policy and because there are 94 district courts in the country, that means that you have 94 opportunities in theory to shut down any given national policy,\" Alicea said. \"That is a recipe for genuine paralysis in terms of national policy-making and in a way that subverts the separation of powers because single district court judges were never supposed to have this kind of authority to stop national policy in its tracks.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have attacked by name the judges issuing these decisions, and his administration has extended that battle to the relief they are granting. In a filing in one of the birthright citizenship cases, the Justice Department said universal injunctions have reached \"epidemic\" proportions since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "\"Those injunctions thwart the executive branch's crucial policies on matters ranging from border security, to international relations, to national security, to military readiness,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. \"They repeatedly disrupt the operations of the Executive Branch up to the Cabinet level.\"",
      "Republicans in Congress have also taken up the cause against universal injunctions. The GOP-controlled House in April passed a bill that would restrict district court judges from issuing broad injunctive relief. It's unclear whether the measure will pass the Republican-led Senate, where 60 votes are needed for legislation to advance.",
      "But Wofsy, of the ACLU, said the number of lawsuits and injunctions stems from the volume of executive actions taken by the president in the opening months of his second term.",
      "\"The administration has been subject to so many nationwide injunctions and injunctions more generally because it's doing an incredible volume of illegal things, and that is not a reason to take away a tool that the judiciary has to check executive authority. It's the opposite,\" he said. \"Now more than ever it is vital that the judiciary is a strong and robust check against illegal executive actions.\"",
      "The Supreme Court may not stop universal injunctions altogether but could curtail them, as there are instances where relief naturally extends beyond the parties involved in a case. Take, for example, a landowner who sues a factory for polluting a river. In that instance, an injunction that orders the factory to stop would benefit all who live along it, not just the single plaintiff.",
      "\"The basic principle here is courts may only issue injunctions that are as broad as necessary to remedy the plaintiff's asserted harm,\" Alicea said. \"Sometimes that will require an injunction that gives protection even to nonparties as an incidental result of giving protection to the actual plaintiff.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court does curtail judges' ability to enter universal injunctions, courts could still enter tailored relief. Plaintiffs seeking to represent a broader group of people could also file class-action lawsuits. In the context of the birthright citizenship case, a class-action lawsuit could be brought by affected pregnant women in the U.S. illegally and children at risk of losing their right to U.S. citizenship, the Trump administration has argued.",
      "But Wofsy said class-action lawsuits, like nationwide injunctions, are one of many tools available to federal courts and may not be appropriate in every case.",
      "\"The existence of that tool doesn't mean courts shouldn't have other tools available,\" he said. \"The question here isn't, 'should nationwide injections be entered in every case?' The question is, 'are we going to take away the discretion that district courts have to use this as an appropriate tool to craft a remedy in a case where it's necessary?'\"",
      "He said birthright citizenship is an example of a situation in which the constitutional question is so clear, there is no reason the government needs to apply the policy to a single child while the legal challenges move forward.",
      "\"Citizenship really cuts through so many aspects of our society. It matters for so many educational, health, nutrition, other kinds of programs,\" Wofsy said. \"The idea that we would have a patchwork system where people's citizenship isn't just a matter of whether you're born in the United States, but who your parents are, what their status is, do you have documentation, are you a member of this organization, were you born in this state or that state invites confusion, chaos, discrimination and for no real purpose.\"",

Congress was tasked with finding $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to fund President Trump's tax cuts.",
      "House Republicans are hoping to have a floor vote next week prior to Memorial Day, after which the bill will go to the Senate.",
      "Four Republican Senators wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune cautioning the caucus against a \"full-scale repeal\" of tax credits, adding that repealing credits would be disruptive to businesses which had made investments based on the Inflation Reduction Act's tax framework. They also added that cuts would lead to higher energy costs.",
      "Twenty-one House Republicans wrote a similar letter in March urging against cuts to energy credits from the Inflation Reduction Act. A 2024 CBS News report found that over 80% of Inflation Reduction Act spending and tax credits went towards Republican congressional districts.",
      "Environmental groups and renewable energy companies have been on Capitol Hill lobbying to protect tax credits they say are vital to support new industries. Raghu Belur, co-founder of Enphase Energy, a solar components manufacturer, expected changes to the IRA, but didn't expect them to go this far.",
      "\"I thought there would be a glide path, I thought there would be a reasonable transition period. Instead it's become very abrupt,\" he told CBS News.",
      "His company has manufacturing facilities in South Carolina and Texas, made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act. But Belur also worries about the downstream effects on businesses that have formed around renewable energy, like solar installers, which tend to be small businesses.",
      "Among their concerns, Belur and the Solar Energy Industries Association have been focusing on the importance of a tax credit that helps homeowners to finance solar projects. The GOP budget proposal would abruptly end the credit at the end of 2025. The credit was previously slated to be phased out by 2034. He says the credits help support customer demand for nascent businesses, and that the renewable energy sector finally had momentum that should be supported as promised at this stage of their industry.",
      "\"Fossil fuels have been receiving subsidies for the last 100-plus years,\" Belur told CBS News. \"I always believe that subsidies must be a catalyst, not a crutch, we are not asking for an infinite extension of this.\"",
      "The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, estimates that 75% of the affected credits and spending cuts would affect local economies in Republican districts.",
      "\"At a time when billions of dollars are being invested in states that overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "Several tax credits and incentives are set to be phased out early or end, impacting a wide range of projects, including solar, geothermal, nuclear, wind, and hydrogen. The $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit that President Trump campaigned against will be ended, as well as manufacturing credits to produce electric vehicles.",
      "Funding for other Inflation Reduction Act initiatives are also projected to be cut. Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie, the House Energy and Commerce Committee chair, wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this week that the cuts would include $6.5 billion of unspent Inflation Reduction Act funding that is earmarked for the Environmental Protection Agency's Green House Gas Reduction Fund, clean pollution reduction, clean ports, and environmental justice grants.",
      "Evan Chapman, senior director of policy at Clean Tomorrow, a nonpartisan clean energy advocacy group, believes the version of the budget proposed by the GOP would make it harder to quickly increase energy production through renewables, and could lead American renewable energy industries to fall behind the rest of the world.",
      "\"This is largely a repeal of the inflation Reduction Act,\" Chapman told CBS News. \"What this bill will do is reduce the availability of energy, increase costs for energy that's coming on the grid, and make it more difficult to pull innovative American technologies that will produce clean energy towards the market.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The House is moving forward on President Trump's \"one, big beautiful bill,\" as three committees on Wednesday voted to advance some of the most contentious parts of the major budget package aimed at addressing the president's defense, energy and tax priorities.",
      "The Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce and Agriculture committees met Tuesday and Wednesday to debate and vote on their proposals as Republicans remained divided on a number of major issues \u2014 from Medicaid to tax cuts.",
      "Ways and Means faces SALT conflict",
      "After a nearly 18-hour markup, the Ways and Means panel, which is responsible for the tax portions of the bill, advanced its portion of the legislation Wednesday morning, in a 26-19 vote. But the key sticking point, a cap on the state and local tax deduction, often referred to as SALT, appeared to go unresolved. Republicans who represent blue states have pushed for an increase to the $10,000 cap, but balked at a proposed $30,000 cap in recent days.",
      "On SALT, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Wednesday morning that he's serving as the \"neutral umpire\" in the conversations between red state and blue state Republicans, adding that \"I'm absolutely confident we're going to be able to work out a compromise that everybody can live with.\"",
      "Energy and Commerce deals with Medicaid",
      "Meanwhile, the Energy and Commerce Committee debated for more than 25 hours before advancing its portion of the legislation in a 30-24 vote on Wednesday afternoon. The panel was tasked with finding $880 billion in cuts, which has implicated the popular entitlement program Medicaid.",
      "The Energy and Commerce proposal, unveiled Monday night, would impose work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cuts to federal funding to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and a ban on Medicaid covering gender transition services for children.",
      "Agriculture Committee votes on food stamp changes",

      "The most contentious issue handled by the Agriculture panel surrounds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, widely known as food stamps. The committee's proposal would increase the age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits, while shifting more of the costs to states. The bill updates the age requirement to 64, up from 54.",
      "Republicans also want to close a loophole for work requirement waivers that states could request for areas with unemployment rates over 10% or lack \"a sufficient number of jobs.\"",
      "House aims for vote next week \u2014 but Senate still needs to weigh in",

      "\"A lot of work has gone into getting 11 committees ready to complete all of their work today,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said.",
      "Republican leaders have been pushing to have the bill on the floor by next week, with the House Budget Committee expected to meet in the coming days to put the bill's components into one massive legislative package. After that, the measure would then go to the House Rules Committee before it can be brought to the floor for a vote.",
      "\"This process isn't over. We're just getting close to maybe half time,\" Scalise said. \"When we pass this bill next week through the House, it will go to the Senate, they'll do their work. But we will get this bill to President Trump's desk before the July 4 deadline that the White House has asked for.\"",
      "Johnson also touted the progress on the legislation so far Wednesday, calling it \"one of the most consequential pieces of legislation ever passed by the United States Congress.\"",

    "summary": "Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause to the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits in 2026 as California faces a steep budget deficit.",
    "story": [
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause to the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits in 2026 as the state faces economic uncertainty.",
      "Newsom outlined his nearly $332 billion state spending plan on Wednesday, revealing that California is facing a $12 billion budget deficit.",
      "\"California is under assault,\" Newsom said. \"We have a president that's been reckless in terms of assaulting those growth engines.\"",
      "The Democratic governor noted that the freeze does not mean California is backing away from its support for immigrants.",
      "\"No state has done more than the state of California, no state will continue to do more than the state of California by a long shot. And that's a point of pride,\" Newsom said.",
      "The decision, the details for which were revealed before Wednesday's budget revision presentation, is driven by a higher-than-expected price tag on the program and economic uncertainty from federal tariff policies, Newsom said. It also comes as Newsom faces his final years in the governor's office, with speculation continuing to mount about his future political prospects.",
      "California's push to offer free health care benefits to all low-income adults, regardless of their immigration status, was announced in late 2023. Newsom touted the planned expansion as \"a transformative step towards strengthening the health care system for all Californians.\"",
      "However, the cost has exceeded the state's initial $6.4 billion estimate by more than $2 billion.",
      "Still, as late as March of this year, Newsom suggested to reporters he was not considering rolling back health benefits for low-income people living in the country illegally \u2014 even with California grappling with a $6.2 billion Medicaid shortfall. He also repeatedly defended the expansion, saying it saves the state money in the long run. The program is state-funded and does not use federal dollars.",
      "Under Newsom's plan, low-income adults without legal status will no longer be eligible to apply for Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, starting in 2026. Those who are already enrolled won't be kicked off their plans because of the enrollment freeze, and the changes won't impact children. Newsom's office didn't say how long the freeze would last.",
      "Starting in 2027, adults with \"unsatisfactory immigration status\" on Medi-Cal, including those without legal status and those who have legal status but aren't eligible for federally funded Medicaid, will also have to pay a $100 monthly premium. The governor's office said that is in line with the average cost paid by those who are on subsidized heath plans through California's own marketplace. There's no premium for most people currently on Medi-Cal.",
      "\"We believe that people should have some skin in the game as it relates to contributions,\" Newsom said.",
      "In total, Newsom's office estimated the changes will save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.",
      "The Medi-Cal expansion, combined with other factors such as rising pharmacy costs and larger enrollment by older people, has forced California to borrow and authorize new funding to plug the multibillion-dollar hole earlier this year. California provides free health care to more than a third of its 39 million people.",
      "The proposals come ahead of Newsom's scheduled presentation on the updated budget. Recovery from the Los Angeles wildfires, changing federal tariff policies, and the expensive health care expansion are putting a strain on California's massive state budget. Lawmakers are expecting a multibillion-dollar shortfall this year, and more deficits are projected for several years ahead.",
      "Newsom blamed President Donald Trump's tariff policies for the shortfalls, estimating that the polices have cost the state $16 billion in tax revenues. California is also bracing for major budget hits if Republicans in Congress follow through with a plan to slash billions of dollars in Medicaid and penalize states for providing health care to immigrants without legal status.",
      "Newsom now opens budget negotiations with lawmakers and it's unclear how Democrats who control the Legislature will react to his plan to freeze new Medi-Cal enrollment for some immigrants. A final budget proposal must be signed by June. California's budget is by far the largest among states.",
      "\"This is going to be a very challenging budget,\" Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, who chairs the budget committee, said before Newsom's proposals were announced. \"We're going to have to make some tough decisions.\"",
      "The budget proposals presented this week will build on some of the impacts of federal policies, but many unknowns remain.",
      "The governor already said he's planning to scale back on baseline spending this year. Analysts and economists also warn that California will face bigger deficits in the tens of billions of dollars in the coming years due to economic sluggishness and stock market volatility brought on by the tariff war.",
      "The budget Newsom first proposed in January included little new spending. But it allows the state to fully implement the country's first universal transitional kindergarten program and increase the state's film and TV tax credit to $750 million annually to bring back Hollywood jobs that have gone to New York and Georgia. He recently called on Trump to pass a $7.5 billion film tax credit at the federal level.",
      "Last year, Newsom and the Legislature agreed to dip into the state's rainy day fund, slash spending \u2014 including a nearly 10% cut for nearly all state departments \u2014 and temporarily raise taxes on some businesses to close an estimated $46.8 billion budget deficit.",

    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 20:32:24 -0400",
    "summary": "The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of \"forever chemicals\" in drinking water.",
    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it plans to weaken limits on some \"forever chemicals\" in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones.",
      "The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits were expected to reduce PFAS levels in drinking water for millions of people.",
      "Commonly called \"forever chemicals,\"\u00a0PFAS\u00a0are found nearly everywhere \u2014 in air,\u00a0water\u00a0and soil \u2014 and can take thousands of years to break down in the environment.",
      "Limits on three types of PFAS, including so-called GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.",
      "The Biden administration's rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards in place, but give utilities two extra years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to comply and treat for the chemicals.",
      "\"We are on a path to uphold the agency's nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,\" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.",
      "The development was first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration's limits. But the vast majority of utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.",
      "Health advocates praised the Biden administration for the tight limits. But water utilities took issue with the rule, saying treatment systems are expensive to install and that customers will end up paying more for water. The utilities sued the EPA.",
      "The EPA's actions align with some of the arguments utilities made in their lawsuit. They argued that the EPA lacked the authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn't properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that are now rescinded. They also asked for the now-granted two-year extension.",
      "Erik Olson, a senior strategic director of health at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move is illegal. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit contaminants in drinking water and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.",
      "\"With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration's promise to deliver clean water for Americans,\" Olson said.",
      "President Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks. The EPA plans to loosen regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, cleanup standards for coal plant waste and car emission limits, among many other clean air and water rules.",
      "Zeldin's history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications \u2014 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule will cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costly rules, combined with recent mandates to replace harmful lead pipes, will raise residents' bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.",
      "The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that will help.",
      "Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over the limits.",
      "\"This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand and that's almost too late already for 2029,\" said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",
      "But what utilities really wanted was a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. He suspects the utility industry will continue to sue over those limits. Dissatisfied environmental groups will likely file challenges, too.",
      "Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said utilities may not have to install treatment that's as broadly effective if they just have to focus on two types of older PFAS.",
      "\"You really reduce what utilities have to do to make sure that the other, newer generation PFAS are captured,\" she said.",
      "When the Biden administration announced its rule, the head of the EPA traveled to North Carolina and was introduced by activist Emily Donovan, who said she was grateful for the first federal standards. She had long campaigned for tougher rules for GenX substances that had contaminated a local river.",
      "Now the EPA says it will roll back those GenX limits.",
      "\"This current administration promised voters it would 'Make America Healthy Again' but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump met Wednesday in Saudi Arabia with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, highlighting the stunning reversal in fortunes for a former Islamist militant with ties to al Qaeda who spent years with a U.S. government bounty on his head. Al-Sharaa's rebel forces led the charge on Damascus last year that toppled the decades-long, iron-fisted rule of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and he has since installed himself as the head of a government presenting itself to the world as inclusive and democratic.",
      "Mr. Trump's decision to meet with al-Sharaa, after some European leaders have done the same, could be a huge boost to the new Syrian government as it tries to rebuild ties with the Western world. Those relationships have been marked by blistering sanctions and acrimony during and after the Middle Eastern nation's bloody civil war, which started in 2011.",
      "\"Young, attractive guy, tough guy, strong past,\" Mr. Trump told reporters of al-Sharaa   aboard Air Force One following the meeting.",
      "In a readout on the two leaders' meeting in Saudi Arabia, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump had told the Syrian leader that \"he has a tremendous opportunity to do something historic in his country,\" and urged him to join Saudi Arabia in signing onto the U.S.-backed Abraham Accords, to normalize ties with Israel.",
      "Mr. Trump also told al-Sharaa he should \"tell all foreign terrorists to leave Syria; Deport Palestinian terrorists; help the United States to prevent the resurgence of ISIS,\" and \"assume responsibility for ISIS detention centers in Northeast Syria,\" according to Leavitt.",
      "They were joined in their meeting by the host of Mr. Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, and on the phone by the President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "The meeting came a day after Mr. Trump announced on his visit to the Saudi capital Riyadh that his administration would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, \"to give them a chance at greatness.\"",
      "\"The sanctions were brutal and crippling, and served ... an important function, nevertheless, at the time, but now it's their [Syrians'] time to shine,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech on Tuesday. \"I say good luck, Syria. Show us something very special.\"",
      "In her readout on Wednesday, Leavitt said \"President Erdogan praised President Trump for lifting sanctions on Syria and committed to working alongside Saudi Arabia to encourage peace and prosperity in Syria. The Crown Prince also commended President Trump for his decision to lift the sanctions, calling it courageous.\"",
      "She said al-Sharaa had thanked Mr. Trump, along with MBS and Erdogan, \"for their efforts to put together the meeting, and recognized the significant opportunity presented by the Iranians leaving Syria, as well as shared U.S.-Syrian interests in countering terrorism and eliminating chemical weapons.\"",
      "The \"Iranians\" referred to by the White House appeared to be a reference to the ousted Assad regime's backers in Tehran.",
      "\"President Al-Sharaa concluded with his hope that Syria would serve as a critical link in facilitating trade between east and west, and invited American companies to invest in Syrian oil and gas,\" Leavitt said.",
      "The White House said Tuesday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would also meet with the Syrian foreign minister in Turkey later this week.",
      "Mr. Trump became on Wednesday the first U.S. president to meet with a Syrian leader since Bill Clinton met with Assad's father Hafez al-Assad.",
      "A former insurgent, Sharaa ascended to power last year as Assad's government rapidly crumbled in the span of several days \u2014 bringing an abrupt end to the more than decadelong civil war that devastated Syria.",
      "Sharaa previously led Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamist rebel group that fought the Assad regime and had its roots in the al-Qaeda-allied Nusra Front. Sharaa also participated in the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq in the 2000s.",
      "Until last year, the U.S. had a $10 million bounty on Sharaa due to his leadership of HTS, which is designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "Syrian-American activist Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the nonprofit Syrian Emergency Task Force, is helping rebuild severed ties, and claims al-Sharaa is \"100% a changed man.\"",
      "\"I want to say, well, let's judge him by his actions,\" Mustafa told CBS News Wednesday. \"\u2026I'm not here to say any of these decisions in his checkered past is nonexistent. But the fact is, this is a changed man. And this is a person who is not interested in anything but rebuilding the country, and wants to see peace with all of the neighbors, wants to stay out of war with everyone in the Middle East.\"",
      "Despite the collapse of Assad's government, many of the intense U.S. sanctions placed on Syria during the last 13 years of Assad's reign have remained in place. The Trump administration appears to be pushing for normalized relations with the new government in Syria in the hope it can help curb Iranian influence in the country and the wider Middle East, despite Sharaa's roots in extremism.",
      "Saudi Arabia has also started building a relationship with Sharaa's government, a move that could also be aimed at limiting the influence of the kingdom's archrival Iran, which along with Russia, aided Assad in his fight against rebels during the civil war.",
      "Key U.S. ally Israel has been more wary of Sharaa, however, and has continued airstrikes against targets inside Syria \u2014 angering Sharaa's government.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham urged caution and said the White House should go through the proper congressional channels in to ease sanctions against Syria. Graham arrived in Turkey on Tuesday to meet with U.S. and Turkish officials about the situation in Syria.",
      "\"I am very inclined to support sanctions relief for Syria under the right conditions,\" Graham said in a statement. \"However, we must remember that the current leadership in Syria achieved its position through force of arms, not through the will of its people. I know the Trump administration has provided guidance to Syrian officials about conditions that need to be met before any sanctions can be relieved.\"",
      "Graham said he was \"certain that Congress would need to be informed of changes in conditions placed on Syria and how they have met those conditions before Congress can make an informed decision on whether or not it should approve the change in designation.\" He also said Israeli officials were \"extremely concerned\" about the \"state of play in Syria.\"",
      "\"Waiving congressionally passed sanctions is a complicated process,\" Graham said. \"While I would like to empower the new players in Syria, it has to be done in a coordinated fashion with our allies \u2014 especially our friends in Israel \u2014 so that numerous security concerns can be addressed.\"",

    "summary": "Donald Trump Jr. has maneuvered potentially lucrative business deals while also becoming a power player to his father.",
    "story": [
      "When the crypto mining firm American Bitcoin announced plans to go public on the Nasdaq stock exchange this week, the company called it a \"major milestone\" for a key stakeholder, Dominari Holdings \u2014 a little-known investment house that recently added a very recognizable name to its advisory board: Donald Trump Jr.",
      "It was the latest maneuver in a series of high-stakes, and potentially lucrative business deals Trump Jr. and his younger brother Eric, also a Dominari adviser, stand to benefit from.",
      "Since his father won the 2024 election, Trump Jr. has joined at least eight corporate boards or advisory committees, adding political clout and his famous family brand to companies that sell handguns, make drones, and offer healthcare services online.",
      "During President Trump's second term, his son Donald Jr. has morphed from a lower profile presence in Washington to what Trump first term press secretary Sean Spicer, who knows Trump Jr. well, describes as the \"most prominent non-elected representative of the MAGA base hands down, the number one surrogate and power player in the ecosystem outside of his father.\" The most overt symbol of that ascendence \u2013 and of the Trump family's unique blend of governing and deal-making, went public last month, with the announcement of a highly-exclusive private club, which is named\u00a0 \"Executive Branch.\"",
      "At the coming-out event, the cocktails flowed and servers passed caviar to A-list guests that included Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Attorney General Pam Bondi; Paul Atkins, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and FCC chair Brendan Carr. The Capital's buzzy newsletters revealed the club's eye-popping club membership fee: $500,000.",
      "Private clubs have long been a fixture of official Washington, where lobbyists and well-heeled donors can mingle with members of Congress and high-ranking officials.\u00a0 But this venture launched by the president's oldest son is something new \u2014 and, according to critics, serves as the latest example of how the Trump family has turbo-charged Washington's pay-to-play culture.",
      "\"I don't think there has ever been anything comparable to this use of the presidency to advance private business interests,\" said Joseph Briffaut, a law professor who specializes in government ethics at Columbia Law School.",
      "Critics fear a pay-to-play culture",
      "To government watchdogs, the members-only social club embodies what they say is an increasingly brazen mingling of private business interests and government policy.",
      "\"It's unseemly and it undermines the public's faith that the government is operating in the public interest,\" said Brett Kappel, a veteran Washington, D.C., election lawyer.",
      "Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor who has for years advocated for stronger ethics rules in the nation's capital, told CBS News she views the club as a blatant play to cash in with interest groups seeking access to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This is literally members bringing money into the pockets of Donald Trump Jr, and his business partners,\" Sloan said.",
      "Trump Jr's allies disagree. They argue the extravagant membership fee actually cuts against the claim that it is a vehicle for influence peddling \u2014 because members are already so well connected.",
      "\"If your goal was to let as many people in as possible, you'd have every lobbyist in DC join,\" said one source familiar with the concept behind the club, pointing out that members who could afford the sky-high admission fee would likely already be well known in Washington's power corridors.",
      "For his part, Trump Jr. disputes suggestions that he is cashing in on his father's name or testing any ethical boundaries.",
      "\"I'm a private citizen who has been a businessman my entire life,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS News.\u00a0 \"It's laughable that the left-wing media thinks that I should lock myself in a padded room and cease what I've been doing for over 25 years to earn a living and provide for my five children,\" Trump Jr. added.",
      "The White House calls Trump Jr's private sector dealings ethically sound, pointing out that President Trump's assets are held in a trust controlled by his family",
      "The \"Executive Branch\" club is only one of the ways Trump Jr. has raised his profile during his father's second term. The president's son has rapidly expanded the family's crypto profile and continued to pursue real estate investments.\u00a0 He has also been a front-facing leader of the MAGA empire, supplanting his sister Ivanka and brother-in-law, Jared Kushner, as the most high-profile \u2014 and politically astute \u2014 Trump scion in Washington.",
      "The \"Trump bump\"",
      "The family business is a global enterprise.\u00a0 Recently, Trump Jr. made a whirlwind tour of several foreign nations, including Serbia, Hungary and Bulgaria, where he looked in on real estate interests, delivered lucrative speeches and met with government leaders, according to The New York Times.",
      "At home, Trump Jr.'s move to join a spree of corporate boards in the role of adviser or board member traces in part to his relationship with Omeed Malik, the financier and mega Trump donor who is also Trump Jr.'s co-founder in the DC social club.",
      "Just days after the election, Malik brought on Trump Jr. as a partner in his venture capital firm, 1789 Capital, which says on its website that it invests in conservative companies and eschews \"woke capitalism\" and other left-wing causes, a deal a knowledgeable source said was in the works before the election. \u00a0 Trump Jr. soon joined the boards of arms retailer GrabAGun as well as the online health care company BlinkRX, both 1789 Capital properties.",
      "It is not hard to see the impact when a company adds Trump Jr. to its board. When Dominari Holdings inc., a wealth management and banking services company, announced that it was bringing on both of the president's sons, its stock price shot up 83% to a record high, eventually settling down to 30%above where it was before Trump Jr. joined.\u00a0 Shortly thereafter, Dominari's CEO announced that the company was planning investments in AI and data centers, growth industries where the Trump administration has been massively rolling back regulations. In a company press release, CEO Kyle Wood he cited Trump Jr's and Eric Trump's \"strategic insight\" in both of those sectors.",
      "And this week, the Bitcoin mining company owned partly by Trump sons Donald Jr. and Eric engineered a listing on the NASDAQ after merging with a smaller, publicly traded mining firm called Gryphon Digital Mining Inc.\u00a0 Dominari Holdings is effectively acting as the banker for the deal and has been reaching out to potential investors.",
      "In another example of the so-called \"Trump bump,\" the stock price of Unusual Machines, a Florida-based drone manufacturer, nearly doubled when the news hit that Trump Jr. was joining the board.",
      "Unusual Machines, which manufactures its unmanned aerial vehicles and components in the US, is aiming to reduce American dependence on Chinese drones.\u00a0 But for the time being the company is reliant on Chinese parts, which means that the Trump administration's yo-yoing tariffs on China could hurt the company's bottom line. CEO Allan Evans has said he would not ask Trump Jr. to intervene with the federal government on the company's behalf for relief.",
      "\"I would never ask him to do anything or facilitate anything like that,\" Evans told the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Trump Jr. and his defenders clap back at critics who suggest his moves to join board seats and champion business interests carry the echoes of past ventures by presidential relatives like Billy Carter, Neil Bush or Hunter Biden. They call him a skilled entrepreneur with a long record of business success who has capitalized on his position by making shrewd business decisions, cultivating lucrative connections among tech and finance leaders, all while building up a powerful political operation in Washington.",
      "The Hunter Biden comparisons, in particular, have drawn a sharp response: \"He became a 'businessman' after his dad got elected,\" Trump Jr. said in a social media post. \"I joined a Venture Capital Firm that invests in private American companies - Nothing to do with the government.\"",
      "MAGA power broker",
      "\"Don Jr. was an accomplished businessman long before his father got into politics and just continues to grow,\" said Sean Spicer, who served the president as press secretary in his first term and now hosts the Sean Spicer podcast.",
      "Today, Spicer says Trump Jr. is the man to see. Spicer, who worked closely with the president's son during the first term, says has seen the evolution up close.",
      "\"If the phone rings and it's Don Jr., you better pick it up on the first ring,\" Spicer said. During the 2020 campaign Trump Jr. emerged as a potent asset for his father, stumping on the trail and fully embodying the MAGA brand.\u00a0 He flung \"red meat\" to the rapturous crowds at Trump rallies and showed an instinct for the jugular that reminded observers of Trump senior.",
      "A big part of his success, his friends say, is an ability to blend with the grassroots\u00a0 MAGA world.",
      "\"Don Jr. isn't just a billionaire's son, he's one of us,\" said Andrew Kolvet, spokesman for Turning Point USA, the pre-eminent MAGA aligned youth organization and an associate of Trump Jr.",
      "Trump Jr.'s inside and outside game makes him a unique player in Trump's Washington, his allies say -- someone with unparalleled clout within the administration who is also able to operate freely in the private sector.",
      "He has forged close ties with powerful tech titans like Elon Musk and David O. Sacks, the angel investor who was a key figure in bringing a powerful and wealthy contingent of Silicon Valley over to Trump. Sacks is currently serving as the White House Czar for both Crypto and AI.\u00a0 Last month he became Member #1 of the Executive Branch club.",

      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Rep. Shri Thanedar of Michigan backed down from his attempt to force a vote on impeaching President Trump after it lacked support from his own party.",
      "The House was expected to vote Wednesday evening to table Thanedar's motion to impeach Mr. Trump for alleged high crimes and misdemeanors, which would have effectively killed it.",
      "Thanedar filed his\u00a0seven articles of impeachment\u00a0against Mr. Trump in April, but moved Tuesday to bring it up as \"privileged,\" requiring the House to act on the motion within two legislative days. But Thanedar changed course by Wednesday afternoon after having conversations with his colleagues.",
      "\"Instead, I will add to my articles of impeachment and continue to rally the support of both Democrats and Republicans to defend the Constitution with me,\" he wrote, adding that he will \"continue to pursue all avenues to put this President on notice and hold him accountable for his many impeachable crimes.\"",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said he explained to Thanedar that \"it's not enough to be right.\"",
      "\"You need consensus,\" Raskin said. \"You need a strategy to move forward because impeachment as a constitutional matter is a mixed question of law and politics.\"",
      "Thanedar's 29-page resolution accuses Mr. Trump of obstructing justice, overriding Congress' power to appropriate funds, abusing the power of the presidency, violating First Amendment rights and unlawfully creating the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "His effort was not expected to receive much support from Democrats. The three Democrats who were listed as initial co-sponsors of the resolution when it was introduced last month quickly pulled their names after learning it was not cleared by leadership. And, Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the Democratic caucus chair, said the move to impeach Mr. Trump was impractical because Republicans control both chambers of Congress.",
      "\"This is not the right approach we should be taking,\" Aguilar told reporters earlier Wednesday, adding that Democratic leadership would be joining Republicans in voting to block the attempt.",
      "Aguilar said Democrats are focused on Republican attempts to cut Medicaid through the reconciliation process as they seek to slash spending to pay for trillions in tax cuts.",
      "\"Everything else is a distraction,\" Aguilar said.",
      "Thanedar acknowledged the hesitancy in his party to impeach Mr. Trump in a news conference Wednesday morning, but defended his action as something supported by the public and said that he would continue pushing the issue \"until we have a victory.\"",
      "\"Many people in my party and elsewhere say, 'Is this the right time to do this?,\" he said. \"People all over the country are saying this is the right time to do it!\"",
      "\"Some Democrats have called me a lunatic, just like the president has called me lunatic,\" he said. \"Nobody has said to me, 'Mr. Thanedar, the seven articles of impeachment that you presented to the U.S. Congress, they're piece of s***. They're not good. You missed the point.'\"",

Amy Klobuchar is set to give a speech on the rule of law and what she paints as President Trump's overreach on Wednesday night, as Democrats look to find effective messaging that will resonate with voters about the early days of the Republican's second term in the White House.",
      "Excerpts obtained by CBS News ahead of the event hosted by The New Republic show Klobuchar, a leading Senate Democrat who has not ruled out a 2028 presidential run, plans to make the case that \"Donald Trump is trying to remake the executive office into one that is immune from outside accountability.\"",
      "\"He's engaging in unprecedented overreach that disregards the rule of law and pretends as if the independent judiciary is a bug rather than a feature of our system,\" the Minnesota senator plans to say, according to the excerpts.",
      "Mr. Trump's first months since he returned to the White House have found the president and his allies leaning heavily on executive power. His administration has clashed with Democrats over its attempts at curtailing spending already approved by Congress and has\u00a0tangled with multiple\u00a0federal judges\u00a0over immigration.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai responded to Klobuchar's planned remarks by criticizing Democrats over the legal cases Trump faced during the 2024 cycle and the party's immigration policies.",
      "\"The Trump administration will continue to legally use every lever of power granted to the Executive Branch by the Constitution and Congress to finally put Americans and America First,\" Desai said in an email.",
      "Klobuchar, who is the leading Democrat on the Senate's agriculture committee and served as the Hennepin County Attorney in Minnesota before being elected to Washington, is also expected to try to put a real-world face on what she views as the impact of tariffs during Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "\"Who's the roadkill with Trump's tariffs?\" Klobuchar's excerpts show. \"The small businesses. The small farmers. The consumers who are facing a $4,000 tariff tax.\"",
      "Mr. Trump recently took to social media and defended his tariff policy, writing that \"the very STUPID Democrats are doing everything within their power to disparage what is happening. They are totally unhinged, and have lost all levels of Confidence. It is a financial REVOLUTION, and they are being Crushed.\"",
      "Minnesota's senior senator is viewed as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, after a 2020 primary run that saw her finish a strong and surprising third in the New Hampshire primary only to face struggles expanding her base of support shortly afterward. Klobuchar has not indicated whether she will seek the presidency in 2028, but did not explicitly rule out running when asked by \"Meet The Press\" moderator Kristen Welker on Sunday.",
      "Since her 2020 campaign, Klobuchar's political power has risen in Washington while she's also maintained a major focus on antitrust issues, a topic that is also interwoven into her approach during her upcoming remarks on Wednesday.",

With our economy heading toward a cliff, you may ask \u2013 \"Why is this important to me?\" It's a legitimate question,\" Klobuchar is set to say Wednesday. \"My answer? Everything we hold faith in across this country \u2014 including our economy \u2014 is glued together by law.\"",
      "Klobuchar's speech comes as intrigue continues to swirl about who truly is the leader of the Democratic party after the setbacks the left faced in the 2024 election. Democrats are looking to chart a path forward after last fall's election saw the party lose the White House and Senate and fail to retake the House. At the same time, there's clear tension within the base of the party about the best way to politically challenge Mr. Trump after his convincing win in November.",
      "Even though national Democrats struggled in 2024, the Minnesota senator is fresh off a strong political performance in her home state.",
      "Last year, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris won Minnesota by more than 4 points, in what amounted to a surprisingly close result in a state that has not voted for a Republican for president since Richard Nixon in 1972. Klobuchar in turn performed far better than the top of the Democratic ticket in Minnesota as she successfully ran for a fourth term, winning around 135,000 more votes than Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov.

    "summary": "President Trump is now seeking to implement the idea through an executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats and the Biden administration dropped plans to set drug price caps based on the amount paid in other high-income countries, during talks years ago to push through the law that empowered Medicare to negotiate down the cost of prescription medications.",
      "A version of the idea was revived by President Trump in the executive order signed Monday, which called on the Department of Health and Human Services next month to draw up regulations to impose price restrictions tied to lower amounts paid in other developed nations, if drugmakers did not voluntarily reduce what they were charging in the U.S.",
      "\"Democrats could have done this a long time ago. They have fought like hell, for the drug companies. And they knew they were doing the wrong thing,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking at a White House event to announce the move.",
      "For Democrats on Capitol Hill, this kind of approach to price controls has roots in a bill their own party successfully passed under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.",
      "As part of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate the price of costly drugs it covered, the bill passed by House Democrats wanted the maximum price to be tied to an average based on prices paid in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.",
      "\"We were hoping to get Trump. Trump said, 'I want to negotiate.' But then Republicans in Congress got to him,\" said Wendell Primus, who served for nearly two decades as Pelosi's top aide on health policy.",
      "The bill did not make it through the Senate at the time, which was controlled by Mr. Trump's party. After Democrats flipped control of the Senate, the idea ran into headwinds years later, as Biden aides and lawmakers tried to incorporate the measure into the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Multiple Democrats involved in the talks on Capitol Hill at the time blamed a series of meetings in early 2021 with the staff from the Senate Finance Committee and party leadership for scuttling the idea.",
      "Staff on the committee said that they were worried that moderate Democrats like then-Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would not support the bill if it included the measure, Primus said. Menendez and Sinema are no longer in the Senate.",
      "\"Members did not want to have something referencing foreign countries. They wanted it to make a function of the manufacturer's price here, what drug companies were offering to commercial insurers,\" Primus said.",
      "One former Biden White House aide involved in the talks said that there were several senators who understood that drug prices were too high, but they worried those price caps could undercut innovation from drugmakers in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the deal struck by lawmakers and White House aides to pass the law in 2022 ultimately turned to a different formula: capping them using calculations based on the price previously paid by Medicare and a fixed discount off the list price in the private U.S. market.",
      "\"President Biden and Democrats in Congress cared about getting something done, and so there was a compromise on the table that wasn't perfect, but it was going to make a huge amount of difference. And so that's the law they ultimately enacted,\" said Christen Linke-Young, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Mr. Biden.",
      "Medicare has gone on to implement the law, resulting in talks that are continuing under the current Trump administration to lower the maximum price that the federal insurance program will pay for a growing list of costly drugs.",
      "\"It's a good thing for prescription drug costs in this country to be lower, we need to continue to work on that. And one of the ways to do that is actually put a proposal before Congress and get it enacted, so it has the force of law,\" said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, as the White House was working with their allies in Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration moved to formally scrap a bid by Mr. Trump to impose caps tied to lower prices in other high-income countries using executive power during his first term.",
      "Called the \"most favored nation\" model, Trump officials had directed Medicare to only reimburse hospitals and clinics for some costly drugs based on the lowest price paid for in other high-income countries.",
      "CMS under Mr. Biden ultimately rescinded that move in 2022, after a legal fight that had blocked the proposal on the grounds that the Trump administration had unlawfully shortcutted the normal rulemaking steps to finalize the policy.",
      "\"The proposal was always pretty transparently illegal. The statute says that Medicare has to pay for prescription drugs in one particular way, and the Trump administration proposal was that we are going to ignore the statute and pay for drugs in an entirely different way. If the statute allowed that, a president before Donald Trump would have done it,\" Linke-Young said.",
      "A White House official under Mr. Trump disagreed with the accusation that their initial proposal was unlawful, arguing that the initial authority they used for the \"demonstration\" model in Medicare used powers that were broadly written by Democrats.",
      "While they are not planning to go down the exact same path, the official said, saying that they \"learned certain things from that first demonstration,\" the Trump administration believes they \"absolutely have that authority in our pocket.\"",
      "\"We are confident that we have authorities within our government programs to do this. And any dispute from the Biden administration is an intentional misinterpretation of the statute for political reasons, because they are the ones that walked away,\" the White House official said.",
      "Trump administration officials have painted their second run at the \"most favored nation\" idea as even broader in scope than their first term, which had been limited to only some costly drugs administered by healthcare providers through Medicare Part B.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday that they \"firmly believe\" they have the ability to pursue wider actions to push drugmakers to lower their prices within Medicare. They cited other authorities in the law being considered like section 402, which affords HHS powers to \"develop and engage in experiments\" which could affect payment rates in Medicaid as well.",
      "Asked this week on Fox Business Network whether the president's promise of steep drug price cuts would also extend to Medicare Part D, which covers the broad swath of prescriptions filled at drug store pharmacies, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said \"they absolutely will.\"",
      "\"They'll apply to Medicare, and they'll apply in the private market as well,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Asked Tuesday whether he supported the president's plan, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he thought \"it'll be the subject of probably multiple lawsuits, and I think the courts will probably have something to say about it.\"",

    "summary": "Challenges to President Trump's use of emergency power to impose sweeping tariffs cite legal doctrines that have been embraced by the conservative Supreme Court justices.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Legal challenges to President Trump's tariffs could put the president on a collision course with a Supreme Court that he shaped, as his use of emergency power to unilaterally impose the levies could run into legal doctrines championed by the conservative justices to limit executive authority.",
      "Several things have to happen before the Supreme Court would consider the legality of Mr. Trump's tariffs: the losing party in a lawsuit challenging his tariffs would have to appeal all the way up to the high court, and at least four justices would then have to agree to review the lower court's decision. The high court would then have to decide the case on the merits, rather than a procedural issue.",
      "But if that were to occur, the president could face skepticism from its six-member conservative wing \u2014 which includes three justices he appointed \u2014\u00a0 as the cases raise doctrines that have been embraced by the conservative legal movement and invoked by the justices themselves in other cases: the major questions doctrine and nondelegation doctrine.",
      "\"If this issue gets to the Supreme Court, which is a big if, and if it comes down to the major questions doctrine or the nondelegation doctrine, and those are big ifs as well, we believe the court's precedent requires them to rule in our favor,\" said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, who is involved in a lawsuit brought by the Liberty Justice Center on behalf of a group of small businesses in the U.S. Court of International Trade.",
      "That suit is one of at least six court battles targeting Mr. Trump's tariffs, which he has rolled out through a series of executive orders starting in February. The most sweeping tariffs were announced in April on what the White House has called \"Liberation Day,\" when the president imposed a 10% baseline tariff on nearly all U.S. trading partners and higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" on imports from 57 countries, which are now largely paused.",
      "The tariffs have been in flux as the Trump administration has sought to engage in trade negotiations with countries to possibly lessen their burden.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump announced a framework for an agreement with the United Kingdom, which would leave in place 10% tariffs on imports from the country. Then, on Sunday, the White House said that the U.S. and China had agreed to a temporary easing of tariffs following negotiations between the two countries over the weekend.",
      "The reductions would lessen the U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports to roughly 30%, while levies on American goods would drop to 10%.",
      "While the president has said that there are more deals in the works, he hasn't unveiled any additional agreements yet. Meanwhile, the lawsuits are moving forward. The U.S. Court of International Trade on Tuesday weighed a temporary bid to block the tariffs in one of the cases, which was the first major test of their legality.",
      "The court battles may be brought by different parties, but several of them invoke the major questions and nondelegation doctrines in arguing that the tariffs cannot stand.",
      "Major questions doctrine",
      "Under the major questions doctrine, Congress must give clear authorization for a federal agency to decide an issue of major political or economic significance \u2014 a view that conservatives on the court have often cited in recent years to limit\u00a0federal agency actions.",
      "In the suit that Somin is involved in, the small businesses are challenging Mr. Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The plaintiffs argue that his attempt to use the law violates the major questions doctrine because Congress did not \"speak clearly in granting such a broad and consequential power to upend the global economy.\"",
      "IEEPA makes no mention of the words tariffs or taxes, and no other president has used the law to impose levies on trading partners. The law gives the president the authority to impose economic sanctions, such as freezing foreign assets, after declaring a national emergency. Mr. Trump has declared that persistent trade deficits pose a national emergency and said the 10% baseline tariffs will remain in place until he determines that the threat posed by trade deficits is resolved.",
      "In another lawsuit, led by the stationary company Simplified, lawyers with the New Civil Liberties Alliance argue that because Mr. Trump's executive orders present a question of major political and economic significance, the major questions doctrine requires the president to show that IEEPA clearly gives him the power to impose tariffs. Mr. Trump, the suit alleges, cannot make that showing.",
      "\"Under the major questions doctrine, the court says that if Congress is going to delegate a significant power to the executive branch, we expect to see something pretty clear about it,\" said Andrew Morris, one of the NCLA lawyers representing Simplified. \"This is as big as it gets. This is restructuring the entire tariff framework for every country.\"",
      "Both the NCLA and the Liberty Justice Center are conservative-backed public interest law firms.",
      "The Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research organization, estimated in February \u2014 after the president rolled out his first round of levies \u2014 that Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China would cost the typical U.S. household more than $1,200 annually.\u00a0The president's 25% tariffs on most imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as a 10% increase in tariffs on products from China proposed by Mr. Trump at the time, mark the \"largest tax increase in at least a generation,\" the organization said in a\u00a0report.",
      "Separately, the Tax Foundation found that Mr. Trump's current tariff regime will raise $2.1 trillion in revenue over the next 10 years and reduce U.S. gross domestic product by 0.7%.",
      "That economic impact is at least as significant, and likely much larger, than actions that the Supreme Court has previously ruled were \"major questions\" that required a clear statement by Congress to authorize the executive action, the companies involved in the lawsuits say. Those efforts include former President Joe Biden's attempt to cancel roughly $400 billion in student loan debt and a COVID-era vaccine mandate for companies with more than 100 employees, both of which were blocked by the Supreme Court.",
      "\"Here, we have an obvious major question in that this is the biggest trade war since the Great Depression. It makes previous cases look small by comparison,\" Somin said. \"To put it mildly, it is very far from clear that Congress delegated that kind of sweeping power to the president here.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued in court filings that Congress, through IEEPA, delegated to the president the power to regulate importation through tariffs under specific circumstances. Justice Department lawyers have also said the major questions doctrine does not apply to presidential actions, especially those involving national security and foreign affairs.",
      "Nondelegation doctrine",
      "If a case involving Mr. Trump's tariffs makes it to the Supreme Court and if the high court declines to apply the major questions doctrine, lawyers say the levies also violate the nondelegation doctrine, a long dormant legal concept rooted in the separation of powers.",
      "Under that principle, Congress cannot delegate its legislative powers to executive branch agencies. The nondelegation doctrine was last invoked by the Supreme Court in two cases during the New Deal era, but some members of the Supreme Court have advocated for reviving it.",
      "The high court has the chance to do that through a case challenging the constitutionality of a Federal Communications Commission's mechanism for expanding phone and internet access to low-income and rural communities. But following oral arguments in March, the high court appeared skeptical of the effort to invalidate the fund.",
      "In the tariff fights playing out in the courts, the plaintiffs argue that even if IEEPA granted the president broad, unlimited authority to issue tariffs worldwide, it would be an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. Congress has the power to tax and regulate commerce with foreign nations, and IEEPA does not have an \"intelligible principle\" that limits the president's authority in slapping tariffs on imports, they say.",
      "\"If Congress passed this emergency statute that permits the president to rewrite tariff law from top to bottom and change it on a whim \u2014 set it at 10% across the board then 125% for China, then increase it, then pause it, then put it back in place \u2014 if Congress can give that to the president, there's no limitation on the power passed along,\" Morris said. \"That's a problem.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has notched some significant wins before the Supreme Court, and the court's conservative 6-3 majority may be sympathetic to some of his assertions of executive power, such his firings of independent agency heads.",
      "But the Supreme Court's recent decisions \u2014 and writings from the justices \u2014 foreshadow that it could view his use of emergency power to unilaterally levy tariffs on goods from nearly every country as a step too far.",
      "\"One of the benefits of being a justice is you can reverse or ignore precedents,\" Somin said, \"but if you follow your own doctrines consistently, the outcome in this case should be pretty clear.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats will hold hearings next week on the dramatic overhaul at the Department of Health and Human Services amid widespread terminations that have drawn questions about the functioning of key health programs.",
      "The hearings, led by Democratic Sens. Peter Welch of Vermont and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, will center on the impact of the restructuring, featuring testimony from former officials from agencies under the HHS umbrella, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the National Institute of Health, among others.",
      "A sweeping restructuring ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has played out in recent weeks, with department-wide layoffs at health agencies. HHS announced in March that it aimed to reduce its employees by nearly 25% with layoffs, buyouts and early retirement offers.",
      "The restructuring came after thousands of probationary workers at health agencies received termination letters in February amid a government-wide effort by the Elon Musk-helmed Department of Government Efficiency to cut recently hired or promoted employees, before the firings were put on pause amid court intervention. And earlier this month, HHS moved for a second time to fire probationary employees, in what an HHS spokesperson said was the \"the final step of the process.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Welch called the HHS overhaul an \"assault on the structures that provide scientific research, that are engaged in disease prevention, that are engaged in the delivery of health.\"",
      "\"You've got a Health and Human Service Secretary in Robert Kennedy who is on a destructive rampage, tearing apart institutional structures that have been in place to help us with the science and research and delivery of healthcare in this country,\" Welch added.",
      "The widespread restructuring has raised concerns about some key health agency functions, like monitoring food and drug safety and preparing for the next pandemic, with cuts hitting the FDA and CDC, while also impacting departments that handle mental health, federal poverty guidelines and other services. Some of the layoff notices were ultimately revoked.",
      "Still, Kennedy told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook last month that things were going according to plan, noting that the agency had grown in the past four years, and \"these reductions just bring it down to pre-COVID levels.\"",
      "\"What this reorganization is meant to do is to eliminate the redundancies, to streamline the agency, and to reorient it so that we are trying to make America healthy,\" Kennedy said.",
      "The HHS secretary returned Wednesday to Capitol Hill, appearing before congressional committees for the first time since his arduous confirmation process.",
      "Last month, the leaders of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee requested testimony about Kennedy's \"reorganization\" of HHS in a letter, citing his commitment to come before the committee on a quarterly basis \u2014 a commitment that GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a medical doctor, outlined following his decision to deliver Kennedy the key support he needed to become secretary, despite consternation over his record on vaccines.",
      "Cassidy said in his opening statement at Wednesday's hearing, which focused on the White House's proposed budget, that \"people fear change even when it's from worse to better. But without a clearly defined plan or objective, people assume the worst.\"",
      "\"Americans need direct reassurance from the administration and from you, Mr. Secretary, that these reforms will make their lives easier, not harder,\" Cassidy said.",
      "Democrats derided Kennedy's nomination during the confirmation process, and Welch, who sits on the committee that ultimately advanced Kennedy's nomination said at the time that \"it's hard, in many ways, to see how we could do worse.\"",
      "Three months later, Welch said Kennedy has \"exceeded my low expectations.\"",

      "U.S. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles ordered the release of Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national and postdoctoral associate who was studying and teaching at Georgetown on a student visa and who is currently detained by ICE in Texas. Giles found that Suri's detention violated his First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights.",
      "Suri is married to a U.S. citizen whose father was a government official and advisor in Gaza.",
      "The government cited his alleged \"close connections\" to a Hamas official as justification for revoking the visa, saying he was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda.\" In March, Suri was surrounded and detained by masked Homeland Security agents as he was returning to his home in Rosslyn, Virginia, after breaking his fast for Ramadan.",
      "One day after he was taken into custody, Giles blocked the government from deporting Suri as court proceedings played out.",
      "ACLU Attorney Sophia Gregg called Suri's detention an \"ongoing infringement\" on his constitutional rights that \"chills the speech of millions and millions\" across the country who are protesting the ongoing war in Gaza.",
      "In a statement after the ruling, the ACLU's legal director in Virginia Eden Heilman called Suri's detention an \"unprecedented attack by this administration designed to punish students and academics for their views.\"",
      "The Justice Department, as it did in the cases of other students who were detained for what the government has classified as \"illegal protests,\" said that only immigration judges could free Suri and that the government had a right to detain him until his removal proceedings were finalized.",
      "Giles disagreed with their arguments.",
      "\"The government has consistently made that argument across multiple jurisdictions,\" Giles said. \"No one has adopted that.\" She said in her order from the bench that she has jurisdiction to free Suri while his habeas proceedings play out in Virginia and his removal proceedings continue.",

      "\"I join several other courts... that speech regarding the conflict [in Gaza] and opposing Israel's military actions are likely protected First Amendment speech,\" Giles said, adding that she finds Suri's \"detention and apprehension was caused by his speech.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Giles ruled that she has appropriate jurisdiction in the case and that the Eastern District of Virginia is the proper venue, siding with Suri's attorneys despite a Justice Department argument that the case should be moved to Texas, where Suri is detained.",
      "In their initial court filings, Suri's attorneys said his detention is \"unjustified\" and violates his due process rights. They argued that the Trump administration's targeting of noncitizens for removal based on protected speech, namely his and his wife's views of Israel and Gaza, is \"arbitrary and capricious\" and constitutes viewpoint discrimination. They said that he has no criminal record and has not been charged with any crime.",
      "The complaint alleged that the couple had \"long been doxxed and smeared\" online by an \"anonymously-run blacklisting site\" known as The Canary Mission. The site alleges that Saleh, who Suri's attorneys said is a U.S. citizen, \"has worked for Hamas, expressed support for Hamas terrorism and called for Israel's destruction,\" according to a profile dedicated to her on the site. The Canary Mission, the complaint said, runs a blacklist of individuals who its creators believe support Palestinian rights and \"is infamous for bullying, slandering, and defaming academics and students.\" The complaint also alleges that the couple were \"smeared\" by other websites.",
      "A Georgetown University spokesperson said Suri obtained his visa \"to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"",
      "\"We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,\" the school spokesperson told CBS News. \"We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be",
      "difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.\"",

      "SACRAMENTO \u2014 Gov. Gavin Newsom didn't expect to be reckoning with another health care crisis.",
      "In March, as President Trump and congressional Republicans escalated a nationwide debate over whether to slash health care for poor and disabled Americans, the Democratic governor had to tell state lawmakers that California's health care costs had spiraled out of control due to major Medicaid initiatives he backed \u2014 including the nation's largest expansion of taxpayer-financed health care for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "His top officials at the state Department of Finance quietly disclosed to California lawmakers in a letter that the state had borrowed $3.4 billion to pay health insurers, doctors, and hospitals caring for patients enrolled in California's Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal. Facing rising health care costs amid a deepening state budget crisis, Newsom now must contemplate rolling back coverage and benefits.",
      "The second-term governor faces a tough political decision: renege on his promise to achieve universal health care and strip coverage from millions of immigrants who lack legal status or look elsewhere for budget cuts. With nearly 15 million low-income or disabled residents enrolled in Medi-Cal, California has more to lose on health care than any other state. Yet even as Newsom has condemned Mr. Trump's approach to\u00a0tariffs\u00a0and environmental policies, he is already adjusting his health policies.",
      "Complicating his political tightrope: Polling shows that providing health care coverage for immigrants without legal status has tepid support. And any resulting budget trouble could harm his political legacy should he run for president in 2028.",
      "\"We all know that the cuts are definitely coming,\" said Carlos Alarcon, a health and public benefits analyst with the California Immigrant Policy Center, which has helped spearhead a decadelong campaign in California to expand Medicaid to eligible immigrants without legal status. \"The governor should keep his commitment \u2014 we'll be very disappointed if we see cuts and rollbacks. When times get hard, it's always our marginalized and underserved communities that lose out.\"",
      "California allows any low-income adults to enroll in Medi-Cal if they earn 138% of the federal poverty level, or $21,597 a year or less, regardless of immigration status. But the costs have been dramatically higher than expected.",
      "Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown first expanded Medi-Cal to people age 19 and younger without legal status, but he expressed reluctance to go further because of potential costs. Newsom signed bills into law adding people age 20 and older. An estimated 1.6 million immigrants without legal status are now covered, and costs have soared to $9.5 billion per year, up from $6.4 billion estimated in November. The federal government chips in roughly $1.1 billion of that total for pregnancy and emergency care.",
      "\"We can expand out of the graciousness of our heart to everywhere and anywhere, but the moment these resources run out, now everybody loses. We're hitting that breaking point,\" said California Assembly member David Tangipa (R-Fresno). \"Either we get fiscally responsible, or there's not going to be services for anybody \u2014 and that includes the Californian and the undocumented immigrant.\"",
      "Democratic leaders responsible for approving the state budget declined interviews. In a statement, state Sen. Mar\u00eda Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles), who championed the expansion in the legislature, said, \"Rolling back this progress would be a harmful and shortsighted decision.\"",
      "Lawmakers are considering freezing enrollment for immigrants without legal status, imposing cost-sharing measures such as drug copays or premiums, or restricting benefits, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified to protect relationships at the state Capitol.",
      "The governor's budget revision proposed an enrollment freeze as soon as 2026 for immigrants 19 and older who lack legal status, along with a $100 monthly premium for them starting in 2027. Newsom pledged that no children would be affected and insisted that \"no one will be kicked off their health care.\" He blamed a \"Trump Slump\" for cutting $16 billion from the state's projected revenue.",
      "\"This is going to be very problematic for the governor. Budget cuts will disrupt the lives of millions of immigrants who just got health care, but the governor has got to do something, because this is not sustainable,\" said Mark Peterson, an expert on health care and national politics at UCLA. \"The prospect of cutting other places in order to support immigrants living in the country illegally would be a hard political sale; I don't see that happening.\"",
      "Should Newsom, along with the Democratic-controlled legislature, be forced to make cuts, he could argue he had no choice. Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans have threatened states like California with the latest U.S. House proposal cutting Medicaid funding by 10 percentage points for states that provide coverage for immigrants without legal status. For Newsom, political analysts say, Mr. Trump could make an easy scapegoat.",
      "\"He can blame Trump \u2014 there's only so much money to go around,\" said Mike Madrid, an anti-Trump Republican political analyst in California who specializes in Latino issues. \"It's making people look at the health care that they can't afford and ask, 'Why the hell are we giving it for free to people who are here illegally?'\"",
      "The exorbitant cost has come as somewhat of a surprise.",
      "In Newsom's first budget proposal as governor \u2014 in which he called for expanding Medi-Cal to young adults without legal status \u2014 his administration estimated it would cost roughly $2.4 billion annually to extend benefits to all eligible people regardless of status. But the latest figure reported to legislators was nearly four times as much.",
      "Newsom declined to respond to questions from KFF Health News, instead referencing previous comments that leave the door open to scaling back Medi-Cal. The governor noted \"sober\" discussions with lawmakers and said cutting Medi-Cal is \"an open-ended question\" that the president will heavily influence.",
      "\"What's the impact of Donald Trump on a lot of these things? What's the impact of federal vandalism to a lot of these programs?\" Newsom asked rhetorically in December, suggesting it's unclear whether he'll be able to sustain the expansion to immigrants without legal status in future years.",
      "Newsom expanded Medi-Cal in three phases, starting with immigrants ages 19 to 25, who became eligible in 2020, resisting pressure from health care advocates for one big, costly expansion. He argued doing it incrementally would ultimately save California money.",
      "\"It is the right thing morally and ethically,\" Newsom said in 2020. \"It is also the financially responsible thing to do.\"",
      "Record budget surpluses in recent years allowed Democrats to continue. Older adults ages 50 to 64 became eligible in 2022, and Newsom closed the gap the following year, approving coverage starting in 2024 for the biggest group, those ages 26 to 49.",
      "But the costs have grown tremendously while the budget picture has soured, according to a KFF analysis of the most recent 2023 records available from the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers Medi-Cal.",
      "Aside from children, it was more expensive to provide Medicaid coverage to immigrants without legal status than to legal residents. For instance, Medi-Cal paid L.A. Care, a major health insurer in Los Angeles, an average of $495.32 monthly to provide care for a childless adult without legal status and $266.77 for a legal resident without kids.",
      "Not only were immigrants without legal status more expensive, California footed most of the cost. The state paid roughly between 60% and 70% of health care costs for a childless adult immigrant covered by L.A. Care, and about 10% for a legal resident without kids. Those costs don't encapsulate the entire cost of providing care, which can vary depending on where Medi-Cal patients live, and grow higher when filling prescriptions, going to the dentist, or seeking mental health care.",
      "These payments also differ by insurer, but the trend holds across the state's Medi-Cal health insurance plans. Patients in most of the state can choose from more than one health plan.",
      "Children without legal status in many cases were cheaper to cover than children who were legal residents. Generally, kids are healthier and require less care.",
      "Mike Genest, who served as finance director under former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, argued that the state should have planned for the immense price tag.",
      "\"The idea that we'd be able to afford in the long run paying for health care for all these undocumented people \u2014 it's beyond unsustainable,\" Genest said.",
      "While costs are high now, the expansion of Medi-Cal will result in long-term savings to taxpayers and the health care system, said Anthony Wright, who previously lobbied for the expansion as the head of the nonprofit Health Access and is now fighting Medicaid cuts as the executive director of Families USA, based in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"They're going to be showing up in our health care system regardless,\" Wright said. \"Leaving them without health insurance is just going to end in more crowded emergency rooms, and it's going to cost even more. It doesn't make any sense economically for them to be uninsured; that takes critical revenue from clinics and hospitals, just causing more problems.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday told Gulf leaders he urgently wants \"to make a deal\" with Iran to wind down its nuclear program but said Tehran must end its support of proxy groups throughout the region as part of any potential agreement.",
      "Iran \"must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars and permanently and verifiably cease pursuit of nuclear weapons,\" Trump said in remarks at a meeting of leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council hosted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Saudi capital. \"They cannot have a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "The U.S. and Iran have engaged in four rounds of talks since early last month focused on Iran's nuclear program. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that he believes brokering a deal is possible but that the window is closing.",
      "The president's strongly worded push on Iran to cease support of Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen come as its proxy network has faced significant setbacks in the 19 months since Hamas-led militants launched the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and 251 were taken as hostages back into Gaza. Some of those hostages have been killed or have been released as part of deals, but there are still some 58 hostages being held by Hamas.",
      "In Iran, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called Mr. Trump's remarks \"deceitful\" but did not directly address his call on Iran to cease support of proxy groups.",
      "Later, Mr. Trump, in an exchange with reporters aboard Air Force One, urged Iran \"to make the right decision\" about its nuclear program \"because something's going to happen one way or the other.\"",
      "\"So we'll either do it friendly or we'll do it very unfriendly,\" Mr. Trump warned. \"And that won't be pleasant.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said that he believed the moment was ripe \"for a future free from the grip of Hezbollah terrorists.\" Hezbollah is severely weakened after its war last year with Israel in which much of its top leadership was killed, and after losing a key ally with the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad, a conduit for Iran to send arms.",
      "Secretary of Energy Chris Wright told CBS News' Weijia Jiang that he anticipates a deal with Iran by the end of the year, calling it a \"very active dialogue in all of my travels in the Middle East.\"",
      "\"I think sometime later this year, and hopefully on the sooner, and hopefully much sooner than late this year, we'll see large breakthroughs in Iran,\" Wright said. \"Look, this is a win, win deal. Iran agrees to completely give up their nuclear program. They can have trade, they can have engagement with the rest of the world. They can bring down rampant inflation. They can bring investment, make their society better, and the rest of the region can thrive, if it's not constantly under bombardment by Iranian proxies or the threat of a nuclear armed Iran This is by far the biggest security issue in the Middle East.\"",
      "Lifting sanctions on Syria",
      "Mr. Trump's comments on Iran came after he met Wednesday with Syrian interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a face-to-face engagement with the onetime insurgent leader who spent years imprisoned by U.S. forces after being captured in Iraq.",
      "In a readout on the two leaders' meeting in Saudi Arabia, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump had told the Syrian leader that \"he has a tremendous opportunity to do something historic in his country,\" and urged him to join Saudi Arabia in signing onto the U.S.-backed Abraham Accords, to normalize ties with Israel.",
      "Mr. Trump agreed to meet al-Sharaa at the end of his stay in Saudi Arabia. The president then headed to Qatar, where he is being honored with a state visit. His Mideast tour also will take him to the United Arab Emirates later this week.",
      "Al-Sharaa was named president of Syria in January, a month after a stunning offensive by insurgent groups led by al-Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, stormed Damascus and ended the 54-year rule of the Assad family.",
      "Mr. Trump said he decided to meet with al-Sharaa after being encouraged to do so by Prince Mohammed and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The president also pledged to lift yearslong sanctions on Syria.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that the meeting with al-Sharaa went \"great\" and described him as a \"young, attractive guy\" with a \"very strong past.\"",
      "\"He's got a real shot at holding it together,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Prince Mohammed joined Trump and al-Sharaa for the meeting, which lasted 33 minutes. Erdogan also took part in the talks via video conference.",
      "The prince said Mr. Trump's decision to engage with al-Sharaa and lift the sanctions will \"alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people\" and spur a \"new chapter\" for the nation.",
      "Formerly known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, al-Sharaa joined the ranks of al-Qaida insurgents battling U.S. forces in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion. He still faces a warrant for his arrest on terrorism charges in Iraq. The U.S. once offered $10 million for information about his whereabouts because of his links to al-Qaida.",
      "Al-Sharaa returned to his home country of Syria after the conflict began in 2011 and led al-Qaida's branch called the Nusra Front. He changed the name of his group to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and cut links with al-Qaida.",
      "The U.S. sanctions go back to the rule of Assad, who was ousted in December, and were intended to inflict major pain on the Syrian economy.",
      "Both the Biden and Trump administrations left the sanctions in place after Assad's fall as they sought to take the measure of al-Sharaa.",
      "State visit to Qatar",
      "After meeting with members of the GCC \u2014 which includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 Mr. Trump flew to Qatar, the second stop in his Mideast tour.",
      "Like the Saudis did a day earlier, Qatar rolled out the red carpet for Trump. Trump was greeted at the airport by Qatar's emir Sheikh Tamim Al Thani, and Air Force One was escorted by Qatari F-15 jets as it neared the capital city of Doha.",
      "As he sat down for talks with the emir at the Royal Court told the Qatari leader, he Mr Trump said he was impressed with the \"perfecto\" marble as well as the camels that took part in his grand arrival ceremony.",
      "Al Thani, for his part, said he had high hopes for Mr. Trump's efforts at ending the grinding war in Gaza.",
      "\"I know that you are a man of peace,\" he said. \"I know that you want to bring peace to this region.\"",
      "Qatar, like the other Gulf Arab states, is an autocratic nation where political parties are banned and speech is tightly controlled. It is overseen by its ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Sheikh Tamim took power in June 2013 when his father stepped down.",
      "Qatar has also been linked to several high-profile pay-to-play-style scandals around the globe.",
      "Two European Union lawmakers were accused of taking money from Doha in a scandal dubbed \"Qatar-gate.\" U.S. prosecutors in 2020 accused Qatar of bribing FIFA executive committee members to secure the tournament in the country in 2022.",
      "In 2024, RTX Corp., the defense contractor formerly known as Raytheon, agreed to pay more than $950 million to resolve allegations that it defrauded the U.S. government and paid bribes to secure business with Qatar. Doha always has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Qatar also has served as a key mediator, particularly with the militant terrorist group Hamas as the international community pursues a ceasefire for in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Qatar also served as host of the negotiations between the United States and the Taliban that led to America's 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan.",
      "Qatar is home to Al-Udeid Air Base, a sprawling facility that hosts the forward headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command.",
      "The oil-and-gas rich country is also in the center of a controversy over its offer to give Mr. Trump a luxury $400 million Boeing 747-8 to be used as Air Force One. The president has said the plane is \"a gift from the Nation to the United States Air Force/Department of Defense\" and not him.",
      "The Qatari government has said a final decision hasn't been made. But Trump has defended the idea even as critics argue it would amount to a president accepting an astonishingly valuable gift from a foreign government.",
      "Mr. Trump said after he leaves office the plane would reside at his library and not be used."

      "Mr. Trump arrived Wednesday in Qatar following a visit to Saudi Arabia, as the president makes his first international trip of his second term this week. Meanwhile, the unprecedented offer by the royal family of Qatar to donate a jumbo jet for Mr. Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane has loomed over the trip, as Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans \u2014 have called the ethics and national security implications of the potential gift into question.",
      "But the Republican, who was ousted as speaker by his own members in 2023 and left Congress later that year, said he thinks of the issue differently, saying \"here's a problem, and you need to solve it.\"",
      "\"If you understand President Trump, he's always a business man, he's looking for a deal, and he doesn't want the taxpayers to pay for something,\" McCarthy said.",
      "McCarthy argued that \"we need a new Air Force One,\" noting that the two plans that currently serve in that role were manufactured around 40 years ago. Boeing had taken \"too long,\" he said, to fulfill the contract it has with Congress to build replacement aircraft. The former speaker said Boeing should lease another plane to the president, even if it's the Qatari jet, which he argued would \"take away all implication that somebody says we're getting some gift, because Boeing is responsible, because they're too delayed.\"",
      "\"They should lease the plane, fix it, and provide an Air Force One, new one, for the president,\" McCarthy said of Boeing.",
      "The comments come as McCarthy's relationship with Mr. Trump have taken twists and turns. After the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, McCarthy accused the president of \"inciting people\" to carry out the attack. But McCarthy later sought to mend fences with the president, while largely avoiding criticizing him since.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump defended the gift, while citing a delay on the Boeing planes.",
      "\"When I came back, I said, by the way, what's going on with the Boeings that are coming? 'Well sir, they're way behind,'\" the president said of his return to office.",

      "Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said he understood the need for a new Air Force One, but he told reporters that \"I'd love to have a big, beautiful jet that's built in the United States of America,\" although the 747 the Qataris are offering was built in the U.S. GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida expressed concern for the president's safety, saying \"Qatar is not in my opinion a great ally.\" And Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said \"everybody needs to know that Air Force One is not like every other Boeing.\"",
      "\"It's going to have to be put through a lot of paces and probably every square inch analyzed before I think the president should consider it as a primary means of transportation,\" Tillis added.",

      "As a Republican-backed bill moves ahead in the House, proposed tax cuts under the measure include some new and surprising changes that could impact the wallets of millions of Americans.",
      "On Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of the bill, which would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other reductions.",
      "The extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions would mean that most taxpayers wouldn't see much of a change because their tax brackets would remain at the same levels they've been at since the cuts took effect in 2018. Without an extension, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "Aside from extending the 2017 tax cuts, the proposed bill would provide taxpayers with an average $1,300 tax reduction, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. Some of the additional tax cuts include those promised on the campaign trail by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on overtime pay, as well as new provisions that would lower taxes for senior citizens and parents.",
      "The proposed bill is likely to change as it moves through the legislative process, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, aiming to send it to the Senate by Memorial Day. Democratic lawmakers have opposed the bill for its proposed cuts to Medicaid\u00a0and food stamps, part of the GOP's goal to find $880 billion in savings to help pay for the tax cuts.",
      "Some Democrats also pointed out that some of the tax cuts promised by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on tips, would expire after 2028, limiting the benefits.",
      "\"[T]hey made provisions like addressing taxes on tips and overtime pay temporary, as opposed to the cuts for the richest 1%, which they made permanent,\" said Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, in a statement.",
      "Still, the bill released Wednesday by the House's tax panel provides a laundry list of tax breaks that could soon become law. Here's what the legislation would do:",
      "Adds a new $4,000 deduction for people 65 and older",
      "Senior citizens who are 65 and older would get a new tax benefit \u2014 an extra deduction of $4,000 per filer.",
      "The new deduction could be used by people who either itemize or take the standard deduction. But there would be an income limit, with the $4,000 deduction available for people with a modified adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for single filers and $150,000 for married couples who file joint returns.",
      "The tax break would be available starting in the current 2025 tax year and extend through 2028.",
      "By contrast, for seniors the latest version of the House bill has one notable omission: There's no plan to eliminate taxes on Social Security income, as Mr. Trump promised in his campaign.",
      "Proposing to scrap income taxes on Social Security proved controversial because those taxes directly fund the retirement program. That would likely hasten the\u00a0insolvency of its trust funds, policy experts have warned.",
      "Increases the standard deduction for all taxpayers",
      "The current standard deduction, which was expanded under the 2017 tax bill, is set to expire on Dec. 31. The House GOP bill would make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's bigger deduction permanent, as well as give it a boost.",
      "Starting in the current 2025 tax year through 2028, here's how the standard deduction would increase:",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000",
      "Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000",
      "Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "The standard deduction reduces your tax liability because it lowers your taxable income by that amount. For instance, single taxpayers earning $50,000 would reduce their taxable income to $34,000 for the 2025 tax year under the proposed standard deduction.",
      "Extends and increases the Child Tax Credit",
      "The House bill also extends the $2,000 Child Tax Credit, which otherwise would revert to its pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act level of $1,000 per eligible child starting in 2026. That change would be permanent, the House Ways and Means Committee said.",
      "The proposal would also increase the Child Tax Credit to $2,500 per child for the current 2025 tax year through 2028, after which it would drop back to $2,000.",
      "Eliminates the 1099-K reporting rule",
      "The proposed legislation would also abolish a\u00a0controversial rule that would have required payment platforms like Venmo or Paypal to send 1099-K tax forms to anyone receiving over $600.",
      "Previously, such payment services only had to report users' income to the Internal Revenue Service if they had more than 200 transactions, exceeding $20,000 in revenue. The IRS had delayed the implementation of the $600 rule after pushback from some online platforms as well as from Republican lawmakers.",
      "Increases the pass-through deduction for small businesses",
      "The pass-through deduction for small businesses, which was enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, also would increase under the House bill.",
      "The deduction allows small businesses, including partnerships, sole proprietorships (who are often gig workers) and S corporations, to subtract 20% of their qualified business income from their taxes, lowering their tax liability. Under the new bill, the deduction would rise to 23%.",
      "Eliminates taxes on tips",
      "This follows Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to eliminate taxes on tipped income, but it would apply only from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "The provision would create \"an above-the-line deduction for qualified tips received by an individual in an occupation which traditionally and customarily receives tips during a given taxable year,\" according to a summary of the bill from the House Ways and Means Committee.",
      "Eliminates taxes on overtime pay",
      "Another proposal from Mr. Trump \u2014 to eliminate taxes on eligible workers' overtime pay \u2014 would also become a reality, but only for three years.",
      "Under the House bill, an above-the-line deduction for OT would be created from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "Allow car loan interest to be deducted",
      "The House bill would also eliminate taxes on car loan interest by allowing consumers to deduct up to $10,000 for interest paid on vehicle loans.",
      "This would have an income limit, phasing out for taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income above $100,000 for single filers or $200,000 for married couples. Vehicles must have been assembled in the U.S. to qualify for the deduction.",

      "\"There have been and will be differences, but it is possible, with God's blessing, to move forward and resolve many issues,\" Maduro said, alluding to the deep divisions between his and Mr. Trump's governments. \"I hope and aspire that very soon we can also rescue Maikelys' father and the 253 Venezuelans who are in El Salvador.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, beginning a three-nation visit to the region and the first international trip of his second administration. Saudi Arabia is the first stop on a four-day trip to the Middle East for Mr. Trump, and he was greeted on the tarmac at the airport in Riyadh by the kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "The president and the crown prince were set to hold private talks on a wide range of topics, from dismantling Iran's nuclear program to efforts to end the war in Gaza and to keep oil prices in check.",
      "Mr. Trump also visited Saudi Arabia before any other nation during his first term in the White House, bucking the tradition for U.S. presidents to make their first foreign trip to the United Kingdom.",
      "\"Last time I went to Saudi Arabia, they put up $450 million,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in March, while pledging to make the visit again should there be another investment in American companies. In a call shortly after Mr. Trump took office in January, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the next four years.",
      "Saudi Arabia is of key diplomatic importance to the Trump White House, especially amid ongoing efforts to negotiate a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, and with the Israel-Hamas war still raging in Gaza. The Trump administration also held talks with Russia in the Saudi capital of Riyadh earlier this year on how to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "But the visit is also expected to focus on business. Mr. Trump spoke at an investment conference in Miami in February sponsored by Saudi government entities, as the Trump Organization has sought to expand its real estate empire in Saudi Arabia, and the president looks to strengthen ties with the Middle East partner.",
      "Mr. Trump has also attracted some high-profile business leaders to Riyadh for a U.S.-Saudi investment summit on Tuesday. The speakers will include Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Palantir's Alex Karp, Citigroup's Jane Fraser, BlackRock's Larry Fink, Franklin Templeton Investments's Jenny Johnson, Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi, BDT & MSD Partners' Dina Powell McCormick and Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman, according to multiple sources familiar with the event.",
      "Meanwhile, the White House has touted the trip's diplomatic opportunities.",
      "\"The president looks forward to embarking on his historic return to the Middle East, visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next week, where he will focus on strengthening ties between our nations,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Friday. \"Eight years ago, President Trump's first trip was to this same region of the world, where he introduced his bold peace-through-strength foreign policy strategy.\"",
      "The Trump administration brokered a diplomatic breakthrough during his first term that normalized relations between Israel and a number of Arab states, known as the Abraham Accords. Eight years later, as the administration has made a goal of expanding the agreement, Leavitt said Mr. Trump is returning to the region to \"re-emphasize his continued vision for a proud, prosperous and successful Middle East, where the United States and Middle Eastern nations are in cooperative relationships, and where extremism is defeated in place of commerce and cultural exchanges.\"",
      "\"This trip ultimately highlights how we stand on the brink of the golden age for both America and the Middle East, united by a shared vision of stability, opportunity and mutual respect,\" Leavitt added.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to accompany the president in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the State Department said, where they will \"look to strengthen ties between the United States and Gulf partners.\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will also join the president on the Middle East trip, a Pentagon spokesperson said. And Mr. Trump is expected to visit with U.S. military personnel at the U.S. airbase in Qatar, Leavitt said.",
      "Mr. Trump is not expected to visit Israel during the trip, in a change from his first term.",

      "In about two dozen cases nationwide, judges have gotten unsolicited pizza deliveries with the recipient listed as Daniel Anderl, the late son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas, the New Jersey judge told CBS News. Anderl was killed at the family's New Jersey home in 2020 by a disgruntled gunman who was targeting Salas.",
      "Salas called the cases attempts at \"psychological warfare\" against judges.",
      "Salas says the perpetrators have not been identified. She plans to meet with officials at the U.S. Marshals Service on Thursday to talk about the threats.",
      "A U.S. Marshals Service official told CBS News the agency \u2014 which handles judicial security \u2014 is \"looking into all the unsolicited pizza deliveries to federal judges and taking appropriate steps to address the matter.\"",
      "During a news conference Tuesday, outgoing U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., Ed Martin said \"pizza doxxers\" are also a focus of the federal prosecutor's office in the nation's capital, a jurisdiction where a large number of federal judges reside.",
      "Former FBI agent Mike Clark, who leads the Society of Retired FBI Agents, told CBS News the incidents appear to be designed to send a threatening and menacing message to judges.",
      "\"To do this, is inviting tragedy and something terrible to happen. They're making a mockery of the justice system and they're playing a dangerous game,\" Clark said.",
      "Security analysts have previously warned \"pizza doxxing\" \u2014 or hoax deliveries \u2014 could also be a technique to lure a public official to the front door of his or her home, to confirm their address for a possible future attack.",
      "Threats against judges have been on the rise in recent years, part of a broader trend for public officials. The U.S. Marshals Service recorded more than 450 threats against federal judges in 2023, up more than 300 from 2019, with threats against prosecutors also growing at a rapid clip over the same period, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "In a separate interview with CBS News in March, Salas said, \"I worry for judicial officers who have to render tough decisions, who have to render decisions that may be unpopular to some individuals.\" She also cited \"the inflammatory rhetoric and language that's coming from both our leaders as well as people in positions of power that have large platforms.\"",
      "\"Those are dangerous combinations, because \u2026 we don't know what might set someone off,\" she said. \"I'm living proof. My son isn't here anymore.\"",

      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \"it'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\"",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, \"chances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean,\" Langbroek said.",
      "Space debris could impact planes",
      "Space junk crashing back back to Earth could be a growing problem for aircraft, researchers warned in a\u00a0recent study.",
      "The study's authors said that the probability of space debris hitting an airplane is small, but the risk is rising due to increases in both space debris reentries and flights.",
      "The study found that high-density regions close to major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled rocket reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern U.S. or around major cities in Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was\u00a0published in Scientific Reports.",
      "Space junk has hit Earth recently",
      "Space debris has crashed back into Earth in recent months.",
      "In February, debris from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that blasted off in the United States entered the Earth's atmosphere over Poland. Two chunks from an unidentified object \u2014 both measuring about 5 feet by 3 feet \u2014 were later found on the ground. Police said it was possible the objects came from the SpaceX rocket.",
      "Last New Year's Eve, fragments of metal, believed to be from a rocket, crashed into a village in Kenya.",
      "In March 2024, NASA faced a lawsuit\u00a0from a family whose Florida home was hit by a piece of falling metal.",
      "The month before that, the European Space Agency said a satellite \u2014 weighing as much as an adult male rhinoceros \u2014 made an\u00a0uncontrolled return to Earth, reentering the atmosphere over the north Pacific Ocean between Alaska and Hawaii. Most of the satellite burned up as it reentered Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Stijn Lemmens, senior space debris mitigation analyst at the European Space Agency, told the BBC that the \"re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently,\" happening weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones. But objects typically burn up in the Earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground.",

      "The settlement stems from a 2021 lawsuit filed by Fumiko Lopez, a California resident who owned several Apple devices, and other consumers who alleged Siri listened to private or confidential conversations.

      "In 2024, customers lodged a record 66,675 complaints against U.S. airlines, according to a new report from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy group, based on data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. Passenger complaints have surged since the pandemic, rising every year since 2021, according to PIRG.",
      "\"When you file a complaint, the DOT asks if you talked to airline, so it's not like the DOT complaint line is your first stop,\" U.S. PIRG consumer watchdog director Teresa Murray told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When people try to get their money back and the airline hasn't done it, that's when people file complaints.\"",
      "For example, some customers sought refunds they were due related to flight cancellations or delays, while others sought reimbursement they were owed for lost or damaged piece of luggage.

Airlines struggled to ramp capacity back up in 2021 and 2022, resulting in plenty of cancellations and delays.",
      "At the top 10 U.S. airlines, cancellations rose from 1.28% of flights in 2023 to 1.36% last year, resulting in a total of 102,908 canceled flights in 2024, according to the report. Delays also worsened, with 78.1% of flights arriving on time last year, down from 78.3% in 2023. In total, roughly 1.7 million flights were either delayed or canceled in 2024.",
      "Nationwide air traffic controller shortages could lead to more snarls in schedules for the remainder of 2025, PIRG said.",
      "One relative bright spot in the report: Airlines mishandled fewer bags and wheelchairs in 2024 compared to the previous year. While that showed some modest improvement, 2.7 million bags were still lost or damaged, as were 11,357 wheelchairs and scooters.",
      "The carrier with the highest rate of complaints per 100,000 passengers: Frontier Airlines, which had the worst cancellation record, worst record for on-time arrivals and worst record for involuntary bumping, PIRG found.

      "The security video of Combs attacking Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental hotel\u00a0is a key piece of evidence in his trial. The video,\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0by CNN last year, shows Combs throw her onto the floor before kicking and dragging her.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Stephanie Haines, a Trump nominee, ruled the president is legally allowed to use the 18th-century law to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of belonging to the gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's push to remove people from the U.S. using the wartime Alien Enemies Act got a rare stamp of approval from a federal judge this week, as one of the more controversial parts of Mr. Trump's immigration strategy faces a slew of court challenges.",
      "U.S. District Judge Stephanie Haines of Pennsylvania, a Trump nominee, ruled Tuesday the president is legally allowed to use the 18th-century law to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of belonging to the gang Tren de Aragua. However, Haines also said the administration hasn't given people facing Alien Enemies Act removal enough notice to bring court challenges.",
      "The ruling is fairly narrow: The case only applies to one person, a Venezuelan man who was arrested in central Pennsylvania and moved to Texas. But it further complicates a nationwide battle over the Alien Enemies Act, which Mr. Trump has used to rapidly expel hundreds of migrants and send them to a supermax prison in El Salvador.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 says the government can remove people during an invasion or a \"predatory incursion\" launched by a foreign nation. Prior to this year, the law had been invoked three times in history, during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In all other cases, the law has been used for citizens of countries at war with the United States. But the Trump administration argued in a March proclamation that accused Tren de Aragua members count as \"alien enemies,\" claiming the gang \u2014 which Mr. Trump has deemed a foreign terrorist group \u2014 has extensive links to the Venezuelan government.",
      "The use of the Alien Enemies Act has drawn controversy, with critics arguing the administration hasn't given people an opportunity to challenge their cases in court. Many of the migrants who were sent to a Salvadoran prison don't have clear criminal records, CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" found last month. The Trump administration has stood by its use of the law, casting it as a necessary step to crack down on crime by the notorious Tren de Aragua.",
      "Why does the judge say the Trump administration can use the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "Haines wrote on Tuesday the Alien Enemies Act can apply to Tren de Aragua members. The judge defined a \"predatory incursion\" as a \"hostile entry into the United States by a cohesive group,\" like a U.S.-designated terrorist group, with a \"common goal of causing significant disruption\" \u2014 which she said lines up with Mr. Trump's proclamation in March.",
      "Haines also deferred to Mr. Trump on the question of whether Tren de Aragua is directed by Venezuela's government, though some U.S. intelligence agencies disagree with the administration, according to a memo obtained by several news outlets.",
      "But the judge broke with the administration in one key respect: She said the government must give people facing Alien Enemies Act removal at least 21 days' notice, in both English and Spanish, so they can bring court challenges. That's far more than the 12 hours' notice Haines said the government had promised to give in the past.",
      "The case reached Haines' desk after a Venezuelan man, referred to as A.S.R., filed a habeas corpus petition last month asking her to stop the government from deporting him.",
      "The man's lawyers say he was detained by ICE agents, asked about his tattoos and accused of links to Tren de Aragua, which he strongly denies. He was later moved to Texas. The petition says the man \u2014 who entered the U.S. in 2023 and is seeking asylum \u2014 fears the government will try to use the Alien Enemies Act against him.",
      "Why is Judge Haines' Alien Enemies Act ruling unusual?",
      "Haines is the first judge to explicitly say the Trump administration can use the Alien Enemies Act to remove Venezuelan migrants, making the Pennsylvania jurist an \"outlier among all of the other federal courts,\" says Columbia Law School professor Elora Mukherjee.",
      "Judges in three other states \u2014 Texas, Colorado and New York \u2014 have blocked Alien Enemies Act removals in their court districts. In some of these cases, the judges have said outright that the Trump administration's use of the 1798 law is likely illegal, often concluding that Tren de Aragua likely isn't involved in an invasion under the law.",
      "Last week, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein of Manhattan rejected the government's arguments. His ruling also took aim at the Trump administration for transporting hundreds of Alien Enemies Act subjects to the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador under a deal with that country's government, calling it a \"notoriously evil jail.\"",
      "Ahilan Arulanantham, a University of California, Los Angeles Law School professor who has worked on cases involving the Alien Enemies Act, called Haines' ruling \"wrong on a couple of key points.\"",
      "He says it gives too much legal weight to the fact that the Trump administration considers Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization, calling it \"deeply misguided\" and at odds with other rulings on terrorism designations. He also believes Haines gives excessive deference to the administration on whether an invasion is taking place.",
      "\"If every group of individuals \u2026 who the U.S. government says are controlled by a foreign government can be therefore treated as an invading force, then the Alien Enemies Act power is truly unbounded,\" Arulanantham told CBS News.",
      "Georgetown Law School Professor David Super also questioned the amount of deference that Haines gave the administration, including on the questions of whether Tren de Aragua is invading the U.S. and whether the Venezuelan government is responsible.",
      "\"This is involving individual liberties, and sweeping deference to the executive to abridge individual liberties is not part of our tradition,\" Super told CBS News.",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have defended his use of the law, arguing it's a necessary tool to deport Tren de Aragua members and halt gang violence. His March proclamation said Tren de Aragua members have \"unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.\"",
      "Tren de Aragua \"is one of the most violent and ruthless terrorist gangs on planet earth. They rape, maim and murder for sport,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has said.",
      "In court papers, the administration has argued it is \"the President's call alone\" whether the Alien Enemies Act applies, and whether the U.S. faces a \"predatory incursion\" is the type of foreign policy decision that's typically left to the president. The government's lawyers have also said the term \"predatory incursion\" can apply to Tren de Aragua members, arguing it can have a broader definition than just military action.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Haines' ruling.",
      "What does Judge Haines' ruling mean for migrants?",
      "The ruling is fairly narrow because \u2014 at least for now \u2014 it appears to only impact the Venezuelan man who initially brought the habeas corpus petition.",
      "In an earlier ruling last month, the judge treated the case as a class action, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from removing anybody from western Pennsylvania under the Alien Enemies Act unless they've gotten 14 days' notice.",
      "But Haines wrote Tuesday that there is no evidence anyone in her court district is currently being held under the law \u2014 including the man who brought the case, since he was transferred to Texas last month. For that reason, she narrowed the case to just the one petitioner.",
      "\"My read of it is that Judge Haines' order is extremely limited,\" Mukherjee said.",
      "Mukherjee also noted that Haines' ruling still requires the administration to give migrants plenty of notice \u2014 a view that other courts have held, including the Supreme Court.",
      "\"Universally, the federal courts are trying to curb the executive branch's reliance on the Alien Enemies Act as a mechanism for swift deportations from the United States without providing meaningful due process and notice to people,\" Mukherjee said.",
      "Still, Arulanantham said the ruling will be \"enormously significant\" if it's upheld on appeal.",
      "If the government can keep using the Alien Enemies Act to remove alleged Tren de Aragua members, but those migrants can challenge their detentions in court based on the specific facts of their situation, it could \"become an enormous drain on the legal system,\" requiring judges to hold a \"mini-trial\" for each planned removal, Arulanantham said.",
      "Has the Supreme Court ruled on the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "The Supreme Court hasn't weighed in directly on the question of whether the Alien Enemies Act is being used properly, but it has said the government needs to give migrants held under the law a chance at judicial review \u2014 which Haines' ruling cites.",
      "The high court handed down that ruling in April. In the same order, the justices overturned a ruling from a Washington, D.C., judge blocking Alien Enemies Act removals \u2014 but the Supreme Court focused on whether the judge had jurisdiction over migrants held in Texas, not on whether the Trump administration was allowed to use the 1798 law.",
      "The court also temporarily blocked Alien Enemies Act rulings in one part of Texas last month, in a brief emergency order that still remains in effect.",
      "Super believes the Supreme Court is likely to weigh in on the Alien Enemies Act again \u2014 possibly before its summer recess.",
      "\"This is certainly going back to the Supreme Court sooner rather than later,\" Super said.",
      "Can the Trump administration suspend habeas corpus?",
      "Many of the cases challenging the Alien Enemies Act are brought under writs of habeas corpus \u2014 a centuries-old legal concept that grants people the right to challenge their imprisonment.",
      "Last week, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told reporters the Trump administration is \"actively looking at\" suspending habeas corpus, citing a provision of the Constitution that allows it to be suspended \"in cases of rebellion or invasion.\" That step has only been taken under extremely rare circumstances in the past, including during the Civil War.",
      "Many legal experts believe the idea of suspending habeas corpus to deal with illegal immigration is unlikely to pass legal muster. Super told CBS News the gambit would put \"an even higher burden on the administration that we are at war.\"",
      "\"Habeas corpus goes all the way back to the Magna Carta,\" Super said. \"I think courts will be very concerned about discarding a provision that is 800 years old in defense of our liberties.\"",
      "It's also widely believed that suspensions of habeas corpus must be authorized by Congress.",
      "\"There are centuries of case law on this question,\" Mukherjee said. \"If the executive branch tries to suspend habeas corpus, that would be unconstitutional and illegal, and a dramatic escalation of the authoritarian overreach of the executive branch.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's bid to enforce its birthright citizenship executive orders gives the Supreme Court an opportunity to address the soundness of nationwide injunctions.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday is set to consider a bid by the Trump administration to narrow three lower court orders blocking President Trump from ending birthright citizenship, in cases that test judges' power to block a president's policies nationwide.",
      "The arguments before the court, taking place in a rare May session, will be the first involving a policy rolled out by Mr. Trump in his second term. But the high court is not examining the legality of the president's birthright citizenship executive order, which seeks to deny U.S. citizenship to children born to a mother or father who are in the U.S. unlawfully or on a temporary basis.",
      "Instead, the Trump administration has said district court judges overseeing three legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policy lacked the authority to issue sweeping injunctions that extend beyond the parties involved in the litigation. The plaintiffs that brought the three lawsuits are 22 states, two organizations and seven individuals, and the Justice Department is pushing for the injunctions to apply only to them.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court in favor of the administration could allow it to partially enforce the birthright citizenship measure while the litigation proceeds \u2014 but not enforce it against the plaintiffs, including residents of California, New York and 20 other states.",
      "\"This is one of a range of efforts to close the courthouse doors, to make it harder, more expensive, more complicated, slower to challenge illegal government action,\" said Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the Immigrants' Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"A case like birthright citizenship puts that in really stark relief where you have an executive order that is blatantly illegal, but the administration is asking the Supreme Court to make it harder for courts to protect people and vindicate constitutional rights.\"",
      "The fight over nationwide, or universal, injunctions has been simmering for years, and several of the justices themselves have indicated that the Supreme Court would have to clarify their legality.",
      "\"Universal injunctions are legally and historically dubious,\" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion to the Supreme Court's 2018 decision upholding the travel ban\u00a0Mr. Trump put in place during his first term. \"If federal courts continue to issue them, this court is dutybound to adjudicate their authority to do so.\"",
      "But criticisms of these broad orders reached a fever pitch this year, as the Trump administration fends off more than 200 legal challenges targeting nearly every aspect of the president's second-term agenda, and courts around the country issue injunctions that stop his policies from taking effect.",
      "Most of these decisions have been appealed, and the Trump administration has sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court in more than a dozen cases, including over his birthright citizenship executive order. The high court left the lower court injunctions preventing implementation of the birthright citizenship policy in place for now.",
      "Among the president's other plans that have been blocked were his transgender military ban, which the Supreme Court then allowed to take effect; his effort to restrict federal funding to medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care for young people; and cuts to certain federal funds.",
      "\"The pace of universal injunctions has gotten to the point where it really is an urgent issue for the court to resolve, not just because it has meant the thwarting of the president's ability to implement the policies for which he was elected, but also because it has led to an inundation of emergency petitions to the Supreme Court as a result of these universal injunctions,\" said Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America.",
      "These sweeping orders have frustrated not just Mr. Trump and his agenda, but also his predecessors. A study from the Harvard Law Review published in April 2024 found that at least 127 nationwide injunctions were issued from 1963 through 2023, though most of those, 96, were entered from 2001 through 2023.",
      "In March, the Congressional Research Service identified 86 nationwide injunctions that were issued under Mr. Trump's first four years in office and 28 during former President Joe Biden's term. But the report warned that it is \"not possible to provide a single definitive count of nationwide injunctions.\"",
      "As to Mr. Trump's second term, the Congressional Research Service identified 17 nationwide injunctions issued during his first two months back in office. The Trump administration estimates there have been at least 28 of these orders entered against it by judges.",
      "\"What universal injunction practice effectively means is that a single district court judge has a veto over the president's national policy and because there are 94 district courts in the country, that means that you have 94 opportunities in theory to shut down any given national policy,\" Alicea said. \"That is a recipe for genuine paralysis in terms of national policy-making and in a way that subverts the separation of powers because single district court judges were never supposed to have this kind of authority to stop national policy in its tracks.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have attacked by name the judges issuing these decisions, and his administration has extended that battle to the relief they are granting. In a filing in one of the birthright citizenship cases, the Justice Department said universal injunctions have reached \"epidemic\" proportions since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "\"Those injunctions thwart the executive branch's crucial policies on matters ranging from border security, to international relations, to national security, to military readiness,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. \"They repeatedly disrupt the operations of the Executive Branch up to the Cabinet level.\"",
      "Republicans in Congress have also taken up the cause against universal injunctions. The GOP-controlled House in April passed a bill that would restrict district court judges from issuing broad injunctive relief. It's unclear whether the measure will pass the Republican-led Senate, where 60 votes are needed for legislation to advance.",
      "But Wofsy, of the ACLU, said the number of lawsuits and injunctions stems from the volume of executive actions taken by the president in the opening months of his second term.",
      "\"The administration has been subject to so many nationwide injunctions and injunctions more generally because it's doing an incredible volume of illegal things, and that is not a reason to take away a tool that the judiciary has to check executive authority. It's the opposite,\" he said. \"Now more than ever it is vital that the judiciary is a strong and robust check against illegal executive actions.\"",
      "The Supreme Court may not stop universal injunctions altogether but could curtail them, as there are instances where relief naturally extends beyond the parties involved in a case. Take, for example, a landowner who sues a factory for polluting a river. In that instance, an injunction that orders the factory to stop would benefit all who live along it, not just the single plaintiff.",
      "\"The basic principle here is courts may only issue injunctions that are as broad as necessary to remedy the plaintiff's asserted harm,\" Alicea said. \"Sometimes that will require an injunction that gives protection even to nonparties as an incidental result of giving protection to the actual plaintiff.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court does curtail judges' ability to enter universal injunctions, courts could still enter tailored relief. Plaintiffs seeking to represent a broader group of people could also file class-action lawsuits. In the context of the birthright citizenship case, a class-action lawsuit could be brought by affected pregnant women in the U.S. illegally and children at risk of losing their right to U.S. citizenship, the Trump administration has argued.",
      "But Wofsy said class-action lawsuits, like nationwide injunctions, are one of many tools available to federal courts and may not be appropriate in every case.",
      "\"The existence of that tool doesn't mean courts shouldn't have other tools available,\" he said. \"The question here isn't, 'should nationwide injections be entered in every case?' The question is, 'are we going to take away the discretion that district courts have to use this as an appropriate tool to craft a remedy in a case where it's necessary?'\"",
      "He said birthright citizenship is an example of a situation in which the constitutional question is so clear, there is no reason the government needs to apply the policy to a single child while the legal challenges move forward.",
      "\"Citizenship really cuts through so many aspects of our society. It matters for so many educational, health, nutrition, other kinds of programs,\" Wofsy said. \"The idea that we would have a patchwork system where people's citizenship isn't just a matter of whether you're born in the United States, but who your parents are, what their status is, do you have documentation, are you a member of this organization, were you born in this state or that state invites confusion, chaos, discrimination and for no real purpose.\"",

      "A Texas mother was arrested this week on allegations she purchased ammunition and tactical gear for her son, who authorities said was planning \"mass targeted violence\" at a San Antonio school, according to an affidavit obtained by CBS News.",
      "Ashley Pardo, 33, was arrested Monday on one count of aiding in the commission of terrorism after tactical gear and ammunition were found at her home, which authorities said she purchased for her son in exchange for babysitting his younger siblings, according to the arrest affidavit issued by Bexar County Magistrate Court.",
      "Pardo \"intentionally and knowingly aided\" her son, San Antonio police wrote in the affidavit.",
      "The situation unfolded in January, when school staff at Jeremiah Rhodes Middle School in San Antonio found a map of the school which had been allegedly drawn by the Pardo's son, who was not named in the affidavit.",
      "The map was labeled \"suicide route,\" with the name of the school and a rifle drawn above it, according to the affidavit. The boy told officials that he had a \"fascination with past mass shooters, including their manifestos.\"",
      "In April, the boy was suspended from school for using a school-issued computer to research the 2019 massacre on two mosques in Christchurch , New Zealand, according to the affidavit.",
      "The boy was \"subsequently suspended,\" and later in the day attempted suicide, the affidavit states. He attended an alternative school through May 7, and returned to his Jeremiah Rhodes on May 8.",
      "On Monday, the boy's grandmother contacted police after the middle schooler told her that Pardo gave him guns and ammunition, according to the affidavit. The grandmother had found her grandson playing with a live bullet and a hammer the day prior, the documents read.",
      "The grandmother told police that Pardo had taken her son to a surplus store and bought him tactical gear, including magazines, a tactical vest, a tactical helmet and army clothing.",
      "\"It has been expressed to the Defendant the concerns of her child's expression and desire to commit acts of mass violence,\" the affidavit stated about Pardo. \"The Defendant expressed to the school her support of (her son's) violent expressions and drawings and does not feel concerned for his behavior.\"",
      "The grandmother also found a homemade explosive device made from a mortar-style firework in the boy's bedroom, the affidavit said. Written on the device were the words \"For Brenton Tarrant,\" the Australian white supremacist who carried out the Christchurch shootings which killed 51 people.",
      "Multiple \"SS\" symbols and \"14 words\" were also written on the device, according to the affidavit, references to white supremacist ideology.",

      "Boston\u00a0\u2014 A Russian-born scientist and Harvard University researcher, who was already facing deportation back to Russia, was charged Wednesday with trying to smuggle frog embryos into the country. Kseniia Petrova  , 30, was sent to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Louisiana after her February arrest. She continues to await a judge's decision on whether she will be deported to Russia, where she fears she will be imprisoned or worse. A hearing on her case was held Wednesday in Vermont.",
      "But in the case's latest twist, federal prosecutors charged her with one count of smuggling goods into the United States. It says she was taken into custody Wednesday. If convicted, Petrova faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.",
      "A lawyer for Petrova could not be reached for comment. It is unclear if she is being moved from the ICE facility.",
      "Petrova had been vacationing in France, where she stopped at a lab specializing in splicing superfine sections of frog embryos and obtained a package of samples to be used for research.",
      "As she passed through a U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoint in Boston Logan International Airport, Petrova was questioned about the samples. Petrova told The Associated Press in an interview last month that she didn't realize the items needed to be declared and was not trying to sneak in anything. After an interrogation, Petrova was told her visa was being cancelled.",
      "\"The truth is on my side,\" said Petrova, who spoke with the AP in a video call from the Louisiana ICE detention center in Monroe.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement on the social platform X that Petrova was detained after \"lying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country.\" They allege messages on her phone \"revealed she planned to smuggle the materials through customs without declaring them.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors said Petrova was stopped by Customs and Border Protection agents after a law enforcement canine alerted them to her checked duffle bag. Upon inspection, the frog embryos were discovered in a foam box. She initially denied carrying any biological material in her checked baggage, prosecutors said, but later acknowledged it.",
      "Petrova's boss and mentor, Leon Peshkin, said in an interview last month that the samples were not in any way dangerous or biohazardous.",
      "\"I don't think she did anything wrong,\" Peshkin told the AP. \"But even if she did, at most she should have gotten a warning or maybe a fine of up to $500.\"",
      "Harvard said in a statement that the university \"continues to monitor the situation.\"",
      "Petrova told the AP that she left her country to avoid conflict or possible political repression. She fled after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, marking the start of a bloody three-year war.",
      "\"If I go back, I am afraid I will be imprisoned because of my political position and my position against war,\" Petrova said.",
      "Petrova's case is being closely watched by the scientific community, with some fearing it could impact recruiting and retaining foreign scientists at U.S. universities.",
      "\"I think that there is a wrong perception that foreign scientists are somehow privileged to be in the United States. I feel it's the opposite,\" Peshkin said. \"Foreign scientists come here with gifts ... they are highly skilled experts who are in demand. They enrich the American scientific community.\"",

    "summary": "The heart of the Republican budget legislation targets key climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act.",
    "story": [
      "House Republicans Wednesday moved forward with a tax bill to cut billions of dollars in climate-related funding, reduce regulations, and prematurely phase out clean energy tax credits as part of President Trump's, \"One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "The heart of the Republican budget legislation targets key climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Cuts would impact businesses and consumers, affecting renewable energy, manufacturing, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles. Concurrently, House Republicans proposed streamlining permitting for fossil fuels, rescinding Clean Air Act pollution funding, and allocating $2 billion to the strategic petroleum reserve.",
      "The Inflation Reduction Act has led to $321 billion worth of climate investment being completed, with $522 billion worth of investments still in process, according to a report from the Clean Investment Monitor. Congress was tasked with finding $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to fund President Trump's tax cuts.",
      "House Republicans are hoping to have a floor vote next week prior to Memorial Day, after which the bill will go to the Senate.",
      "Four Republican Senators wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune cautioning the caucus against a \"full-scale repeal\" of tax credits, adding that repealing credits would be disruptive to businesses which had made investments based on the Inflation Reduction Act's tax framework. They also added that cuts would lead to higher energy costs.",
      "Twenty-one House Republicans wrote a similar letter in March urging against cuts to energy credits from the Inflation Reduction Act. A 2024 CBS News report found that over 80% of Inflation Reduction Act spending and tax credits went towards Republican congressional districts.",
      "Environmental groups and renewable energy companies have been on Capitol Hill lobbying to protect tax credits they say are vital to support new industries. Raghu Belur, co-founder of Enphase Energy, a solar components manufacturer, expected changes to the IRA, but didn't expect them to go this far.",
      "\"I thought there would be a glide path, I thought there would be a reasonable transition period. Instead it's become very abrupt,\" he told CBS News.",
      "His company has manufacturing facilities in South Carolina and Texas, made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act. But Belur also worries about the downstream effects on businesses that have formed around renewable energy, like solar installers, which tend to be small businesses.",
      "Among their concerns, Belur and the Solar Energy Industries Association have been focusing on the importance of a tax credit that helps homeowners to finance solar projects. The GOP budget proposal would abruptly end the credit at the end of 2025. The credit was previously slated to be phased out by 2034. He says the credits help support customer demand for nascent businesses, and that the renewable energy sector finally had momentum that should be supported as promised at this stage of their industry.",
      "\"Fossil fuels have been receiving subsidies for the last 100-plus years,\" Belur told CBS News. \"I always believe that subsidies must be a catalyst, not a crutch, we are not asking for an infinite extension of this.\"",
      "The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, estimates that 75% of the affected credits and spending cuts would affect local economies in Republican districts.",
      "\"At a time when billions of dollars are being invested in states that overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "Several tax credits and incentives are set to be phased out early or end, impacting a wide range of projects, including solar, geothermal, nuclear, wind, and hydrogen. The $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit that President Trump campaigned against will be ended, as well as manufacturing credits to produce electric vehicles.",
      "Funding for other Inflation Reduction Act initiatives are also projected to be cut. Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie, the House Energy and Commerce Committee chair, wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this week that the cuts would include $6.5 billion of unspent Inflation Reduction Act funding that is earmarked for the Environmental Protection Agency's Green House Gas Reduction Fund, clean pollution reduction, clean ports, and environmental justice grants.",
      "Evan Chapman, senior director of policy at Clean Tomorrow, a nonpartisan clean energy advocacy group, believes the version of the budget proposed by the GOP would make it harder to quickly increase energy production through renewables, and could lead American renewable energy industries to fall behind the rest of the world.",
      "\"This is largely a repeal of the inflation Reduction Act,\" Chapman told CBS News. \"What this bill will do is reduce the availability of energy, increase costs for energy that's coming on the grid, and make it more difficult to pull innovative American technologies that will produce clean energy towards the market.\"",

      "The Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce and Agriculture committees met Tuesday and Wednesday to debate and vote on their proposals as Republicans remained divided on a number of major issues \u2014 from Medicaid to tax cuts.",
      "Ways and Means faces SALT conflict",
      "After a nearly 18-hour markup, the Ways and Means panel, which is responsible for the tax portions of the bill, advanced its portion of the legislation Wednesday morning, in a 26-19 vote. But the key sticking point, a cap on the state and local tax deduction, often referred to as SALT, appeared to go unresolved. Republicans who represent blue states have pushed for an increase to the $10,000 cap, but balked at a proposed $30,000 cap in recent days.",

      "Energy and Commerce deals with Medicaid",
      "Meanwhile, the Energy and Commerce Committee debated for more than 25 hours before advancing its portion of the legislation in a 30-24 vote on Wednesday afternoon. The panel was tasked with finding $880 billion in cuts, which has implicated the popular entitlement program Medicaid.",
      "The Energy and Commerce proposal, unveiled Monday night, would impose work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cuts to federal funding to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and a ban on Medicaid covering gender transition services for children.",
      "Agriculture Committee votes on food stamp changes",

      "The most contentious issue handled by the Agriculture panel surrounds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, widely known as food stamps. The committee's proposal would increase the age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits, while shifting more of the costs to states. The bill updates the age requirement to 64, up from 54.",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause to the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits in 2026 as the state faces economic uncertainty.",
      "Newsom outlined his nearly $332 billion state spending plan on Wednesday, revealing that California is facing a $12 billion budget deficit.",
      "\"California is under assault,\" Newsom said. \"We have a president that's been reckless in terms of assaulting those growth engines.\"",
      "The Democratic governor noted that the freeze does not mean California is backing away from its support for immigrants.",
      "\"No state has done more than the state of California, no state will continue to do more than the state of California by a long shot. And that's a point of pride,\" Newsom said.",
      "The decision, the details for which were revealed before Wednesday's budget revision presentation, is driven by a higher-than-expected price tag on the program and economic uncertainty from federal tariff policies, Newsom said. It also comes as Newsom faces his final years in the governor's office, with speculation continuing to mount about his future political prospects.",
      "California's push to offer free health care benefits to all low-income adults, regardless of their immigration status, was announced in late 2023. Newsom touted the planned expansion as \"a transformative step towards strengthening the health care system for all Californians.\"",
      "However, the cost has exceeded the state's initial $6.4 billion estimate by more than $2 billion.",
      "Still, as late as March of this year, Newsom suggested to reporters he was not considering rolling back health benefits for low-income people living in the country illegally \u2014 even with California grappling with a $6.2 billion Medicaid shortfall. He also repeatedly defended the expansion, saying it saves the state money in the long run. The program is state-funded and does not use federal dollars.",
      "Under Newsom's plan, low-income adults without legal status will no longer be eligible to apply for Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, starting in 2026. Those who are already enrolled won't be kicked off their plans because of the enrollment freeze, and the changes won't impact children. Newsom's office didn't say how long the freeze would last.",
      "Starting in 2027, adults with \"unsatisfactory immigration status\" on Medi-Cal, including those without legal status and those who have legal status but aren't eligible for federally funded Medicaid, will also have to pay a $100 monthly premium. The governor's office said that is in line with the average cost paid by those who are on subsidized heath plans through California's own marketplace. There's no premium for most people currently on Medi-Cal.",
      "\"We believe that people should have some skin in the game as it relates to contributions,\" Newsom said.",
      "In total, Newsom's office estimated the changes will save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.",
      "The Medi-Cal expansion, combined with other factors such as rising pharmacy costs and larger enrollment by older people, has forced California to borrow and authorize new funding to plug the multibillion-dollar hole earlier this year. California provides free health care to more than a third of its 39 million people.",
      "The proposals come ahead of Newsom's scheduled presentation on the updated budget. Recovery from the Los Angeles wildfires, changing federal tariff policies, and the expensive health care expansion are putting a strain on California's massive state budget. Lawmakers are expecting a multibillion-dollar shortfall this year, and more deficits are projected for several years ahead.",
      "Newsom blamed President Donald Trump's tariff policies for the shortfalls, estimating that the polices have cost the state $16 billion in tax revenues. California is also bracing for major budget hits if Republicans in Congress follow through with a plan to slash billions of dollars in Medicaid and penalize states for providing health care to immigrants without legal status.",
      "Newsom now opens budget negotiations with lawmakers and it's unclear how Democrats who control the Legislature will react to his plan to freeze new Medi-Cal enrollment for some immigrants. A final budget proposal must be signed by June. California's budget is by far the largest among states.",
      "\"This is going to be a very challenging budget,\" Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, who chairs the budget committee, said before Newsom's proposals were announced. \"We're going to have to make some tough decisions.\"",
      "The budget proposals presented this week will build on some of the impacts of federal policies, but many unknowns remain.",
      "The governor already said he's planning to scale back on baseline spending this year. Analysts and economists also warn that California will face bigger deficits in the tens of billions of dollars in the coming years due to economic sluggishness and stock market volatility brought on by the tariff war.",
      "The budget Newsom first proposed in January included little new spending. But it allows the state to fully implement the country's first universal transitional kindergarten program and increase the state's film and TV tax credit to $750 million annually to bring back Hollywood jobs that have gone to New York and Georgia. He recently called on Trump to pass a $7.5 billion film tax credit at the federal level.",
      "Last year, Newsom and the Legislature agreed to dip into the state's rainy day fund, slash spending \u2014 including a nearly 10% cut for nearly all state departments \u2014 and temporarily raise taxes on some businesses to close an estimated $46.8 billion budget deficit.",

    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 20:32:24 -0400",
    "summary": "The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of \"forever chemicals\" in drinking water.",
    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it plans to weaken limits on some \"forever chemicals\" in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones.",
      "The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits were expected to reduce PFAS levels in drinking water for millions of people.",
      "Commonly called \"forever chemicals,\"\u00a0PFAS\u00a0are found nearly everywhere \u2014 in air,\u00a0water\u00a0and soil \u2014 and can take thousands of years to break down in the environment.",
      "Limits on three types of PFAS, including so-called GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.",
      "The Biden administration's rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards in place, but give utilities two extra years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to comply and treat for the chemicals.",
      "\"We are on a path to uphold the agency's nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,\" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.",
      "The development was first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration's limits. But the vast majority of utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.",
      "Health advocates praised the Biden administration for the tight limits. But water utilities took issue with the rule, saying treatment systems are expensive to install and that customers will end up paying more for water. The utilities sued the EPA.",
      "The EPA's actions align with some of the arguments utilities made in their lawsuit. They argued that the EPA lacked the authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn't properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that are now rescinded. They also asked for the now-granted two-year extension.",
      "Erik Olson, a senior strategic director of health at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move is illegal. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit contaminants in drinking water and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.",
      "\"With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration's promise to deliver clean water for Americans,\" Olson said.",
      "President Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks. The EPA plans to loosen regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, cleanup standards for coal plant waste and car emission limits, among many other clean air and water rules.",
      "Zeldin's history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications \u2014 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule will cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costly rules, combined with recent mandates to replace harmful lead pipes, will raise residents' bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.",
      "The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that will help.",
      "Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over the limits.",
      "\"This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand and that's almost too late already for 2029,\" said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",
      "But what utilities really wanted was a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.

      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Rep. Shri Thanedar of Michigan backed down from his attempt to force a vote on impeaching President Trump after it lacked support from his own party.",
      "The House was expected to vote Wednesday evening to table Thanedar's motion to impeach Mr. Trump for alleged high crimes and misdemeanors, which would have effectively killed it.",
      "Thanedar filed his\u00a0seven articles of impeachment\u00a0against Mr. Trump in April, but moved Tuesday to bring it up as \"privileged,\" requiring the House to act on the motion within two legislative days. But Thanedar changed course by Wednesday afternoon after having conversations with his colleagues.",
      "\"Instead, I will add to my articles of impeachment and continue to rally the support of both Democrats and Republicans to defend the Constitution with me,\" he wrote, adding that he will \"continue to pursue all avenues to put this President on notice and hold him accountable for his many impeachable crimes.\"",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said he explained to Thanedar that \"it's not enough to be right.\"",

      "His effort was not expected to receive much support from Democrats. The three Democrats who were listed as initial co-sponsors of the resolution when it was introduced last month quickly pulled their names after learning it was not cleared by leadership. And, Rep.

    "story": [
      "Kroger shoppers might be paying more at checkout than they bargained for.",
      "A new investigation\u00a0found price tag errors at the supermarket giant's stores leading to customers being overcharged on many items marked as discounted or on sale. Expired discount tags were found on everyday products ranging from Cheerios cereal to Nescaf\u00e9 instant coffee, according to an investigation by Consumer Reports, The Guardian and the Food & Environment Reporting Network (FERN).",
      "The probe stems from allegations made by Kroger employees in Colorado who are currently in labor negotiations with the supermarket chain.",
      "\"People should pay the price that is being advertised, that's the law,\" Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate and former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts, who runs the Consumer World website, told Consumer Reports. \"The issue here is that shoppers can't rely on the shelf price being accurate, and that's a big problem.\"",
      "Kroger operates roughly 2,700 stores throughout the U.S., according to the company's\u00a0website, and owns a suite of supermarkets that includes Harris Teeter, Fred Meyer, Fry's and Ralphs.",
      "To conduct the investigation, Consumer Reports, The Guardian and FERN recruited people to shop at more than two dozen Kroger and Kroger-owned stores in 14 states and the District of Columbia over a roughly three-month period this year.",
      "The investigation found that expired sales labels led to overcharges on more than 150 grocery items, with an average overcharge of $1.70 per item, or 18.4%. For instance, a bag of Mission Flour Tortillas at a Harris Teeter in Alexandria, Virginia, was advertised as on sale for $2.99, while customers were charged $4.99.",
      "Although pricing mistakes were not found at all the Kroger stores in the investigation, the probe found issues at over half of the 26 locations it examined.",
      "Kroger took issue with the findings, saying the investigation greatly overstates the pricing issues.",
      "The \"characterization of widespread pricing concerns is patently false,\" a Kroger spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, adding that the errors cited by the investigators represented only a \"few dozen examples across several years out of billions of customer transactions annually.\"",
      "Although Consumer Price Index\u00a0data shows\u00a0the rate of inflation and grocery prices eased last month, Americans continue to face higher\u00a0costs for household goods.",
      "\"Even if the incidents are careless rather than calculated, it creates a perception that Kroger is ripping people off,\" said Neil Saunders, an analyst with retail industry research firm GlobalData in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not what any grocery retailer wants or needs when the consumer is looking to maximize value for money.\"",
      "Kroger not alone in overcharging claims",
      "The overcharging problem is not unique to Kroger: Retailers like Walmart, Safeway, Albertsons and Vons have\u00a0been hit with similar allegations.",
      "Grocery giant Albertsons in October agreed to pay $4 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the California chain of selling items for more than their lowest advertised price.",
      "But the Kroger case stand out for several reasons said Derek Kravitz, an investigative journalist and author of the Consumer Reports story. One is that in states in the Midwest and the South, where the retailer has a strong foothold, Kroger is often one of just a few places to choose from for grocery shopping.",
      "Kravitz also pointed to the persistent flow of complaints from Kroger customers over out-of-date sales prices, dating back to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Ohio, for example, the attorney general's office has received nearly 60 complaints of price tag and overcharge issues at Kroger since 2021.",
      "\"Almost every single time I go in the store, the listed price of an item is NOT what rings up at the register,\" Belpre resident Allison Hadfield noted in one of three complaints she and her husband, Derek, filed against their local Kroger store, according to Consumer Reports.",
      "In addition to individual complaints, customers have also filed multiple class-action lawsuits alleging pricing errors at Kroger locations, with cases ongoing in California, Ohio and Illinois, according to The Guardian.",
      "Kroger said it has taken steps to fix price discrepancies. That includes instituting a policy that gives employees the authority to fix price problems on the spot.",
      "\"Kroger is committed to affordable and accurate pricing, and we conduct robust price check processes that reviews millions of items weekly to ensure our shelf prices are accurate,\" a spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Potential staffing issues",
      "Between 2019 and 2024, the average number of employees at the Kroger-owned stores that the researchers focused on fell by 10.3%, or 17 employees per store, according to the report, which cites data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The average number of hours worked also fell by 2.7 hours per week.",
      "\"There are simply not enough employees to manually switch out price labels on shelves because some stores have tens of thousands of price tags hanging at any one time,\" Kravitz wrote in the report.",
      "Kroger denies there is a problem with understaffing. In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, the Kroger spokesperson said work hours and staffing at its stores have not been reduced.",
      "\"We intentionally staff our stores to keep them running smoothly while creating an enjoyable place to shop,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our staffing decisions are data-driven to balance workload and schedules.\"",

      "A CDC report late last year showed that overdose deaths in the U.S. fell 17% between July 2023 and July 2024 \u2014 credited in part to wider naloxone access. Naloxone, also sold under the brand name Narcan,  was made\u00a0available for over-the-counter purchase\u00a0in 2023 and is\u00a0standard for first responders\u00a0to carry.

      "But there are reasons to be optimistic.",
      "Drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacy chains and other businesses have settled lawsuits with state and local governments over the painkillers that were a main driver of overdose deaths in the past.

      "They were joined in their meeting by the host of Mr. Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, and on the phone by the President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "The meeting came a day after Mr. Trump announced on his visit to the Saudi capital Riyadh that his administration would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, \"to give them a chance at greatness.\"",
      "\"The sanctions were brutal and crippling, and served ... an important function, nevertheless, at the time, but now it's their [Syrians'] time to shine,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech on Tuesday. \"I say good luck, Syria. Show us something very special.\"",
      "In her readout on Wednesday, Leavitt said \"President Erdogan praised President Trump for lifting sanctions on Syria and committed to working alongside Saudi Arabia to encourage peace and prosperity in Syria. The Crown Prince also commended President Trump for his decision to lift the sanctions, calling it courageous.\"",
      "She said al-Sharaa had thanked Mr. Trump, along with MBS and Erdogan, \"for their efforts to put together the meeting, and recognized the significant opportunity presented by the Iranians leaving Syria, as well as shared U.S.-Syrian interests in countering terrorism and eliminating chemical weapons.\"",
      "The \"Iranians\" referred to by the White House appeared to be a reference to the ousted Assad regime's backers in Tehran.",
      "\"President Al-Sharaa concluded with his hope that Syria would serve as a critical link in facilitating trade between east and west, and invited American companies to invest in Syrian oil and gas,\" Leavitt said.",
      "The White House said Tuesday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would also meet with the Syrian foreign minister in Turkey later this week.",
      "Mr. Trump became on Wednesday the first U.S. president to meet with a Syrian leader since Bill Clinton met with Assad's father Hafez al-Assad.",
      "A former insurgent, Sharaa ascended to power last year as Assad's government rapidly crumbled in the span of several days \u2014 bringing an abrupt end to the more than decadelong civil war that devastated Syria.",
      "Sharaa previously led Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamist rebel group that fought the Assad regime and had its roots in the al-Qaeda-allied Nusra Front. Sharaa also participated in the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq in the 2000s.",
      "Until last year, the U.S. had a $10 million bounty on Sharaa due to his leadership of HTS, which is designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "Syrian-American activist Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the nonprofit Syrian Emergency Task Force, is helping rebuild severed ties, and claims al-Sharaa is \"100% a changed man.\"",
      "\"I want to say, well, let's judge him by his actions,\" Mustafa told CBS News Wednesday. \"\u2026I'm not here to say any of these decisions in his checkered past is nonexistent. But the fact is, this is a changed man. And this is a person who is not interested in anything but rebuilding the country, and wants to see peace with all of the neighbors, wants to stay out of war with everyone in the Middle East.\"",
      "Despite the collapse of Assad's government, many of the intense U.S. sanctions placed on Syria during the last 13 years of Assad's reign have remained in place. The Trump administration appears to be pushing for normalized relations with the new government in Syria in the hope it can help curb Iranian influence in the country and the wider Middle East, despite Sharaa's roots in extremism.",
      "Saudi Arabia has also started building a relationship with Sharaa's government, a move that could also be aimed at limiting the influence of the kingdom's archrival Iran, which along with Russia, aided Assad in his fight against rebels during the civil war.",
      "Key U.S. ally Israel has been more wary of Sharaa, however, and has continued airstrikes against targets inside Syria \u2014 angering Sharaa's government.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham urged caution and said the White House should go through the proper congressional channels in to ease sanctions against Syria. Graham arrived in Turkey on Tuesday to meet with U.S. and Turkish officials about the situation in Syria.",
      "\"I am very inclined to support sanctions relief for Syria under the right conditions,\" Graham said in a statement. \"However, we must remember that the current leadership in Syria achieved its position through force of arms, not through the will of its people. I know the Trump administration has provided guidance to Syrian officials about conditions that need to be met before any sanctions can be relieved.\"",
      "Graham said he was \"certain that Congress would need to be informed of changes in conditions placed on Syria and how they have met those conditions before Congress can make an informed decision on whether or not it should approve the change in designation.\" He also said Israeli officials were \"extremely concerned\" about the \"state of play in Syria.\"",
      "\"Waiving congressionally passed sanctions is a complicated process,\" Graham said. \"While I would like to empower the new players in Syria, it has to be done in a coordinated fashion with our allies \u2014 especially our friends in Israel \u2014 so that numerous security concerns can be addressed.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for the first stop of his four-day trip to the Middle East. It is the first foreign trip of Mr. Trump's second term. It will include stops in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates later this week.",
      "The president delivered remarks at a U.S.-Saudi investment summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital, as the White House announced a $600 billion investment from Saudi Arabia, including what it touted as the \"largest defense sales agreement in history.\"",

    "story": [
      "Thai officials on Wednesday said they seized 238 tons of illegally imported electronic waste from the United States at the port of Bangkok, one of the biggest lots they've found this year.",
      "The waste, which came in 10 large containers, was declared as mixed metal scrap containing aluminium, copper and iron, but turned out to be circuit boards mixed in a huge pile of metal scrap, said Theeraj Athanavanich, director-general of the Customs Department.",
      "The electronic waste \u2014 which is classified as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal \u2014 was found on Tuesday after the 40-foot containers became the subject of a routine random inspection, officials said.",
      "The Basel Convention is an international treaty signed in 1989 meant to deal with hazardous waste flowing into developing countries as costs for disposal grew along with the amount of waste.",
      "A U.N. report last year said electronic waste is piling up worldwide. Some 62 million tons of electronic waste was generated in 2022 and that figure is on track to reach 82 million tons by 2030, the report said. It said only 22% of the waste was properly collected and recycled in 2022 and that quantity is expected to fall to 20% by the end of the decade due to higher consumption, limited repair options, shorter product life cycles, and inadequate management infrastructure.",
      "Theeraj said Thai authorities are looking to press charges including falsely declaring imported goods, illegally importing electronic waste and planning to re-export the waste back to its country of origin.",
      "\"It's important that we take action on this kind of goods,\" he said. \"There are environmental impacts that are dangerous to the people, especially communities around factories that might import these things for processing, then recycling.\"",
      "Electronic waste creates huge\u00a0health hazards. Many components are laden with lead and mercury, cadmium and other toxins. Recyclers are after gold, silver, palladium and copper, mainly from printed circuit boards, but lax controls mean that facilities often burn plastics to release encased copper and use unsafe methods to extract precious metals.",
      "Thailand passed a ban on the import of a range of electronic waste products in 2020. The Cabinet in February approved an expanded list of the banned waste.",
      "Sunthron Kewsawang, deputy director-general of the Department of Industrial Works, said officials suspected at least two factories in Samut Sakhon province, which borders Bangkok, are involved in importing the waste. Last year, Thai officials found thousands of tons of smuggled cadmium waste at a factory in the province, Thai PBS reported.",
      "Residents near the area were later found to have usually high levels of the poisonous metal in their urine, according to the report. Exposure to cadmium can cause flu-like symptoms, including chills, fever and muscle pain, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Long-term exposure can lead to cancer, kidney, bone and lung disease.",
      "In January, the Customs Department said it seized 256 tons of illegally imported electronic waste from Japan and Hong Kong at a port in eastern Thailand.",

      "Iran \"must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars and permanently and verifiably cease pursuit of nuclear weapons,\" Trump said in remarks at a meeting of leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council hosted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Saudi capital. \"They cannot have a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "The U.S. and Iran have engaged in four rounds of talks since early last month focused on Iran's nuclear program. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that he believes brokering a deal is possible but that the window is closing.",
      "The president's strongly worded push on Iran to cease support of Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen come as its proxy network has faced significant setbacks in the 19 months since Hamas-led militants launched the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and 251 were taken as hostages back into Gaza. Some of those hostages have been killed or have been released as part of deals, but there are still some 58 hostages being held by Hamas.",
      "In Iran, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called Mr. Trump's remarks \"deceitful\" but did not directly address his call on Iran to cease support of proxy groups.",
      "Later, Mr. Trump, in an exchange with reporters aboard Air Force One, urged Iran \"to make the right decision\" about its nuclear program \"because something's going to happen one way or the other.\"",
      "\"So we'll either do it friendly or we'll do it very unfriendly,\" Mr. Trump warned. \"And that won't be pleasant.\"",

      "\"I think sometime later this year, and hopefully on the sooner, and hopefully much sooner than late this year, we'll see large breakthroughs in Iran,\" Wright said. \"Look, this is a win, win deal. Iran agrees to completely give up their nuclear program. They can have trade, they can have engagement with the rest of the world. They can bring down rampant inflation. They can bring investment, make their society better, and the rest of the region can thrive, if it's not constantly under bombardment by Iranian proxies or the threat of a nuclear armed Iran This is by far the biggest security issue in the Middle East.\"",
      "Lifting sanctions on Syria",
      "Mr. Trump's comments on Iran came after he met Wednesday with Syrian interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a face-to-face engagement with the onetime insurgent leader who spent years imprisoned by U.S. forces after being captured in Iraq.",

      "Mr. Trump said he decided to meet with al-Sharaa after being encouraged to do so by Prince Mohammed and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The president also pledged to lift yearslong sanctions on Syria.",

      "\"He's got a real shot at holding it together,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Prince Mohammed joined Trump and al-Sharaa for the meeting, which lasted 33 minutes. Erdogan also took part in the talks via video conference.",

He still faces a warrant for his arrest on terrorism charges in Iraq. The U.S. once offered $10 million for information about his whereabouts because of his links to al-Qaida.",
      "Al-Sharaa returned to his home country of Syria after the conflict began in 2011 and led al-Qaida's branch called the Nusra Front. He changed the name of his group to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and cut links with al-Qaida.",
      "The U.S. sanctions go back to the rule of Assad, who was ousted in December, and were intended to inflict major pain on the Syrian economy.",
      "Both the Biden and Trump administrations left the sanctions in place after Assad's fall as they sought to take the measure of al-Sharaa.",

      "Qatar, like the other Gulf Arab states, is an autocratic nation where political parties are banned and speech is tightly controlled. It is overseen by its ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Sheikh Tamim took power in June 2013 when his father stepped down.",
      "Qatar has also been linked to several high-profile pay-to-play-style scandals around the globe.",

      "Qatar also has served as a key mediator, particularly with the militant terrorist group Hamas as the international community pursues a ceasefire for in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Qatar also served as host of the negotiations between the United States and the Taliban that led to America's 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan.",
      "Qatar is home to Al-Udeid Air Base, a sprawling facility that hosts the forward headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command.",
      "The oil-and-gas rich country is also in the center of a controversy over its offer to give Mr. Trump a luxury $400 million Boeing 747-8 to be used as Air Force One. The president has said the plane is \"a gift from the Nation to the United States Air Force/Department of Defense\" and not him.",
      "The Qatari government has said a final decision hasn't been made. But Trump has defended the idea even as critics argue it would amount to a president accepting an astonishingly valuable gift from a foreign government.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, beginning a three-nation visit to the region and the first international trip of his second administration. Saudi Arabia is the first stop on a four-day trip to the Middle East for Mr. Trump, and he was greeted on the tarmac at the airport in Riyadh by the kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "The president and the crown prince were set to hold private talks on a wide range of topics, from dismantling Iran's nuclear program to efforts to end the war in Gaza and to keep oil prices in check.",
      "Mr. Trump also visited Saudi Arabia before any other nation during his first term in the White House, bucking the tradition for U.S. presidents to make their first foreign trip to the United Kingdom.",
      "\"Last time I went to Saudi Arabia, they put up $450 million,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in March, while pledging to make the visit again should there be another investment in American companies. In a call shortly after Mr. Trump took office in January, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the next four years.",
      "Saudi Arabia is of key diplomatic importance to the Trump White House, especially amid ongoing efforts to negotiate a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, and with the Israel-Hamas war still raging in Gaza. The Trump administration also held talks with Russia in the Saudi capital of Riyadh earlier this year on how to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "But the visit is also expected to focus on business. Mr. Trump spoke at an investment conference in Miami in February sponsored by Saudi government entities, as the Trump Organization has sought to expand its real estate empire in Saudi Arabia, and the president looks to strengthen ties with the Middle East partner.",
      "Mr. Trump has also attracted some high-profile business leaders to Riyadh for a U.S.-Saudi investment summit on Tuesday. The speakers will include Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Palantir's Alex Karp, Citigroup's Jane Fraser, BlackRock's Larry Fink, Franklin Templeton Investments's Jenny Johnson, Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi, BDT & MSD Partners' Dina Powell McCormick and Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman, according to multiple sources familiar with the event.",

      "\"The president looks forward to embarking on his historic return to the Middle East, visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next week, where he will focus on strengthening ties between our nations,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Friday. \"Eight years ago, President Trump's first trip was to this same region of the world, where he introduced his bold peace-through-strength foreign policy strategy.\"",
      "The Trump administration brokered a diplomatic breakthrough during his first term that normalized relations between Israel and a number of Arab states, known as the Abraham Accords. Eight years later, as the administration has made a goal of expanding the agreement, Leavitt said Mr. Trump is returning to the region to \"re-emphasize his continued vision for a proud, prosperous and successful Middle East, where the United States and Middle Eastern nations are in cooperative relationships, and where extremism is defeated in place of commerce and cultural exchanges.\"",
      "\"This trip ultimately highlights how we stand on the brink of the golden age for both America and the Middle East, united by a shared vision of stability, opportunity and mutual respect,\" Leavitt added.",

    "summary": "The pope's name helps indicate what direction he wants to take the church.",
    "story": [
      "Cardinal Robert Prevost has been announced as the new pontiff\u00a0and has chosen the name Pope Leo XIV.",
      "There are no written rules or official criteria for a pope's name, but they choose names that have meaning in the Catholic tradition.",
      "The significance of a pope's name",
      "The name a new pope chooses will \"indicate a certain spirit and direction and vision of the new pope,\" said Dennis Doyle, a theologian and professor emeritus of religious studies at the University of Dayton.",
      "\"The first thing that you would look for would be, which popes had that name before?\" he said. \"That would signify something about the direction that the pope wants to take.\"",
      "Leo has been chosen 13 times before.",
      "\"The name Leo harkens back to Pope Leo the Great,\" the first pope with the name Leo, CBS News papal contributor Candida Moss said Thursday.",
      "Also known as Pope Leo I, his papacy was from 440 to 461. He's famous for meeting with Attila the Hun and dissuading him from attacking Rome.",
      "\"What does this mean for our new pope? Well, it might mean that he too is going to stand up to oppressive political forces in the world,\" Moss said.",
      "Leo I is also known as \"a great intellectual and theological reformer,\" Moss said. He wrote Leo's Tome, a document that influenced the official doctrine defining Jesus Christ as both fully human and fully divine.",
      "\"Our new pope has a doctorate in canon law, so we might expect that he too is going to clarify the church's teachings on central issues,\" Moss said.",
      "Doyle also pointed to the last pope to use the name Leo, Pope Leo XIII, who was the head of the Catholic Church between 1878 and 1903.",
      "\"He is perhaps most famous for writing the Rerum Novarum,\" Doyle said, which translates to \"On New Things,\" but the Latin meaning is also \"On Revolutionary Changes.\"",
      "The Rerum Novarum addressed workers' rights and capitalism at the dawn of the industrial age and is considered the first Catholic social encyclical, laying the foundation for modern Catholic social thought.",
      "This could indicate that Pope Leo XIV is interested \"in promoting Catholic social teaching in today's world,\" Doyle said. \"Maybe Catholic social teaching, if taken seriously, could be something to help overcome polarization.\"",
      "Bishop Robert Barron, of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, also saw the connection to Leo XIII and said he thinks the name is \"very significant.\"",
      "Leo XIII was a \"great 19th century pope,\" Barron told CBS News. \"When the revolutions in the 18th century happened, and the philosophical revolutions of the 19th century, the church initially said 'no' to much of that. Leo represents a very nuanced, intelligent engagement with modernity \u2014 not caving into it, not saying yes completely, but not saying no \u2014 using the resources of our own traditions to engage modernity creatively. That makes him a bridge figure.\"",
      "The name Leo \"is a deep sign of commitment to social issues,\" Natalia Imperatori-Lee, the chair of religious studies at Manhattan University, told The Associated Press.",
      "Because of that, Pope Leo XIV's choice of name also suggests a continuation of much of Pope Francis' ministry.",
      "Pope Francis, whose birth name was Jorge Mario Bergoglio, chose a papal name that hadn't been chosen by a pope before, so in his case, \"you have to ask, well, are there any biblical figures or people in the tradition who have had that name?\" Doyle said.",
      "For Francis, it was St. Francis of Assisi, known for his charity and simplicity.",
      "What are the most common papal names?",
      "The names most used by popes have been:",
      "John: 23 timesBenedict: 16 timesGregory: 16 timesClement: 14 timesLeo: 14 timesInnocent: 13 timesPius: 12 times",

      "Clement: 14 times",
      "Leo: 14 times",
      "Innocent: 13 times",
      "Pius: 12 times",
      "As with the name Leo, \"there could be more than one reference in the name that the pope chooses,\" Doyle explained.",
      "Pope Benedict XVI paid homage to Benedict XV, who led the church during World War I, but also to St. Benedict of Nursia, who founded the Benedictine Order and influenced the spread of Christianity throughout Europe.",
      "The name John, the most popular, could refer back to the Gospel of John, which is one of \"the most loved of the gospels,\" Doyle said. It can also refer to St. John the Baptist, the prophet who baptized Jesus.",
      "Have popes always changed their names?",
      "Not every pope in history has changed his name. Out of 266 popes before Pope Leo XIV, 129 have chosen new names, according to Vatican News.",
      "The practice became more ingrained around the 11th century, a period of German popes who chose names of early church bishops out of \"a desire to signify continuity,\" Rev. Roberto Regoli, a historian at Rome's Pontifical Gregorian University, told the AP.",
      "For many centuries, new popes tended to choose the name of the pope who had elevated them to cardinal.",
      "Only starting in the mid-20th century did new popes begin to choose names signaling the aim of their papacy, Regoli said.",
      "Names never chosen by a pope",
      "Some biblical names that haven't been used by a pope are Joseph, James and Andrew.",

      "Between 2010 and 2018, half of the participants took GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) \u2014 injectable medications for obesity and type 2 diabetes \u2014 with at least\u00a0six drug purchases within 12 months. The other half underwent bariatric metabolic surgery (BMS).",

      "The findings were published in the journal eClinicalMedicine.",
      "\"The results point at the existence of additional pathways beyond weight loss in which GLP-1RAs contribute to the decreased risk of obesity-related cancer,\" lead study author Yael Wolff Sagy, PhD, head of research at Clalit Health Services, told Fox News Digital.",
      "How do GLP-1 RAs affect cancer risk?",
      "Niketa Patel, professor of molecular medicine with the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine in Tampa, Florida, noted that obesity is associated with chronic inflammation.",
      "\"GLP1-RAs are shown to reduce inflammation and thus decrease the risk of developing ORC,\" she told Fox News Digital. (Patel was not involved in the study.)",
      "\"The anti-inflammatory properties of these medications address a known risk factor for various cancers.\"",
      "\"Bottom line: Obesity can cause certain cancers, and treatment of obesity with GLP1-RA reduces the risk of only obesity-related cancers.\"",
      "Dr. Britta Reierson, MD, medical director of knownwell, a provider of metabolic health services, said there are several ways in which GLP-1 RAs could have cancer mitigation properties.",
      "\"First, the anti-inflammatory properties of these medications address a known risk factor for various cancers,\" the Minnesota-based doctor, who also was not part of the research, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Overall, the study determined that \"the direct effect of GLP1-RAs compared to BMS on the risk for ORC beyond their effects on weight-loss is estimated as 41% relative risk reduction.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Second, the metabolic regulation and improvement in metabolic health from these medications, including lowering blood glucose levels and decreasing insulin resistance, can reduce cancer risk.\"",
      "Emerging evidence also suggests that GLP-1 RAs may have direct anti-tumor effects, Reierson noted \u2014 \"potentially through modulation of immune responses and epigenetic changes (changes that occur to gene expression and are passed down to future generations).\"",
      "FIRST GLP-1 PILL FOR WEIGHT LOSS, DIABETES SHOWS SUCCESS IN LATE-PHASE TRIAL",
      "Research suggests that GLP-1 medications help reduce inflammation not just through weight loss, but also in other organs of the body, such as the heart, according to Dr. Susan Savery, MD, a board-certified obesity medicine and primary care physician with PlushCare, a virtual health platform offering primary care, therapy and weight management services.",
      "\"Over time, chronic inflammation can be a risk factor for cancer development, as it may damage cell DNA,\" San Francisco-based Savery, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The metabolic regulation and improvement in metabolic health from these medications, including lowering blood glucose levels and decreasing insulin resistance, can reduce cancer risk.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Our fat cells (adipose tissue) naturally produce inflammatory cells, and GLP-1 medications, similar to bariatric surgery, help reduce this inflammation by decreasing the amount of adipose tissue through weight loss.\"",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The study did have some limitations, the researchers acknowledged.",
      "\"First, it is an observational study. It means that our comparison groups (persons who had surgery versus those who received GLP1-RAs) may still have some residual differences, despite our methodological efforts,\" Sagy told Fox News Digital.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"However, only this type of real-life observational study can provide the long follow-up period that is necessary to evaluate the risk of developing cancer, which often has very long latency periods.\"",
      "Another limitation is that the primary drug included in the study was liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza), with smaller numbers of people taking exenatide (Byetta) and dulaglutide (Trulicity).",
      "While GLP-1 RAs are \"wonderful tools\" that can support people on weight-loss journeys, Savery pointed out that maintaining a healthy lifestyle through nutritious eating and regular physical activity is \"the foundation for cancer prevention and better overall health.\" (iStock)",
      "\"It will be important to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the newer GLP1-RA drugs, which are expected to have a larger effect,\" Sagy said.",
      "\"Although the direction of the results is promising, we should wait and see if and how clinical guidelines will consider it.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Reierson agreed that much more research is needed before GLP-1 RAs could ever be considered as cancer prevention options.",
      "\"Larger, randomized, controlled trials are necessary to confirm the observed effects and better understand the underlying mechanisms,\" she said.",

      "\"It will also be important to investigate the impact of GLP-1 RAs on different types of cancer and assess the long-term safety and potential side effects of using GLP-1 RAs as a cancer therapy.\"",

      "Michael Cannon, the director of health policy studies at the Washington-based libertarian-leaning Cato Institute think tank, voiced similar sentiments about the initial CBO report.",
      "\"The first thing to know is that this is not a Republican proposal that CBO was examining,\" Cannon told Fox News Digital Monday about the initial CBO analysis. \"They\u2019re similar to Republican proposals, but these were proposals, ideas that the Democrats asked CBO to examine for the purposes of criticizing those proposals, using them as a CBO score as a cudgel against Republicans.\"",
      "While Democrats labeled the first scorekeeper\u2019s report as proof that Republican policies would lead to \"catastrophic\" Medicaid cuts and force millions of people off their coverage, Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee said in a post on X that Democrats sought to \"fear monger\" Americans.",
      "Ultimately, the CBO report released Thursday evaluated five different initiatives that would rein in Medicaid spending, freeing up billions of dollars in spending but jeopardizing healthcare coverage for up to 8.6 million people.",
      "HOUSE GOP UNVEILS MEDICAID WORK REQUIREMENTS IN TRUMP'S \u2018BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'",
      "Additional analysis from the CBO released Monday claimed that an additional 5.1 million Americans could lose their coverage if the measure fails to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits that will expire in 2034, and includes a provision to fully implement the Marketplace Integrity Rule that seeks to crack down on eligibility verification.",
      "Although neither of these proposals is included in the Republican legislation, Democrats have added the numbers from these two CBO reports and have asserted that roughly 13.7 million people would go uninsured under Republican policies.",
      "Meanwhile, the latest CBO analysis released Tuesday examining Medicaid proposals included in the GOP measure found that adding work requirements, new eligibility checks and removing illegal immigrants from Medicaid would result in 10.3 million people losing coverage, and would leave 7.6 million people without insurance.",
      "CBO declined to comment when reached by Fox News Digital on its recent reports.",
      "ANTI-ABORTION PROVIDER MEASURE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' COULD SPARK HOUSE GOP REBELLION",
      "Rep. Frank Pallone (Alex Brandon/The Associated Press)",
      "Additionally, Cannon pushed back against accusations that any of the proposals would actually cut Medicaid funding. While federal Medicaid spending is set to increase by 4.5% annually, the proposals CBO evaluated would simply curb that growth to at least 3% annually.",
      "But ultimately, Cannon said the report is a mechanism Democrats are using to ignite fears among Republicans as they seek a legislative victory of their own.",
      "\"Democrats want to beat up Republicans, of course they do,\" Cannon said. \"They want to win elections, and they think if they can scare people, they can do it\u2026 they don't want Republicans to get a political win, like tax cuts, and so this is their best weapon to stop tax cuts. They\u2019re making the most of it, so that's what's going on with that CBO score.\"",

      "The measure also puts limits on how much states spend on expanded Medicaid populations established through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which permitted states to increase their Medicaid coverage to those who make up 138% of the poverty level.",

      "How this scam works",
      "This type of scam is known as a remote access scam. It often begins with a fake email that appears to come from a trusted company like PayPal. The message claims there is an issue, such as an unauthorized charge, and urges the victim to call a phone number or click a link.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once the scammer makes contact, they guide the victim to enter a code into their browser or install a program, claiming it will fix the problem. In reality, this grants the scammer full control of the victim\u2019s computer.",
      "Once inside, scammers often search for sensitive files, access banking websites, steal login credentials or install malware to maintain long-term access. Even if the immediate scam is stopped, hidden malware can allow scammers to reenter the system later.",

They copy logos, formatting and even fake customer support numbers. Always double-check the sender\u2019s email address and verify communications by visiting the official website or app directly instead of clicking links inside emails.",
      "Remote access scams can escalate fast: Once scammers gain control of your device, they can steal sensitive data, move funds between accounts and install hidden malware that stays behind even after the scammer disconnects. It often takes only minutes for serious damage to be done, making fast recognition critical.",
      "Psychological pressure plays a big role: Scammers rely on creating a sense of urgency and fear. By keeping you on the phone and urging secrecy, they isolate you from help and rush you into making bad decisions. Recognizing when you are being pressured is key to breaking the scammer\u2019s control.",
      "Fast action can make all the difference: By quickly disconnecting his computer and contacting his bank, John limited the scammer\u2019s access to his accounts.

      "Taking simple but strong security steps can protect you from falling victim.",
      "1. Never call a number listed in a suspicious email: Scammers often set up fake phone numbers that sound professional but are designed to manipulate you into handing over control or information. Always find verified contact information through a company's official website or app, not links/numbers provided in suspicious messages.",
      "2. Be skeptical of unusual instructions: No legitimate company will ask you to install software or enter strange codes to protect your account. If anything seems unusual, trust your instincts and stop the communication immediately.",
      "3. Install strong antivirus software on all devices:\u00a0Antivirus programs can detect suspicious downloads, block remote access attempts and help prevent hackers from taking over your system. Having strong antivirus protection installed across all your devices is the best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware and attempt to access your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Use identity theft protection: These services monitor financial accounts, credit reports and online activity for signs of fraud, alerting you to suspicious transactions.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. React immediately if you suspect a scam: Disconnect your device from the internet, contact your bank or credit card company immediately and change your passwords, especially for banking and email accounts. Monitor your accounts closely for unauthorized activity and report the scam to the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission as well as the company that was impersonated. Acting quickly can prevent further access and limit the damage scammers can cause.",
      "6. Use multifactor authentication (MFA):\u00a0MFA adds a critical layer of security beyond passwords, blocking unauthorized logins even if credentials are stolen. Enable MFA on all accounts, especially banking, email and payment platforms, to stop scammers from bypassing stolen passwords.",
      "7. Update devices and software immediately:\u00a0Regular updates patch security flaws that scammers exploit to install malware or hijack systems. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible to ensure you\u2019re always protected against newly discovered vulnerabilities.",
      "8. Employ a password manager with strong, unique passwords: Avoid password reuse and use complex passphrases to minimize credential-stuffing attacks. A\u00a0password manager generates and stores uncrackable passwords, eliminating the risk of weak or repeated credentials. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "9. Never share screen access or grant remote control: Scammers exploit screen-sharing tools to steal passwords and manipulate transactions in real time. Legitimate tech support will never demand unsolicited screen access; terminate the call immediately if pressured.",
      "10. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0These services automate requests to delete your personal information from data brokers and people-search sites, reducing publicly available details scammers could exploit for phishing or impersonation. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson says hackers are using CAPTCHAs to infect your PC with malware.",
      "Ransomware gangs once thrived on infected email attachments and bogus invoices, but security-savvy users and hardened mail gateways have weakened those tactics. Attackers are now focusing on a subtler trick that targets the small checkbox labeled \"I'm not a robot\" that most people click without thinking.",
      "A widespread campaign known as MacReaper has compromised more than 2,800 legitimate websites and redirects visitors to an infection process designed specifically for Apple computers. The operation relies on visual trust signals, including a convincing fake of Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA, along with hidden clipboard code that ends with the installation of Atomic macOS Stealer malware, a data-harvesting infostealer distributed through Telegram.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does the attack unfold?",
      "When a Mac user visits one of the compromised websites, they don't see the page they were expecting. Instead, the site displays a full-screen imitation of Google's familiar reCAPTCHA box.",
      "This fake reCAPTCHA appears harmless, simply asking the user to click \"I'm not a robot.\" However, when the user clicks the box, a hidden command is silently copied to their clipboard. Immediately afterward, the page displays a friendly message, complete with familiar macOS keyboard shortcut visuals, explicitly instructing the user to open Terminal and paste what they've just copied. If the user follows these instructions, the command downloads and runs the malicious file known as Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS).",
      "This trick is specifically targeted at Mac users. The website checks the visitor's operating system and only activates the attack if it detects macOS. For Windows or Linux users, the site behaves normally. Researchers have dubbed this infection method \"ClickFix,\" referencing the single click that initiates the attack chain.",
      "At the center of this campaign is AMOS, a sophisticated piece of malware that has become notorious in cybercrime circles. AMOS is available for rent on Telegram, with some versions costing attackers up to $3,000 per month. Once installed, AMOS can steal a wide array of sensitive data: it can extract Wi-Fi and app passwords stored in Keychain, collect browser cookies and autofill data, list system information and scan through personal folders such as Desktop and Documents. It is also capable of identifying and targeting more than 50 types of cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "Fake reCAPTCHA (Cyber Security News) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Domains and sites compromised in the MacReaper campaign",
      "Several cybersecurity reports have identified specific domains involved in the attack infrastructure. Notably, domains such as\u00a0technavix.cloud and\u00a0salorttactical.top have been highlighted as part of the malicious network distributing AMOS. The campaign's initial discovery traced back to a compromised Brazilian news site,\u00a0agencia2.jornalfloripa.com.br, which served as an early infection vector before the operation expanded to more than 2,800 legitimate websites worldwide.",
      "Macs aren't as secure as Apple wants you to believe",
      "MacReaper challenges two widely held beliefs. The first is that everyday CAPTCHA checks are just harmless speed bumps. The second is that macOS provides a level of built-in security that keeps most attackers at bay. In reality, a single click can expose Keychain credentials, active browser sessions and cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "These are exactly the kinds of targets that attract credential-stuffing groups and profit-driven cybercriminals. Because the attack is triggered by the user, many network monitoring tools treat the traffic as normal, leaving security teams with little to investigate. In environments where Macs and Windows machines share identity systems, one compromised Mac can open access to single sign-on portals, cloud storage and even production codebases.",

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of the MacReaper attack, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures.",
      "1) Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to copy commands or paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it's likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2) Don't click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many MacReaper attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company's official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4) Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you've interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don't recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6) Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from MacReaper or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "MacReaper makes it clear that the most durable exploits aren't zero-days but borrowed moments of trust, an authentic-looking CAPTCHA, a helpful-sounding fix, a clipboard that does what it's told. As Apple tightens the technical screws with Rapid Security Responses and notarization, expect adversaries to double down on such psychological levers. The counter-strategy is to hard-bake healthy skepticism into user behavior and to instrument Macs with the same telemetry layers enterprises already expect from Windows. Security, in other words, has finally become a platform-agnostic muscle, and complacency is the riskiest operating system of all.",

      "There\u2019s a long list of methods cybercriminals use to get into people\u2019s financial accounts, and most of them don\u2019t involve \"hacking\" in the Hollywood sense. Instead, they rely on tricking you into handing over sensitive information. Here are some of the most common techniques.",
      "Fake banking apps and mobile trojans: Some apps are designed to look exactly like your bank\u2019s official app, but they\u2019re actually fakes. If you enter your login info, it goes straight to the scammer. Even more advanced are\u00a0mobile banking trojans, which hide inside seemingly unrelated apps. Once installed, the trojan watches for when you open your real banking app and then quickly overlays a fake login screen. If you type in your credentials, the trojan grabs them and sends them off to the attacker.",
      "Phishing scams: Scammers\u00a0send emails or texts that appear to be from your bank, asking you to verify a transaction or log in to resolve an issue. These messages often include links to websites that look identical to your bank\u2019s site but are actually fakes. The giveaway is often a small detail, like a misspelled URL. For example, \"captial0ne.com\" instead of \"capitalone.com.\"",
      "Keyloggers:\u00a0Keyloggers are a type of malware that silently records everything you type. If one gets onto your device, it can capture your banking username, password and anything else you type, all without you knowing.",
      "Man-in-the-middle attacks:\u00a0These attacks happen when hackers intercept the data being transmitted between you and your bank\u2019s website. This is especially risky if you\u2019re on\u00a0public Wi-Fi. You may think you're logging in securely, but a hacker could be watching everything or even redirecting you to a fake version of your bank's site.",
      "SIM swapping:\u00a0SIM swapping is where a scammer contacts your phone provider, pretends to be you and asks to transfer your number to a new SIM card. If successful, they receive your text messages, including any verification codes sent by your bank. This gives them access to your account, even if two-factor authentication is turned on.",

By targeting the display layer of your banking app or web interface. If malware is installed on your device, it can manipulate what shows up on the screen. That means your balance might look normal, while your actual funds are long gone. This type of attack is extremely rare and usually requires access to a compromised or jailbroken device, but it\u2019s technically possible and just sophisticated enough to delay you from realizing what happened.",

      "1) Use official apps only: Cybercriminals will try to trick you with fake banking apps and mobile trojans that overlay fake login screens, so it\u2019s critical to download banking apps exclusively from the Apple App Store or Google Play. Never install apps from links in emails or texts.",
      "2) Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA): SIM-swapping attacks can hijack your phone number and intercept SMS codes, so enable app-based\u00a02FA to block unauthorized logins even if hackers obtain your password.",
      "3) Get text or app alerts: Hackers can manipulate your account\u2019s display to hide stolen funds, so set up real-time transaction alerts to expose unauthorized withdrawals immediately, especially for microtransactions used to test your account.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords: Phishing scams and keyloggers often harvest weak or reused credentials, so use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Avoid clicking suspicious links and install strong antivirus software: Scammers impersonate banks with phishing emails/texts containing misspelled URLs (e.g., \"captial0ne.com\"), so always navigate directly to your bank\u2019s official website or app instead of clicking embedded links. Strong antivirus software helps protect your devices from fake apps, keyloggers and other threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Check your accounts regularly: Don\u2019t just glance at your balance. Review recent transactions at least once a week to catch any suspicious activity.",
      "7) Avoid public Wi-Fi for banking: Hackers exploit unsecured networks to launch man-in-the-middle attacks and spoof banking sites, so use a VPN to encrypt your connection if you must bank on public Wi-Fi. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "8) Use a personal data removal service: Data brokers sell your contact details and personal information, which hackers can use for targeted phishing attacks or SIM swap scams. These services automatically remove your data from broker databases, reducing the risk of social engineering attempts that could compromise your bank account.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says AT\u00b2 Aerospace\u2019s Z1 hybrid airship uses helium lift, low fuel, no runways.",
      "The tragic Hindenburg disaster of 1937, which resulted in the death of 36 people and effectively ended passenger airship travel, cast a long-lasting shadow over lighter-than-air technology. For many decades, airships were largely confined to niche roles such as advertising and surveillance.",
      "However, a groundbreaking spin-off from Lockheed Martin to AT\u00b2 Aerospace is now reviving the airship concept with a modern twist: hybrid airships designed specifically for eco-friendly cargo transport. Most recently, AT\u00b2 Aerospace announced two purchase orders for their airships, one from Straightline Aviation and one from Arctic Airships.",

      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The Z1 hybrid airship",
      "At the center of this revival is the Z1 hybrid airship, a massive vessel capable of carrying up to 23.5 tons (21 metric tons) of cargo while minimizing environmental impacts and significantly reducing fuel consumption compared to traditional aircraft. Unlike the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg, which was highly flammable, the Z1 relies on helium for lift, a nonflammable gas, providing buoyancy for the majority of the airship's weight, combined with aerodynamic design and advanced propulsion systems.",
      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MASSIVE AIRSHIP COULD SHAKE UP CARGO TRANSPORT",
      "How the Z1 hybrid airship works",
      "The Z1 combines lighter-than-air buoyancy with advanced engineering innovations. Notably, the aircraft features a tri-lobe hull design, a hallmark of Lockheed Martin's earlier airship projects. This design includes a raised central lobe flanked by two side lobes, which enhances lift efficiency and stability. Its Air Cushion Landing System allows it to take off and land on virtually any flat surface, including sand, ice, water or uneven terrain, eliminating the need for traditional runways.",
      "The Z1 uses vectored thrust propulsion and advanced onboard systems for weather prediction and route planning, enabling it to travel more than 1,400 nautical miles at speeds of up to 60 knots. The hybrid lift system merges helium's natural buoyancy with vectored thrust from the engines, optimizing both efficiency and control. This innovative design reduces fuel consumption to just one-fifth of what a heavy-lift helicopter would use, making the Z1 especially suited for transporting goods to remote and difficult-to-access areas such as the Arctic or the Amazon rainforest.",
      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "ZERO EMISSIONS HYDROGEN ELECTRIC JET DISRUPTS CONVENTIONAL FLIGHTS",
      "Why it matters",
      "The Z1 addresses two pressing challenges in modern transportation. First, it offers a practical solution for accessing remote regions where traditional cargo planes and helicopters face high costs and infrastructure limitations. Its ability to land without airstrips unlocks affordable transport options for industries like mining, disaster relief and medical supply delivery in isolated communities.",
      "Second, the Z1 contributes to the urgent global need to reduce carbon emissions. Transports such as cars, trucks, trains, ships and airplanes currently account for over 40% of worldwide carbon emissions, and the Z1's low fuel consumption and ability to overfly environmentally sensitive areas quietly present a scalable alternative for freight transport with minimized environmental impact.",

      "The recent $50 million order from Straightline Aviation demonstrates strong confidence in the Z1's commercial potential, with the first delivery expected by 2028. Arctic Airships has also placed orders for two airships, targeting operations in Alaska's challenging terrain.",
      "\"Our hybrid airships will transform cargo transport by providing an environmentally responsible solution while maintaining operational efficiency,\" said Dr. Bob Boyd, CEO of AT\u00b2 Aerospace. He went on to say,\u00a0\"Our aircraft not only optimizes cargo movement in challenging terrains but also aligns with the industry's increasing focus on environmental responsibility and cost efficiency.\"",

      "SMS (Short Message Service) is the most basic form of text messaging and has been around since the early days of mobile phones. It allows users to send plain text messages with a strict character limit of 160 characters. SMS messages are sent over the cellular network, which means they work even if you don\u2019t have a data plan or access to Wi-Fi. This makes SMS one of the most reliable messaging options available, especially for simple communication. It works for all phones, even older models, which makes it universal.",
      "MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service)\u00a0builds upon SMS by allowing the transmission of multimedia content. With MMS, users can send images, videos, audio files and even GIFs. The character limit is significantly higher, typically up to 1,600 characters, although this can vary depending on the carrier. MMS messages also travel over the cellular network but require mobile data to send and receive. They do not require Wi-Fi, but because media files are larger, the reliability can vary. Some carriers compress MMS files or fail to send them if they exceed certain size limits, which means your carefully chosen vacation photo might arrive as a pixelated blur.",
      "RCS (Rich Communication Services) represents the next generation of mobile messaging. It is designed to upgrade the SMS and MMS experience by providing features that rival popular messaging apps like iMessage and WhatsApp. With RCS, users can send high-resolution photos and videos, audio clips, emoji, stickers and even read receipts and typing indicators. There is no character limit, and the service works over Wi-Fi or mobile data instead of over standard cellular channels.",
      "While RCS allows larger files, some messaging platforms or carriers may still apply soft limits or compress images/videos to ensure consistent performance. However, for RCS to work, both the sender and the recipient need to have RCS enabled on a supported messaging app and carrier. Google Messages is the most reliable app for accessing these RCS features, especially on Android devices. However, it should be noted that Apple devices do not support RCS natively because Apple relies on iMessage for similar functionality.",
      "HOW TO STOP SPAM TEXT MESSAGES ON YOUR PHONE",
      "Why it matters when choosing a wireless carrier",
      "Now that you know what SMS, MMS and RCS are, it\u2019s important to understand how your phone carrier influences your messaging experience. From hidden fees to message delivery issues, the provider you choose can make a big difference in how well these technologies work.",
      "Not all carriers treat these messaging types the same. While SMS is often free and unlimited on many plans, MMS messages may incur additional charges, especially on prepaid or international plans. RCS messages, on the other hand, use mobile data or Wi-Fi and typically do not incur per-message fees, making them a cost-effective option if supported.",
      "For example, carrier A might offer unlimited SMS but charge for every MMS sent. Carrier B might include MMS in the plan but cap the number of SMS messages. Carrier C could fully support RCS, letting users send messages over Wi-Fi for free. Choosing the right carrier based on how you communicate can help avoid surprise charges.",
      "While SMS and MMS are universally supported, RCS still depends on carrier infrastructure and the messaging app being used. Some carriers support RCS only through their proprietary apps, which may not be compatible with all devices. Others support \"universal RCS\", which works across multiple platforms but still requires the right app, most reliably\u00a0Google Messages.",
      "If you\u2019re hoping to use RCS features like high-resolution image sharing, read receipts and typing indicators, it\u2019s important to ensure your carrier not only supports RCS but also supports it universally across devices and apps. Otherwise, your message may silently fall back to SMS or MMS if the recipient\u2019s carrier or device does not support RCS.",

      "A French startup named Robeaut\u00e9 has just raised about $29 million to develop a truly groundbreaking neurosurgical microrobot.",

      "A neurosurgical microrobot. (Robeaut\u00e9)",
      "The challenges of brain surgery today",
      "Brain surgery is incredibly complex. The tools surgeons use today are often rigid and can only move in straight lines. This limits where they can safely operate. Many tumors or problematic areas in the brain are simply too risky to reach because they lie near regions responsible for critical functions like movement or speech.",
      "In some cases, surgeons have no choice but to leave tumors untreated because the risk of damage is too high. On top of that, many drugs cannot even reach certain parts of the brain because of the blood-brain barrier, leaving patients with limited treatment options.",
      "A neurosurgical microrobot. (Robeaut\u00e9)",
      "TEEN GOES FROM 10 NIGHTLY SEIZURES TO ZERO WITH BRAIN IMPLANT",
      "How the microrobot works",
      "Robeaut\u00e9\u2019s microrobot is designed to overcome these challenges. It is incredibly small, about three millimeters long, roughly the size of a grain of rice, and it enters the brain through a tiny incision just a millimeter wide. Unlike traditional tools, this robot does not move in straight lines. Instead, it can follow curved paths, gently pushing aside brain tissue as it goes. It uses rotating silicone rings at its tip to carefully shift tissue without causing damage. This movement is inspired by how tiny insects walk on water, using adhesion forces that dominate at such small scales.",
      "Inside the robot, there is a small compartment that holds miniature surgical tools. For example, when performing a biopsy, the microrobot uses a flexible needle and tiny forceps to collect tissue samples. These samples can be stored inside the device or pulled back through a cable connected to the robot. Beyond biopsies, the robot can also implant electrodes for conditions like Parkinson\u2019s disease or deliver drugs directly to tumors. It even has sensors that send real-time information back to the surgeons, helping them monitor the procedure closely.",
      "What is really impressive is how the robot\u2019s path is planned. Using MRI scans combined with artificial intelligence, surgeons can map out safe routes that avoid sensitive brain areas. During surgery, they can adjust the robot\u2019s position in real time using ultrasound imaging mounted on the skull, achieving sub-millimeter precision.",

      "AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS",
      "Looking ahead: Trials and future plans",
      "So far, the microrobot has been tested in preclinical trials, mainly on sheep, with very promising results. There were no major complications like bleeding, which suggests the device can safely navigate brain tissue. Robeaut\u00e9 plans to begin human clinical trials in 2026, focusing on microbiopsies of brain tumors. They also aim to expand into the U.S. market and seek FDA approval, with hopes of launching internationally by 2030.",

      "Why this technology matters",
      "The potential impact of this microrobot is huge. It could allow doctors to diagnose brain tumors earlier and treat them more effectively while reducing the risks associated with traditional surgery. Because it is minimally invasive, patients could experience faster recoveries and fewer side effects. Additionally, the ability to collect live data from inside the brain could accelerate research and drug development for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.",

It tackles one of the most difficult challenges in healthcare: how to safely access and treat the brain. While there are still hurdles to overcome, such as regulatory approvals and manufacturing at scale, this tiny device has the potential to turn previously \"inoperable\" brain tumors into treatable conditions. As one of the company\u2019s founders describes it, the microrobot acts like a \"brain gardener,\" delicately tending to damaged tissue from within. With strong funding and a growing portfolio of patents, Robeaut\u00e9 is poised to make a lasting impact on the future of neurosurgery.",

      "When sending photos from an iPhone to an Android phone, images often appear blurry or compressed due to differences in messaging protocols and compression methods. This issue arises because Apple uses SMS/MMS to send messages to Android devices, which compresses images due to size limitations. Additionally, iPhones often use the HEIC format, which may not be fully supported on Android devices, leading to compatibility issues and reduced quality.",

      "Several third-party messaging apps, such as FaceBook Messenger and Telegram, allow you to keep your photo files at their original size, ensuring that quality doesn't decrease.

Thankfully, with the introduction of RCS messaging on iPhones, you can now send uncompressed images, significantly improving quality. Additionally, utilizing cloud services like Google Photos or third-party messaging apps can help maintain image clarity.

      "The attempted takeover of a library at Columbia University by anti-Israel protesters last week was shut down fast and decisively by law enforcement, and the feeling among students on campus is that any further disruption \u2014 or any repeat of last year\u2019s chaotic campus encampments \u2014 will not be tolerated among the university\u2019s new leadership and will be quickly squashed.",
      "There was a somber and uneasy mood outside the university the day after the protest, with the vast majority of students tight-lipped on the matter as they hurriedly shuffled through a security checkpoint outside the main gate on their way to class. There were no political signs, no Palestinian flags, and only a handful of people over the course of several hours were spotted wearing keffiyehs, the traditional Middle Eastern scarf often worn by protesters to signify their support of Palestinians.",

      "\"There's just a collective understanding now on campus that we don't talk about certain things because of fears of getting detained or questioned by the authorities. So it was very scary last night because the university really revealed themselves in that they\u2026 really don't have our interests at heart. And I think that was seen through the viciousness that a lot of the public safety officers and NYPD had.\"",
      "Cruz Bustamante and others sympathetic to the protesters' cause pointed fingers at the alleged heavy-handed tactics used by the NYPD and university police.",
      "Having had $400 million in federal funding pulled by the Trump administration, the university warned students weeks ago that any illegal protests would be swiftly shut down, and agitators would be arrested.",
      "That is exactly what happened on Wednesday afternoon when anti-Israel protesters burst into the Butler Library and climbed on tables as students prepared for finals. The NYPD made 80 arrests \u2013 19 males and 61 females, according to a source. A source also said at least 50 of the 80\u00a0protesters arrested\u00a0were Columbia University students.",

      "\"Columbia is going against every value that they preach. I mean they teach us these beautiful values and the reason why I came here -- freedom and equality and justice \u2013 but they're bending over backwards to basically appease a dictator. While Harvard is fighting back. They're not even trying to fight back.\"",
      "He said that the demonstrators' message itself is antisemitic and that there is always a small fraction of people who will take it too far, adding that those protesting are not against the Jewish people.",
      "However, a blunt Rose Meyer was adamant that agitators should pay the price for their illegal conduct.",
      "\"My thoughts are that if you're going to break school policy, you will pay the consequences. It's that simple,\" Meyer said. \"What's happening in Gaza is not great. I don't have a solution. I don't think it's very easy to solve, but the way you're going about it, not so bueno.\"",
      "The university's encampment protests ignited a wave of campus protests throughout the country last year. The chaos at Columbia culminated in students taking control of\u00a0Hamilton Hall and violently clashing\u00a0with police\u00a0in riot gear. The ugly scenes saw more than 200 people arrested as students protested Israel\u2019s war in Gaza in response to the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas that left more than 1,200 people dead.",
      "Critics of the protesters said they were fueled by hatred of Israel, while defenders said they were trying to force political change and stop Israel\u2019s attacks on Gaza aimed at crushing Hamas and rescuing the hostages.",
      "Another student, PJ, said he hopes Wednesday's disturbance can be used as an inflection point and said he hopes it is used as a time to come together to find some common ground. He feels the disruptions should be dealt with internally by the university.",

    "summary": "The court is considering whether to allow the proposal to go into effect at least in some parts of the country while litigation continues in lower courts.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday weighs whether to allow President Donald Trump's radical reinterpretation of the Constitution's guarantee of birthright citizenship to go into effect, at least in part, while litigation continues.",
      "In an unusual move, the court is hearing oral arguments on a series of Trump administration emergency requests seeking to limit the scope of nationwide injunctions that blocked the plan almost as soon as it was announced in January.",
      "A decision siding with the administration would not only provide a boost to Trump's birthright citizenship proposal but would also help the administration implement other policies via executive actions, many of which have also been blocked nationwide by lower court judges.",
      "The justices have not agreed to take up the bigger legal question of whether Trump's plan comports with the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\"",
      "The longstanding interpretation of the provision as understood by generations of Americans, including legal scholars on the left and right, is that anyone born on U.S. soil is an American citizen with a few minor exceptions, including people who are the children of diplomats.",
      "As part of Trump's hard-line immigration policy, he wants to limit birthright citizenship to people who have at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or is a permanent U.S. resident.",
      "In line with the historical understanding of the 14th Amendment, every court that has ruled on the plan so far has blocked it. Trump filed three separate emergency applications at the Supreme Court seeking to narrow the injunctions issued by judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state.",
      "The Trump administration has complained vociferously about judges who have issued \"universal injunctions\" blocking various policies rolled out during the president's first few months in office. The Justice Department says there have been 39 such rulings on a host of issues, including the administration's ban on transgender people serving on the military, which the Supreme Court recently allowed to go into effect.",
      "Trump has relied in large part on aggressive executive orders to enact his agenda, rather than seeking legislation from Congress or regulatory actions by federal agencies.",
      "The administration's argument is that federal judges simply do not have the authority to issue broad rulings that affect people other than the litigants appearing before them. As a result, when judges rule that a government policy is unlawful, the decision should only apply to the individual plaintiffs or entities that sued, the administration says.",
      "In response, the challengers say that on an issue like birthright citizenship, a nationwide injunction is appropriate in part because it is vital to have uniformity on such a fundamental right.",
      "Even if some nationwide injunctions cannot be justified, the Supreme Court should not use the birthright citizenship case to curb the ability of judges to issue them at all, lawyers for the plaintiffs argue.",
      "The administration has asked the court to limit the injunctions to individual people or organizations that sued, and potentially the 22 states led by New Jersey and Washington that filed separate lawsuits on birthright citizenship.",
      "Depending on what action the court takes, the proposal could go into effect in more than half of all U.S. states but not others, or against anyone who has not themselves sued or is not a member of the immigrant advocacy organizations CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project.",
      "If the court grants the administration's request in some form, people affected by the executive order may have to file their own lawsuits or join a class action lawsuit.",
      "All of this is taking place amid widespread agreement among legal experts that the Supreme Court would ultimately rule against Trump when the case eventually reaches the justices on the merits.",
      "In recent years, five of the six members of the court's conservative majority have raised concerns about individual judges having the power to block a president's actions nationwide, an authority that is traditionally reserved for the Supreme Court.",
      "Such rulings have stymied not just the Trump administration but recent Democratic administrations as well."

    "story": [
      "ISTANBUL \u2014 Confusion swirled around high-stakes peace talks between Russia and Ukraine that were called for by Russian President Vladimir Putin Thursday, as the Kremlin confirmed that Putin himself would be skipping the negotiations.",
      "Uncertainty over the start date, location, and whether either side would even participate made for chaotic scenes in the Turkish capital Ankara, Antalya and Istanbul \u2014 outside whose Ottoman-era Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace some 200 journalists and crew were massed with no clear idea of when talks would get underway.",
      "A back-and-forth between Kyiv, Moscow and the Trump administration dashed the U.S. president's hopes of a three-way meeting involving Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "When asked Thursday whether Putin would be attending talks in Turkey, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told CNN \u201cno.\u201d He added on a later media call that there are \u201cno preparations\u201d for talks between Putin and Trump in the coming days.",
      "Putin made the suggestion for negotiations \u201cwithout any preconditions\u201d after Ukrainian allies, including Germany, France and the U.K. presented an ultimatum to Moscow to either accept the ceasefire proposal or face additional sanctions.",
      "The Russian leader's no-show is expected to further antagonize the White House, which has markedly changed its tone over the war in the past weeks. Even after his historic Oval Office shouting match with Zelenskyy, Vice President J.D. Vance has shifted to accusing Moscow of \u201casking for too much,\u201d in the bilateral peace talks senior Trump administration officials have held with Russia in recent weeks.",
      "That is partly because Trump\u2019s major gripe with Ukraine \u2014 that American taxpayers have mostly funded Ukraine\u2019s defense \u2014 was soothed after the two nations struck a mineral deals that would go some way to repaying American military aid.",
      "Zelenskyy has also presented himself as compliant, backing Trump\u2019s calls for an immediate 30-day ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "Trump has said he is \u201calways considering\u201d additional sanctions against Russia if he believes Moscow is blocking the peace process, with officials also suggesting secondary sanctions on the buyers of Russian oil.",
      "After heeding Trump\u2019s calls to accept Putin\u2019s initial suggestion of talks Sunday, Zelenskyy landed Thursday in Ankara.",
      "Before a planned meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyib Erdogan, Zelenskyy said he would meet with a broader Turkish delegation as well as American diplomats.",
      "\u201cThe level of the Russian delegation is not officially known to me yet, but from what we see \u2014 it looks like not a serious level,\u201d Zelenskyy, using a Ukrainian word meaning \u2018sham\u2019 or \u2018theatrical.\u2019",
      "\u201cWe must understand the level of the Russian delegation and what mandate they have \u2014 whether they are even capable of making any decisions on their own,\u201d Zelenskyy added, \u201cbecause we all know who actually makes decisions in Russia.\u201d",
      "That was instead of joining the talks initially planned for Istanbul, after the Kremlin indicated late Wednesday that rather than Putin, or even Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, it was instead sending a relatively junior team headed by Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin.",
      "\u201cThis week really may change a lot \u2014 but only may,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an X post Wednesday, adding, \u201cI am waiting to see who will come from Russia, and then I will decide which steps Ukraine should take.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far, the signals from them in the media are unconvincing,\u201d he added.",
      "While the Kremlin's last-minute naming of a junior team will do little to dispel Ukrainian and European allegations that Putin is not taking Trump's peace-brokering attempts seriously, the Russian delegation that arrived Thursday in Istanbul was \u201cready for serious work,\u201d Russian foreign ministry Maria Zakharova said at a news briefing the same day.",
      "As well as uncertainty over whether Ukraine would even send a delegation to the scaled down talks in Istanbul, Kyiv and Moscow appeared to disagree over the start time of talks.",
      "While Russian media initially reported a 10 a.m. local time start (3 a.m. ET) at the Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace, that shifted to midday, and then after 5 p.m.",
      "The confusion looked set to continue in Istanbul late Thursday morning, with American personnel appeared to be preparing a venue for a U.S. delegation to use as a base, with officials huddled in urgent meetings and two security staff arriving with a German Shepherd.",
      "State-run broadcaster Russia 1 TV, meanwhile, that 89 Russian journalists have been accredited to cover the negotiations with the station's reporters suggesting to NBC News that they were told the negotiations would conclude Thursday.",

      "Walmart said in February that it wasn\u2019t \u201cimmune\u201d from the costs of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. Now it\u2019s preparing shoppers to pay more, potentially within weeks.",
      "The retail giant is likely to start rolling out tariff-related price hikes \u201ctowards the tail end of this month, and I certainly expect more in June,\u201d Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told CNBC Thursday, as the company reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Sales rose by 4.5% at U.S. stores, and the company\u2019s e-commerce business notched its first profitable quarter.",
      "But Rainey said \u201cit\u2019s a challenging environment to operate in retail right now,\u201d speaking separately Thursday to Bloomberg. He indicated that the Trump administration has further to go to resolve cost pressures that have risen at a scale and speed without \u201chistorical precedent,\u201d despite recent truces with the U.K. and China \u2014 a view analysts have also shared this week on the heels of those agreements.",
      "Several other major brands have recently revised or scrapped their financial outlooks for the rest of the year, saying they\u2019re struggling to game out how ever-shifting White House trade policies will affect their business. Walmart, for its part, maintained its 2025 sales and profit guidance. But it decided not to offer guidance on operating income or earnings per share for the second quarter now underway, due to the \u201cthe range of near-term outcomes being exceedingly wide and difficult to predict.\u201d",
      "A number of companies that sell products at Walmart, such as Stanley Black & Decker, Adidas, Mattel and Procter & Gamble, have already raised prices or signaled expected hikes.",
      "\u201cShould the duties go away, there will of course not be price increases,\u201d Adidas CEO Bjorn Gulden said in late April. \u201cBut I think we all agree that should this duty stay or even be higher, then of course it will cause a price increase in the market in general.\u201d",
      "Since Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs on April 2 \u2014 and then partially walked them back days later \u2014\u00a0Walmart\u2019s shares have risen nearly 8%, far outpacing the gains of Target and Costco. Its stock has jumped about 7% so far this year.",
      "Analysts have seen Walmart as relatively well-positioned to handle some of the retail sector\u2019s headwinds. Deutsche Bank researchers said ahead of the company\u2019s earnings report Thursday that it could benefit from shoppers\u2019 \u201cvalue-seeking behavior\u201d as consumers grow more pessimistic. Walmart\u2019s scale allows it to offer \u201ccompelling price points\u201d even as it faces higher costs, they said.",
      "Visits to Walmart locations slid 2.4% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Placer.ai. But the foot-traffic analytics firm found visits to Walmart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club wholesale stores, which are known for bargain prices in bulk, rose 2.7% in the same period. Other membership-based superstores, including BJ\u2019s and Costco, also saw jumps in foot traffic, Placer said.",
      "Indeed, Walmart\u2019s traditional retail business has already been buoyed by its own subscription offering, Walmart+. Members of the $12.97 monthly program accounted for nearly half of the company\u2019s U.S. online spending in its last full fiscal year, shelling out almost three times as much as non-subscriber customers, CNBC reported last month."

    "story": [
      "A day after 59 white South Africans were welcomed to America as refugees, more than 86,000 South African farmers \u2014 who are mostly white \u2014 are gathering this week at the NAMPO Harvest Day trade fair, an annual agricultural exhibition considered the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "Over four days, the attendees will discuss innovations in technology, collaborations and various other elements of an industry that last year generated nearly $14 billion in revenue.",
      "Notably, according to one participant, there is no planned discussion of violence against white farmers or \u201cAfrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored, race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation\u201d without compensation, as President Donald Trump wrote in a Feb. 7 executive order that opened the way for the 59 South Africans to come to U.S., despite a ban on refugees from other nations.",
      "The executive order referenced South Africa\u2019s Expropriation Act enacted last year, which in some cases allows the government to seize unused land without compensation, something Cyril Ramaphosa, the country\u2019s president, said has not happened.",
      "The act awakened a profoundly troubling argument over land rights. South Africa's dark history of racism includes the confiscation of land from Black residents, both before and during the apartheid. Afrikaners, the minority white descendants of Dutch and French settlers who arrived in South Africa in the 1600s, were leaders of the apartheid regime that ended in 1994.",
      "The purported goal of the Expropriation Act is to shrink the vast land ownership disparity that came with the oppressive rule. According to the organization Action for Southern Africa, 72% of farms and agricultural holdings are owned by whites, who make up 7.3% of the population. Black Africans, representing 81.4%, own only 4% of the land.",
      "Trump asserted on Monday, ahead of the refugees\u2019 arrival in the U.S., that \u201cwhite farmers are being brutally killed and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.\u201d",
      "Yet Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, said that the spirit of NAMPO this week reaffirms that \u201cgenocide\u201d of white South African farmers \u201cwas imaginary and not happening in our country.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all disturbed that the U.S. side is alleging that there\u2019s genocide and mistreatment of white farmers in South Africa. It is incorrect,\u201d said Sihlobo, who is also co-author of the book \u201cThe Uncomfortable Truth About South Africa\u2019s Agriculture.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anything, the sector continues to flourish. [Trump's] comments are misinformed and not mirroring the reality on the ground in the country,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "The New York Times reported 225 people were killed on South African farms over a four-year period ending in 2024. Of those deaths, 101 were Black current or former workers living on farms, and 53 were farmers, who are usually white.",
      "Nico Harris, a farmer of Afrikaans heritage, told Daily Maverick South African newspaper that the problems he sees can be overcome and stem from the government not being \u201cpro-farmer.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the refugees that have gone [to the U.S.] are not well-established family farming businesses like we are,\u201d Harris told the paper. \u201cI think they don\u2019t have an opportunity in the country and they might think that, \u2018This is an opportunity for us.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really fleeing because they are scared or worried, I think they see it as an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Harris added, \u201cI think there are racially discriminating laws against white farmers, and I think they have problems and haven\u2019t got sympathy from the government. But there are no real land grabs, and I don\u2019t think there are real threats. There are individual farm attacks, but it\u2019s more related to criminal activity. We just hope our government is going to wake up and realize that they need the farmers, Black and white.\u201d",
      "One of the South Africans who arrived in the U.S. on Monday told The Washington Post that she had been advised not to speak with the media and said it had been a \u201cvery emotional, very rough couple of weeks.\u201d",
      "Theo Boshoff, CEO of AgBiz, which represents companies across the agricultural value chain, including South African and multinational companies, said crime in rural farming areas is high but \u201cnot targeted against any racial or ethnic group.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no genocide in South Africa,\u201d Boshoff added. \u201cPeople who live in rural areas, who are often farmers, are simply more vulnerable to crime and violent crime because they live in remote areas.\u201d",
      "And because they are remote, law enforcement often is not nearby to protect them. \u201cThere is no cultural or racial bias at play. White farmers, Black farmers, white farmworkers, Black farmworkers are\u00a0all equally at risk and united in combatting this challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t agree with insinuations that rural crime is motivated by politics or in any way related to South Africa\u2019s affirmative action efforts to remedy our checkered past.\u201d",

    "summary": "Walmart said Trump\u2019s import taxes remain too high to avoid passing along to shoppers, who could start paying more for some items as soon as late May.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart said in February that it wasn\u2019t \u201cimmune\u201d from the costs of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. Now it\u2019s preparing shoppers to pay more, potentially within weeks.",
      "The retail giant is likely to start rolling out tariff-related price hikes \u201ctowards the tail end of this month, and I certainly expect more in June,\u201d Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told CNBC Thursday, as the company reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Sales rose by 4.5% at U.S. stores, and the company\u2019s e-commerce business notched its first profitable quarter.",
      "But Rainey said \u201cit\u2019s a challenging environment to operate in retail right now,\u201d speaking separately Thursday to Bloomberg. He indicated that the Trump administration has further to go to resolve cost pressures that have risen at a scale and speed without \u201chistorical precedent,\u201d despite recent truces with the U.K. and China \u2014 a view analysts have also shared this week on the heels of those agreements.",
      "Several other major brands have recently revised or scrapped their financial outlooks for the rest of the year, saying they\u2019re struggling to game out how ever-shifting White House trade policies will affect their business. Walmart, for its part, maintained its 2025 sales and profit guidance. But it decided not to offer guidance on operating income or earnings per share for the second quarter now underway, due to the \u201cthe range of near-term outcomes being exceedingly wide and difficult to predict.\u201d",
      "A number of companies that sell products at Walmart, such as Stanley Black & Decker, Adidas, Mattel and Procter & Gamble, have already raised prices or signaled expected hikes.",
      "\u201cShould the duties go away, there will of course not be price increases,\u201d Adidas CEO Bjorn Gulden said in late April. \u201cBut I think we all agree that should this duty stay or even be higher, then of course it will cause a price increase in the market in general.\u201d",
      "Since Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs on April 2 \u2014 and then partially walked them back days later \u2014\u00a0Walmart\u2019s shares have risen nearly 8%, far outpacing the gains of Target and Costco. Its stock has jumped about 7% so far this year.",
      "Analysts have seen Walmart as relatively well-positioned to handle some of the retail sector\u2019s headwinds. Deutsche Bank researchers said ahead of the company\u2019s earnings report Thursday that it could benefit from shoppers\u2019 \u201cvalue-seeking behavior\u201d as consumers grow more pessimistic. Walmart\u2019s scale allows it to offer \u201ccompelling price points\u201d even as it faces higher costs, they said.",
      "Visits to Walmart locations slid 2.4% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Placer.ai. But the foot-traffic analytics firm found visits to Walmart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club wholesale stores, which are known for bargain prices in bulk, rose 2.7% in the same period. Other membership-based superstores, including BJ\u2019s and Costco, also saw jumps in foot traffic, Placer said.",
      "Indeed, Walmart\u2019s traditional retail business has already been buoyed by its own subscription offering, Walmart+. Members of the $12.97 monthly program accounted for nearly half of the company\u2019s U.S. online spending in its last full fiscal year, shelling out almost three times as much as non-subscriber customers, CNBC reported last month."

      "Zelenskyy has also presented himself as compliant, backing Trump\u2019s calls for an immediate 30-day ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "Trump has said he is \u201calways considering\u201d additional sanctions against Russia if he believes Moscow is blocking the peace process, with officials also suggesting secondary sanctions on the buyers of Russian oil.",

      "\u201cWe must understand the level of the Russian delegation and what mandate they have \u2014 whether they are even capable of making any decisions on their own,\u201d Zelenskyy added, \u201cbecause we all know who actually makes decisions in Russia.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s the government\u2019s dirty little secret\u2014this has been an ongoing effort by nation states and other criminal organizations for years,\u201d said Jordan Burris, vice president of Socure, an identities management firm, a former White House official. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to confirm that these coordinated attacks\u00a0are pilfering government programs and doing so at a velocity that is relentless.\u201d",
      "Socure\u2019s\u00a0new\u00a0report found that U.S. government programs are being attacked by international\u00a0criminal\u00a0groups in China, Russia, Egypt, Poland and several other nations\u2014and that international fraudsters were responsible for up to 12% of all applications for government services and loans. The core problem is a failure to properly identify recipients.",
      "\u201cFor far too long, fraud has been seen as the cost of doing business in government. But this is a fallacy,\u201d says the new report, which NBC News obtained in advance of its publication. \u201cAs Washington prioritizes efficiency, one of the most significant opportunities to reduce government waste, fraud, and abuse remains under-addressed: strengthening our digital identity verification systems.\u201d",
      "A Trump Administration official speaking on behalf of DOGE told NBC News that DOGE is trying to implement new technology and private sector solutions to stop improper payments. But he said those efforts have been met with criticism, such as a plan to modernize computer code in the Social Security Administration.",

      "But anti-fraud experts say the same thing has been happening for years to regular government programs, from Federal Emergency Management Agency hurricane relief to Medicare.",
      "A report by the Government Accountability Office last year pegged annual losses\u00a0to fraud\u00a0at between $233 billion and $521 billion annually. Burris and other experts say the true number if likely far higher.",
      "\"You can only measure what you can see when it comes to identity fraud,\u201d said Burris, who previously\u00a0worked in the White House as the chief of staff\u00a0in the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer\u00a0from 2017 to 2021. \u201cFrankly, the government does not have the right visibility.

Experts say\u00a0it persists in government not because of\u00a0corrupt bureaucrats\u00a0but due to\u00a0incompetence and inertia, experts say.",
      "\u201cCriminals are using the stolen identities of Americans to pilfer federal and state government programs at a record pace,\u201d\u00a0according to\u00a0the new report from Socure,. \u201cNew AI enabled technologies allow bad actors to use increasingly sophisticated fraud tactics to siphon billions away from programs.\u201d",

Examples include\u00a0someone claiming to be calling from Connecticut who is actually in China\u00a0or\u00a0asking to add a bank account that has never been associated with the presumed beneficiary.",
      "\u201cDOGE claims that this is something that\u2019s front and center for them,\u201d Burris said. \u201cI look forward to seeing what they actually do to try to curb some of these issues.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 A New Zealand parliamentary committee has recommended the unprecedented suspensions of three M\u0101ori lawmakers for performing a protest haka in the debating chamber last year.",
      "The haka is a chanting dance of challenge of great cultural importance in New Zealand, and the three lawmakers from Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori, the M\u0101ori party, performed one to oppose a controversial bill that would have redefined the country\u2019s founding document.",
      "On Wednesday a committee recommended record suspensions and severe censure \u2014 the harshest penalties ever assigned to New Zealand parliamentarians \u2014 after finding the trio in contempt of Parliament.",
      "Government bloc lawmakers, who hold the majority, are expected to endorse the penalties in a vote Tuesday. But Parliament\u2019s Speaker Gerry Brownlee took the unusual step Thursday of saying he would first allow unlimited debate before the vote due to the severity of the proposed punishments.",
      "The recommendations were the latest twist in the fraught saga over the bill, now defeated, that opponents said would have provoked constitutional havoc and reversed decades of progress for M\u0101ori, New Zealand\u2019s Indigenous people.",
      "Video of the legislators in full cry drew global attention last November. The bill they opposed was vanquished at a second vote in April.",
      "However, some lawmakers from the center-right government objected to the M\u0101ori Party legislators\u2019 protest during the first vote and complained to parliament\u2019s speaker. At issue was the way the trio walked across the floor of the debating chamber toward their opponents while they performed the haka.",
      "\u201cIt is not acceptable to physically approach another member on the floor of the debating chamber,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s report said, adding that the behavior could be considered intimidating. The committee denied the legislators were being punished for the haka, which is a beloved and sacred cultural institution in New Zealand life, but \u201cthe time at and manner in which it was performed\u201d during a vote, according to the findings.",
      "The committee deciding the fate of the lawmakers has members from all political parties. The government\u2019s opponents disagreed with parts or all of the decision but were overruled.",
      "\u201cThis was a very serious incident, and the likes of which I have never seen before in my 23 years in the debating chamber,\u201d said the committee\u2019s chair, Judith Collins.",
      "The three legislators did not appear before the committee when summoned in April because they said Parliament does not respect M\u0101ori cultural protocol and they would not get a fair hearing.",
      "\u201cThe process was grossly unjust, unfair, and unwarranted, resulting in an extreme sanction,\u201d M\u0101ori party spokesperson and lawmaker Mariameno Kapa-Kingi said in a statement. \u201cThis was not about process, this became personal.\u201d",
      "The report recommended that Hana-R\u0101whiti Maipi-Clarke, who at 22 is New Zealand\u2019s youngest lawmaker, be suspended from Parliament for seven days. The co-leaders of her political party, Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, face 21-day bans.",
      "Three days is the longest a lawmaker has been barred from the House before. Suspended legislators are not paid during their bans.",
      "Waititi and Ngarewa-Packer, the leaders of the party that advocates M\u0101ori rights and holds six of Parliament\u2019s 123 seats, have lambasted the committee\u2019s process as intolerant of M\u0101ori principles and identity.",
      "The pair received more severe sanctions than Maipi-Clarke because the younger lawmaker had written a letter of \u201ccontrition\u201d to the committee, the report said.",
      "The Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Bill sought to redefine New Zealand\u2019s founding document, the 1840 pact between the British Crown and M\u0101ori leaders signed during New Zealand\u2019s colonization.",
      "The English and M\u0101ori language versions of the treaty differed, and the Crown immediately began to breach both, resulting in mass land thefts and generations of disenfranchisement for M\u0101ori, who remain disadvantaged on almost every metric. But in recent decades, M\u0101ori protest movements have wrought growing recognition of the Treaty\u2019s promises in New Zealand\u2019s law, politics and public life.",
      "That produced billion-dollar land settlements with tribes and strategies to advance Indigenous language and culture. Such policies were the target of the bill, drawn up by a minor libertarian party that denounced what it said was special treatment for M\u0101ori as they tried to rewrite the treaty\u2019s promises."

      "Statues and monuments to the 18th-century naval officer are common in Australia and are often defaced by opponents of Britain\u2019s settlement of the country without a treaty with its Indigenous people. In 1770, then Lt. Cook charted the Australian east coast where Sydney would become the first British colony on the continent.",
      "The granite and bronze monument to the master navigator and cartographer in an inner-city Melbourne park was vandalized days after the anniversary of the first British settlers\u2019 arrival at Sydney Cove was commemorated on Jan. 26.

      "Jolly said the decision to permanently remove the monument, which included an image of Cook\u2019s face cast in bronze, was about economics rather than taking a position in Australia\u2019s culture wars.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a waste of ratepayers\u2019 money. We can\u2019t afford to do that,\u201d Jolly added.",
      "But Victoria state\u2019s Melbourne-based conservative opposition leader, Brad Battin, condemned removing such memorials as surrendering to vandals.",
      "\u201cWe need to stand strong and remember the fact that this is part of our history,\u201d Battin told reporters.",
      "\u201cIf you start to remove the history of our state and our country because of activists, then you\u2019re actually giving in to those that are campaigning against it,\u201d Battin added.",
      "Jolly disagreed that his council had given the vandals what they wanted.",
      "\u201cNo, I think they would\u2019ve loved for us to put it back up and then they could\u2019ve just tagged it again or destroyed it again and just had this ongoing sort of little war going on in Edinburgh Gardens,\u201d Jolly said.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re probably the most disappointed people that it\u2019s not going to be there anymore,\u201d Jolly added.",
      "The base of the monument remained at the entrance to the park on Wednesday with a traffic cone attached to warn cyclists, joggers and pedestrians of the trip hazard it presents. Someone has scrawled a smiling face and a torso on the cone in an apparent reference to the memorial that had once stood in its place.",
      "Jolly said a local branch of the Captain Cook Society, an international group that celebrates the explorer, has offered to preserve the bronze plaques.",
      "Melbourne-based society member Bill Lang said discussions were underway to find a short-term home for the monument, such as a museum.",
      "Lang said the council\u2019s decision not to repair the monument was disheartening.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing for every open-minded Australian that believes that there are lots of things that we can learn about and learn from our history that we should celebrate,\u201d Lang said."

      "Heating, ventilation and air conditioning contractors say they\u2019ve been weathering higher costs since the post-Covid recovery, for everything from labor and raw materials to a newly mandated refrigerant. With supply chains stretching deep into countries facing new tariffs, HVAC firms say it\u2019s impossible to avoid passing at least some of the higher costs on to customers.",

      "Scott Shelton, owner of Charlotte Comfort Systems, Charlotte, N.C.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll affect lower and middle classes more than I\u2019ve seen in my 38 years\u2019 experience in this industry,\u201d he said of ongoing and expected cost increases.",
      "The prices U.S. manufacturers charge for HVAC and refrigeration equipment remain near the record highs they hit last summer, before Trump won re-election, and some contractors expect his levies to drive them higher.",
      "Take a component that cost $1,000 in March, said Aydin Mehr, who manages Denver-based UniColorado Heating and Cooling: \u201cCurrently it\u2019s going to cost $1,100,\u201d he said. \u201cIn September, that same thing will cost $1,300 to 1,400.\u201d",
      "Adding to the expected squeeze are steeper utility bills for many households. U.S. residential electricity costs are forecast to average $784 this summer, up 6.2% since last season and the highest level in 12 years, the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) said Thursday. An early heat wave is already baking the Southwest and Texas this week, with Oklahoma City, San Antonio, Austin, Houston and Dallas breaking May records.",
      "Mehr voiced concerns about this summer. \u201cWe\u2019re stockpiling like crazy to keep our prices low as long as possible,\u201d he said, but his inventory is \u201calready diminishing rapidly.\u201d",
      "Some top air-conditioner makers are responding to the Trump administration\u2019s reshoring push, with Carrier on Tuesday announcing a $1 billion five-year investment to expand domestic production. Analysts say the HVAC sector is relatively well-positioned to handle tariffs, including on steel and aluminum. But the industry still relies heavily on overseas suppliers, and contractors say many American importers are already curbing shipments, unsure which tariffs will stick.",
      "The United States imported more than $15 billion worth of air conditioners last year, about five times as much as it exported, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity. Mexico and China \u2014 which currently face double-digit blanket tariffs \u2014 accounted for the largest shares of U.S. spending on AC imports, at 50% for Mexico and 19% for China. Analysts estimate less than half of Mexican-made HVAC equipment complies with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, the deal Trump brokered in his first term that spares some Mexican and Canadian goods from the 25% tariffs he imposed on them in his second.",
      "Many suppliers, which typically purchase on 90-day schedules, had already halted ordering by the time the U.S. and China agreed Monday to pause most of their tariffs for 90 days, Mehr said.",
      "\u201cIn the best-case scenario, we\u2019re going to have a Covid-style type of thing where they\u2019re going to be waiting months just to get their stuff,\u201d he predicted.",
      "A key factor is the industrywide shortage of R-454B, the more eco-friendly coolant that regulators began requiring in January under a bipartisan measure Trump signed in 2020. Mehr was expecting a major manufacturer to ship new heat pumps that use R-454B in mid-April, \u201cbut it still hasn\u2019t shipped because they didn\u2019t import the parts from China to finish them.\u201d",

      "These fears may not pan out nationwide, or at all, but the coolant crunch is already driving up costs and delaying installations as manufacturers hike prices. Appliance giant Honeywell last month announced a 42% surcharge on R-454B, citing \u201cthe cumulative effect of increased costs and raw materials\u201d amid strong demand.",
      "Some HVAC contractors even accuse manufacturers of using supply-chain disruptions to price-gouge. Makers of cooling systems announced tariff-related price hikes \u201cbefore it even became real,\u201d said Barton James, president and CEO of the Air Conditioning Contractors of America. \u201cThe whole industry continues to test the waters on what\u2019s the breaking point for the consumer. And right now, we\u2019ve not found it.\u201d",
      "The Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute called that allegation \u201coffensive.\u201d The manufacturing trade group\u2019s members have their own concerns about the uncertainty posed by \u201con again/off again tariffs,\u201d spokesperson Francis Dietz said in a statement. \u201cFar from using tariffs as a cover to raise prices, manufacturers are going out of their way to minimize the economic impacts\u201d and keep products affordable.",

      "The National Weather Service forecasts excessive heat to generate hotspots from Maryland to Maine and Oregon to Texas. Parts of Utah, Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico are most likely to see hotter-than-average days over the next three months. With extreme heat exacerbated by climate change becoming more frequent, researchers say U.S. heat-related deaths have more than doubled in recent decades.",
      "This year there could be less federal aid to help households keep their homes at safe temperatures.",
      "Shortly after gutting the entire staff of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, Trump proposed a budget that would slash the initiative\u2019s $4 billion in funding to zero. LIHEAP was established in 1981 to help struggling families cover home heating and, later, cooling costs including AC installations. But it has been strained by what advocates describe as chronic funding shortfalls coupled with surging demand for summertime relief.",
      "NEADA, which represents state officials who disburse LIHEAP aid, estimates that households facing utility arrears now owe a cumulative $21 billion, the most in four years.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The court is considering whether to allow the proposal to go into effect at least in some parts of the country while litigation continues in lower courts.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday weighs whether to allow President Donald Trump's radical reinterpretation of the Constitution's guarantee of birthright citizenship to go into effect, at least in part, while litigation continues.",
      "In an unusual move, the court is hearing oral arguments on a series of Trump administration emergency requests seeking to limit the scope of nationwide injunctions that blocked the plan almost as soon as it was announced in January.",
      "A decision siding with the administration would not only provide a boost to Trump's birthright citizenship proposal but would also help the administration implement other policies via executive actions, many of which have also been blocked nationwide by lower court judges.",
      "The justices have not agreed to take up the bigger legal question of whether Trump's plan comports with the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\"",
      "The longstanding interpretation of the provision as understood by generations of Americans, including legal scholars on the left and right, is that anyone born on U.S. soil is an American citizen with a few minor exceptions, including people who are the children of diplomats.",
      "As part of Trump's hard-line immigration policy, he wants to limit birthright citizenship to people who have at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or is a permanent U.S. resident.",
      "In line with the historical understanding of the 14th Amendment, every court that has ruled on the plan so far has blocked it. Trump filed three separate emergency applications at the Supreme Court seeking to narrow the injunctions issued by judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state.",
      "The Trump administration has complained vociferously about judges who have issued \"universal injunctions\" blocking various policies rolled out during the president's first few months in office. The Justice Department says there have been 39 such rulings on a host of issues, including the administration's ban on transgender people serving on the military, which the Supreme Court recently allowed to go into effect.",
      "Trump has relied in large part on aggressive executive orders to enact his agenda, rather than seeking legislation from Congress or regulatory actions by federal agencies.",
      "The administration's argument is that federal judges simply do not have the authority to issue broad rulings that affect people other than the litigants appearing before them. As a result, when judges rule that a government policy is unlawful, the decision should only apply to the individual plaintiffs or entities that sued, the administration says.",
      "In response, the challengers say that on an issue like birthright citizenship, a nationwide injunction is appropriate in part because it is vital to have uniformity on such a fundamental right.",
      "Even if some nationwide injunctions cannot be justified, the Supreme Court should not use the birthright citizenship case to curb the ability of judges to issue them at all, lawyers for the plaintiffs argue.",
      "The administration has asked the court to limit the injunctions to individual people or organizations that sued, and potentially the 22 states led by New Jersey and Washington that filed separate lawsuits on birthright citizenship.",
      "Depending on what action the court takes, the proposal could go into effect in more than half of all U.S. states but not others, or against anyone who has not themselves sued or is not a member of the immigrant advocacy organizations CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project.",
      "If the court grants the administration's request in some form, people affected by the executive order may have to file their own lawsuits or join a class action lawsuit.",
      "All of this is taking place amid widespread agreement among legal experts that the Supreme Court would ultimately rule against Trump when the case eventually reaches the justices on the merits.",
      "In recent years, five of the six members of the court's conservative majority have raised concerns about individual judges having the power to block a president's actions nationwide, an authority that is traditionally reserved for the Supreme Court.",
      "Such rulings have stymied not just the Trump administration but recent Democratic administrations as well."

    "story": [
      "A day after 59 white South Africans were welcomed to America as refugees, more than 86,000 South African farmers \u2014 who are mostly white \u2014 are gathering this week at the NAMPO Harvest Day trade fair, an annual agricultural exhibition considered the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "Over four days, the attendees will discuss innovations in technology, collaborations and various other elements of an industry that last year generated nearly $14 billion in revenue.",
      "Notably, according to one participant, there is no planned discussion of violence against white farmers or \u201cAfrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored, race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation\u201d without compensation, as President Donald Trump wrote in a Feb. 7 executive order that opened the way for the 59 South Africans to come to U.S., despite a ban on refugees from other nations.",
      "The executive order referenced South Africa\u2019s Expropriation Act enacted last year, which in some cases allows the government to seize unused land without compensation, something Cyril Ramaphosa, the country\u2019s president, said has not happened.",
      "The act awakened a profoundly troubling argument over land rights. South Africa's dark history of racism includes the confiscation of land from Black residents, both before and during the apartheid. Afrikaners, the minority white descendants of Dutch and French settlers who arrived in South Africa in the 1600s, were leaders of the apartheid regime that ended in 1994.",
      "The purported goal of the Expropriation Act is to shrink the vast land ownership disparity that came with the oppressive rule. According to the organization Action for Southern Africa, 72% of farms and agricultural holdings are owned by whites, who make up 7.3% of the population. Black Africans, representing 81.4%, own only 4% of the land.",
      "Trump asserted on Monday, ahead of the refugees\u2019 arrival in the U.S., that \u201cwhite farmers are being brutally killed and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.\u201d",
      "Yet Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, said that the spirit of NAMPO this week reaffirms that \u201cgenocide\u201d of white South African farmers \u201cwas imaginary and not happening in our country.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all disturbed that the U.S. side is alleging that there\u2019s genocide and mistreatment of white farmers in South Africa. It is incorrect,\u201d said Sihlobo, who is also co-author of the book \u201cThe Uncomfortable Truth About South Africa\u2019s Agriculture.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anything, the sector continues to flourish. [Trump's] comments are misinformed and not mirroring the reality on the ground in the country,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "The New York Times reported 225 people were killed on South African farms over a four-year period ending in 2024. Of those deaths, 101 were Black current or former workers living on farms, and 53 were farmers, who are usually white.",
      "Nico Harris, a farmer of Afrikaans heritage, told Daily Maverick South African newspaper that the problems he sees can be overcome and stem from the government not being \u201cpro-farmer.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the refugees that have gone [to the U.S.] are not well-established family farming businesses like we are,\u201d Harris told the paper. \u201cI think they don\u2019t have an opportunity in the country and they might think that, \u2018This is an opportunity for us.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really fleeing because they are scared or worried, I think they see it as an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Harris added, \u201cI think there are racially discriminating laws against white farmers, and I think they have problems and haven\u2019t got sympathy from the government. But there are no real land grabs, and I don\u2019t think there are real threats. There are individual farm attacks, but it\u2019s more related to criminal activity. We just hope our government is going to wake up and realize that they need the farmers, Black and white.\u201d",
      "One of the South Africans who arrived in the U.S. on Monday told The Washington Post that she had been advised not to speak with the media and said it had been a \u201cvery emotional, very rough couple of weeks.\u201d",
      "Theo Boshoff, CEO of AgBiz, which represents companies across the agricultural value chain, including South African and multinational companies, said crime in rural farming areas is high but \u201cnot targeted against any racial or ethnic group.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no genocide in South Africa,\u201d Boshoff added. \u201cPeople who live in rural areas, who are often farmers, are simply more vulnerable to crime and violent crime because they live in remote areas.\u201d",
      "And because they are remote, law enforcement often is not nearby to protect them. \u201cThere is no cultural or racial bias at play. White farmers, Black farmers, white farmworkers, Black farmworkers are\u00a0all equally at risk and united in combatting this challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t agree with insinuations that rural crime is motivated by politics or in any way related to South Africa\u2019s affirmative action efforts to remedy our checkered past.\u201d",
      "Solidarity, a South African trade union that represents 600,000 Afrikaner families, said in a statement in February that it does not agree with the African National Congress, which wants to close the farmland disparity gap. \u201cBut we love our country. As in any community, there are individuals who wish to immigrate, but repatriation of Afrikaners as refugees is not a solution for us,\u201c the group wrote.",
      "President Ramaphosa said on X that the country\u2019s laws \u201cbalance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.\u201d He said that a meeting with President Trump about the country\u2019s land reform policy would result in them sharing \u201ca better and common understanding over these matters.\u201d",

      "Fadial Adams, a member of the National Assembly of South Africa, a political body that passes legislation and analyzes executive action, warned of Musk\u2019s influence on the president. \u201cLet us not forget that Elon Musk is a beneficiary of our suffering and our slavery in South Africa, and it is not something that he hides. He was raised on a system which benefited white South Africans exclusively,\u201d\u00a0Adams said. \u201cElon Musk should stop acting like the minister for foreign affairs for South Africa. He\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration and Musk representative did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Afriforum, a nongovernmental South African agency that supports the interests of white citizens, have called for farm murders to be classified as priority crimes requiring special attention, like gender-based violence or rhino-poaching. It does not support the Expropriation Act.",
      "\u201cMany laws identified by the Afrikaner lobby groups as racist are viewed by the African National Congress as being necessary, intentional measures to redress past wrongs,\u201d said Thula Simpson, an associate professor of history at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. \u201cSo the present developments strike at the heart of the post-apartheid consensus.\u201d",
      "As for the farmers in South Africa as a whole, Sihlobo, the economist from the Agricultural Business Chamber, pointed at how the country's earnings from exporting produce have grown from $2 billion in the year 2000 to nearly $14 billion in 2024.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re self-sufficient,\u201d Sihlobo said. \u201cThat speaks to the progress the sector has been making. You can\u2019t see numbers like that where there\u2019s a genocide.\u201d",
      "Jaco Minnaar, the chairman of AGRI SA, the largest agriculture organization in South Africa, says the larger problem is South Africa\u2019s crime rate.",
      "\u201cWe can see that farm murders in South Africa have a slightly higher rate per capita than murders in general, but it\u2019s farmers and farmworkers, which is not all necessarily white,\u201d Minnaar said.",
      "\u201cOur murder rate is one of the highest per capita in the world, even higher than some of the war-torn countries. That\u2019s something that we need to address,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t specifically see from the statistics that white people or any other demographic group are targeted.

    "story": [
      "A hotline between military and civilian air traffic controllers in Washington, D.C., that hasn\u2019t worked for more than three years may have contributed to another near miss shortly after the U.S. Army resumed flying helicopters in the area for the first time since January\u2019s deadly midair collision between a passenger jet and a Black Hawk helicopter, Sen. Ted Cruz said at a hearing Wednesday.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration official in charge of air traffic controllers, Frank McIntosh, confirmed the agency didn\u2019t even know the hotline hadn\u2019t been working since March 2022 until after the latest near miss. He said civilian controllers still have other means of communicating with their military counterparts through landlines. Still, the FAA insists the hotline be fixed before helicopter flights resume around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.",
      "The Army said in a statement Wednesday that is it \u201cworking with the FAA to resolve the direct communications line between the Pentagon pad tower and the DCA tower and determine what repairs are required to restore services.\u201d DCA is the code for Reagan airport.",
      "It said the Army \u201ccontinues to restrict flights to the Pentagon pad to only mission essential operations until the line is repaired or improved communication procedures are implemented and accepted by the FAA.\u201d",
      "The FAA said in a statement that the dedicated direct access line between air traffic controllers at Reagan and the Pentagon\u2019s Army heliport hasn\u2019t worked since 2022 because of the construction of a new tower at the Pentagon. But the FAA said \u201cthe two facilities continue to communicate via telephone for coordination.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe developments at DCA in its airspace are extremely concerning,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThis committee remains laser-focused on monitoring a safe return to operations at DCA and making sure all users in the airspace are operating responsibly.\u201d",
      "The Army suspended all helicopter flights around Reagan airport after the latest near miss, but McIntosh said the FAA was close to ordering the Army to stop flying because of the safety concerns before it did so voluntarily.",
      "\u201cWe did have discussions if that was an option that we wanted to pursue,\u201d McIntosh told the Senate Commerce Committee at the hearing.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and FAA accident investigator, said \u201cthe fact that they were unaware that this connection was not working for three years is troublesome.\u201d But he is not entirely clear on the purpose of the hotline when controllers had other ways to communicate.",
      "But Guzzetti thinks the Army needs to be more forthcoming about what it is doing to ensure the airspace around Washington remains safe. Since the crash, the Army has at times refused to provide information that Congress has asked for, and officials didn\u2019t answer all the questions at a previous hearing.",
      "\u201cThe DCA airspace is under the white hot spotlight. So the Army\u2019s going to have to be more transparent and more assertive in their dealings with this problem,\u201d Guzzetti said.",
      "According to a U.S. official, one course of action under consideration now is to have the Army give 24 hours notice of any flights around National Airport. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because no decisions have been made and discussions are ongoing.",
      "January\u2019s crash between an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter killed 67 people \u2014 making it the deadliest plane crash on U.S. soil since 2001. The National Transportation Safety Board has said there were an alarming 85 near misses around Reagan in the three years before the crash that should have prompted action.",
      "Since the crash, the FAA has tried to ensure that military helicopters never share the same airspace as planes, but controllers had to order two planes to abort their landings on May 1 because of an Army helicopter circling near the Pentagon.",
      "\u201cAfter the deadly crash near Reagan National Airport, FAA closed the helicopter route involved, but a lack of coordination between FAA and the Department of Defense has continued to put the flying public at risk,\u201d Sen. Tammy Duckworth said.",
      "McIntosh said the helicopter should never have entered the airspace around Reagan airport without permission from an air traffic controller.",
      "\u201cThat did not occur,\u201d he said. \u201cMy question \u2014 and I think the larger question is \u2014 is why did that not occur? Without compliance to our procedures and our policies, this is where safety drift starts to happen.\u201d",
      "The NTSB is investigating what happened.",
      "In addition to that incident, a commercial flight taking off from Reagan airport had to take evasive action after coming within a few hundred feet of four military jets heading to a flyover at Arlington National Cemetery. McIntosh blamed that incident on a miscommunication between FAA air traffic controllers at a regional facility and the tower at Reagan, which he said had been addressed.",

      "But Pugh, who often swims to raise awareness for environmental causes \u2014 and was this year named the United Nations Patron of the Oceans \u2014 said no swim is without risk and that drastic measures are needed to get his message across: Around 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day \u2014 a rate of 100 million every year, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
      "\u201cIt was a film about sharks attacking humans and for 50 years, we have been attacking sharks,\u201d he said of \u201cJaws.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s completely unsustainable. It\u2019s madness. We need to respect them.\u201d",

      "Pugh remembers feeling fear as a 16-year-old watching \u201cJaws\u201d for the first time. Over decades of study and research, awe and respect have replaced his fear, as he realized the role they play in maintaining Earth\u2019s increasingly fragile ecosystems.",

      "Both director Steven Spielberg and author Peter Benchley have expressed regret over the impact of the film on viewers\u2019 perception of sharks.

Scientists didn\u2019t know a lot about sharks.\u201d",
      "Skomal said the biggest threat contributing to the decline of the shark population now is commercial fishing, which exploded in the late 1970s and is today driven by high demand for fins and meat used in food dishes, as well as the use of skin to make leather and oil and cartilage for cosmetics.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve really moved away from this feeling, or the old adage that, \u2018The only good shark is a dead shark,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely morphing from fear to fascination, or perhaps a combination of both.\u201d"

      "\u201cMy reaction was one of amazement and, in a way, awe that I should have managed to find a previously unknown Magna Carta,\u201d said David Carpenter, a professor of medieval history at King\u2019s College London. He was searching the Harvard Law School Library website in December 2023 when he found the digitized document.",
      "\u201cFirst, I\u2019d found one of the most rare documents and most significant documents in world constitutional history,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cBut secondly, of course, it was astonishment that Harvard had been sitting on it for all these years without realizing what it was.\u201d",

The technology helps scholars see details on faded documents that are not visible to the human eye.",
      "That allowed them to compare the texts word-for-word, as well as the handwriting, which include a large capital \u2018E\u2019 at the start in \u2018Edwardus\u2019 and elongated letters in the first line.",
      "After the 1215 original printed by King John, five other editions were written in the following decades \u2014 until 1300, the last time the full document was set out and authorized by the king\u2019s seal.",
      "The 1300 version of Magna Carta is \u201cdifferent from the previous versions in a whole series of small ways and the changes are found in every single one,\u201d Carpenter said.",
      "Harvard had to meet a high bar to prove authenticity, Carpenter said, and it did so \u201cwith flying colors.\u201d",
      "Its tattered and faded copy of the Magna Carta is worth millions of dollars, Carpenter estimated \u2014 though Harvard has no plans to sell it. A 1297 version of the Magna Carta sold at auction in 2007 for $21.3 million.",
      "A document with a colorful history",
      "The other mystery behind the document was the journey it took to Harvard.",
      "That task was left to Vincent, who was able to trace it all the way back to the former parliamentary borough of Appleby in Westmorland, England.",
      "The Harvard Law School library purchased its copy in 1946 from a London book dealer for $27.50. At the time, it was wrongly dated as being made in 1327.",
      "Vincent determined the document was sent to a British auction house in 1945 by a World War I flying ace who also played a role defending Malta in World War II. The war hero, Forster Maynard, inherited the archives from Thomas and John Clarkson, who were leading campaigners against the slave trade. One of them, Thomas Clarkson, became friends with William Lowther, hereditary lord of the manor of Appleby, and he possibly gave it to Clarkson.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a chain of connection there, as it were, a smoking gun, but there isn\u2019t any clear proof as yet that this is the Appleby Magna Carta. But it seems to me very likely that it is,\u201d Vincent said. He said he would like to find a letter or other documentation showing the Magna Carta was given to Thomas Clarkson.",
      "Making Magna Carta relevant for a new generation",
      "Vincent and Carpenter plan to visit Harvard in June to see its Magna Carta firsthand \u2014 and they say the document is as relevant as ever at a time when Harvard is clashing with the Trump administration over how much authority the federal government should have over its leadership, admissions and activism on campus.",
      "\u201cIt turns up at Harvard at precisely the moment where Harvard is under attack as a private institution by a state authority that seems to want to tell Harvard what to do,\u201d Vincent said.",
      "It also is a chance for a new generation to learn about the Magna Carta, which played a part in the founding of the United States \u2014 from the Declaration of Independence to the adoption of the Bill of Rights. Seventeen states have incorporated aspects of it into their laws.",
      "\u201cWe think of law libraries as places where people can come and understand the underpinnings of democracy,\u201d said Amanda Watson, the assistant dean for library and information services at Harvard Law School. \u201cTo think that Magna Carta could inspire new generations of people to think about individual liberty and what that means and what self-governance means is very exciting.\u201d"

      "Based on his growth rate and tooth loss, Morris the alligator was at least 80 years old when he died, the Colorado Gator Farm said in a Facebook post Sunday. He was nearly 11 feet (3.3 meters) long and weighed 640 pounds (290 kilograms).",
      "\u201cHe started acting strange about a week ago. He wasn\u2019t lunging at us and wasn\u2019t taking food,\u201d Jay Young, the farm\u2019s owner and operator, said in a\u00a0video\u00a0as he tearfully stroked Morris\u2019 head in an animal enclosure.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s strange to people that we get so attached to an alligator, to all of our animals. ... He had a happy time here, and he died of old age,\u201d he said.",
      "Morris, who was found in the backyard of a Los Angeles home as an illegal pet, started his Hollywood career in 1975 and retired in 2006, when he was sent to the Colorado Gator Farm in the tiny town of Mosca. He appeared in several films, including \u201cInterview with the Vampire,\u201d \u201cDr. Dolittle 2\u201d and \u201cBlues Brothers 2000.\u201d He also appeared on \u201cCoach,\u201d \u201cNight Court\u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno\u201d featuring the late wildlife expert Steve Irwin.",

      "The Colorado Gator Farm, which opened to the public in 1990, said it plans to preserve Morris\u2019 body.",
      "\u201cWe have decided to get Morris taxidermied so that he can continue to scare children for years to come. It\u2019s what he would have wanted,\u201d the farm posted on Facebook on Monday."

    "story": [
      "FBI field offices around the country have been ordered to assign significantly more agents to immigration enforcement, a dramatic shift in federal law enforcement priorities that will likely siphon resources away from counterterrorism, counterintelligence and fraud investigations, multiple current and former\u00a0bureau\u00a0officials told NBC News.",
      "The orders, given in a series\u00a0of\u00a0memos\u00a0and\u00a0meetings\u00a0in FBI offices\u00a0this week, come at a time when the Trump Administration is proposing to cut 5% of the FBI\u2019s budget, and as the Justice Department is deprioritizing\u00a0investigating\u00a0certain types of white collar and corporate crime, according to a memo obtained by NBC News.",
      "The new push is happening as FBI director\u00a0Kash Patel also\u00a0approved 667 requests for FBI personnel to take early retirement\u00a0this week, two people familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "\u201cAs you know, we have been actively engaged in immigration enforcement efforts in coordination with our DOJ and DHS partners,\u201d said a memo obtained by NBC News from a senior FBI official to managers. \u201cStarting this week, we will need to see an increase in operational tempo in your immigration efforts. DOJ expects a significant increase in the number of agents participating in immigration enforcement operations.\u201d",
      "One federal law enforcement official estimated that\u00a0the vast majority of agents were uncomfortable with being a part of the immigration operations, saying ICE\u00a0didn\u2019t meticulously plan out arrest operations the way that the bureau does.",
      "\u201cThis is not what we do, these are bad ideas,\u201d said the federal law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fear of retaliation. \u201cIf this was a Democrat administration, I\u2019d be saying this is bad, we shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201d",
      "FBI spokesman Ben Williamson defended the move. \u201cThe FBI has been committed to supporting our partners in immigration enforcement and will remain so.\u201d",
      "The\u00a0stepped-up immigration enforcement initiative\u00a0was\u00a0first reported by Reuters.",
      "Nationwide shift",
      "The shift in resources spans the country, according to two FBI officials.\u00a0In a major\u00a0change, 45% of all agents in the 25 largest FBI field offices will be working on immigration full time.",
      "The bureau\u2019s\u00a0Atlanta\u00a0field office\u00a0will assign 67 agents to work immigration \u201cenforcement and removal operations\u201d full time, seven days a week,\u00a0the officials said. That is around half of all the agents assigned to the Atlanta Field Office headquarters",
      "In Los Angeles,\u00a0the field office\u00a0is creating 9 squads to address enforcement and removal operations full-time.\u00a0They will pursue non-citizens\u00a0who have overstayed their visas,\u00a0even if they have\u00a0no criminal history.",
      "And the FBI\u2019s Boston field office\u00a0was ordered to assign an additional 33 special agents to immigration enforcement",
      "The FBI and Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The orders\u00a0intensify\u00a0what had already been an unprecedented push by the Trump Justice Department to get the FBI involved in immigration enforcement, a task\u00a0traditionally\u00a0handled by the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "One of the memos says the goal is to have 2000 FBI agents across the country working full time on immigration enforcement at any one time.",
      "Given that FBI resources are finite, current and former officials say a significant increase in immigration enforcement will draw agents away from what have long been top FBI priorities, including counterterrorism, counterespionage, fraud, and violent crime.",
      "Trump and his top aides have been frustrated\u00a0by\u00a0the slow pace of deportations.\u00a0Documents\u00a0released in the Biden administration showed that hundreds of thousands or illegal immigrants with criminal records were living in the U.S. including more than 10,000 with homicide convictions.\u00a0Many of those people are still here, according to NBC News reporting.",
      "White collar crime",
      "The moves also come as the head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division issued a memo this week ordering a new \u201cappropriate balance\u201d in enforcement of corporate crime.",
      "\u201cOverbroad and unchecked corporate and white-collar enforcement burdens U.S. businesses and harms U.S. interest,\u201d wrote Matthew Galeotti, the head of the criminal division, adding later, \u201cNot all corporate misconduct warrants federal criminal prosecution.\u201d",
      "The memo orders prosecutors to prioritize schemes to defraud Americans, tariff evaders, sanctions violators, Chinese money launderers and foreign terrorist financiers.",
      "But it seeks to tap the brakes on what had been a major initiative in the Biden Justice Department to target corporate crime and to\u00a0begin\u00a0monitoring of companies found to have broken the law.",
      "Galiotti ordered prosecutors \u201cto review the length of terms of all existing agreements with companies to determine if they should be terminated early.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe work of Criminal Division attorneys to investigate and prosecute white-collar crime is essential to the Department\u2019s efforts to advance American interests, protect victims, and strengthen our national security,\u201d the memo says.",
      "\u201cBut federal investigations into corporate wrongdoing can be costly and intrusive for businesses, investors, and other stakeholders, many of whom have no knowledge of, or involvement in, the misconduct at issue,\u201d Galiotti wrote. \u201cFederal investigations can also significantly interfere with day-to-day business operations and cause reputational harm that may at times be unwarranted.\u201d"

      "Justin Baldoni\u2019s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, is alleging that Blake Lively \u201cdemanded\u201d Taylor Swift release a statement supporting her in the latest development involving\u00a0the legal battle between the two \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d stars.",
      "Following Swift\u2019s spokesperson\u00a0addressing the pop star reportedly being subpoenaed\u00a0in Lively and Baldoni\u2019s legal back-and-forth, Freedman filed\u00a0a letter\u00a0with\u00a0Judge Lewis J. Liman \u2014 who is presiding over the trial set for\u00a0March 9, 2026 in New York.",
      "In the May 14 letter, Freedman wrote that the purpose of the subpoena is to access discovery regarding \u201cwitness tampering and evidence spoliation.\u201d",
      "He said that the counsel for Wayfarer Parties, which includes Baldoni, received \u201cinformation from a source who is highly likely to have reliable information\u201d alleging that Lively asked Swift to delete their text messages. Freedman then claimed that Michael Gottlieb, Lively\u2019s lawyer, contacted Swift\u2019s attorney and \u201cdemanded that Ms. Swift release a statement of support for Ms. Lively, intimating that, if Ms. Swift refused to do so, private text messages of a personal nature in Ms. Lively\u2019s possession would be released.\u201d",
      "Freedman further described the alleged demands as \u201cinappropriate and apparently extortionate threats\u201d and said a representative for Swift responded to them in \u201cat least one written communication\u201d sent to Gottlieb.",
      "\u201cIt is those communications that the Wayfarer Parties seek to obtain by way of subpoena, as they would evidence an attempt to intimidate and coerce a percipient witness in this litigation,\u201d Baldoni\u2019s lawyer continued.",

      "\u201cIt should be unnecessary to respond to anonymously sourced, baseless, allegations recklessly leveled without any supporting evidence. It is worth stating for the record, however, that each of the allegations in the Freedman Letter is unequivocally and demonstrably false. As a legal matter, the Freedman Letter is improper. It does not seek any form of relief, is irrelevant to any motion currently pending before the Court, and serves no legitimate purpose. It is not useful to the Court in any respect,\u201d Lively lawyers wrote.",
      "They also said that Freedman\u2019s letter appeared intended to \u201claunder scandalous and defamatory allegations about Ms. Lively and opposing counsel into the press.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Swift\u2019s rep for a comment.",
      "Swift\u2019s spokesperson previously issued a statement regarding the subpoena, asserting that the musician has no connection to the movie adaptation besides her song \u201cMy Tears Ricochet\u201d being featured on the soundtrack. Her rep said that the witness summons was a way to generate \u201ctabloid clickbait.\u201d",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even see \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 until weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024 headlining the biggest tour in history,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Her rep continued, \u201cThe connection Taylor had to this film was permitting the use of one song, \u2018My Tears Ricochet.\u2019 Given that her involvement was licensing a song for the film, which 19 other artists also did, this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift\u2019s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.\u201d",
      "Lively and Baldoni\u2019s legal case began on Dec. 20 when Lively filed an 80-page sexual harassment complaint alleging that Baldoni created a hostile workplace environment on the set of \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d and that he later launched a smear campaign to \u201cdestroy\u201d her reputation. She also alleged that he crossed the line while they filmed intimate scenes and that he harassed her on set.",
      "Freedman reacted to the accusations in a statement to TODAY.com at the time, calling them \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively then filed a federal lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company, Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, crisis communications representative Melissa Nathan and publicist Jennifer Abel on Dec. 31. Her attorney alleged there was a \u201cretaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns.\u201d",
      "Following an article about Lively\u2019s accusations, Baldoni sued The New York Times for libel. He also filed a lawsuit against Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, Lively\u2019s rep Leslie Sloane and Sloane\u2019s PR firm on Jan. 16, accusing them of defamation and disregarding contractual claims.",
      "Swift became linked to the case when Baldoni filed his suit, which included alleged text messages exchanged between him and Lively. In the documents, a \u201cTaylor\u201d is referenced and described as a \u201cmegacelebrity friend.\u201d",
      "Baldoni\u2019s team confirmed to NBC News at the time that the \u201cTaylor\u201d in the suit was the pop singer, who has been friends with Lively for years.",

For better or worse, but usually better. Because my dragons also protect those I fight for. So really we all benefit from those gorgeous monsters of mine. You will too, I can promise you.\u201d"

      "\u201cGuess who I found?\u201d Kathie Lee asked in the clip.",

    "story": [
      "Though it's hard to believe, it's been 40 years since Georgetown alums Jules, Billy, Kirby, Kevin, Alec, Leslie and Wendy last met for a drink at St. Elmo's Bar. But for fans of the movie \"St. Elmo's Fire,\" they're long overdue.",
      "Fortunately, according to Rob Lowe, they may not have to wait much longer.",
      "\"There's a script due any minute,\" Lowe tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview. \"And hopefully it will be good, and we'll go off and make it.\"",
      "Released in 1985, the Joel Schumacher movie chronicles the lives of seven college friends struggling to become adults post-graduation and navigate their various relationship troubles.",
      "Starring Lowe as erstwhile rocker and womanizer Billy Hicks, the movie also features actors Demi Moore, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson and Mare Winningham.",
      "Famously dubbed the \"Brat Pack\" by a reporter in 1985, some of the young actors starred in a variety of coming-of-age '80s movies including \"The Breakfast Club,\" \"Sixteen Candles\" and \"Pretty in Pink,\" among others, and were as much known for their off-screen drama as they were for their movies.",
      "Since that time, they've gone their separate ways, but according to Lowe, the group may soon be back together to make a sequel.",
      "\"It's contingent on the script, obviously, but we've been developing it for quite a while and everybody's super excited to do it. It would be great. I have my fingers crossed,\" Lowe says.",
      "And of the original seven cast members, who would return?",
      "\"Everybody wants to do it,\" he says.",

      "His latest project is \"Literally,\" a podcast in which the actor interviews notable celebrities like Maria Shriver, Chelsea Handler, Kelsey Grammer, Kevin Bacon, along with musicians, songwriters, comedians and a variety of other interesting guests.",

      "\"There's no rhyme or reason to the conversation, other than it's a conversation. It feels like you're eavesdropping on two people having a drink or lunch together,\" Lowe adds.",

      "\"She was my greatest supporter and fan and she passed away from breast cancer,\" he said on TODAY May 12. \"I try and work in and around the cancer advocacy area because of her.\"",

      "Lowe says participating in a clinical trial helped prolong his grandmother's life.",

      "And, unlike his younger days, mortality is something that comes up more often than it used to.",
      "\"I just know that whenever I'm with interesting and interested people for a lunch or dinner, I would say 70% of the conversation is about health and wellbeing,\" he says. \"And that same demographic at 25 is not talking about that.\""

    "summary": "Here's how Judy Blume's Forever compares to the new show and what the show changes.",
    "story": [
      "When Judy Blume\u2019s \"Forever\" first hit shelves in 1975, it sparked controversy \u2014 and connection. The novel\u2019s candid exploration of teenage love and sex was revolutionary, giving young readers permission to feel deeply, make mistakes and move on.",
      "Nearly five decades later, Netflix\u2019s adaptation of \u201cForever,\u201d developed by Mara Brock Akil, brings Blume\u2019s themes into a modern context, reminding a new generation that love, especially first love, doesn\u2019t always last, but it always leaves a mark.",
      "\u201cI think Judy was ahead of her time,\u201d actor Michael Cooper, who plays Justin, says. \u201cEspecially with \u2018Forever\u2019 as a book \u2014 it\u2019s brilliant. And then Mara\u2019s adaptation is just so current. It\u2019s such a beautiful interpretation.\u201d",
      "The eight-episode series centers on Keisha and Justin, two high school seniors whose whirlwind romance mirrors the intensity of Blume\u2019s original couple, Katherine and Michael.",
      "But instead of prom and campfires, Keisha and Justin face contemporary challenges \u2014digital privacy, racial identity and the pressure of making decisions that could impact their adult lives.",
      "There are other changes between the book and show, like the setting \u2014 the show takes place in California rather than the book's New Jersey setting.",
      "Actress Lovie Simone, who portrays Keisha, read the novel while auditioning. \u201cI needed to be Keisha after reading it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a well-written book.",
      "The couple\u2019s connection is immediate, unfolding at a chaotic party where both characters seek familiarity. \u201cThere was a lot going on,\u201d Simone recalled. \u201cBoth of them are shy at first, so I think they were just looking for someone. They didn\u2019t expect to find each other\u2014but it was a pleasant surprise.\u201d",
      "That sense of surprise quickly deepens into commitment. Throughout the series, Keisha and Justin repeatedly promise each other: \u201cIt\u2019s forever.\u201d It\u2019s a phrase they cling to as their lives begin to change.",
      "\u201cIn high school, everything feels so big,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cI remember thinking one little thing could make the world crumble. That\u2019s how their relationship feels \u2014 high-stakes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, and you don\u2019t have many years to look back on, everything feels more intense. It feels like the end of the world,\u201d Simone says.",
      "But as in Blume\u2019s novel, that promise is tested.",
      "In \u201cForever\u2019s\u201d final chapters, Katherine realizes she\u2019s grown apart from Michael after her grandfather dies. It\u2019s a quiet heartbreak \u2014 no scandal, no villain, Just two people choosing to be honest.",
      "The Netflix version similarly grounds Keisha\u2019s evolution in loss. When an old sex tape filmed without her full consent resurfaces, it fractures her sense of safety and identity. Justin is a student with ADHD who is passionate about music but struggles in school and with direction in life.",
      "Simone says Keisha\u2019s ability to love Justin was shaped by her need for self-love. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t able to love him fully until she checked in with herself,\u201d she says. \u201cShe wanted to love him so badly that she had to do something for herself first.\u201d",
      "For Justin, the journey is equally internal.",
      "\u201cThere was this line Mara wrote: \u2018He had one foot in confidence and the other in insecurity,\u2019\u201d Cooper says. \u201cKeisha gave him the space to be his authentic self. He could be vulnerable with her. And although sometimes I\u2019d be like, \u2018Bro, what are you saying?\u2019 He just let it out. She allowed him that space.\u201d",
      "In the show\u2019s final episodes, Keisha earns a scholarship to Howard University. Justin, meanwhile, is torn between following his parents\u2019 preferred path \u2014 attending Northwestern \u2014 or taking a gap year to pursue music. When Keisha encourages him to choose himself, it\u2019s no longer a breakup rooted in pain, but a conscious step toward individual growth.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to fight for us,\u201d she tells him, \u201cthen fight for Justin.\u201d",
      "That sentiment echoes Blume\u2019s original message. Her characters don\u2019t reunite in the end. There\u2019s no grand romantic gesture \u2014 just a phone call from a friend, a reminder that life goes on.",
      "Blume didn\u2019t write \u201cForever \u201cto make readers feel better about breakups. She wrote it to validate their feelings \u2014 that first love is real, even if it isn\u2019t permanent. Akil\u2019s adaptation honors that truth while layering in modern realities like race, class, and digital trauma.",
      "\u201cWhat I hope audiences take away,\u201d said Cooper, \u201cis that love can teach you who you are \u2014 but it can\u2019t always carry you into who you\u2019re becoming.\u201d",
      "In the end, the title \u201cForever\u201d isn\u2019t a promise. It\u2019s a question. And the answer, as both Blume and Netflix remind us, is that growing up is the point.",

      "Going into the \"9-1-1\" Season Eight finale, the 118 is more fractured than ever in the wake of the death of Capt. Bobby Nash.",
      "After Bobby (played by Peter Krause) died alone locked in a lab in a shocking ending to Episode 15, his team of firefighters found out about the tragedy separately.",
      "Ravi Panikkar (Anirudh Pisharody) broke the news to Henrietta \"Hen\" Wilson's wife, while Hen (Aisha Hinds) sobbed alone after being quarantined. Evan \"Buck\" Buckley (Oliver Stark) collapsed onto the ground and screamed, as Howard \"Chimney\" Han (Kenneth Choi) called his wife in tears. Finally, as revealed in the most recent episode, \"Don't Drink the Water,\" Eddie Diaz (Ryan Guzman), who is living in El Paso, received a call in the middle of the night and had to stifle his sobs as to not wake up son Christopher (Gavin McHugh).",
      "The last two episodes before the May 15 finale followed the characters through the funeral and their return to work. Each person has seemingly spiraled in a different way.",
      "Chimney was the recipient of Bobby's ultimate sacrifice. In the lab, they both were infected with a dangerous virus, but Bobby hid his symptoms. The only antidote was used to save Chimney's life, and Bobby succumbed to the virus.",
      "Chimney then struggled with how to accept Bobby\u2019s actions. Eddie \u2014 who returned from El Paso for the funeral \u2014\u00a0questioned if things could have been different if he had been with his team. And Buck tried to provide support to everyone to honor Bobby's last words to him: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be OK, Buck. Remember that. They\u2019re going to need you. I love you, kid.\u201d",
      "Oliver Stark tells TODAY.com that Buck is interpreting Bobby's last words as a task he's been charged with. But as the penultimate episode revealed, Buck has felt the team slipping away.",
      "\"I think probably because of what Bobby left him with, he\u2019s trying to take more control than is necessary, which is not working for him,\" Stark says.",
      "The disconnect between characters came to a head in Episode 17. Buck and Eddie, staying under the same roof for Bobby's funeral, have a fight that started over who was supposed to get the groceries and ended with Eddie accusing Buck of making his new job opportunity with an El Paso fire department all about himself.",
      "\"You'd make it all about you. The trials and tribulations of Evan Buckley, a tragedy in 97 acts,\" Eddie said. \"You've been spiraling since the funeral. And no one knows how to talk to you about it.\"",
      "\"Sorry, I'm sad that Bobby's dead,\" Buck responded.",
      "\"You\u2019re not the only one who lost him,\" Eddie said. \"We all lost him.\"",
      "Below, Stark unpacks what he believes Bobby's final words to Buck mean and what's at the heart of the most recent fight between Buck and Eddie.",
      "He\u2019s tried to be \u2014 the way I\u2019ve always interpreted it is, he\u2019s tried to step into the Bobby role. Not by any means captain, but in the sense of, they\u2019re going to need somebody to say, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get through this.\u201d And a scene that sticks out in my mind is from the previous episode (Episode 16, \u201cThe Last Alarm\u201d), when Chimney is on the rooftop. I was very much like, I didn\u2019t want to come be emotional with Chimney. It was \u2014 we almost have work to do by going to the service and the funeral, and it\u2019s like, \u201cCome on. Pull yourself together.\u201d And this is out of duty more than anything.",
      "I think Buck has been trying to hold himself together because he feels like he\u2019s been charged with this task by Bobby. And that\u2019s why it was really nice to me this past episode, the confessional scene, to let that facade go.",
      "I think it\u2019s the idea that everybody\u2019s experience is their own. We\u2019re all looking at things from our own point of view. So Buck doesn\u2019t necessarily know that Eddie has gone to Hen\u2019s house to have these conversations. All Buck knows is something feels different. He says we\u2019re not eating together, which is obviously something that Bobby instituted into the 118. So it doesn\u2019t have to be true for everybody. It just has to be true for Buck, that\u2019s the way he is seeing things.",
      "And I think probably because of what Bobby left him with, he\u2019s trying to take more control than is necessary, which is not working for him. And because of that, the juxtaposition between what he thinks it should be and what it actually is is so far apart that it must make things feel worse.",
      "Just, everybody\u2019s hurt. And everybody deals with grief differently. And I don\u2019t know if Buck necessarily lashed out in the scene, as much as was a bit already defeated, maybe. He\u2019s not getting back in Eddie's face until the very end. He\u2019s not actually being loud or complaining about Eddie going.",
      "To me, it just kind of feels like a piece is missing from Buck, and it\u2019s left him a bit empty. And I think Eddie, obviously, having not been there for the death, has all this emotion and needs somewhere to put it.",
      "Actually, no, I don\u2019t think it was fair in that particular instance. But I think it\u2019s fair in a sense that \u2014\u00a0so when we were shooting the scene, I was actually given the note of, \u201cI don\u2019t think you are making it about you. I think you need to be a bit more bratty or whatever.\u201d",
      "And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u201d I think for Eddie to say that, it\u2019s actually just a culmination of past things that Buck has done that in the past. And so even though Buck is not actively making it about himself in this moment, it\u2019s almost PTSD of Buck having done that so many times, so that\u2019s what conjures up for Eddie. So it\u2019s fair in the sense of, as I say, it\u2019s just what he\u2019s used to experiencing from Buck.",
      "But I think because everybody\u2019s just going through such a tough time, like emotions are just all over the place, and something that doesn\u2019t go the way you expected it to can trigger something completely different. And it\u2019s just all up in the air, and everything is clashing and butting heads.",
      "I\u2019ll argue with Ryan all day, that's no problem. (Laughs). No, I mean, the whole cast, we have such a truly great relationship. Everybody is really close, and there\u2019s so much trust that it\u2019s easy to go to places with each other, because you feel safe as a performer and as a friend.",
      "Some people love to go to work, and everybody\u2019s process is different. Some people want to feel that in real life, right? Like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not going to talk to you between takes. We\u2019re going to let this really build.\u201d But I think what has been the theme for our cast is, no, let\u2019s have as much fun as we can, so that then when we go into these darker scenes, we can really go at each other, and we still know that afterwards, we\u2019re friends. And it\u2019s a safe environment.",
      "I think in the early seasons, it was clear that Buck was always trying to, whether it be prove himself, or there was just an uncertainty in everything he did, an insecurity \u2014 and sometimes you combat insecurity by going too far in the opposite direction. And I think Buck had a case of that, and so when the question of the bisexuality was brought to me, it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, that could be the thing.\u201d And I think post that, there\u2019s been a more \u2014\u00a0for the most part, obviously, it\u2019s not black and white \u2014\u00a0but there\u2019s been a more settled and grounded Buck. And then something can come in like Eddie leaving, and that can unsettle him again. But he\u2019s from a more grounded place.",

      "The back half of \"9-1-1\" Season Eight has been Evan \"Buck\" Buckley's nightmare come to life.",
      "The Los Angeles firefighter started out fresh off a breakup. Meanwhile, his best friend, Eddie Diaz (Ryan Guzman), moved from California to Texas. His sister, Maddie Han (Jennifer Love Hewitt), is then kidnapped (again), and his beloved captain and father figure, Bobby Nash (Peter Krause), is killed by a gruesome virus after being trapped in a lab.",
      "Fans of the long-running procedural may remember that after Buck, played by Oliver Stark, was struck by lightning in Season Six, an entire episode was dedicated to his coma dream. The episode, titled \"In Another Life,\" questioned what would happen if Buck never became a firefighter. The result? Eddie lost custody of son Christopher (Gavin McHugh), Maddie remained married to the abusive husband responsible for her first kidnapping and Bobby was long dead.",
      "Asked if Season Eight is essentially Buck's nightmare, Stark answers literally.",
      "\"I would say it's a strong coincidence. I don't think that's an intentional choice, but it's funny how things work out sometimes,\" he tells TODAY.com. \"If it is, I have yet to find that out.\"",
      "Bobby's death sent shock waves through the \"9-1-1\" fan base. In a major change from the show's typical formula, the 118 didn't all make it out alive from an emergency.",
      "Over the course of Episodes 14 and 15, the 118 responded to a fire at a lab that studied viruses. An explosion rocked the facility with the team inside, triggering an emergency quarantine door, locking Bobby, Henrietta \"Hen\" Wilson (Aisha Hinds), Howard \"Chimney\"\u00a0Han (Kenneth Choi) and Ravi Panikkar (Anirudh Pisharody) inside \u2014 and Buck out.",
      "Buck teamed up with Los Angeles Police Department Sgt. Athena Grant (Angela Bassett) \u2014\u00a0also Bobby's wife \u2014 to try and free them as an aerosolized version of a modified, dangerous virus infected Chimney and Bobby.",
      "Buck and Athena tracked down the one antidote for the virus and administered it to Chimney as he actively experienced organ failure. After the rest of the 118 finally left the lab, Bobby locked himself in again and removed his mask, revealing the virus had already set in.",
      "Below, Stark unpacks the impact of Bobby's death, how his character is handling his grief after the funeral and where \"9-1-1\" goes from here.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "Well, it sounds like I was making a good guess. I think the thread of a family falling apart. You know, you take out one key element, and you just watch as the whole thing starts to kind of disintegrate, I suppose. And that\u2019s obviously what we saw with Bobby\u2019s passing, and how the 118 lost its patriarchal figure, and the struggles and the fallout of that and the crumbling world without its foundation and structure.",
      "So the first time I watched it \u2014 on occasion, I'll watch an episode before it airs, but it tends to be before the (visual effects) and before the final sound mix. So this was an earlier version, and I didn\u2019t think it would make me emotional, because I knew it was coming. I\u2019m inside the machine as it were, and the first time \u2014 when it gets to the part, and he says, \"Love you, kid.\" I didn\u2019t just like cry, it burst out of me, and I was so surprised by that.",
      "But I think it\u2019s obviously a personal connection to him, as well, and that particular line has big meaning for us. And yeah, I really, like sobbed when it happened. But that was pre-VFX, so he didn\u2019t look as sickly. A lot of the blood is added in post(production).",
      "And so then when I did watch it live on television, I said, \"Oh yeah, he really looks like he\u2019s about to die.\" And it just took it to a whole nother level. So very emotional, very moving.",
      "Often the moments of advice that he gives me are not when I\u2019ve asked for something specific. It\u2019s just in watching how he behaves, watching how he conducts himself, how he treats people, how he approaches the job.",
      "One of the things he did say to me that always sticks out in my mind is way back, Season One. The beginning of the show really gives Buck a lot to do. And then I remember we came across the first episode where I didn\u2019t have so much to do, and I went to him, and I said, \"Do you think I messed up? Like they were giving me all this story. Now there\u2019s this episode, and I don\u2019t really say much in it.\" And I was 26 at the time, and he said to me, \"I get it. You\u2019re 26. You always want to be thrown the ball.\" He said, \"I\u2019m 52. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to sit on the bench.\" And I always remember that.",
      "I would never be so bold as to assume myself unkillable. The most honest answer to that is, I probably would have assumed everybody else was unkillable, but in my own head, I\u2019d be like, \"But me, they could take me out at any moment.\"",
      "But that has been, obviously, the culture of the show, is to say we can put them into these situations, and we\u2019re going to make you think, and then at the last second, no, they\u2019re going to make it. And (showrunner) Tim (Minear) decided it was time to take a big swing and a big creative choice. And I say to him, credit to him. I think it\u2019s important to not just exist in the gray. And he wanted to move in a really strong direction. And I understand the idea that at some point you\u2019ve got to do that because of fear of the audience going, \"Well, I don\u2019t care about this emergency, because I know that they can make it out.\" And now that counter has almost reset to zero, and you have to build that back up again.",
      "I don\u2019t think it changes the tone of the show in the sense that the show is one that is always switching between genres. We have super light episodes, and then we\u2019ll have a really dark arc. I think that\u2019s been one of the strengths of the show, is that it really does offer tonal changes, sometimes not even episode to episode, but scene to scene.",
      "So obviously, post death, the tone has been darker. But it\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t gone into a darker tone for three, four, five episodes at a time before. It doesn\u2019t mean that that is now the tone of the show. I absolutely look forward to the lighter episodes as well, once we are through that first stage of grieving.",
      "The tone on set is, you know, he\u2019s obviously missed. He\u2019s loved by all of us. But you have to remember, we have to remember, Peter is fine. Peter is not dead. Peter is not Bobby. And as with anything, nothing is set in stone any one way, like you can be sad in one moment, and you can be laughing in the next. That\u2019s the human experience, and that\u2019s how you deal with heavy things, as you often do make light of them.",
      "There are absolutely moments, many moments where he\u2019s missed. But we also find the lighter moments day to day as well. And we still have to have a good time. And we can\u2019t be in mourning forever. We have to, and want to, have a great time doing the job that we love.",
      "I said to Tim that one thing I was excited about moving forward from this is I wanted to use it as a chance to help mature Buck. We've seen a lot of growth in Buck over the years \u2014 subtle in some senses.",
      "But if I was to watch the pilot today, and then if I was to watch the most recent episode, I'd go, \"Oh, that\u2019s a lot of growth.\" But I think there was something still lacking in terms of taking him to the next level. And I was excited that maybe this could be the thing that helps Buck mature or grow into a different place at a different stage. So I think that\u2019s, from my point of view, anyway, what the fallout or the repercussions for Buck will be.",
      "I think Athena said this in the show once, \"You were being Buck,\" or something. He will go through whatever he has to to help the people that he loves, as we\u2019ve seen. Even through the lab episodes, trying to get the cure when it was Chimney on the line.",
      "I think having that moment of Bobby shutting that door, and there is nothing Buck could do. There are variations when we shot it of trying to get into the room, to no success, and what could you do, but it\u2019s more just me shouldering the door and trying to smash my way through it. But it\u2019s just hopeless.",
      "There\u2019s a sense of being defeated. And I think he learns from that that you change the things that you can and you have to accept the things that you can\u2019t. And that\u2019s what Buck has had to do. If the change is there to be made, we\u2019ll see him go to the ends of the earth for it. And now he\u2019s learning that he has to accept the things when there is nothing to be done.",
      "The finale of \"9-1-1\" Season Eight will air on ABC May 15 at 8 p.m. ET and stream the next day on Hulu."

    "summary": "Conan O'Brien tells the TODAY show he has never watched a clip of his final words on his last episode as host of \"The Tonight Show.\"",
    "story": [
      "Few people have cast as large a shadow over the history of late-night television as Conan O\u2019Brien. First bursting into the public eye as David Letterman\u2019s successor on \u201cLate Night\u201d in 1993, O\u2019Brien hit pay dirt when he was tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d in 2009. O\u2019Brien\u2019s stint, though, was short-lived, marred by low ratings and NBC\u2019s ultimate decision to bring back Leno as host.",
      "O\u2019Brien\u2019s final episode as \u201cTonight Show\u201d host took place Jan. 22, 2010. He remained gracious and eloquent while signing off.",
      "\u201cPlease do not be cynical,\u201d he told his studio audience and viewers as he closed that final show. \u201cI hate cynicism. For the record, it\u2019s my least favorite quality. It doesn\u2019t lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and you\u2019re kind, amazing things will happen.\u201d",
      "Years later, he can look back and appreciate what he said.",
      "\u201cI believe that still. Yeah. I think, man, who was that guy? That guy was smart,\u201d he joked to TODAY\u2019s Jacob Soboroff in a story that aired May 14.",
      "As wise as he may think those words were, O\u2019Brien said he hasn\u2019t actually sat down and watched the clip.",
      "\u201cNo, never have,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cNo. I can\u2019t do it,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s too \u2014 I\u2019m proud of it. But I can\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 it was just a lot. It was a lot. And that was a moment where I really did think, \u2018I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s over for me.\u2019 I really did, you know?\u201d",
      "O\u2019Brien had an unusual route to fame. He worked as a writer on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d but he was hardly a household name when he was chosen to take over for Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d when Letterman moved to CBS to host \u201cLate Show.\u201d",
      "After initially struggling, O'Brien's \u201cLate Night\u201d became a fan favorite and ratings winner. O\u2019Brien would remain with the program until 2009, when he took over for Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Brien didn\u2019t last eight months on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d and left following a messy, public split with NBC, but he would be just fine. In 2010, he returned as host of TBS\u2019 new late-night show, \u201cConan,\u201d which would run until 2021.",
      "He also went on to host the Emmy-winning shows \u201cConan Without Borders\u201d and \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Must Go,\u201d as well as his podcast, \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Needs a Friend.\u201d In addition, he had a sort of full-circle moment when he returned to \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d \u2014 now hosted by Jimmy Fallon \u2014 as a guest in 2024, his first time on the program since his exit almost 15 years earlier.",
      "Known for his trademark self-deprecating style, O\u2019Brien in March received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, considered one of the most prestigious honors in comedy. Letterman presented him with the award.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll have a more meaningful night in my career than I did at the Twain Award. It just had so much meaning for me,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so grateful to all those amazingly talented people that came. And it meant a lot to me that David Letterman was there. It meant the world to me,\u201d he added.",
      "O\u2019Brien\u2019s career in comedy has been scrutinized, maligned and beloved. Still, he\u2019s grateful for how it all panned out.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a thing, honestly. I know people say that, but I wouldn\u2019t change a thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been insanely blessed. ... I\u2019ve had all my dreams come true 75,000 times over. And even the dark moments have had gifts in them.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s all in line with who O\u2019Brien is.",
      "\u201cI like to make people laugh. I get a lot of joy out of making people laugh. And if, when we wrap this up and go and get coffee next door, if I can make the person at the counter laugh, I\u2019m happy,\u201d he said."

      "The podcaster and former late-night host spoke with NBC's Jacob Soboroff in an interview that aired May 14 on TODAY about experiencing the loss of his parents only three days apart in December 2024.",
      "O'Brien was shooting an episode for Season Two of his Max travel show, \"Conan O'Brien Must Go,\" when he learned his father, Dr. Thomas O'Brien, had died at 95 at their home in Brookline, Massachusetts, on Dec. 9.",
      "\"I was in Austria when my brother Luke called me and said, 'Dad passed,'\" O'Brien said. \"And I took a van to a plane to another plane, just different airport hubs, got to Boston. And (I) walk in the room and my dad\u2019s bed is empty, and my mom was in the bed next to him.",
      "\"And I could tell that she was going, which was surreal. And she passed within three days of my dad passing.\"",

      "His parents' deaths came only days before massive wildfires cut a path of destruction through Southern California, endangering O'Brien's home. He also was preparing to host the Oscars for the first time.",
      "\"Then the funeral became a double funeral, and the scramble to get that together, and all the emotions that come with it,\" O'Brien said. \"And the minute Christmas was over I was like, 'OK, you just have to get to work on the Oscars because there\u2019s not much time.' And the fires hit, and we were evacuated and we\u2019re living in a hotel, very fortunately. The fire came very close.\"",

      "\"I\u2019ve known these people for decades, some of them, and they\u2019re friends,\" he said. \"And so the fact that I\u2019m together with them, it sounds crazy, but it\u2019s healing to be in a room with really funny people that know and care about me, and to be working on something that we\u2019re trying to make that\u2019s positive and life-affirming and silly.\"",
      "\"So in a way, it was good therapy,\" he continued. \"I wish my parents had been able to see the Oscars, but they got to see a lot. They got to see a lot of cool things. And they were very proud, and so I had the knowledge of knowing that they saw a lot.\"",

She was a trailblazer. And so many women have come up to me since my mom passed and said, 'Your mother counseled me. Your mother gave me the courage and the belief that, yes, women can inhabit this space.'\"",

      "During the movie premiere at the Paris Theater in New York on April 30, Scaravella got to see what was once a grief-driven vision that turned into a movie-worthy script. Scaravella said on Sunday Sitdown that he \u201ccried through the whole movie.\u201d",

She knows exactly what that\u2019s supposed to taste like,\u201d Scaravella tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd the Italian lady, and so on and so forth. I think that these ladies are the source and so they really are able to represent the culture, and that\u2019s what we do.\u201d",
      "With the big release, Scaravella says there are plans to do a sequel called \u201cNonnas of the World.\u201d Scaravella has even started developing an idea to do a television series.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s beyond my comprehension,\u201d Scaravella says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just so grateful. I can\u2019t be anything more than grateful.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "ISTANBUL \u2014 Confusion swirled around high-stakes peace talks between Russia and Ukraine that were called for by Russian President Vladimir Putin Thursday, as the Kremlin confirmed that Putin himself would be skipping the negotiations.",
      "Uncertainty over the start date, location, and whether either side would even participate made for chaotic scenes in the Turkish capital Ankara, Antalya and Istanbul \u2014 outside whose Ottoman-era Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace some 200 journalists and crew were massed with no clear idea of when talks would get underway.",
      "A back-and-forth between Kyiv, Moscow and the Trump administration dashed the U.S. president's hopes of a three-way meeting involving Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "When asked Thursday whether Putin would be attending talks in Turkey, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told CNN \u201cno.\u201d He added on a later media call that there are \u201cno preparations\u201d for talks between Putin and Trump in the coming days.",
      "Putin made the suggestion for negotiations \u201cwithout any preconditions\u201d after Ukrainian allies, including Germany, France and the U.K. presented an ultimatum to Moscow to either accept the ceasefire proposal or face additional sanctions.",
      "The Russian leader's no-show is expected to further antagonize the White House, which has markedly changed its tone over the war in the past weeks. Even after his historic Oval Office shouting match with Zelenskyy, Vice President J.D. Vance has shifted to accusing Moscow of \u201casking for too much,\u201d in the bilateral peace talks senior Trump administration officials have held with Russia in recent weeks.",
      "That is partly because Trump\u2019s major gripe with Ukraine \u2014 that American taxpayers have mostly funded Ukraine\u2019s defense \u2014 was soothed after the two nations struck a mineral deals that would go some way to repaying American military aid.",
      "Zelenskyy has also presented himself as compliant, backing Trump\u2019s calls for an immediate 30-day ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "Trump has said he is \u201calways considering\u201d additional sanctions against Russia if he believes Moscow is blocking the peace process, with officials also suggesting secondary sanctions on the buyers of Russian oil.",
      "After heeding Trump\u2019s calls to accept Putin\u2019s initial suggestion of talks Sunday, Zelenskyy landed Thursday in Ankara.",
      "Before a planned meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyib Erdogan, Zelenskyy said he would meet with a broader Turkish delegation as well as American diplomats.",
      "\u201cThe level of the Russian delegation is not officially known to me yet, but from what we see \u2014 it looks like not a serious level,\u201d Zelenskyy, using a Ukrainian word meaning \u2018sham\u2019 or \u2018theatrical.\u2019",
      "\u201cWe must understand the level of the Russian delegation and what mandate they have \u2014 whether they are even capable of making any decisions on their own,\u201d Zelenskyy added, \u201cbecause we all know who actually makes decisions in Russia.\u201d",
      "That was instead of joining the talks initially planned for Istanbul, after the Kremlin indicated late Wednesday that rather than Putin, or even Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, it was instead sending a relatively junior team headed by Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin.",
      "\u201cThis week really may change a lot \u2014 but only may,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an X post Wednesday, adding, \u201cI am waiting to see who will come from Russia, and then I will decide which steps Ukraine should take.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far, the signals from them in the media are unconvincing,\u201d he added.",
      "While the Kremlin's last-minute naming of a junior team will do little to dispel Ukrainian and European allegations that Putin is not taking Trump's peace-brokering attempts seriously, the Russian delegation that arrived Thursday in Istanbul was \u201cready for serious work,\u201d Russian foreign ministry Maria Zakharova said at a news briefing the same day.",
      "As well as uncertainty over whether Ukraine would even send a delegation to the scaled down talks in Istanbul, Kyiv and Moscow appeared to disagree over the start time of talks.",
      "While Russian media initially reported a 10 a.m. local time start (3 a.m. ET) at the Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace, that shifted to midday, and then after 5 p.m.",
      "The confusion looked set to continue in Istanbul late Thursday morning, with American personnel appeared to be preparing a venue for a U.S. delegation to use as a base, with officials huddled in urgent meetings and two security staff arriving with a German Shepherd.",
      "State-run broadcaster Russia 1 TV, meanwhile, that 89 Russian journalists have been accredited to cover the negotiations with the station's reporters suggesting to NBC News that they were told the negotiations would conclude Thursday.",

    "story": [
      "The streets of Syria were a carnival of car horns, fireworks and flags after President Donald Trump made the surprise announcement that the United States would lift sanctions that have throttled the country\u2019s economy for more than 45 years.",
      "Trump stunned even close observers on Tuesday by saying he wants to normalize relations after Syria\u2019s longtime president, Bashar al Assad, was toppled in December. Trump met Wednesday with Assad\u2019s successor, interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former leader of an al-Qaeda offshoot group, in Saudi Arabia\u00a0after urging him\u00a0late Tuesday to \u201cshow us something special.\u201d",
      "That has delighted Syrians and campaigners, who have been calling for sanctions relief to rebuild the war-ruined country \u2014 a reconstruction priced up to $400 billion. When Trump made the announcement \u2014 telling a Saudi audience \u201cwe\u2019re taking them all off\u201d \u2014 Syrian housewife Dalal Qallab took to\u00a0the streets with her children in an outpouring of joy.",
      "\u201cTrump said that he will give us a chance, and we deserve that chance,\u201d Qallab, a mother of four from the port city of Latakia, told NBC News. \u201cAfter 14 years, I felt that the American president cared about us,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was a historic moment. It gave us hope for a better life.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a chance at relief after a grim 14 years in a country that until now has been one of the world\u2019s most sanctioned.",
      "\u201cFor years, sanctions have caused severe damage to the Syrian economy, directly impacting citizens\u2019 lives and hindering development and production,\u201d said Syrian economy minister spokesperson Hassan Al-Ahmad in a statement sent to NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis decision presents a genuine opportunity to revive the economy, restore national production cycles, and open doors to investments, technology, and markets,\u201d he added. \u201cFrom the Syrian government\u2019s perspective, this decision marks a turning point that we aim to leverage wisely and rationally.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere have been very few positive things happening in Syria,\u201d said  Aron Lund, a Syria expert and a fellow at Century International, a progressive think tank based in New York. \u201cAssad going was, of course, positive in the sense that you got rid of this mass murderer,\u201d but the \u201ceconomic morass\u201d has persisted.",
      "Assad\u2019s 2011 crackdown morphed into one of the most devastating and complex civil wars of modern times. Iran, Russia and Hezbollah lined up behind Assad, and the U.S., Turkey and others supported different rebel groups. Amid all of that, the Islamic State terroist organization thrived.",
      "Assad stayed in power by killing his own people, deploying chemical weapons and Russian bombs, and torturing and murdering them in an underground network of gulags. The U.N. estimates more than 300,000 people were killed; another 13 million were forced to flee their homes.",
      "In recent years, however, most international aid has flown into places like Ukraine and Gaza. Now it will be far easier for cash to enter Syria, Lund said. He called Trump\u2019s move \u201ca big, good thing for Syria\u2019s chances of recovering and stabilizing as a functioning nation state.\u201d",
      "Such a development would be welcomed by Syria\u2019s neighbors in the Gulf and Middle East. And indeed, Trump said his decision to lift sanctions came at the behest of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. They want to see a stable Syria, one that does not disseminate refugees, instability and terrorism, and acts as an ally against Iran.",
      "\u201cI hope to see Syria like the UAE, Qatar or Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Nasser Eido, 49, a lawyer who fled to Norway during the war but has since returned to Damascus since Assad fell. \u201cI\u2019m confident we can achieve this. The old regime stole the country\u2019s resources, kept the people poor and left them hungry.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s move does not come without risk, however.",
      "Questions still hang over al-Sharaa, who led Assad\u2019s overthrow and says he has reformed since his days as the leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which spearheaded the offensive against Assad in early December.",
      "He has given some moderate signals, appointing women and minorities to government positions and saying Sharia, the strict interpretation of Islamic law, will not be imposed. Yet some groups remain uneasy about their place in the new Syria, where there have already been mass killings of Alawites, Assad\u2019s minority Muslim sect.",
      "\u201cThere is the risk that the Syrian government, which is pretty hardcore Islamist, ends up doing horrible things: more massacres, or Christians getting killed, or something else that would not play well in Washington,\u201d Lund said. The White House could be in the position of having to defend itself \u201cagainst the charges that it maybe enabled that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not a risk free decision.\u201d",
      "In 1979, the country was blacklisted on the State Department\u2019s first list of state sponsors of terror, alongside Iraq, Libya and former South Yemen. Today, Syria is the only one left, the others being replaced by North Korea, Cuba and Iran. This classification imposes financial restrictions, as well as banning any American military-related imports or exports.",
      "More U.S. sanctions came in 2004, followed by the first measures from the United Nations and European Union a year later. In 2011, when Assad began brutally suppressing demonstrations, the U.S., U.N. and E.U. imposed further import and export controls.",
      "After rebels toppled Assad in just 11 days with little fightback, the U.S. eased some of these restrictions, granting a six-month license that allowed humanitarian aid to enter the country.",
      "Since then, the Trump administration had shown few signs of offering easy progress. It demanded that Syria fulfill a list of conditions that included protecting minorities before any sanctions could be shifted \u2014 hence the surprise at Trump's announcement.",
      "It could be a game changer for millions.",
      "Jumana Hayek, 23, risked imprisonment and torture for receiving 100 euros (around $115) every month from her brother, who had fled to Germany.",
      "\u201cIt was hard and dangerous because sending money to Syria wasn\u2019t allowed due to American and international sanctions,\u201d said Hayek, a university student from Aleppo studying electrical engineering. \u201cMy brother took risks sending the money, and we took risks receiving it,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cWe suffered a lot, but things will change now.\u201d"

      "\u201cNobody does drama like the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church,\u201d said Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, shortly after emerging from the conclave that elected Pope Leo XIV on Thursday.",
      "The quick decision, made some 33 hours after the Sistine Chapel\u2019s doors closed and the cardinals went into sequestration, was a sign that they likely entered the conclave with enough unity around the decision to continue Francis\u2019 legacy that they did not have to spend days tussling over a new direction for the Vatican.",
      "In the weeks ahead of the conclave, Cardinal Joseph Tobin, archbishop of Newark, said in a joint press conference with five other American cardinals on Friday. \u201cWe listened to each other. What does the church need? What does the world need? What are we hoping for? What are we dreaming about?\u201d",
      "Leo, previously Cardinal Robert Prevost, a U.S. native with Peruvian citizenship and deep ties to Latin America, is described by the Vatican as the \u201csecond pope from the Americas,\u201d to Francis\u2019 first. He is known to have been close to the late pontiff, both in their daily dealings at the Vatican and ideologically.Like Francis, Leo is known for his concern for the poor and marginalized, and in his first Sunday blessing as pope, quoted Francis and called for ceasefires in Ukraine and Gaza, the subjects of Francis\u2019 final message to the world.",
      "The conclave is shrouded in secrecy, and many of the dealings that lead up to it remain in the shadows, but since the end of the conclave some cardinals have offered glimpses into what happened in the hours that led up to Leo\u2019s election.",
      "Once the Sistine Chapel\u2019s doors close, the cardinals swear an oath of \u201cabsolute and perpetual secrecy,\u201d as do all\u00a0Vatican\u00a0staff assisting them, including cooks, cleaners and drivers. Mobile phones are confiscated, an ancient reason for a digital detox that at least one cardinal, Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, appreciated for giving him \u201cmore time on my hands just to be prayerful, just to reflect, just to be still, rather than being constantly agitated,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "On the first evening, the cardinals cast their first-round votes, but black smoke billowed from the chimney, meaning no pope was chosen.",
      "The cardinals adjourned for the night to Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse were most of them were staying \u2014 and eating. Cardinal Wilton Gregory said that \u201ca lot of dialogue occurred at mealtime, coffee breaks, those moments when you can engage in smaller groups.\u201d\u201cThe only method is the human method, to get to talk to another, the dialogue, to listen to one another,\u201d Cardinal Robert McElroy, archbishop of Washington, said about the conversations that eventually lead to the two-thirds majority required to elect a pope.",
      "The next morning, the cardinals returned to the Sistine Chapel and two more ballots were cast, but black smoke emerged once again.",
      "\u201cVoting is like watching a glacier move, but sometimes glaciers under stress move a lot faster,\u201d Tobin said.",
      "Despite wide speculation on papabili in the wake of Francis\u2019 death, once the conclave began, we don\u2019t know who the other front-runners were, or why they fell behind. But Dolan told CNN that Prevost\u2019s name had begun to emerge from relative obscurity even before the conclave began. And he continued to confer with his brother cardinals into the conclave.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that he stood up and made this overwhelmingly convincing speech that just wowed,\u201d said Gregory. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any particular intervention, but I do believe he engaged quite effectively in the smaller group conversations.\u201d",
      "And while conclaves in centuries past could stretch for weeks, Prevost\u2019s election began to take shape on the second day.",
      "Or as Gregory framed it: \u201cThere was a great movement on the second day, a great movement within the body that was there and there could be nothing other than the grace of God moving us toward this consensus.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I experience is that everything begins in politics and finishes mystic,\u201d added McElroy.",
      "Tobin recalled the moment after casting his vote. \u201cI walked back and I took a look at Bob, and because his name had been floating around, and he had his head in his hands,\u201d he said. \u201cI was praying for him, because I couldn\u2019t imagine what happens to a human being when you\u2019re facing something like that.\u201d",
      "During a press conference on Saturday, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, himself considered one of the leading candidates for pope, said he was seated next to Prevost.",
      "In the minutes after his election, when the new pope was gasping for air as the weight of his new role descended on him, Tagle said he asked him if he wanted a piece of candy. Prevost accepted and Tagle pulled one from a pocket beneath his cardinal\u2019s robe. \u201cThat\u2019s my first act of charity,\u201d he said he told Prevost jokingly, \u201cfor our new Holy Father.\u201d",

    "summary": "Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel are \"worried about any deal\" President Trump might strike with Iran, one source told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0When President Donald Trump took office in January, he and Israeli Prime\u00a0Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were closely aligned on how to approach the most pressing issues in their relationship: the war in Gaza and aggression from Iran.",
      "Trump lifted a hold the Biden administration had put on sending large bombs to Israel. He encouraged Israeli military operations \u201cto finish the job\u201d against Hamas in Gaza. He agreed with Netanyahu on confronting Iran and its proxy groups in the region.",
      "But in recent weeks, the relationship between Trump and Netanyahu has become strained as the two leaders are increasingly at odds over a strategy for tackling these challenges now that Hamas has been significantly degraded and Iran weakened, according to two U.S. officials, two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions.",
      "Where Netanyahu sees an opportunity to finally take out Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, Trump sees an opportunity to remove the threat of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon by making a deal. As Israel hits Gaza with a new military offensive, Trump is pushing for a ceasefire and looking to implement his postwar plan for rebuilding the area into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d And after Trump halted the U.S. military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthi militant group, a shocked Netanyahu said Israel would then defend itself.",
      "The recent differences between the two leaders on key strategies and positions has put Trump\u2019s relationship with one of America\u2019s closest allies at a bit of a crossroads. How they navigate their disagreements going forward will shape the outcome of some of the core components of the president\u2019s foreign policy agenda.",
      "Twice in just this past week alone, Trump made public comments that rankled Netanyahu, the two U.S. officials, the\u00a0two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions said.",
      "Netanyahu\u00a0was particularly upset when Trump said Wednesday that\u00a0he had yet to decide\u00a0whether Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium under a new nuclear deal his administration is negotiating, the two U.S. officials said. A top adviser to Netanyahu, Ron Dermer, conveyed that message to Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, during a meeting at the White House on Thursday, according to\u00a0one of the\u00a0U.S. officials.",
      "For his part, Trump has been frustrated with Netanyahu\u2019s decision to begin a new military offensive in Gaza, which the president sees as at odds with his plan for rebuilding there, according to one of the U.S. officials and one of the people familiar with the tensions between the two leaders.",
      "Privately, Trump has said the new Israeli offensive in Gaza is a wasted effort because it will make it harder to rebuild, according to those two sources.",
      "The U.S. is currently pushing Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza, which Dermer was set to discuss with Witkoff during his White House visit this week, according to the Middle Eastern diplomats and a senior Trump administration official.",
      "But\u00a0Trump\u2019s approach to Iran has been the biggest point of contention for Netanyahu.",
      "The Israeli leader has been frustrated for weeks with Trump\u2019s refusal to support military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities and his decision to instead\u00a0try to reach a deal aimed at blocking Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, according to the two U.S. officials, the\u00a0two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re worried about any deal,\u201d one of the U.S. officials said of the Israelis.",
      "Israel has made clear to the U.S. that it does not want Trump to cut a nuclear deal that leaves Iran with any uranium enrichment capabilities, the U.S. officials and Middle Eastern diplomats said. Trump has expressed an openness to Iran maintaining a civilian nuclear program.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t made that decision yet,\u201d Trump said Wednesday when asked if the U.S. position is that Iran can have a uranium enrichment program for civilian nuclear purposes.",
      "\u201cIsrael has had no better friend in its history than President Trump,\u201d\u00a0James Hewitt, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement responding to this story. \u201cWe continue to work closely with our ally Israel to ensure remaining hostages in Gaza are freed, Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, and to strengthen regional security in the Middle East. As he has repeatedly stated in his first and second terms, the president is committed to ensuring Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "A third U.S. official said the president\u2019s team has communicated with Israeli officials regularly about the status of negotiations with Iran, providing updates and coordinating on elements of a potential deal.",
      "Netanyahu's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u2018Trump has his own agenda\u2019",
      "Netanyahu was\u00a0blindsided \u2014 and infuriated \u2014\u00a0this past week\u00a0by Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. was halting its military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen after the\u00a0Houthis\u00a0agreed to stop firing on U.S. ships in the Red Sea, according to\u00a0one of the U.S. officials and\u00a0the\u00a0two Middle East diplomats.",
      "The Houthis had just attacked Israel with a missile that hit close to Ben Gurion, Israel\u2019s main airport.",
      "When Netanyahu visited the White House last month, for the second time since Trump took office,\u00a0he hoped\u00a0the president\u00a0would pledge U.S. air support for a possible Israeli operation against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, according to the two Middle Eastern diplomats. The Israeli leader was taken aback when the president instead announced he would agree to direct talks with Tehran, the diplomats said.",
      "Netanyahu has privately said\u00a0he thinks\u00a0Trump\u2019s negotiations with Iran are a waste of time because Tehran will never hold up its end of any deal, according to the two U.S. officials. Israel has argued that Iran is so weakened by economic sanctions and the degradation of its proxies in the region that now is an ideal moment to take out its nuclear facilities, and it is concerned the window for doing so is closing while the U.S. negotiates, the officials said.",
      "Adding to that concern about timing,\u00a0Israeli military strikes\u00a0crippled Iranian strategic air defenses in October,\u00a0meaning manned aircraft conducting new strikes now\u00a0would not be as susceptible to being shot down. But the Iranians are rebuilding their air defenses.",
      "Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham said this week that the only acceptable Iran deal is one that completely stops Tehran from any uranium enrichment. They also urged Trump to submit any Iran nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification, which requires a two-thirds majority vote.",
      "Asked about Cotton and Graham\u2019s comments, a fourth U.S. official said Witkoff is in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with Graham about Iran negotiations and briefed Cotton on them this past week.",
      "The 2015 Iran nuclear deal reached by President Barack Obama was not ratified by the Senate, which allowed Trump to simply withdraw the U.S. from the agreement during his first term.",
      "\u201cI think what you\u2019re seeing is the Israelis recognizing that as much as they welcomed the election of President Trump and thought that would really give them a blank check to pursue whatever agenda they wanted, Trump has his own agenda,\u201d Frank Lowenstein,\u00a0a former Middle East envoy under the Obama administration,\u00a0said during a virtual briefing organized by J Street, an advocacy organization that describes itself as pro-Israel and pro-peace.",
      "Although Trump\u2019s diplomacy with Iran and the U.S. deal with the Houthis are \u201canathema\u201d to Netanyahu, the prime minister does not have the political leverage in Washington or Israel to enter into a direct confrontation with Trump, who is popular with\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s\u00a0base in Israel, said Ilan Goldenberg, who worked on Middle East policy\u00a0as a senior official during\u00a0the Biden and Obama administrations.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cwhole political strategy and survival strategy is based on holding his coalition and holding his political base together,\u201d Goldenberg said in the briefing organized by J Street. \u201cAnd those folks love Trump, so for him to go very publicly against Trump is something he really can\u2019t do.\u201d",
      "The strain\u00a0in\u00a0the relationship between\u00a0Trump and\u00a0Netanyahu comes as the president is set\u00a0to\u00a0travel to the Middle East next week, with stops\u00a0scheduled\u00a0in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Trump\u00a0is not currently scheduled\u00a0to visit Israel\u00a0on this trip, though he did during his first term.",
      "Witkoff also\u00a0planned to\u00a0attend another round of negotiations with Iran this weekend in Oman."

    "story": [
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 A New Zealand parliamentary committee has recommended the unprecedented suspensions of three M\u0101ori lawmakers for performing a protest haka in the debating chamber last year.",
      "The haka is a chanting dance of challenge of great cultural importance in New Zealand, and the three lawmakers from Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori, the M\u0101ori party, performed one to oppose a controversial bill that would have redefined the country\u2019s founding document.",
      "On Wednesday a committee recommended record suspensions and severe censure \u2014 the harshest penalties ever assigned to New Zealand parliamentarians \u2014 after finding the trio in contempt of Parliament.",
      "Government bloc lawmakers, who hold the majority, are expected to endorse the penalties in a vote Tuesday. But Parliament\u2019s Speaker Gerry Brownlee took the unusual step Thursday of saying he would first allow unlimited debate before the vote due to the severity of the proposed punishments.",
      "The recommendations were the latest twist in the fraught saga over the bill, now defeated, that opponents said would have provoked constitutional havoc and reversed decades of progress for M\u0101ori, New Zealand\u2019s Indigenous people.",
      "Video of the legislators in full cry drew global attention last November. The bill they opposed was vanquished at a second vote in April.",
      "However, some lawmakers from the center-right government objected to the M\u0101ori Party legislators\u2019 protest during the first vote and complained to parliament\u2019s speaker. At issue was the way the trio walked across the floor of the debating chamber toward their opponents while they performed the haka.",
      "\u201cIt is not acceptable to physically approach another member on the floor of the debating chamber,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s report said, adding that the behavior could be considered intimidating. The committee denied the legislators were being punished for the haka, which is a beloved and sacred cultural institution in New Zealand life, but \u201cthe time at and manner in which it was performed\u201d during a vote, according to the findings.",
      "The committee deciding the fate of the lawmakers has members from all political parties. The government\u2019s opponents disagreed with parts or all of the decision but were overruled.",
      "\u201cThis was a very serious incident, and the likes of which I have never seen before in my 23 years in the debating chamber,\u201d said the committee\u2019s chair, Judith Collins.",
      "The three legislators did not appear before the committee when summoned in April because they said Parliament does not respect M\u0101ori cultural protocol and they would not get a fair hearing.",
      "\u201cThe process was grossly unjust, unfair, and unwarranted, resulting in an extreme sanction,\u201d M\u0101ori party spokesperson and lawmaker Mariameno Kapa-Kingi said in a statement. \u201cThis was not about process, this became personal.\u201d",
      "The report recommended that Hana-R\u0101whiti Maipi-Clarke, who at 22 is New Zealand\u2019s youngest lawmaker, be suspended from Parliament for seven days. The co-leaders of her political party, Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, face 21-day bans.",
      "Three days is the longest a lawmaker has been barred from the House before. Suspended legislators are not paid during their bans.",
      "Waititi and Ngarewa-Packer, the leaders of the party that advocates M\u0101ori rights and holds six of Parliament\u2019s 123 seats, have lambasted the committee\u2019s process as intolerant of M\u0101ori principles and identity.",
      "The pair received more severe sanctions than Maipi-Clarke because the younger lawmaker had written a letter of \u201ccontrition\u201d to the committee, the report said.",
      "The Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Bill sought to redefine New Zealand\u2019s founding document, the 1840 pact between the British Crown and M\u0101ori leaders signed during New Zealand\u2019s colonization.",
      "The English and M\u0101ori language versions of the treaty differed, and the Crown immediately began to breach both, resulting in mass land thefts and generations of disenfranchisement for M\u0101ori, who remain disadvantaged on almost every metric. But in recent decades, M\u0101ori protest movements have wrought growing recognition of the Treaty\u2019s promises in New Zealand\u2019s law, politics and public life.",
      "That produced billion-dollar land settlements with tribes and strategies to advance Indigenous language and culture. Such policies were the target of the bill, drawn up by a minor libertarian party that denounced what it said was special treatment for M\u0101ori as they tried to rewrite the treaty\u2019s promises."

      "MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 An Australian local government has decided against repairing an often-vandalized monument to renowned British explorer James Cook because it would be destroyed again. But the mayor on Wednesday rejected accusations that the vandals have won.",
      "Statues and monuments to the 18th-century naval officer are common in Australia and are often defaced by opponents of Britain\u2019s settlement of the country without a treaty with its Indigenous people. In 1770, then Lt. Cook charted the Australian east coast where Sydney would become the first British colony on the continent.",
      "The granite and bronze monument to the master navigator and cartographer in an inner-city Melbourne park was vandalized days after the anniversary of the first British settlers\u2019 arrival at Sydney Cove was commemorated on Jan. 26. Opponents of Australia Day celebrations denounce the public holiday as \u201cInvasion Day.\u201d There are growing calls for the country to find a less divisive national day.",
      "The monument in Melbourne\u2019s Edinburgh Gardens was snapped at its base and spray painted with the words \u201ccook the colony.\u201d",
      "Mayor Stephen Jolly, head of the Yarra City Council, which is a municipality near the heart of Melbourne, said his fellow councilors had voted unanimously on Tuesday night against spending 15,000 Australian dollars ($9,700) on repairing the monument, which remains in storage.",
      "Jolly said the decision to permanently remove the monument, which included an image of Cook\u2019s face cast in bronze, was about economics rather than taking a position in Australia\u2019s culture wars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about being economically rational. It\u2019s AU$15,000 a pop every time we have to repair it and it\u2019s persistently getting either demolished or vandalized or tagged,\u201d Jolly told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a waste of ratepayers\u2019 money. We can\u2019t afford to do that,\u201d Jolly added.",
      "But Victoria state\u2019s Melbourne-based conservative opposition leader, Brad Battin, condemned removing such memorials as surrendering to vandals.",
      "\u201cWe need to stand strong and remember the fact that this is part of our history,\u201d Battin told reporters.",
      "\u201cIf you start to remove the history of our state and our country because of activists, then you\u2019re actually giving in to those that are campaigning against it,\u201d Battin added.",
      "Jolly disagreed that his council had given the vandals what they wanted.",
      "\u201cNo, I think they would\u2019ve loved for us to put it back up and then they could\u2019ve just tagged it again or destroyed it again and just had this ongoing sort of little war going on in Edinburgh Gardens,\u201d Jolly said.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re probably the most disappointed people that it\u2019s not going to be there anymore,\u201d Jolly added.",
      "The base of the monument remained at the entrance to the park on Wednesday with a traffic cone attached to warn cyclists, joggers and pedestrians of the trip hazard it presents. Someone has scrawled a smiling face and a torso on the cone in an apparent reference to the memorial that had once stood in its place.",
      "Jolly said a local branch of the Captain Cook Society, an international group that celebrates the explorer, has offered to preserve the bronze plaques.",
      "Melbourne-based society member Bill Lang said discussions were underway to find a short-term home for the monument, such as a museum.",
      "Lang said the council\u2019s decision not to repair the monument was disheartening.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing for every open-minded Australian that believes that there are lots of things that we can learn about and learn from our history that we should celebrate,\u201d Lang said."

      "A day after 59 white South Africans were welcomed to America as refugees, more than 86,000 South African farmers \u2014 who are mostly white \u2014 are gathering this week at the NAMPO Harvest Day trade fair, an annual agricultural exhibition considered the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "Over four days, the attendees will discuss innovations in technology, collaborations and various other elements of an industry that last year generated nearly $14 billion in revenue.",
      "Notably, according to one participant, there is no planned discussion of violence against white farmers or \u201cAfrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored, race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation\u201d without compensation, as President Donald Trump wrote in a Feb. 7 executive order that opened the way for the 59 South Africans to come to U.S., despite a ban on refugees from other nations.",
      "The executive order referenced South Africa\u2019s Expropriation Act enacted last year, which in some cases allows the government to seize unused land without compensation, something Cyril Ramaphosa, the country\u2019s president, said has not happened.",
      "The act awakened a profoundly troubling argument over land rights. South Africa's dark history of racism includes the confiscation of land from Black residents, both before and during the apartheid. Afrikaners, the minority white descendants of Dutch and French settlers who arrived in South Africa in the 1600s, were leaders of the apartheid regime that ended in 1994.",
      "The purported goal of the Expropriation Act is to shrink the vast land ownership disparity that came with the oppressive rule. According to the organization Action for Southern Africa, 72% of farms and agricultural holdings are owned by whites, who make up 7.3% of the population. Black Africans, representing 81.4%, own only 4% of the land.",
      "Trump asserted on Monday, ahead of the refugees\u2019 arrival in the U.S., that \u201cwhite farmers are being brutally killed and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.\u201d",
      "Yet Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, said that the spirit of NAMPO this week reaffirms that \u201cgenocide\u201d of white South African farmers \u201cwas imaginary and not happening in our country.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all disturbed that the U.S. side is alleging that there\u2019s genocide and mistreatment of white farmers in South Africa. It is incorrect,\u201d said Sihlobo, who is also co-author of the book \u201cThe Uncomfortable Truth About South Africa\u2019s Agriculture.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anything, the sector continues to flourish. [Trump's] comments are misinformed and not mirroring the reality on the ground in the country,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "The New York Times reported 225 people were killed on South African farms over a four-year period ending in 2024. Of those deaths, 101 were Black current or former workers living on farms, and 53 were farmers, who are usually white.",
      "Nico Harris, a farmer of Afrikaans heritage, told Daily Maverick South African newspaper that the problems he sees can be overcome and stem from the government not being \u201cpro-farmer.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the refugees that have gone [to the U.S.] are not well-established family farming businesses like we are,\u201d Harris told the paper. \u201cI think they don\u2019t have an opportunity in the country and they might think that, \u2018This is an opportunity for us.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really fleeing because they are scared or worried, I think they see it as an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Harris added, \u201cI think there are racially discriminating laws against white farmers, and I think they have problems and haven\u2019t got sympathy from the government. But there are no real land grabs, and I don\u2019t think there are real threats. There are individual farm attacks, but it\u2019s more related to criminal activity. We just hope our government is going to wake up and realize that they need the farmers, Black and white.\u201d",
      "One of the South Africans who arrived in the U.S. on Monday told The Washington Post that she had been advised not to speak with the media and said it had been a \u201cvery emotional, very rough couple of weeks.\u201d",
      "Theo Boshoff, CEO of AgBiz, which represents companies across the agricultural value chain, including South African and multinational companies, said crime in rural farming areas is high but \u201cnot targeted against any racial or ethnic group.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no genocide in South Africa,\u201d Boshoff added. \u201cPeople who live in rural areas, who are often farmers, are simply more vulnerable to crime and violent crime because they live in remote areas.\u201d",
      "And because they are remote, law enforcement often is not nearby to protect them. \u201cThere is no cultural or racial bias at play. White farmers, Black farmers, white farmworkers, Black farmworkers are\u00a0all equally at risk and united in combatting this challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t agree with insinuations that rural crime is motivated by politics or in any way related to South Africa\u2019s affirmative action efforts to remedy our checkered past.\u201d",
      "Solidarity, a South African trade union that represents 600,000 Afrikaner families, said in a statement in February that it does not agree with the African National Congress, which wants to close the farmland disparity gap. \u201cBut we love our country. As in any community, there are individuals who wish to immigrate, but repatriation of Afrikaners as refugees is not a solution for us,\u201c the group wrote.",
      "President Ramaphosa said on X that the country\u2019s laws \u201cbalance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.\u201d He said that a meeting with President Trump about the country\u2019s land reform policy would result in them sharing \u201ca better and common understanding over these matters.\u201d",

      "Fadial Adams, a member of the National Assembly of South Africa, a political body that passes legislation and analyzes executive action, warned of Musk\u2019s influence on the president. \u201cLet us not forget that Elon Musk is a beneficiary of our suffering and our slavery in South Africa, and it is not something that he hides. He was raised on a system which benefited white South Africans exclusively,\u201d\u00a0Adams said. \u201cElon Musk should stop acting like the minister for foreign affairs for South Africa. He\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration and Musk representative did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Afriforum, a nongovernmental South African agency that supports the interests of white citizens, have called for farm murders to be classified as priority crimes requiring special attention, like gender-based violence or rhino-poaching. It does not support the Expropriation Act.",
      "\u201cMany laws identified by the Afrikaner lobby groups as racist are viewed by the African National Congress as being necessary, intentional measures to redress past wrongs,\u201d said Thula Simpson, an associate professor of history at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. \u201cSo the present developments strike at the heart of the post-apartheid consensus.\u201d",

      "Jetlagged but excited, Pope Leo XIV\u2019s brother, John Prevost, is catching up on daily life after a whirlwind few days in the Vatican.",
      "Prevost is freshly arrived home after spending time with his brother following his election to the papacy. He said his priorities when he got home were mowing the lawn, enjoying a beer and letting a wild new reality set in.",
      "\u201cThis is as life-altering event for everybody, not just for the Catholic Church,\u201d he said. \u201cI was stunned at how quickly the vote went.\u201d",
      "During his time in Rome, Prevost attended multiple events with his brother, going on two different church trips outside the Vatican, and he said the massive crowds were an incredible sight.",
      "\u201cIt was supposed to be secret, but all the way there, both sides, jammed, four or five people deep,\u201d Prevost said. \u201cScreaming and hollering, \u2018Papa! Papa! Papa!\u2019 He rolled down his window and shook hands with as many people as he could. It just changed their facial expression.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s been plenty of talk of what the pope\u2019s philosophy will be and whether it will represent a departure from his predecessor or a continuation of his work, but Prevost said his brother recognizes that \u201cpeople are looking for hope\u201d and that he wants to focus on unity.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019ll be a second Pope Francis,\u201d he said.",
      "Prevost also shared photos with NBC Chicago of his parents and his siblings, and said he believed his brother was always destined for a critically important role.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a man of the world. And so what better person to be pope,\u201d he said.",
      "Unsurprisingly, Prevost said that things are still slowly sinking in.",
      "\u201cYou also feel a sense of pride, a sense of, 'Is this for real?'\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t hit me until last night \u2014 that this is for real, life-changing, and then life will go on.\u201d",
      "Prevost also said there was a stack of mail at his home when he returned, but that plenty of it was meant for the new pope.",
      "\u201cPeople bore their souls, so I\u2019m going to give them something back,\u201d he said.",
      "Prevost said he was amused by the White Sox's reaction to the news that his brother was a fan of the South Siders, and also answered another critical question for a Chicagoan: thin-crust or deep-dish pizza?",
      "\u201cThin crust, because that\u2019s what I like too,\u201d he said.",
      "Prevost asked the public to continue praying for his brother, who will be formally inaugurated as pope in a Mass on Sunday.",
      "\"Keep watching and keep praying,\" Prevost said. \"I think this is going to be a great thing for the church and for the country and the world.\""

      "DOHA, Qatar \u2014 President Donald Trump\u00a0brushed off\u00a0questions Wednesday\u00a0over ethical concerns about the\u00a0growing\u00a0Middle East\u00a0footprint of his\u00a0family business, as his\u00a0trip in the region\u00a0takes him to three countries with Trump-branded ventures.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he didn\u2019t know how an Emirati-backed firm had struck a deal with the Trump family company\u2019s digital coin for $2 billion.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Trump said, adding that he is a big cryptocurrency fan and if the U.S. doesn\u2019t lead in crypto and AI, China will. Zach Witkoff, a co-founder of the World Liberty Financial crypto venture and the son of the president\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, announced the investment at a conference in Dubai earlier this month.",
      "Asked if the Saudi-financed and Trump-linked LIV Golf tour came up during his conversations with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the last two days, Trump said it had not. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss that,\u201d he added. He also sidestepped Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s threat to block his nominees until there are more answers on a high-priced jet that Qatar has offered as a gift and instead mused that there was \u201cjust something wrong\u201d with Schumer, a New York Democrat.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The Trump Organization, led by the president\u2019s two oldest sons, has also significantly expanded its Middle East footprint, with new ventures in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. These include a Trump International Hotel & Tower in Dubai, a golf resort in Doha with Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund\u2019s real estate arm,\u00a0a Trump Tower in Jeddah, and a hotel under construction in Muscat. The projects are partnered with Dar Global, a developer linked to the Saudi government. It's unclear how long the projects will take to complete.",
      "The Trump-branded projects have drawn scrutiny in Washington from the president's political opponents and even some allies, who point out that the president has not divested from the Trump Organization and continues to profit from \u2014 and personally promote \u2014 these business ventures in his second term. The company has said that Trump handed over management of his assets to his family before returning to office and has no day-to-day role.",
      "\"The Trump Organization developments in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates raise serious conflict of interest questions, as President\u00a0Trump meets with top officials of all three countries this week,\u201d said Meghan Faulkner, communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group and watchdog focused on issues of public integrity and affiliated with Democrats. \u201cThe American people should not have to wonder if Donald Trump is prioritizing their interests or his own bottom line while he is making foreign policy decisions, but his business ties make that an unavoidable question.\u201d",
      "The White House did not return a request for comment.",
      "Trump\u2019s affinity for the Middle East is well known, with the president finding fertile ground in the region as he works to carve out an image as a global peacemaker and the leader of a country that is open for business. On Tuesday in Riyadh, he announced plans to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria and offered Iran \u201ca new, hopeful path\u201d toward a better future.",
      "During a state visit with Qatar\u2019s emir on Wednesday, Trump praised the warming Qatar-Saudi Arabia relationship, lavishing flattery on his host. \u201cWe just came from Saudi Arabia, where we have another great man over there that's a friend of yours,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys get along so well and like each other. You sort of remind me a little bit of each other, if you want to know the truth. They're both tall, handsome guys who happen to be very smart.\u201d",
      "This marks a shift from his first term, when a Saudi-led coalition blockaded Qatar over alleged terrorism support.",
      "And Trump has defended as \u201ca great gesture\u201d the Qatari jet gift, saying before leaving Washington that turning it down would be foolish. \u201cI could be a stupid person and say, \u2018No, we don\u2019t want a free, very expensive airplane,\u2019\u201d Trump said, adding that it would go to his presidential library foundation once he leaves office. Qatar, however, appeared to temper the announcement. Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar\u2019s media attach\u00e9 to the U.S., clarified that the transfer is \u201cunder consideration\u201d by Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense, with no final decision having been made.",
      "Democrats in Washington are capitalizing on the controversy, with the Democratic National Committee announcing plans to fly a banner that reads \u201cQatar-a-Lago\u201d over Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club on Wednesday.\u00a0Some Republican allies of the president have also raised concerns about the jet: Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson called the gift a \"very odd offer,\" and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said the plane could bring \"significant espionage and surveillance problems.\"",
      "At a news conference Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., dismissed concerns about the Trump family\u2019s foreign business dealings, claiming he did not have expertise on the matter and stressing that Trump has been transparent.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has nothing to hide,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe\u2019s very upfront.\u201d He stressed that ethics oversight is in place and emphasized that his focus is on leading the House. And he said Qatar\u2019s gift of the plane was \u201cto the country,\u201d not Trump personally.",
      "Refitting the plane could cost $1 billion and take years to complete, more than twice the plane\u2019s reported value, NBC News reported. The cost, likely to come at taxpayers\u2019 expense, raises questions about the practical implications of a gift to a president who may no longer be in office at the time it's ready to use."

      "Maikelys Espinoza arrived at an airport outside the capital, Caracas, along with more than 220 deported migrants. Footage aired by state television showed Venezuela\u2019s first lady Cilia Flores carrying Maikelys at the airport. Later, Flores was shown handing the girl over to her mother, who had been waiting for her arrival at the presidential palace along with President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",

      "The girl\u2019s mother was deported to Venezuela on April 25. Meanwhile, U.S. authorities sent her father to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador in March under Trump\u2019s invocation of an 18th-century wartime law to deport hundreds of immigrants.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Israel Vail\u2019s entire life in the small western Guatemalan town of Cajol\u00e1 is built off the money that his three children send home from the United States.",
      "The money from their construction jobs paid for the two-story white home where Vail now lives \u2014 and where his children, who are in the U.S. illegally, would also reside if they ever get deported. Vail, 53, invested some of the money in opening a local food shop, which he uses to keep his family afloat.",
      "In small migratory towns like Cajol\u00e1, it is not unusual for the entire economy to be built off remittances, the funds sent by migrant workers back to their home countries.",
      "\u201cPeople here, they don\u2019t live luxuriously, but they live off remittances,\u201d Vail said.",
      "House Republicans have included in President Donald Trump\u2019s big priority bill a 5% excise tax on remittance transfers that would cover more than 40 million people, including green card holders and nonimmigrant visa holders, such as people on H-1B, H-2A and H-2B visas. U.S. citizens would be exempt.",
      "Trump also recently announced that he is finalizing a presidential memorandum to \u201cshut down remittances\u201d sent by people in the U.S. illegally. White House and Treasury officials have not responded to requests for comment from The Associated Press on specifics of the presidential memorandum that Trump previewed in an April 25 Truth Social post and how it would work.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum shot back on the measure and called on Republican lawmakers to reconsider it, saying it \u201cwould damage the economy of both nations and is also contrary to the spirit of economic freedom that the U.S. government claims to defend.\u201d",
      "\u201cRemittances are the fruit of the efforts of those who, through their honest work, strengthen not only the Mexican economy but also the United States\u2019, which is why we consider this measure to be arbitrary and unjust,\u201d she said in a morning press briefing.",
      "Remittance experts, local leaders and former migrants say that banning, limiting or adding a tax on certain remittances could damage communities that rely on them, prove burdensome to American citizens and firms and, paradoxically, end up causing even more illegal migration to the U.S.",
      "The influx of money provides an important economic lifeline to residents of poorer towns that often have little access to jobs or income. Remittances provide opportunities for people in their home country, making it less likely they would take the risk of migrating to the United States, the experts say.",
      "\u201cAny measure to reduce remittances will have a negative impact on the U.S. national interest,\u201d said Manuel Orozco, director of the Migration, Remittances, and Development Program at the Inter-American Dialogue. \u201cIt will have an effect on the homeland.\u201d",
      "Proponents of efforts to target remittances say they are an effective tax on people in the U.S. illegally and could be a revenue generator for the U.S. government.",
      "Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for less immigration, acknowledges that limiting, banning or taxing remittances would make it more difficult for immigrants in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\u201cOne of the main reasons people come here is to work and send money home,\u201d Krikorian said. \u201cIf that\u2019s much more difficult to do, it becomes less appealing to come here.\u201d",
      "Legislation to control remittances \u2014 through taxes on money transfers, both internationally and domestically \u2014 has been proposed in 18 states in the past few years. Almost all of those efforts have been voted down.",
      "The exception is Oklahoma, which in 2009 passed a tax on remittances: a $5 fee on any wire transfer under $500 and 1% on any amount in excess of $500.",
      "Steven Yates, who is now a senior research fellow at the Heritage Institute, wrote for the America First Policy Institute that every state should adopt this policy as a way to combat the impact of illegal immigration.",
      "Other high-ranking Trump administration officials have also supported efforts to tighten controls on remittances. Vice President JD Vance, as an Ohio senator in 2023, co-sponsored the WIRED Act, which would have imposed a 10% fee on remittances out of the U.S.",
      "The intention of the bill \u2014 which would allow people who could prove their citizenship to get the fee back as a refundable tax credit \u2014 was \u201cpenalizing illicit activity, such as drug and human smuggling.\u201d The bill did not make it out of committee.",
      "\u201cThis legislation is a common sense solution to disincentivize illegal immigration and reduce the cartels\u2019 financial power,\u201d Vance said at the time of the bill\u2019s introduction.",
      "According to the World Bank, remittances sent to home countries in 2023 totaled about $656 billion \u2014 equivalent to the gross domestic product of Belgium. The money that Mexican migrants send home to their relatives grew by 7.6% in 2023 to reach a record $63.3 billion for the year.",
      "Remittances are also a major factor in the global economy, often sent from American wire services rather than banks and credit unions. India, Mexico and China are the biggest recipients of those funds, according to the World Bank.",
      "In response to the proposal to tax remittances in the new Republican House bill, Orozco said, \u201cSome senders would find ways to send money differently, through unauthorized channels. Others would send less.\u201d",
      "\u201cSending less would have an impact on the receiving households, limiting the capacity to save, and in turn may increase the intention to migrate,\u201d said Orozco, who also serves as a senior fellow at Harvard University\u2019s Center for International Development.",
      "In Cajol\u00e1, local leaders say the remittance flow has stopped young people from migrating because they see economic opportunities they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have. Vail said losing that lifeline would deal a devastating blow to families like his and even cause his small business to fold.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear,\u201d Vail said. \u201cFear that for the people that live here in Guatemala, there won\u2019t be work because the businesses will be all gone.\u201d",
      "He said his business has already been struggling since Trump took office and his sales of things like eggs, beans, sugar and more have dipped.",
      "\u201cWhen Donald Trump won, many people stopped sending remittances or they began to save money,\u201d he said. \u201cBusiness dropped off a lot.\u201d"

      "On May 2, Trump ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption policy, which analysts had criticized as hurting local businesses and disguising illicit fentanyl trade.",

    "summary": "Canada's Carney has slammed the U.K.'s invitation to Trump, saying it undermined a united front against the U.S. president\u2019s talk of annexing Canada.",
    "story": [
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark\u00a0Carney\u00a0has criticized Britain\u2019s invitation to Donald Trump for a\u00a0second state visit, saying it undermined his government\u2019s effort to project a united front against the U.S. president\u2019s talk of annexing Canada.",
      "Since taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to become the 51st U.S. state, a suggestion that has angered Canadians and left Britain trying to tread a fine line between the two North American countries.",
      "Britain\u2019s King Charles is also head of state of Canada, a former British colony, and the monarch has made a number of symbolic gestures in recent months, wearing Canadian medals, planting a maple tree and referring to himself as the king of Canada.",
      "Charles, who is still undergoing cancer treatment, is also due to attend Canada\u2019s state opening of parliament on May 27, the first time a British monarch has attended the event in Ottawa since 1977.",
      "Carney, in an interview with Sky News, was asked about British Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s move in February to use his visit to the Oval Office to hand Trump\u00a0an invitation\u00a0from the monarch for an unprecedented second state visit to London.",
      "\u201cI think, to be frank, they (Canadians) weren\u2019t impressed by that gesture... given the circumstance. It was at a time when we were being quite clear about the issues around sovereignty,\u201d he said.",
      "Carney, who won a party race to become prime minister in March before he\u00a0secured victory\u00a0in Canada\u2019s election last month by vowing to stand up Trump, said Charles\u2019s presence in Canada later this month was by design.",
      "\u201cAll issues around Canada\u2019s sovereignty have been accentuated by the president. So no, it\u2019s not coincidental, but it is also a reaffirming moment for Canadians,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer, who is trying to improve trading ties with the U.S. after Britain left the European Union, has sought to play to its strengths when dealing with Trump, talking up its security expertise, pledging higher defense spending, and offering the pomp and pageantry that comes with a state visit.",
      "Trump, whose mother was born in Britain and who has repeatedly praised the British royal family, agreed a limited\u00a0bilateral trade\u00a0agreement with London this month.",
      "Asked about\u00a0Carney\u2019s criticism, senior British minister Pat McFadden told Sky News that every country had to decide how to conduct its relations with other countries."

    "story": [
      "NEW DELHI \u2014 The Indian government on Tuesday disputed President Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the U.S.-mediated ceasefire between India and Pakistan came about in part because he had offered possible trade concessions.",
      "Addressing a weekly news conference, Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesman for India\u2019s foreign ministry, said top leaders in New Delhi and Washington were in touch last week following the Indian military\u2019s intense standoff with Pakistan, but that there was no conversation on trade.",
      "\u201cThe issue of trade didn\u2019t come up in any of these discussions,\u201d Jaiswal said, referring to the conversations held between Vice President JD Vance and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as well as between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar.",
      "Following Saturday\u2019s understanding between India and Pakistan to stop military action on land, in the air and at sea, Trump told reporters on Monday that he had offered to help both nations with trade if they agreed to de-escalate.",
      "\u201cI said, come on, we\u2019re going to do a lot of trade with you guys. Let\u2019s stop it. Let\u2019s stop it. If you stop it, we\u2019ll do a trade. If you don\u2019t stop it, we\u2019re not going to do any trade,\u2019\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cAnd all of a sudden, they said, I think we\u2019re going to stop,\u201d Trump said, crediting trade leverage for influencing both the nations\u2019 decision. \u201cFor a lot of reasons, but trade is a big one,\u201d he said.",
      "The militaries of India and Pakistan had been engaged in one of their most serious confrontations in decades since last Wednesday, when India struck targets inside Pakistan it said were affiliated with militants responsible for the massacre of 26 tourists last month in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan has denied any links to the attackers.",
      "After India\u2019s strikes in Pakistan, the two sides exchanged heavy fire along their de facto borders, followed by missile and drone strikes into each other\u2019s territories, mainly targeting military installations and airbases.",
      "The escalating hostilities between the nuclear-armed rivals threatened regional peace, leading to calls by world leaders to cool down tempers.",
      "Trump said he not only helped mediate the ceasefire, but also offered mediation over the simmering dispute in Kashmir, a Himalayan region that both India and Pakistan claim in its entirety but administer in parts. The two nations have fought two wars over Kashmir, which has long been described as the regional nuclear flashpoint.",
      "New Delhi also declined Trump\u2019s offer for mediation on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe have a longstanding national position that any issues related to the federally controlled union territory of Jammu and Kashmir must be addressed by India and Pakistan bilaterally. There has been no change to the stated policy,\u201d Jaiswal said.",
      "Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said late Tuesday that Pakistan was expelling a staff member of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, accusing him of unspecified inappropriate activity and giving him 24 hours to leave the country.",
      "In a tit-for-tat move last month, India and Pakistan reduced each other\u2019s diplomatic presence in Islamabad and New Delhi. So far, none of the expelled diplomats have returned. Pakistan and India routinely expel each other\u2019s diplomats over allegations of espionage."

      "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would cease sanctions against war-torn Syria \u201cto give them a chance at greatness,\u201d as he seeks to strengthen ties to Saudi Arabia and others.",
      "\u201cOh, what I do for the crown prince,\u201d Trump said as Mohammed bin Salman, seated in the front row, crossed his arms over his chest in an expression of gratitude.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s their time to shine,\u201d Trump added. \u201cGood luck, Syria. Show us something very special, like they\u2019ve done, frankly, in Saudi Arabia, OK? They\u2019re going to show us something special. Very good people.\u201d",
      "Trump will meet with Syria's new president in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, an announcement confirmed by the White House shortly before the president began speaking.",
      "In his speech, Trump presented Middle Eastern leaders with a vision of a future steeped in prosperity, business deals and technological advances, which the president treated as an antidote to historic divisions.",
      "His rhetoric stood in contrast to the words of former President Joe Biden, who deemed the kingdom \u201ca pariah\u201d before taking office. Biden struggled to regain diplomatic footing with Saudi leaders during his presidency after confronting bin Salman about the 2018 death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government. During Trump's first term, he maintained friendly relations with the Saudis despite international outrage over Khashoggi's death, which U.S. intelligence officials have said bin Salman approved.",
      "Trump on Tuesday offered an image of rising regional powers steeped in homegrown economic self-development, while holding up his host as a model.",
      "\u201cI stood here envisioning a Middle East that would eradicate terrorism and extremism, rising as one of the world\u2019s proudest, most prosperous and successful regions,\u201d Trump declared to a gathering of the world\u2019s business elite and Saudi leaders at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum. The event, which was held at King Abdulaziz International Conference Center in Riyadh, included members of his Cabinet and adviser Elon Musk, as well as executives from Palantir, Uber, Google, Amazon and more.",
      "Addressing the crown prince directly, Trump asked, \u201cMohammed, do you sleep at night? Or are you up, restless, thinking, \u2018How do I make it even better?\u2019\u201d Earlier, the two leaders signed a landmark $600 billion investment agreement, marking a high point of the day\u2019s ceremonial events.",
      "As Trump offered heavy flattery to his host, he also took aim at his predecessors in Washington, jabbing at listless leaders whom he called \u201cthe ones that don\u2019t toss and turn,\u201d and \u201cthat will never take you to the promised land.\u201d",
      "He said too many American presidents found themselves afflicted by the notion \u201cthat it\u2019s our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use U.S. policy to dispense justice for their sins.\u201d He rejected the idea that U.S. policy should judge foreign leaders\u2019 morals, advocating instead for pragmatic cooperation to drive progress.",
      "And Trump swiped at destructive forces in the region, citing Iran\u2019s leadership as the most damaging of all, causing \u201cunthinkable suffering in Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and beyond\u201d \u2014 even as his administration seeks to strike a deal with Iranian leaders over their nuclear programs.",
      "Applause followed Trump's promise to withdraw sanctions on Syria. But in announcing his \u201cfervent wish\u201d that Saudi Arabia would \u201csoon be joining the Abraham Accords\" \u2014 the diplomatic agreements Trump's first administration made between Israel and several Arab nations \u2014 the president drew silence from the room.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll do it in your own time, and that\u2019s what I want and that\u2019s what you want,\u201d\u00a0he added.",
      "Saudi Arabia has been an elusive target of Washington\u2019s diplomatic ambitions to expand the accords, with Israel\u2019s war in Gaza looming over Biden\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to bring about the normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. The ongoing conflict with Hamas remains a sticking point for Saudi Arabia, which reaffirmed its support for a Palestinian state in recent months.",
      "Trump showcased his transactional approach to diplomacy even before departing Washington by defending a proposed gift from Qatar of a luxury airplane. He described it as a \u201ccontribution\u201d that the U.S. should accept, stating, \u201cI would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, I could be a stupid person and say, \u2018No, we don\u2019t want a free, very expensive airplane.\u2019 But it was, I thought it was a great gesture.\u201d",
      "It was not just Trump seeking opportunities for deals on his royal tour of the Middle East. American business leaders are also looking to broker ties with wealthy Saudi Arabian investors. One conference attendee characterized the mood as a hub of excitement and positive engagement.",
      "This dynamic was on display during ceremonial events at the opulent Royal Court on Tuesday as the crown prince and Trump greeted, with handshakes and small talk, everyone from Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, and Sam Altman of OpenAI, to billionaire Blackrock co-founder Larry Fink and the leaders of bluechip companies like as Amazon and Coca Cola.",
      "The executives were in Riyadh to pitch deep-pocketed Saudi investors as the kingdom promises to spend on technology, infrastructure and more. Financed through sovereign wealth, the kingdom\u2019s Public Investment Fund offers a major kickstart for businesses expanding in the region. It was also an opportunity to engage with Trump directly as CEOs wrestle with the outcome of the president's sweeping tariffs.",
      "Also in attendance was Musk \u2014who, in addition to advising Trump on how to slash the federal government\u2019s spending, runs Tesla, SpaceX and an AI company \u2014 along with his businessman brother, Kimbal, according to the event program.",
      "During an earlier meeting with MBS, Trump emphasized the opportunity for the long line of American business leaders to walk away with a lot of checks. \u201cI like visiting with you,\u201d Trump added. \u201cI really believe we like each other a lot.\u201d",
      "And he joked about how Saudi Arabia's promised investments weighed on the decision of which country to visit for his first multistate overseas trip. \u201c$600 billion, knowing you, will be a trillion dollars,\u201d he said, repeating his ask to the kingdom\u00a0to increase its investment in the U.S. by rounding up a promised $600 billion.",
      "Trump secured the $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the U.S., including a multibillion-dollar defense partnership, the White House said in a statement. As part of the arrangement, the White House said, the Saudi Arabian company DataVolt\u00a0plans to invest $20 billion\u00a0in artificial intelligence data centers and other technology, while companies like Google, Salesforce, Uber and Oracle will invest $80 billion in projects across both countries. Shamekh IV Solutions, a Saudi Arabian health care firm, promised to invest $5.8 billion, including through a plant in Michigan, to launch a high-capacity IV fluid facility, the White House said.",
      "The White House called the deal historic and said it ushers in \u201ca new golden era of partnership.\u201d",
      "The Trump family has also expanded its business ventures across the Gulf region, building golf courses and luxury properties, and touting a $2 billion investment in its cryptocurrency by an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm. There was little in the way of crossover between the Trump family and its business on display \u2014 Omeed Malik, an investor and business partner of the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., greeted Trump and the crown prince.",
      "Kushner, whose private equity firm received a $2 billion investment from a fund led by the Saudi crown prince, did not join Trump on the trip and has been largely out of the frame since the president\u2019s return to office.",
      "A former White House adviser, Kushner played a key role in helping broker Trump\u2019s signature Abraham Accords during the president\u2019s first term, and his close relationship with MBS is well known."
